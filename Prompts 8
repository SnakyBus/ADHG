ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

>Be you
>Get into a relationship with this one goat girl
>Barbara-Phoebe Metcalfe, or B.P., as most call her
>You’ve been dating for six months now
>It might sound too early to say, but you honestly think she might be ‘The One’
>You met her at the movie theater, in line for your favorite director’s newest feature
>Turns out it was her favorite director, too
>So, after the movie’s finished, you start talking
>And talking
>And talking
>And liking her a little more with each passing second
>She likes the same food you like
>Shares most of the same hobbies you have
>Same political views, too
>By the end of the night, you feel as though you’re comfortable with her
>More comfortable than you probably should be with a stranger
>So you began talking some more
>As the days went by, more and more, you felt as though you couldn’t bear being just friends with her
>So, one day, facing your fears, you asked her out
>And she said yes
>So, after that, you and her were boyfriend and girlfriend
>Your parents, and other people older than you, warned you about the potential downsides of a relationship
>About how there was a honeymoon phase, and then, little by little, that phase ends, and you start noticing flaws in the other person
>Then you start arguing, and after a while, the two of you will have to figure out if the relationship could survive.
>But time passed, and the honeymoon phase seemingly never ended
>You never argued
>Never even disagreed on anything
>She always laughed at your jokes
>Always warmed your heart with her smile
>Always comforted you when you let yourself be vulnerable around her
>It feels like you’ve been in a dream for the last six months, and you don’t want to wake up
>The only minor flaw is that she’s oddly avoidant about talking about her past
>But you don’t care
>You’re more than willing to look past that for everything else she’s done for you
>Well, actually…
>There is something else
>Obviously, you wouldn’t tell anyone, but you and B.P. never had sex before
>You admit, part of that is because you can’t really work up the nerve to ask
>But a part of you also kind of feels she’s too… innocent?
>Like having sex with her wouldn’t be right
>But no, why think that?
>She’s a grown woman
>She’s fully capable of making her own decisions
>And besides, she’s more than attractive enough for your tastes
>Cute face
>Nicely-shaped pair
>Feminine hips with an ass to match
>The perfect balance of skinniness and thickness
>Just like with everything else about her, her looks are perfect
>The truth is, you’ve been wanting her for a while now
>And tonight’s the night you’ll ask
>And that’s where you’re at right now
>You, munching away at the last of the spaghetti she made
>Her, finishing up the cookies she made for dessert
>God, you love her food
>Just like you love everything else about her
>She sets the plate of cookies down on the table, along with two glasses of milk for you and herself
>”Careful, Anon. The tray’s still hot! And I’d definitely dip these in milk for a few seconds before I’d eat them.”
>You smile stupidly
>Her voice itself is nearly enough to put you at ease
>”Don’t worry, I will be.”
>”Good!”
>She gives another cute smile as the two of you start eating the cookies
>You say nothing as you chow down, mentally working up the nerve to ask
>Apparently she takes notice
>”Anon, you got a kinda funny looking on her face. What’s wrong?”
>Your first instinct is to say ‘it’s nothing’ and drop it
>But no
>Not tonight
>Tonight, you man up and be honest with her
>”Listen B.P., I was…”
>You stammer a bit, trying to find the right words
>She tilts her head at you curiously
>”I was just wondering if, you know, tonight, we could…”
>She’s leering over toward you now, fully paying attention to you
>”...Take it to the next level? If you want?”
>She puts her hand on her cheek
>”Oh, Anon…!”
>A visible blush starts to show on her cheek
>”That’s a big thing to ask.”
>You’re blushing now too
>You start to wonder if this was actually a good idea
>”I-i-if you don’t want to, that’s okay, we don’t-”
>She seems to think for a moment, but then…
>”No, I want to.”
>At once, you feel like a huge weight has been lifted off your shoulders, but you don’t feel completely elated
>Already, you’re worried you’re unintentionally pressuring her into something
>”Are you sure? I-if you don’t want to, tha-”
>”I said I want to.”
>You’re surprised
>You never heard her so serious or confident about something before
>”But my question is, are you ready?”
>”M-me? I. uh…”
>”Sex isn’t something to be taken lightly, Anon. Once you have it with someone, things change, in ways you might not be able to predict. Are you positive that you want me, here and now?”
>You’re not really sure what she’s talking about
>Why is she suddenly the one your decision in the matter?
>But the confusion doesn’t last long
>Your want… no need for outweighs any other emotion right now
>You can’t back out now
>”Yes. I’m positive.”
>She gives another smile and walks over to you
>”That’s all I needed to hear.”
>She plants a kiss on your cheek, sending a jolt of ecstasy around your body like electricity
>”Why don’t you head off into the bedroom and get more… comfortable. I’ll put the food away here.”
>You merely give an awkward ‘okay’ and head to the bedroom
>This is it
>This is the night
>It’s happening
>With a sigh of anticipation, you begin to disrobe yourself
>Shoes, socks, pants, shirt, underwear
>Now you sit in wait, nude as the day you were born
>You’re only waiting for about a minute before B.P. comes in, closing the door behind her
>”W-wow, you look even better than I could possibly imagine.”
>By now, all the blood in your body is concentrated in your face, leaving you looking as red as a tomato
>”Th-th-thanks…”
>”Okay, I… guess it’s my turn, now.”
>You watch, mesmerized as B.P. undresses herself
>First, she takes off her brown sweater, and then the turquoise t-shirt underneath it
>Next, she slips off her black tights, leaving her in only her undergarments
>Then, she does it
>You nearly start drooling as she undoes her bra, her beautiful breasts bouncing out
>You’re so busy staring at them, that you almost don’t notice when she takes her panties off
>Dear God…
>The brilliant white of her fur
>Her soft, feminine curves
>She’s divine
>”You’re… beautiful…”
>She lets out yet another dainty, girly giggle
>”Thank you, but I’m not done changing yet.”
>Puzzlement creeps up on you as you wonder what she could mea-
>...Huh?
>She’s… growing?
>You wonder if you’re seeing thing right
>Yes, you are
>She is getting taller before your very eyes
>One foot…
>Two foot…
>Three foot…
>Until what was once a tiny goat woman who barely reached your chest now towers over you
>But that’s just the beginning of the changes
>Her fur starts changing color
>From white, to whitish-pink, to bright pink, to light red, to cherry red, and finally stopping at crimson
>Her eyes, too, change color
>Darkening to pitch black, only a small sliver of magenta serves as a pupil
>Wait…
>She’s not done growing
>Her breasts, ass and thighs begin growing from ‘kinda thick’ to ‘massive’ rapidly
>Meanwhile, the excess fat everywhere else shrinks and shrinks until she has a feminine hourglass figure
>Horns sprout from the sides of her head, growing taller and spiraling out until they’re about a foot from the scalp each
>Another set of eyes blink open under her first one
>Two black, leathery wings like a bat sprout from her back
>Lower on her back, a long black tail ending in a triangle also sprouts out
>You stare, mouth agape, too horrified to even scream
>B.P.(?) throws her arms to the side as if she just did some sort of trick
>”Tada!”
>Her voice sounds like B.P.’s normal voice, only spoken concurrently with a much deeper, more demonic one
>”Surprised? Confused? Okay, I’ll fill you in on everything. Just take a seat on that bed right there.”
>Too shocked to even think of doing anything else, you mindlessly obeyed
>”Okay, so, in the simplest terms, I’m a succubus.”
>”A… s-sucu…?”
>”Oh, but don’t worry! I’m not one of those ‘drag you to straight to hell’ kinds of succubi. For me, just feeding off your emotions is good enough.”
> Your mind thought so many thoughts at once that it crashed, leaving you staring at her near catatonically
>All you could do what is sit and listen
>”Positive emotions, specifically. And you gave me a lot. Happiness, love, gratitude - but one emotion fills me up better than anything.”
>She leans forward, making you revile back in fear
>”Lust.”
>”I had to be careful. I had to make sure you didn’t suspect anything, If I showed my hand too earlier, you’d run away, and where would I be then? But guess what? After you told me tonight that you wanted me - I had a feeling that you did, but better safe than sorry - the I knew. I have you, right where I want you. Now, you’re all mine, simple as that.”
>Tears sting the corner of your eyes
>Lies
>All of it
>Every word she said
>Every memory you had
>Every laugh you shared
>Down to her appearance
>The woman you loved, the woman you thought was “The One’...
>... Was a complete fabrication
>The cold, numbing shock gives way to a flood of other emotions
>Anger
>Betrayel
>Fear
>Sadness
>You grimace as the tears flow down your face
>Fianally, B.P. notices
>”Hey, Anon, no. Don’t cry. Listen, I know it’s a shocking thing to hear, but if you only-”
>You let out an enraged scream and bolt for the door
>You don’t make it far as B.P. grips you by your wrist
>”Anon, please, there’s no need to be upset. We can-”
>”SHUT UP!”
>You uselessly try to yourself out of her grasp
>”YOU BITCH! YOU CUNT! I LOVED YOU, AND YOU LIED TO ME!”
>”Please, cal-”
>You start striking her, your punches bouncing off of her body harmlessly
>”I HATE YOU, YOU HEAR ME? YOU MAKE ME SICK! GO AWAY! OR KILL ME! I JUST DON’T EVER WANNA SEE YOU AGA-”
>A kiss cuts off your infuriated ranting
>B.P. forces her tongue into yours
>It’s much longer now, reaching down into your throat
>And the texture’s different too
>Yet, it also feels… familiar
>Similar to all the other kisses the two of you shared throughout your relationship
>It makes you mentally flashback to those times and…
>Well, it doesn’t put you at ease, but it quells your red-hot anger down to mere disappointed disturbance
>She eventually pulls away, leaving a long string of drool dripping from her black tongue
>”There, now wasn’t that comforting?”
>You say nothing, merely staring at while breathing heavily
>”See? I’m still the same-old B.P. you fell in love with, I’m just… different now.”
>”You lied to me…”
>”Oh, sweetie, I had to. You’d run away if I did. And besides, I can tell, even if you may not realize it right now, you still want me.”
>To further prove her point, she grabs you by the wrist and forces your hand to touch one of her breasts
>The last thing you want is to feel aroused right now, but you can’t help but squeeze it softly
>It’s the perfect consistency in your hand
>Not too hard, not too firm
>To you chagrin, your penis, softened by the shock, hardens again to about half-mast
>B.P. merely giggles
>”See? Told ya.”
>You look away, but don’t say anything to refute it
>She traces her hand cross her cheek
>”Humans have these delusions of grandeur that they’re somehow ‘virtuous’ and ‘pure of intent’. But in actuality, that couldn’t be further from the truth. Oh, they might say or do things that make them seem better than they are. Donate to charity, sing against the evils of society, et cetera, et cetera. But give them enough power, enough hatred, enough lust, and eventually, they will all fall victim to their vices. And you know what? That’s fine.”
>You turn back to her
>”Humans are weak. Humans need to be told what to do. They know it. That’s why their slaves to those they see as a higher purpose. Religion, politics, culture - all excuses for humans to follow something considered as better than themselves. And you, Anon, are without, purpose. But I can help you with that.”
>You say nothing as she locks fingers with you
>”Follow me, Anon. Make me your new reason to live. All I ask for is your emotions, and in exchange, I will give you everything you could ever want and need. Food, sex, love - no one could ever give these to you as I could. I know that deep down, you know it’s true, so come, submit to me.”
>You say nothing still
>About a minute of silence passes
>”Still not sure? Okay then, I’ll make it easier.”
>She walks over to the bed and sits down
>”I will give you an ultimatum. Either you go to that door and leave, letting go of all the happiness I could ever possibly offer you…”
>She raises her foot up
>”...Or you could come here, kneel down and lick my feet, submitting to me completely. Which will it be?”
>You struggle to think
>You look at the door
>This is madness
>You can’t submit to a succubus
>You should end this right now
>...But
>Can you really turn your back on B.P.?
>You remember all the good times with her
>Even now, thinking about them makes you feel warm inside
>You look back at her
>You look into her eyes
>They’re unmistakably the eyes of a demon, and yet…
>You look at them, and instantly see B.P.
>That feeling of love is returning to you, and despite the other complex feelings you’re feeling, you can’t let it go
>You turn and walk to her foot
>You stare up at her
>She gives an expectant smirk
>You shouldn’t
>But you need to
>So, you stick out your tongue and drag it across her foot
>She lets out another giggle
>”I knew you would make the right choice, Anon.”
>You proceed to clean her foot with her tongue
>You shower the sole with long licks, leaving it covered in spit
>You even work to get it between her two hard toes, made of enamel
>When that foot’s done, you repeat with the other one
>When that’s done, you elicit yet another giggle from her
>”Good boy!”
>Good boy
>Somehow, being called that only entices you more
>Without warning, she lifts you up and put you up on the bed
>She nuzzles your now erect cock
>”And it looks like he enjoyed that just as much as I did.”
>You blush in slight embarrassment
>”Just teasing. Now I’ll show you why you made the right decision.”
>This time, she’s the one licking
>First, up the length of your shaft several times
>Then on your balls
>Then on the area around
>Rinse and repeat, with that thick, long black tongue of hers
>You thought it looked a little strange at first, but you find yourself falling a little more in love with it with every lick
>Then, she peppers some kisses in there too
>Each one gives you a little jolt of ecstasy when you do
>Finally, after what feels like hours of foreplay, she puts the entirety of your dick into her mouth
>You nearly cum then and there
>It’s so warm
>So Inviting
>Ironically, you feel like you’ve entered heaven
>But she’s careful
>She keeps you on the edge
>Ever so close, yet ever so far
>Her tongue wipes all around as you exit and enter her throat, over and over
>Finally, after you-don’t-know how long, your body tenses and releases, and B.P. effortlessly catches it in and swallows it
> You're left panting, nearly gasping for air as B.P. scurries herself over your head
>”So, what do you think? Good, right?”
>You let out a satisfied groan, which apparently suffices as a ‘yes’ for her.
>”Good.”
>She places her hand under your head and gently lifts it up
>”Open up.”
>You absentmindedly comply
>She pops her nipple into your mouth.
>”Start sucking. Trust me, you’ll be glad you did.”
>Again, you comply
>Warm milk flows into you
>It tastes… sweet
>And feels silky
>And is oh, so delicious
>You can suck on it all night
>But alas, B.P. pops the teet out of your mouth
>”There we go!”
>”Wh-why did-”
>”Why did I just breastfeed you? To get my essence into you, silly! Now, I can do lots of neat things to your body. Like this!”
>Her eyes glow, and you’re suddenly rock hard again
>And eager, too
>”Sit up, please.”
>Like the good boy you are, you obey
>B.P. sits down on your lap, her soft and wet cunt pressed against your cock, and her thick ass pressed against your torso
>”I think we’ve pussyfooted around long enough, don’t you? Time for the main event.”
>With little warning, she practically jumps onto your dick, and you groan loud enough to almost constitute a scream
>She immediately starts bouncing
>Somehow, it’s 1000 times better than her mouth
>It takes all the strength you have not to pass out
>Her soft butt constantly rubbing against you isn’t helping matters, either
>Soft, lewd plap after soft lewd plap rings out
>Again, you lose track of time, focusing only on the pleasure at hand
>It’s only when she, again, french kisses you do you realize you’re about to cum
>When you do, you scream into her mouth
>You collapse, unable to take any more excitement for the night
>Getting up, B.P. tucks you and herself into bed
>She gently caresses your body
>”We’ve had a very exciting night, haven’t we?”
>You’re too tired to even grunt at this point, but it doesn’t seem to be needed
>”You’ve made entirely the right choice. You will be happy with me. That’s all you need. Now and forever.”
>She gives you one final peck on the forehead
>”I love you, my little weakling.”
>That’s the last thing you hear before you fall asleep
>
>You wake up, and smell… pancakes?
>Must be B.P.
>You go out, and that’s exactly what you see
>B.P. cooking pancakes without a care in the world
>You blink
>She’s… normal
>Short, white, hornless, no wing, no tail
>Not at all the B.P. you remember from last night
>”Morning, Anon!”
>Her voice is also normal
>You shake your head
>A bad dream
>That’s all it was
>A ba…
>A dream
>You take a seat
>”Morning. Smells delicious, like usual.”
>She finishes plating the pancakes and sets them on the table
>”Glad you think so. Guess what? There was Jehova’s Witness this morning! Can you believe it? What are they doing here?
>”Really? Damn, that’s annoying. At least he’s gone, though.”
>You grab a good few pancakes and put them on your plate
>”So, what’s on the agenda today?”
>”Oh, I was thinking we could just stay in and relax for a day, just you and me. After all…”
>You can swear, for a minute, her eyes go black as she says
>”There’s so much fun to be had.”
>You shake your head
>She looks as normal as ever
>”Everything okay, Anon?”
>You think for a moment
>”Yeah… yeah! Everything’s fine.”
>And everything would be fine
>Now and forever
>Because now you know for sure
>She’s ‘The One’

>Be Anon, anthrostate troublemaker
>Not some asshole who fled city to city leaving crying wives behind
>Not the type that would be a part of a resistance group
>Not some prick who leaked classified documents on "Yeen Shaker Central"
>Not some nutjob conspiracy theorist ranting about alien lizards coming to kill all anthros and steal their husbands
>You just had a nasty habit of selling smack and other fun stuff in slums... And getting caught that is
>Should've known that well groomed german shepherd with baggy jeans and shades wasn't a customer
>The judge, a nice old sheep, felt sorry that such a "smart and capable humie" like yourself was wasting his life doing petty crime
>She sentenced you to rehabilitation at some correctional facility for disobedient humans, until you cleaned your act and became hubby material
>Sadly, you turned out to be a pain in the ass to deal with whilst in the nuthouse
>You kept hoarding pills that you stole from the facility's pharmacy (oh yeah, you also picked locks from time to time to help a gang of [literal] coons loot some houses) and trading them back to the other patients
>One of which nearly ended up dying from OD, which got you in solitary confinement, where you weren't allowed to communicate with the other guys even during meal time
>After 1 week of this fiasco, you were really starting to get crazy so you decided to leave this room the only way you were allowed, in a medical emergency
>You started to bite into your wrists hard enough to draw blood and call the guards for help
>When you arrived at the clinic they had you stitched and put you on suicide watch
>They prescribed you some anti-depressants which you pocketed for later use, and you had to attend meetings for humans on the brink of self-destruction
>You noticed one skinny guy next to you playing on his little console, so when the (literal) elephant in the room walked out you showed him the little bottle of pills
"Hey, wanna do a little trade?"
>Few hours pass and your game is interrupted by 2 bear guards, one polar and one grizzly, coming into your cell
"Hello ladies. What can i do for ya?"
>They don't reply, instead they pull out their batons and proceed to kick the living shit out of you
>Turns out the kid ate the whole fucking bottle prescribed to you. Hmm, maybe you should've scratched the label with your name on it before you handed it to him
>This new event causes the doctors to kick you out of the facility for being a "danger to others" and you spend the next 2 weeks in a station cell waiting to be called into court
>Back at the justice building you are greeted by the same judge that gave you your sentence
>To your surprise, she decided to put you on parole, stating that if you crossed the line this time you would be sent to an even harsher facility
>"Anon, i'm putting a great deal of trust in you. Don't make me regret this."
>You can't believe this, you're getting a second chance at freedom... And all you had to do was nearly kill 2 junkies
"You have my word, that i will not peddle dope, ever again."
>Fast-foward 6 months with a never ending cycle of being arrested for drug trafficking, going to different facilities, getting ejected from said facilities and being put on parole
>You arrive back at the courtroom
"Hello again!"
>You happily greeted a not so happy looking sheep on the bench
>She didn't say anything, she kept staring at you like the disappointing child you are
>"Anon... So far you have been kicked out of 4 different rehabilitation centers for humans."
"Continue."
>This causes her to stop reading her paper for a few moments, just to give you the stink eye
>You were taking the piss at this point, and the sweet wooly judge has had enough out of you
>"Due to your lack of any significant progress in the facilities and in public, aswell as your detrimental actions towards other humans in rehab, you have proven to be unacceptable for any and all human penitentiaries."
>For some reason this causes your current mood to turn 180
"I-I don't understand, what does this mean for me."
>"It means you can't live in society and you can't be near other humans... I have no choice but to transfer you to Boulderkeep Prison."
"W-w-what!?"
>She slams the gavel and your fate is sealed, in an anthro prison
>...
>Yeah, you're fucked and soon enough, more ways than one

>Be me
>A mother who has a sweet humie husband and two adorable humie sons
>Decided to watch a family movie that was playing in theaters
>It’s about a magical humie prince who wants to save the magical land from an evil dragon lady
>Reach at the climax of the movie
>Sees a tough anthro women coming in and ask for the humie protag for some help
>’No! I don’t need no anthro women to tell me what to do’
>Sudden burst of cheer from my humie sons
>Mfw the downfall of human males starts with this movie

>Man goes to work at an arctic research station
>Gets blinded during a blizzard and stumbles off into the surrounding icy wastes
>Search teams find no trace of him, presumed dead
>Is later found safe in the den of a native polar bear woman some months later
>Family wants him to return to civilization
>He refuses, who would help his new wife take of care of their cubs if he left?
Many such cases

>"--was telling me about you. Said you looked about ready to bolt all night."
>you had seen the chill looking rodent once or twice, usually hanging out with people
>didn't realize he had noticed you too
"Yeah. Guess it's uh, not really my scene. I'm not used to parties."
>the goat nods
>"I get that, I get that. You can hang out in here with us if you want. Take a seat."
>you look around
>all the seats are occupied by anthros
>a snow-leopard sat beside Ike the capybara on the couch rounding off the group
"Uh, where do I...?"
>the goat leans back on the loveseat and pats her thigh
>"Right here man. Plenty of room."
>you don't move, unsure if she's joking or not
"On...your lap?"
>the yeen snickers
>"I don't think he's ever even talked to an anthro before."
>that sets Ike and the snow leopard laughing as well
>even the goat chuckles out a bleat
>"That right?"
>you shrug and grimace apologetically
"Kinda. Haven't really talked to anyone since I got here."
>the goat gives you a reassuring grin and pats her thigh
>"It's cool dude. Anthro thing. Have a seat."
>you do your best not to feel like a weirdo as you sidle around and sit down on the goat's thigh
>legs turned inward so they're in between hers
>you feel her hand on your back as she settles in again
>"There we go. I'm Gerta."
>Gerta the Goat
>she must have caught your smirk cause she rolls her eyes
>"I know, I know. It's from my grandma."
>you shake you head
"It's a cool name. It's cool. I wasn't laughing. Anon, by the way."
>it was kinda funny, but you don't want to be a jerk
>Gerta starts rubbing your back as she goes on
>"I don't mind dude. S'a funny name. Anon's pretty cool. Lotta humans with that one."
>must be a cultural thing
>you never thought about it much
>right now you're thinking about how good her hand feels rubbing your back
>how long has it been since you last had physical contact with someone that was on purpose?
>must have been when you hugged your mom goodbye at the beginning of the semester
>Gerta goes on rubbing your back, and you find yourself leaning into it
>despite her size and muscle, her embrace is still soft
>"So what you studying, Anon?"
>you go on to explain your college situation to her
>how you transferred from out of state
>and your own little community college in bumfuck nowhere had no anthros at all
>but now you're here, small fish in a huge pond
>as you go one explaining, you find yourself getting closer to Gerta
>or maybe she's getting closer to you
>she's leaning forward again, and over toward you
>and you find yourself leaning sideways into Gerta just as much
>feeling her warmth
>until finally you're resting your head on her shoulder, rubbing your cheek against soft fur
>and her arm is wrapped fully around you
>Lou, the hyena, was in the middle of explaining his own college plans when he's interrupted by the sound of a lighter striking
>"I'm gonna light up. Guys want some?"
>the snow-leopard holds up a joint that she had been working on lighting
>Ike grins, and Gerta bleats happily
>"Shit yeah girl .You were holding out?"
>the snow-leopard gets the thing burning and takes a puff on it
>you watch as she passes it over to Ike, who repeats the motion
>then over to Lou, who has to awkwardly puff at it while laying down so he doesn't disturb the mouse
>she hasn't woken up since you slammed the door
>then it reaches Gerta
>she has to lean away to take her turn at it
>"Hey dude, want some?"
>she holds it down at your level
>you hesitate again
"I uh, never really..."
>you'd been straight-laced all your life
>this is all new to you
>Gerta rubs your shoulder reassuringly
>"It's okay dude. You don't have to. Just hope you don't mind us passing it around."
>she hands it off to the snow-leopard again and the ritual repeats
>by the time it's reached you again, you've worked up a bit more nerve
>this is your big break
>you came to a party
>you're making friends
>and also sitting in their laps
>Gerta's basically cuddling you at this point
>so when it comes around again, you speak up
"Can I try this time?"
>that earns a chorus of soft cheers from the group
>"Woo! That's the spirit."
>Gerta holds the joint between two fingers
>rather than passing it to you, she holds you close and presses them against your lips
>it's an oddly intimate gesture
>"Just take a small hit. Don't try and kill the whole thing."
>you grunt your affirmative around her fuzzy fingers
>and puff on the joint held to your lips
>it tastes smoky and earthy
>and a some kinda citrus on the end there?
>you suck in a bit more, but it's too much
>first you sputter
>then you cough
>Gerta pulls her hand away from your face as you double over and cough hard
>she pats your back gently
>"Easy dude, easy. Told you not to kill the whole thing. You alright?"
>you manage to catch your breath after a few seconds
>already you're starting to feel it
>a low buzzing in the back of your head that slowly ramps up while Gerta passes the joint again
>you lean against her, feeling calmer and easier now
>it's rather pleasant, for a new strange sensation
>her fur feels real nice right now, and you wrap an arm around her waist
>Gerta chuckles and holds you by the shoulder
>"Feel good dude?"
>you just hum and nod your head, brushing your face against her shoulder fur that feels so soft
>and her body's so warm
>you love this
>cuddling with Gerta is awesome
>do anthros get to do this all the time?
>Gerta and the others go on talking about school, then movies, then the music that's playing
>you mostly just hold on to her hand hum non-commitally whenever anyone speaks to you
>Gerta rubs your back and her voice hums in your head when she speaks
>at one point she leans down and kisses the top of your head
>that puts you over the moon
>you like this goat
>she's real nice
>even with her funny eyes and her big muscles and the funny goat laugh she does
>you can't help but giggle at the though of it
>Gerta snickers too, even though you didn't tell her the joke
>that just makes you laugh more
>you take another hit the next time it comes around
>then it's right back to squeezing her
>feeling the fur of her belly under your fingers
>you shut your eyes and let your weight rest fully on her
>"Looks like he's falling asleep."
>that's Ike
>Gerta shifts beneath you
>"Yeah. I'll find him a bed."
>you feel your legs lifted, and your body tilted back
>you crack an eyelid to see she's lifted you into a bridal carry
>like in those old Gisnep movies except backwards
>Gerta carries you out into the hall, and down a flight of stairs until she finds a room that's dark and mostly quiet
>you're set down on a soft mattress
"Gerta."
>you look up to her
"I think I love you."
>she snorts
>"Baaa-haha! Dude we just smoked a little weed and cuddled. Get some sleep."
>you snag her wrist when she turns to go
>you don't want her warmth to leave you
>Gerta gently pulls your hand off of her
>"Fine, fine. We can get coffee tomorrow."
>that makes you smile
>you'd love to see her again
>and you'd love to...
>"And you can sit in my lap, too."

Police Moo-tality
>Living on the western frontier ain't easy
>There's banditos marauding the wilds, feral snakes and other critters waiting to eat your eyes out, the merciless sun tanning your hide, drunks looking for fights, among other things
>But thankfully there’s always a sheriff in town to put a stop to the dangers posed by your fellow man
>Or at least, there used to be
>Sheriff Espinoza, may the old dog rest in peace, took a bullet to the noggin during a raid on some local highwaymen a few days ago
>You aren’t sure who’s riding in to replace him but you don’t really care, you’ve always been good at keeping a low profile despite your inhibition towards alcohol and the occasional bar fight you find yourself wrapped up in
>Speaking of which, it’s a bright sunny Saturday morning here in La Hembra, just the perfect time for you to mosey on down to the local saloon and wet your whistle
>You get off your straw bed and stretch, streaks of sunlight illuminating the dusty air of your humble shack
>You put your shoes and hat on and walk outside, greeting Mary the seamstress and Henson the leather smith as you pass them on the street
>Good folk they are, mostly keeping to themselves and keeping busy with their daily toil
>Unfortunately you couldn’t say the same thing about the German Shepard approaching you
>Samson was his name and selling all manner of snake oil and lies was his game
>”Hey, hey Anon. Come here.” He says, waving you over
>You stop and cross your arms
>”What is it this time Samson? Come to sell me another potion to cure my hairline or stiffen my masculinity?”
>”No, no, no. I just couldn’t help but notice who just arrived.” He pulls you close and points to a woman mounted on horseback coming into town. “See her? That’s the new sheriff.”
>You squint your eyes against the bright sun and take in her details
>A Holstein heifer she is, black and white splotched face with a bright pink nose
>She wears a billowing leather duster and worn tan colored Stetson, a mean look on her face as she scans the town
>She’s armed with a lever action across her back and a six shooter on her hip, a golden badge pinned to her duster
>”Ya know Anon, I think I’ll be taking a nice little vacation while she’s in town. If you had any sense you would do the same.”
>”Pfff! Coward! She’s just a little cow lady. Ain’t nothing I would worry about. Hell, she ain’t even got horns like her male compatriots!”
>”It’s not the horns I would be worried about, it’s her proclivity for handing out arrests like candy.“
>He suddenly grows quiet as the sheriff trots past us, she looks in our direction briefly then turns back to the road
>”I, uhhh, I think I better get moving.” Samson says, quickly fast walking away towards his carriage
>You chuckle and continue towards the saloon, glad that you won’t see that slippery dog for the next several days
>After making your way to the bar you begin conversing with the bartender, downing a few beers and shots of whiskey, your usual morning routine for a Saturday
>After exhausting all conversation and feeling your vision start to blur you decide to retire to your shack
>You stumble to the entrance, bust open the saloon doors and-
>”Hold it right there partner.” Commands a foreign voice, deep yet feminine
>The new sheriff you saw earlier stands in front of you, hands on her hips
>Wanting to make a good first impression you stick your hand out for a handshake, it wobbles in the air as you wait for her to take it
>”Howdy! I’m Anon, you must be Sheriff Espinoza’s replacement.”
>She remains silent, chewing a piece of straw while giving you a lookover
>Eventually she returns your handshake, her grip is strong for a woman
>”That would be correct. I’m Sheriff Leche. I came in from Dallas this morning.”
>”Well I think you’ll find La Hembra accommodating. We got a general store, and a post office, and they even installed one of those telegraph thingermajigs not long ago.”
>”And a saloon.” She says, eyes drifting up to the sign in front of the place
>”Yes ma’am. It’s a fine place. Now if you don’t mind I really must be going.”
>You try to step around her but a hand on the chest stops you
>”You’ve had a few to drink today, haven’t you?”
>”A touch.”
>She leans in and sniffs
>”It’s not even noon yet, Anon.”
>”…so? It’s the weekend, I can do what I want.”
>The cow gives a wicked smile
>”Now that kind of attitude I don’t find very welcoming. Bandits do what they want, criminals do what they want, law abiding citizens however can not. They must live within the letter of the law.”
>”What’s yer point lady?”
>”Public drunkenness is against the law, Anon.”
>You wave your hands around in disbelief
>”Now that ain’t no law I ever heard of what kind of hot new devilry is this crap I can’t believe that you would-Hey!”
>The cow grabs you by the arm and begins leading you to the stockade in the center of town
>”Hey! Where you takin’ me?”
>”The stockade. I hereby sentence you to three days of confinement and public humiliation.”
>”What the- Now hear this! Sheriff Espinoza only ever sentenced me to one day maximum in the stockade when I got a little tipsy and accidentally socked someone in the bar. Three days is totally unfair!”
>”Well I'm not Sheriff Espinoza. Three days is what I sentence you to. Maybe less if I think you learn your lesson before that. I have little tolerance for drunkards and troublemakers.”
>”Drunkard? How dare you call me that! I am merely an innocent enjoyer of fine liquors! It’s a hobby! I-I need to drink for health reasons anyway! I get aching joints if I don’t drink! And heart palpitations too!”
>She laughs
>”Ya sure pal, I’ve heard all those excuses before. Now settle down while secure you.”
>She lays your neck and hands in the stockade then locks it
>You drunkenly struggle in your bindings but find it useless, they won’t budge
>”This is totally uncalled for! You alcohol hating heifer! Denier of fine drink! How dare you do this to me!”
>She stands in front of you and crosses her arms
>”I’ll be back tonight to let you into the jail. There I’ll give you some food and water, then next morning we’ll do this all again.”
>You shout disjointed curses at her as she walks away
>Thankfully your punishment isn’t too harsh for the rest of the day, you were either on good or neutral terms with most of the town
>Mary’s boys came around in the afternoon and threw a couple of tomatoes at you though, little fuckers
>When night fell Leche came to free you true to her word, then you spent the night in a jail cell after a dinner composed of beans, cornbread, and water
>In the morning you ate a small breakfast of biscuits and water then you were back out in the stockade
>Today most people were working so few came to mock you much to your relief
>Yet it proved to be the sun that became your most vicious menace, by mid-afternoon the water you had for breakfast had long been used up
>Your skin was dry and joints ached, your mouth felt like cotton and your body yearned for hydration
>By the time night fell Leche came out of her jailhouse and stood in front of you, hands on her wide hips
>”Well, have you learned your lesson? Promise never be under the influence of the devils drink while out in public?”
>You try to spit on her hooves only to find your mouth dry
>”Screw you! Power tripping cow! I’ll drink and stand where I please!”
>She leans in, voice filled with stern disappointment
>”I'm sorry to hear that. Guess you’ll just have to wait out the rest of your sentence.”
>”I think I will. Now release me so I can at least have a little water before bed, I'm positively parched right now.”
>”No.”
>”No? You have to give me something! I can’t do another day of this with no freakin’ water! The sun’ll dry me out till I'm nothing but bones.”
>”New directive from the city came in. This part of the country has been having a drought something awful and I'm to deny water to prisoners if they only committed minor crimes and have served over half their sentence. That water is better served either going to crops or law abiding citizens. You are neither.”
>”I-I’ll die then! You can’t do this! It’s murder.”
>She puts a hand up to her chin, thinking something over
>”Well, where the water’s going has already been decided. However, they made no such order regarding a certain other kind of sustenance.”
>”Huh?”
>The cow undoes her leather duster then the shirt underneath, untucking a hefty breast from a lacy bra
>You stare in shock for a few seconds, goddamn this woman had some heavenly mams hidden under that duster of hers
>”You should consider yourself lucky, Anon. This heifer’s willing to help you out in your unfortunate situation. A breast’s worth of milk ought to tide you over till tomorrow, keep you from an early death from dehydration.”
>”An unfortunate situation that you put me in with your excessively long sentence. Just let me go!”
>”Let you go? After you tried to spit on the hoof of a duly appointed sheriff and denounce her good intentions? I don’t think so pal!”
>“Fine. I take back everything I said and will never wander around in public while intoxicated ever again. Cross my heart and hope to die.” You say, trying to cram sincerity into every syllable
>Unsurprisingly, she doesn’t fall for it
>”No. I don’t believe you. Now either suck my tit or risk ending up in a casket by the end of tomorrow.”
>You squint an eye and slowly nod, her intentions becoming clear
>”Oh, I see how it is. This is all some sort of perverse pleasure for you, isn’t it? You lecherous cow women must like it when someone suckles from your teat, makes you feel all funny down below. Well I’ll tell you what Leche, I won’t give in to your deviant cream filled fantas-“
>She suddenly leans forward and grabs your chin, her wet pink nose coming up to your own
>”Listen here you little mongrel. It took me three weeks to make it down here on my horse. Three weeks of nothing but rough road and bad weather. We heifers need our breasts drained every week and I haven’t had a chance to do it in three times that long, if you listen closely you can probably hear it all sloshing around in there, you get my drift?”
>You slowly nod in understanding
>”Ya, okay. But why not just do it yourself and save me the trouble?”
>”I, uhhh, I can’t give milk unless someone else is watching.” She whispers, an embarrassed tone in her voice
>It takes all your self-restraint to not burst out laughing
>”You, heh, need a, heh, peeping tom to release the floodgates? You know I have something of a similar issue myself, though it’s the opposite in nature.”
>”Oh shut up, normally my sister would help me out in a situation like this but she’s a hundred miles away and I'm not about to ask some stranger to help me out on the road. Which leaves us in a fortunate situation with you needing milk and me needing to give it. Now unless you want to end up as a pile of dried up bones tomorrow you’re going to do the draining for me tonight. Now put on your best calf impression and get to it.”
>”In the middle of town? This is scandalous! Uncouth!”
>Leche puts her breast in front of your lips then draws her duster around the both of you, hiding her chest and your head from prying eyes
>”There, it’s the middle of night so it’s doubtful anyone will be aware of what I’m doin’ with ya.”
>”Okay, okay.”
>You lick your chapped lips and stare at the pink nipple less than an inch from your mouth
>Sure, you don’t particularly like helping officers of the law, but not doing it may very well end with you dead tomorrow
>And hell, you always did wonder if bovine anthro milk tasted any different from the feral kind
>You crane your neck forward and latch on to her puffy teat, gently sucking
>Within a couple of seconds the first milk enters your mouth and wets your dry tongue, it feels heavenly as it makes it’s way down your sore throat
>With relief washing over your body you find yourself unintentionally suckling with greater intensity, body desperate for more of the life giving liquid regardless of the fact it’s coming from a power tripping sheriff
>Leche stares down at you from above, an occasional soft moan escaping her lips betraying her otherwise stoic persona
>Your appetite for her milk grows ravenous just as her output begins to drop
>With each suck she gave less and less, coming down to just a few drops no matter how much effort you put into freeing her milk from it’s plushy prison
>Leche leans back and removes your mouth from her tit, cream dribbling down your chin
>”Take it down a notch cowboy, this one’s empty. She ain’t got nothing left.”
>”I’m still thirsty.”
>”You can have the other one tomorrow morning for breakfast. Ought to keep you hydrated for the rest of the day.” She tucks the breast back under her bra then buttons up her shirt, standing up to her full height. “You can spend the night in the jail, then I’ll give you ‘breakfast’ just before dawn. By nightfall tomorrow your sentence will be served.”
>”This is insanity. Forced to suckle from the teat of my supposed protector just to keep my life. Satisfying her satisfy perverse carnal desires in the process, it’s disgusting.”
>”Forced? You seemed to be into it just as much as I was.”
>”Was not.”
>She walks around to the rear of the stockade and grabs your package, her fingers finding their way around your erect cock
>You give a surprised grunt and she chuckles in response, unlocks the stockade then escorts you to the jailhouse
> With something in your stomach you fall asleep quickly and in the morning you wake up to another bright sunshiny day
>True to her word Leche allows you to drink from her other breast, this time in the privacy of a jailcell rather than the public stockade
>And it’s a good thing she did, today must be a record breaker for temperature
>The sun beats down on the sand with a scorching intensity as heatwaves rise up from the ground
>By the time the sun falls below the horizon you’re well and truly on the edge, skin flaking and mouth dry
>When you see Leche approach she gives you a canteen of water which you chug down greedily
>The cow then unlocks the stockade and sets you free
>Desperate for some kind of liquor based relief you stumble into the saloon and immediately order a shot of whiskey from the bartender
>You swig it down and look outside
>Leche is still by the stockade, she gives you an unreadable stare before turning towards the jailhouse
>Not wanting to get caught for public intoxication again you get your fill of liquor then request a room to stay in, deciding to head back to your shack in the morning
>Morning arrives, you walk out the door and-
>She’s right fucking there again, waiting for you
>”You’re a wanted man Anon.” She says, sucking on a piece of straw
>You raise your arms up in exasperation
>”What is it this time?! I ain’t done nothin’! I’m perfectly sober I'm telling you!”
>She spits the straw out
>”I have it on good authority you’ve been drinking in public. That’s illegal.”
>”Drinking in public?! I’ve done no such thing! The last alcohol I tasted was last night and I was in the saloon the entire time!”
>”Never said it was alcohol you were sucking down.”
>”What in tarnation are you…oh.”
>She shifts her hooves and smiles
>”Why don’t you come on down to the jailhouse and we can discuss options. I would hate for a man like you who has such a…thirst…for life to end up in jail again.”
>”Guess I don’t have any other options, do I?”
>She shakes her head and spits on the ground
>”Nope. In fact, I can already think of something you could do in place of a prison sentence. Public service. Maybe you could come down to the jailhouse, let’s say once a week, and carry out any tasks I assign you.”
>”Once a week huh? Awfully specific.”
>”If you do well I may even make you my deputy around town. But make no mistake, I’ll always be the one in charge of you, ya hopeless drunkard.”
>”I already told you I'm not a drunkard! It’s a hobby!”

>Milfy director adds a very clear self insert into the storyline
>Same species, same age, even has the same fur coloration and hairstyle as the director
>This new character's backstory is that she's an old friend of the prince's mother who's come to protect him to make good on some kind of deal she made to his mother years ago
>But what he doesn't know is the other side of that deal
>In return for protecting the prince she gets to marry him, thus making her a princess
>Director basically creams her pants every time they're on screen together

If an anthro wants this humie dick she better have
>Long, sharp, curved, claws equally capable of tearing into competing females and leaving scratches on my back during a night of bestial passion
>BIG MEATY PAWS for those claws to be mounted on
>A mouth full of pearly whites for leaving love bites on my delicate skin and ripping into the carefully cooked meats I'll be making for her
>A body covered in plush groomed fur, occasionally unkempt if she comes home after a hard day at work and she needs some immediate stress relief
>Fluffy soft ears for me to rub and nibble on as she rests on our bed after a night of primal rutting, my baby batter seeping it's way into her bun oven
And I refuse to settle for anything less!

>You went off to college, leaving your best friend Alex behind.
>The day before leaving you said your final goodbyes.
>The very same evening she knocked at your door.
>Drunk but determined, she declared you were hers forever. She wasn't going to let you leave.
>And there, on the same couch you two had lost hours to video games, she pounced on you as if the two of you were still kids.
>Play wrestling? You hadn't done that in years. It made you laugh.
>Things got quiet when you felt her teeth slip around your neck, and the tears going down her cheek.
>"You HAVE you stay now! You're my mate! I know you love me too...!"
>Oh, Alex...
>You hear a knock at your dorm door as you're reading this.
>Opening the door, a grinning coyote kisses you before you even know what's happening.
>"Hey Non! Where does my stuff go?"
>Unfortunately for your roommate, coyotes mate for life.

>Lights your house on fire
>Waits for a crowd to gather then rushes in to save you
>Busts through the front door with you in a bridal carry to the cheers of spectators
>News about the heroic lioness saving a poor humie travels across the country
>Offers to let you stay at her place while you get your situation figured out
>Begins subtly turning you into her ideal mate while you're at her mercy
>?????
>Cubs
All according to keikaku

>Be you
>Journalism major
>Thesis deadline rapidly approaching
>Still no subject to write on
>Just when all hope seems lost, however, you finally get some inspiration
>Not far from your college is the town of Shan-srbavayr
>Very small, only about 200 people
>Little to no amenities besides houses, some farms, a small schoolhouse, a small market, and the church in the center
>Almost nothing is known about it, barely even any photos online
>Naturally, there are rumors swarming all around it
>Mostly obvious ones, ranging from cults to fronts for government experimentation
>Also, apparently they have allies in high places, making it easier for them to do their business without the public knowing, whatever business that may be
>You look for as much information as you can, but come up mostly empty-handed
>Just the aforementioned conspiracy theories and the most basic info available
>You’re just about to give up for the day and go play video games when you finally stumble across something
>A phone number for a ‘representative’ of the town, Marcus Neumann
>You call it
>The phone rings four times, but the other end picks up just before it goes to voicemail
>”Hello?”
>”Um, hi, my name is Anon Ymous, I’m a journalism student at Bright State University.”
>You pause, but Marcus stays silent, so you continue
>”Uh, I saw that there’s not much information about your town on the internet. It’s subject to a lot of unsavory rumors, and um… I was wondering if maybe an interview with a few locals could dispel them.”
>Again, no answer
>You only hear faint whispering on the other
>You can’t make out much, but you’re not sure it’s English
>”Um, hello?”
>”Yes, we would love an interview.”
>The abruptness of the response nearly startled you
>”Oh, uh, okay! Can I come on Saturday, around noon?”
>”Yes, that will be just fine. Thank you.”
>Alright. Th-”
>Again abruptly, Marcus hangs up the phone
>Well, that was… odd
>But at least you got your subject
>Now just to get the info and make a decent thesis
>
>Saturday comes before you know it
>At around 11:10, you hop in your car and make your way toward Shan-srbavayr
>Gradually, on your way, buildings start disappearing, until you’re driving in dense, dark woods
>You check your GPS repeatedly to make sure you’re not lost, but every time you check, it still says you’re on the right route
>You knew the town was rural, but you had no idea it was this far out from civilization
>You gulp, starting to have doubts
>Nevertheless, you stay on route, determined to get your thesis written on time
>Finally, you see signs of human life again after what feels like hours of driving
>The trees give way to a clearing and the first thing the first thing you see is a man tilling soil
>He’s an older man, roughly in his mid-to-late 40s, wearing dull shades of brown and blue, topped off with a sun-bleached sun hat, and a goatee with a few grey hairs in it
>Perhaps naively, you slow down and ask the man for directions
>”H-hey, I uh, am looking for a guy named Marcus Neumann. Would you happen to know where he is?”
>The man says nothing, he merely looks up and stares at you
>His face shows no emotion, merely studying you
>He steps a few inches closer to you, making you uncomfortable
>Finally, after a few agonizingly slow minutes, he lifts his arm up and points down the road
>”Uh, th-thanks!”
>It’s not really helpful information, but at least he gave you something resembling a response
>You drive off, glad to escape that encounter
>Not long after, you come across a house, with what is presumably the family who lives there all standing in the front yard
>A father, a mother, a son, and a daughter
>They all stare at your car with the same blank expression the man from before gave you
>Apparently not learning your lesson, you decide to stop and ask for directions
>”Um, excuse me, but… Do any of you happen to know where Marcus Neumann is?”
>Again, silence
>But before things could get more awkward, or before they could answer, you hear a voice calling out to you
>”Anon Ymous?”
>You turn your head to the side
>You see another man walking to your car
>He also appears to be in his forties, with blond, somewhat balding hair and pale skin
>He wears a light beige coat with a black undershirt, white pants, and brown loafers
>You suppose this must be him
>You get out of your car
>”Y-yeah, that’s me. Marcus, I presume?”
>”Correct. Welcome to Shan-Srbavayr.”
>Well, he talks unnaturally, almost robotically, but you’re just glad someone’s talking to you
>”Really, the pleasure’s all mine. Now, about the interview-”
>”There will be plenty of time for that, but is this truly the right time to discuss such things? Come with me.”
>You guess he has a point, it wouldn’t really be appropriate to just talk in the middle of the street
>”Oh, right, haha. Lead the way.”
>He begins walking, and you closely trail him
>Every time you look at someone, they’re all giving you the same face
>They even drop whatever they’re doing just to stare out you
>It’s seriously creeping you out
>Marcus, apparently sensing your discomfort, speaks up
>”You must forgive them. They are not used to strangers in this town, much less ones with cars.”
>”I… guess that makes sense.”
>Besides that brief exchange, the trek through the village is utterly silent
>No talking from you, Marcus, or any of the other villagers
>Now you’re really getting creeped out
>You just hope this doesn’t end in a Wicker Man scenario
>Fortunately, though, you reach your destination in almost no time at all
>The two of you stop at a decently sized house with white walls and a red roof
>”Here we are. This is my house.”
>You at first find it strange you went to Marcus’s house, but thinking on it, you guess it makes sense
>After all, he is the ‘representative’ of this place
>He opens the door
>”Please, after you
>You make you way inside, seeing several other people surrounding a fully set dinner table with plenty of food on it
>”Uh, who are…?”
>”Close friends. Please, sit down at the table.”
>Not wanting to be rude, you take a seat on the chair closest to you
>”You must be hungry after such a long trip. Please, eat. I insist.”
>You almost say no, but then again, the food does look good, and you had a light breakfast
>So, ignoring the screaming voice in your head telling you to run, take a dinner roll and pop it into your mouth
>Marcus takes a seat adjacent to you
>”Now, Mr. Ymous, what was it you would like to discuss in your interview.”
>”Oh, well I was just wondering about this town, and how… and how…”
>You really should have listened to your intuition
>The world blurs together, and stars swaying from side to side
>You only notice how heavy your body feels when you're on the ground
>The last thing you see before you lose consciousness is Marcus and some of his ‘friends’ looking down at you
>
>You wake up, groggy, not even realizing the danger you’re in
>At least, not until you realize you can’t move
>You tug at the restraints on your hands and ankles to no avail
>You’re laid out on a stone slab, arms and legs splayed to the side, mouth gagged
>To make matters worse, besides the gag, you’re completely naked
>You look around
>You seem to be in some sort of old-school cathedral, with no light besides some candles place here and there
>You’re watched by a crowd of people in brown robes, along with several other people in red robes
>You can’t make out any of their faces
>Immediately, you start to panic and scream through the gag
>Everyone ignores you as one of the guys in red robes, whose voice you recognize as Marcus’s, raises his arms and starts talking to the crowd
>”Rejoice, brothers and sisters, rejoice! For today, Marmina, Mother of Flesh, shall be reborn and purify yet another wayward soul!”
>What the fuck is this psycho babbling about?
>You want out
>NOW
>Two other freaks wheel in some sort of sarcophagus containing the mummified remains of…
>What the hell even is that?
>It’s skull almost looks like a dog’s
>But the body is shaped and proportioned like a human’s
>You’re so distracted by that, it nearly failed to notice the fact that the skull has no eye sockets
>This just keeps getting stranger and stranger by the second
>”A donation is required. We shall give Our Mother the blood of man, so she can return to the realm of the living and grace us with her presence.”
>One of them grabs your arm, and another pulls out some sort of strange tool with a long, metal tip
>It takes a few seconds to realize what it is
>A syringe
>You struggle uselessly before screaming into the gag as the needle is injected into your arm and blood is drawn out
>It’s a pretty big syringe, too, and by the time it’s finally done draining you, you feel woozy, your skin losing tone
>The one with the needle pours your blood into a small bowl held by Marcus
>Several of the others pour several basins of water into coffin, filling it to the brim
>”Oh, Mother of Flesh, please accept this gift, and come back to us so that we may offer another humble and loyal servant to serve you endlessly.”
>He pours the blood into the water, and then he and the others kneel down around the coffin, chanting something you can’t understand
>After about a minute of chanting, the water instantly fogs up and ripples before a hand pops out
>Well, perhaps that’s generous
>It’s covered in sickly white fur, each finger ending in a long, sharp, black claw
>Another ‘hand’ comes out, and subsequently, a head
>It’s covered in long, flowing gray hair obscuring its ears (assuming it has any)
>It’s face end in a long, canine snout, with a wet black nose and glistening, sharp teeth
>It’s eyes…
>Don’t exist
>There’s just fur where they should
>It takes a step out, body dripping from the water
>Its body is that of a chubby human woman’s
>Belly jutting out
>Breasts large and dangling
>Thighs jiggling from each step
>Hips wide
>Standing on two feet that also ended in long, sharp, black claws
>Your mind goes almost completely blank, unable to even comprehend what you’re seeing
>She turns to the crowd as they kneel before her
>”Greetings, my children. It is always so very lovely to see you.”
>Finally, she takes notice of you
>”Oh, and I see you’ve brought another soul into our home.”
>Immediately, you start struggling again
>Marmina either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care
>She merely strolls towards you, sniffing the air
>”Oh, yes. He is lost. Without purpose. His soul will never find peace without divine intervention.”
>She her head over yours, staring at you (or would be, if she had eyes
>”But worry not. Through me, all can receive salvation.”
>She removes the gag from your mouth
>”First, one must accept me into their very being.”
>She points one her breasts toward your mouth
>”Drink from me, my child.”
>To the best of your limited ability, you try your best to move your mouth away from the nipple
>”N-no! Get away from me, you disgusting freak!”
>The really seemed to set off Marcus and his crew
>”Heresy!”
>They begin to advance toward you, but stop when Marmina raises a hand to them
>”Stand down.”
>Immediatlely, they stop and kneel down
>She turns back to you and gently drags across your skin
>”He knows not what he does. He only lashes out because he is scared. We must teach him that he is safe in the embrace of the Mother of Flesh and that he shall be saved for his cooperation.”
>She speaks softly, her voice almost full of pity
>As terrified as you are, it’s hard to not feel she’s being sincere
>She once again speaks directly to you
>”You are not in danger, my child. You are not being punished. No one here hates you. I understand change can be scary, but I promise you, the change I will give you will be a good one.”
>She once again points her nipple at your mouth
>”Please, drink.”
>You grimace
>You know no is not an answer
>Either she’ll keep insisting until you crack, or she’ll sic her followers on you
>You give up
>You pop her nipple into your mouth, hoping it’ll get you out of this sooner
>The milk is rich and warm
>You sob between gulps, tears streaming down your cheeks
>Marmina, for her part, pets your hair and coos to you
>”There, there, my child. Keeping drinking, just like that.”
>She hums a strange song to you
>You suck, and suck, and suck until eventually, she pops out of your mouth
>”Well done, my child. Now I am apart of you, in mind, body, and soul, and nothing shall ever change that.”
>You shudder, full of milk, feeling violated
>Speaking of which
>Now she’s fondling your exposed scrotum
>”But now, I must make you a part of me.”
.”W-What?”
>”We must become one, and in order for that to happen, an exchange must be made. I gave you my milk, and now, you must give me your seed. Your virility.”
>”N-no, I can-”
>But it’s too late
>Marmina’s fondling has gotten you hard
>Against your protests, she mounts on top of you
>”I sincerely hope you enjoy this, my child.”
>As you tightly shut your eyes and look away, she starts riding you
>Up and down she goes as she squeezes your shoulders
>”Look at me, Anon.”
>You refuse
>”Look.”
>You reluctantly oblige, and are nearly sick when you once again see her lack of eyes
>How the hell did this happen
>All you wanted was a good subject for your thesis
>And now, you’re being raped by some monster while some insane cult watches
>What did you do to deserve this?
>Her breasts bounce with every lewd plap sound made
>She pants, her tongue leaking slimy drool on your face, making it just that much worse
>But possibly the worst part about it is, even though your mind is sickened by it, your body likes it
>The dissonance between the two feelings makes you wanna vomit more than anything else
>You try your hardest to resist, but you can’t betray your biology forever
>Eventually, you finish, cumming inside of her
>As you do, she bites down hard on your shoulder, causing you to cry out in pain
>She releases your shoulder from her jaw, and you see a deep bite mark where she did
>A few seconds later, she gets up, and you let out a shaky sigh, half out of relief and half out of disgust
>”Now, your essence is inside of me, my child, as mine is inside you. Now, we can begin the final part of your salvation.”
>One of the followers hands her a dagger with some weird runes on it
>Fear shoots up back in you
>”N-No, please don’t!”
>She addresses you offhandedly as she slices her own palm with the blade
“NO! I’ll do anything but please, don’t-”
>You see it before you feel it
>9 inches of metal, right through your abdomen
>”Now, who you were yesterday is gone, replaced by who you are today! Walk as one with me, bathe in my light, and follow my path, so that you may live eternally as an extension of me!”
>You can’t breathe, the dagger feeling like a twenty-ton weight on your stomach
>She starts chanting something in, presumably, some sort of ancient tongue
>You wait to pass out and die, but you don’t
>In fact, the pain goes away almost instantly
>You feel… something surge throughout your body
>With every word she chants, you actually feel more alive
>And then…
>
>In conclusion, Shan-Srbavayr is a lovely, warm, and welcoming town off the beaten path plagued by rumors propagated by ignorance. It is a place with a tight-knit but friendly community with a deep touch of spirituality and tradition. To restate it plainly, my life was changed for the better at Shan-Srbavayr, and I can’t wait to go back. If you would only open your mind and ignore bogus conspiracy theories online, you would realize just how great visiting a so-called ‘backwater hamlet’ could be.
>And, done
>That’s your thesis
>You hope it does good, because you can’t wait to graduate college and go back to your real home
>With your real family
>And your real mother
>Knock-knock
>Who could that be at this hour?
>You open the door
>It’s your friends, Tyler, Cierra, and Damien
>You look at their eyes
>They’re so lost
>They need guidance
>But you can’t play your hand now
>That would drive them away
>”Oh, hello there. What can I do for you this evening?”
>They look at each other, slightly concerned
>”Uh, Anon, you good, bro? We haven’t seen you in a while, and you look kinda… frazzled.”
>”Do I? I guess I was just preoccupied with my thesis.”
>”Uh… Y-yeah! That makes sense. Anyway, we were going to the beach next Sunday, wanna come?”
>You grin
>”Oh, I think I have a better idea.”

What would role play be like for anthros? I assume something like this

>besides the standard “wild animal being hunted by a human hunter”
>many roleplays are species specific
>jaguars act like mesoamerican natives while their husbands act like conquistadors
>horse anthros make husbands act like cowboys or ranchers
>farm animals like cows, pigs and sheep have the standard farmer shtick
>wolves have the whole “red riding hood” thing for them”
>boars pretend to be Germanic warriors facing off against a Roman legionnaire
>dogs have the whole “man’s best friend” thing, often with a praise kink as well
Any others I’m not thinking of? I got nothing else to think of.

>Unlucky with the ladies
>Can barely remember the last time you got laid
>Decide that enough is enough and tonight’s the night
>Shower
>Put on your best clothes and perfume
>Go to a local dance club with the intent of finding someone
>Not really one for clubbing, but hey, there’s gotta be at least one girl for you there, right?
>You pay the entrance fee and head in
>You’re grateful this isn’t one of those fancy clubs that block people off on status,
>Otherwise, you wouldn’t have a chance to get in
>You have a few drinks, not enough to get you drunk outright, just enough to get you buzzed and loosened-up
>Then, Operation Pussy Hunt commences
>You talk to one cute chick with blonde hair and a green dress
>She tells you to fuck off before you finish your sentence
>Next, you try a whole group of women sitting at a table
>You leave after they all start uproariously laughing at you
>After that, you actually manage to hit it off with this short chick at the bar
>At least, until her boyfriend comes back around
>You barely manage to slip away into the crowd before getting your ass beat
>Every single attempt ends similarly
>Woman after woman
>They all reject you in spectacular fashion

>”Don’t you think this place is a little crowded? What say you we go back to my place and get away fr-”

>That girl on the wall over there

>Trying your best to look confident (and failing), you strut over to her
>”Heya. Name’s Anon. What’s yours, beautiful?”
>She says nothing, merely forming an X over her mouth
>”Oh, uh, you can’t talk?”
>She shakes her head
>”Well, uh… That’s fine! Say, you lonely? Looking to get away?”
>She smirks and nods her head
>”I see. Me too. In that case, why don’t you come back to my place? We can relax a little there.”
>She nods again
>You’re almost in disbelief
>This is really happening!
>Nevertheless, you (poorly) try to keep your cool
>”W-well… right this way, then!”
>The two of you leave a club and hail a cab
>You tell the driver where to go
>You don’t try to make conversation, both because you’re bad at it, and she’s presumably worse at it
>Instead, she nuzzles her head into your shoulder
>This girl’s really into you
>Looks like you really hit the jackpot tonight!
>After enjoying the moment for a bit, you make it back to your apartment
>You invite her in and turn the light on
>”Here it is. Casa de Anon. Not much, but it’s home, y’know?”
>She seems more preoccupied with looking around,
>Not that there’s much to look at, honestly
>Meanwhile, you’re completely enamored with how she looks
>Her breasts push against her velvet dress
>Her ass does the same
>And her legs are long and slender
>It’s like you bagged a bitch from a magazine
>You don’t even know her name, and already, you’re completely infatuated with her
>”Hey, uh, you look… You look amazing, y’know that?”
>She looks back at you and gives you another sly smirk
>She pats her hands over her eyes twice
>You tilt your head, somewhat puzzled
>She does it again, and then you get the message
>”Oooohhh, I get it.”
>You giggle and cover your eyes
>After a few seconds, she taps you on the soulder
>”Wow, that was fa-”
>You do a double take
>The girl that was there just a few seconds ago is gone
>Now, standing in your living room, is something else entirely
>Something big
>Something monstrous
>Something with unkempt black fur and wild red hair
> Its claws, three on each hand and foot were blood-red and sharp
>Speaking of blood-red, that was the same color it had around the eyes and mouth
>You know what this thing is
>A Zoroark
>You’ve heard stories about these things
>How they use illusions to fool people
>How they lure unsuspecting trainers in with said illusions and then do whatever with them
>Apparently, most of these are just rumors and don’t have much in the way of evidence backing them up
>Still, one clearly tricked you and is now inside your apartment
>And you don’t like it
>You start to scream, but within a second, The Zoroark tackles you to the ground and muffles you with one hand
>It brings a finger to its lips and shushes you
>You continue to panic for a little bit, but after a few moments of futile struggling, you calm down
>It gives a wicked smirk and, once satisfied that you’re not gonna freak out anymore, begins to shift its weight down your body
>You take the split second to grab your phone and attempt to call… The cops? Pokemon control?
>You don’t know, anyone to get this thing away from you
>Not missing a beat, however, The Zoroark’s hand darts for your phone and rips it out of your grasp
>It shakes her head and wags its finger before crushing the phone with not much effort
>You’re fucked
>It travels down your body, resting on your junk and stretching its leg toward you
>You look up at it
>It makes a licking motion
>When you realize what it wants, your eyes shoot open and you frantically shake your head
>”Nuh-uh. No way. Get off me, you disgusting animal, or I swear to God, I’m gonna-”
>It repeats the motion with a sterner face, its claws squeezing your legs and piercing through the fabric of your pants
>Figuring that making the beast on top of you mad probably isn’t the smartest idea, you gulp and start licking
>You do your best not to dwell on the taste of it, merely trying to get it over with
>After you soaked the entire sole with your spit, you repeat with the other foot
>When that’s done, The Zoroark gives a malicious snicker and looks behind itself
>Apparently, it noticed your humiliating erection
>You don’t enjoy this, of course
>The friction of her body against your cock just made you hard
>It gives its lips a lascivious lick
>It yanks a couple of porno mags from your coffee table and studies them for a few minutes
>You say nothing, wondering what on earth it could be planning
>Finally, it does an understanding nod and throws the magazine aside
>It gets up off you, giving you a chance to breathe
>You’re about to say something, though you’re not sure what
>You don’t get the chance to, however, as The Zoroark changes again
>This time, its chest expands outward, giving it two large breasts
>It turns around and sticks its ass toward you just in time for you to see it, too, balloon in size
>Its thighs also get chunkier, and its hips jut out more
>It - well, she, apparently - then turns around and strikes a flirty pose
>Does this thing want what you think it wants?
>Screw that
>You’re leaving
>As soon as you start running, she grabs your arm and pulls you into a forceful kiss
>Her long, slimy tongue dance in your mouth as you cringe
>She pulls away, leaving a string of saliva between your mouths
>She squeezes your wrist and forces you to touch one of her tits
>They’re big and soft
>You would almost enjoy it if it wasn’t covered in fur
>After she apparently feels you’ve had enough of playing with her breasts, she roughly shoves you to the ground
>The only warning you get is a playful wink before she takes a seat right on your face
>You panic but, again, it’s futile
>After a few moments, you calm down, trying to focus only on breathing
>There’s a small bit of airflow between her nose and her whole
>But even if you can breathe, the smell might just drive you mad
>It’s earthy and musky, not quite like anything you’ve smelt before
>And smelling it’s just about the only thing you can do right now
>You hear another faint giggle before you feel something
>The Zoroark’s ripping your clothes off
>You’re tempted to go back to struggling, but you don’t, knowing it won’t solve anything
>Once it’s finished, your shirt, pants, and underwear are in tatters, living you completely exposed
>She teases you at first, using her still-wet feet to play with your cock
>After watching you squirm for a bit, she gets more active
>She leans forward so her face is right above your penis
>She gives it tender licks, giving you a jolt of unwanted pleasure with each one
>She looks back at you and gives the same licking motion as before
>You don’t bother putting up a fight
>Closing your eyes and holding your breath, you start eating her out while she plays with your dick
>You try only to focus as much on your own pleasure as possible while avoiding thinking about the current circumstances
>The two of you swirl your tongues around each other’s genitalia, eliciting great feelings of lustful ecstasy
>It gets to a point with you sucking on her clit and her sucking hard on your cock
>You have to admit, for a monster like this, she’s pretty good
>But before either of you can cum, she pulls away from you on both ends
>She stands up, leaving you panting on the floor
>You barely even notice her grabbing your legs and hoisting them up by your feet
>She gives you another wicked smile, and before you know it, you’re inside of her
>You let out a loud moan you would probably be embarrassed of if you were in any state of mind to care
>She starts riding, violently, but with care
>You believe this is what’s called a ‘mating press’
>She squeezes onto your feet as you fuck her repeatedly
>You give short, labored breaths, using every ounce of strength to not pass out
>Your cock gets completely covered in slick as it rapidly enters The Zoroark’s pussy
>She knows just how to keep you on edge
>An hour passes before you finally cum
>When you do, your scream is muffled by another kiss
>Her chest pressed firmly against yours
>You twitch and spasm a bit
>Strangely, despite the circumstances, you feel… oddly comfortable
>Like you’re under a big, heavy blanket
>You feel like you could go to sleep right now
>In fact, you do
>
>It’s been a few days since then
>The Zoroark, or Zoe, as you’ve started calling her, hasn’t left, and you don’t think she plans to
>Everytime you try to show her to someone, she uses illusions to disguise herself
>She’s more or less invited herself into your life
>You lay wither her, head laying on her lap while she sits, watching TV while drinking a cold beer
>If nothing else, you can take solace in one thing
>Operation Pussy Hunt was a success

> Be an ordinary citizen on Coruscant, working in a restaurant not far from the Jedi Temple
> See all kinds of colorful figures come and go
> Distracted padawan bunny girl comes in on leave one day
> Has her meal quietly in the corner but bumps into you when she's leaving
> Apologizes, then hesitates, and sniffs the air
> Leans into your shoulder and takes a deeeep breath
> Comes back flushed and with eyes slightly glazed

if you don't mind, what do you like about the anthrostate stories?

Personally, I find the premise fascinating.
The idea of an entire society working on the basis of a twisted interpretation how romantic love should work is captivating.
I mean, I wouldn't actually want to be there. It is a dystopian world after all. But still.
I think it is something similar to watching a car crash in slow motion to me. It isn't "nice" but I cant stop watching.
A marriage shouldn't be mandated by the state, and the relationship shouldn't be strictly hierarchical to the point of one being the owner of the other. Yet for the people living in those worlds it their normal.
It's probably similar to the way I Like "yandere" characters. Yet I wouldn't date a crazy bitch irl.
Idk I'm kinda bad with words and the idea of a woman stronger than me calling me "cute" and "good boy" makes me diamonds.

>The city of Tappahannock was as developed as a free city could get. Tussled back and forth between Sergals on the west and Orcs on the east, it liberated itself from both and found a niche as a neutral area. Both countries, and many economic interests, found it a useful place to congregate. The clash of cultures had helped it develop into a metropolitan flower with paved streets, lamp posts, fine and tall buildings, and a diverse population of races. However, it also led to its degradation. As years passed, wealth disparity grew, violent crime increased, and it became a shadow of its former self - at least for common people.
>For people like Ardella, who reveled in spilling blood and crime, it was a wonderful nest. Splattered in the ichor of someone and really need to rent that apartment for a few weeks? That's fine, so long as you have the coin. Similarly, wetwork was always there to be had. Doubly so with such easy access to other provinces and markets. Her canine form offered her much security and strength when her magic and potioncraft couldn't save her.
>Nearly uncomfortably tall, the wolfess was, at just under two meters. Her body was warped too, glamored with the use of magic to be nearly perfect. Large breasts, a shapely ass, an hourglass figure noblewomen would murder for. It wasn't earned through good means. Hard work, yes. But not healthy or moral. And it showed. In the polluted and evil purple irises, the long and cracked nails that tipped each finger, the grey streaks in the otherwise onyx fur, and a general aura of malaise she carried.
>She had little want for coin, most times. Her benefactor and business partner supplied much of what she needed. And what splurging she desired to engage in was supplanted by her potion-making and strong-arming. Most of her responsibilities were checking out books and summarizing them, and tending to a small storefront with an apartment above it.
>So, when on a dour afternoon the bell to her shop rang and a dreary and rain-doused young man entered, she kicked her footpaws off the counter and put her full attention to him. A man, that is to say, a human male. A mop of wet black hair, firm eyebrows, and a soft face that was appealing in its gentle masculinity.
>He took only a short canvas of the shop. It wasn't much to look at. A bit dusty, a bit disorganized, and darkly themed. The greyness outside leaked in, making the storefront possess a foreboding energy of gloom. Ardella's lupine features curled into a grin of sinister pleasure as her customer noticed *it*.
>Ardella cultivated, purposefully, on herself and by extension her home in the shop, a heady musk. A fetor of feminine pheromones that compelled arousal and confusion both; even races with dulled senses like humans. It brought her great pleasure to see visitors struggle to confront the rich scents of her sweat, sex, and her unique redolence.
>This carried to the stuffy clothes she wore as well. Tight, dark leather trousers which clung to her legs, and a leather cuirass with side-latches and a high, rounded collar. Underneath she was absolutely soupy, slick with the precious (to her) saline of sweat. On a cold night, if she opened her vest, the clouds of steam were visible. Her partners - consenting or not - would come to enjoy the particular flavors and scents of Ardella or suffer in muffled silence.
>And before he'd opened his mouth, Ardella had this piece of prey pegged as someone she would torment.
>He swallowed harshly, and trying to ignore the environment and her piercing glare, spoke in a voice with delicate and refined cantor. "I've come seeking a potion to solve a matter of a discreet and private nature."
>Ardella, rolled her shoulders back, set her clawed hands to her hips, and leaned down to expel breath over him enough for his bangs to move. She nodded, "I believe I already know your issue. A matter of the bedroom. Have no fear. The words said within these walls stay here. Pray tell, your issue in its exact detail."
>The man, who introduced himself only as Courte, began to describe a common issue among men. Performance anxiety! Courte assures Ardella he is deeply attracted to his wife but merely struggles to find himself rising to the occasion. An easy fix, really, but he didn't know that. Clearly, if he did he'd have just asked for the mixture itself. No, he hadn't a clue. And that meant he could be toyed with and molded just like she wanted.
>"There is a permanent solution to your problem."
>Courte's eyes flutter at the mention of 'permanent', something about that word in relation to his genitals didn't inspire trust.
>Ardella continued, "The price is high."
>"I am prepared to pay a handsome price," he immediately went for his coin purse, the jingle of coins already ringing out in the quiet shop.
>She cackled, throwing her head back, her mane of hair thrashing with her. "I am sure you could muster a figure as handsome as your countenance. Useless to me. The craft of the cure requires sacrifice. Centimeters. These will be used in the spell that adds the potency to the potion."
>"What?"
>"Your cock will be shrunk to fuel the potency of the spell, of course." Her nonchalant voice only concerned him further, and he began blubbering to get a reply out, but before he could. "I am sure your wife would prefer a smaller stiffer dick to a longer, floppy one. Besides, human women don't need much, right?"
>He began to weigh his options in his head, wringing his hands.
>"Well, don't waste my time with all this hemming and hawing. I am a busy woman. You can take your limp worm to a different shop that will sell you ground herbs and roots that will do nothing but give you heartburn."
>She turned, slightly, reeling him in by pulling away. And perfectly, he gave a little chase. Just like a fish on a hook! He grasped after her and followed her to the counter. On the other end, she searched the shelves for a tape measure and produced it. Courte couldn't help but sniff at the air and gawk at her behind when he thought she couldn't tell. His sniffing made her ears twitch, she had heard him but said nothing. The twitch made his face fall flush in embarrassment. Not to mention how hard it had made him to take in her detail.
>"How many?"
>"That depends on how effective you want it to be. But, first, I must see what we're working with. Disrobe."
>The only urging more he needed was the intense stare from Ardella when he took too long. He unlatched his belt and undid his trousers. As expected, when he sprung free it was at the fullest mast he could manage. The pheromones’ fault, surely, given how it was dripping and throbbing.
>"Excited for a cure I see. If you run home fast enough maybe you could use this with the wife."
>Ardella knelt to measure him, she had to, Courte came up to her tits. The most well-hung human in Tappahannock would look like a dicklet in her palm, and Courte wasn't any different, and he most certainly wasn't impressively endowed. "Fifteen and a half centimeters. Hmph."
>"Huh... ?" Courte made a mewl that many men do when lacking in confidence, 'please reassure me'.
>"I am sure it's fine for a human. A wolfess requires something with more... strength?" Her inflection and careless attitude cut him to shreds. But, it also made that dick she held twitch in her palm, a sticky string of pre having leaked out. She pulled away, cleaning her palm with a lick and smirking at him.
>"How many do you need?"
>"Five? Six?"
>"What! That's like! That's, that... th--," he looked down at his prized possession and made a whimper.
>"Take it or leave it." With her hand, she gently holds and strokes him toward her. "The exchange method is intimate. It requires, bluntly, the potion crafter to be fucked."
>Between the stroking and the suggestion of sex, Courte was putty. Ardella pulled her trousers slightly, the fabric digging into and showing her puffy, canine pussy.
>Courte had little fight left in him at this point. He mumbled something about being severely pent up. Not much time with the wife but plenty with his hand, apparently. When Ardella unclipped her vest and revealed her motherly, stupendous, heavy tits and the cloud of sweaty, rank musk hit him, he was shaking. He had to bite his lip in order to not spurt across her thigh in that instance.
>She grasped him about the head and shoved his back to the counter, getting him between her legs with a predatory snarl. The idle threat of tooth and claw was a bizarre mix of arousing and heart-poundingly terrifying for the man, and he could do little but grab onto her hips in a small effort to get some control back.
>Ardella barked a firm order for him to undress her lower half and he did so with the trembling disposition of a cherry boy. He didn't expect the sight he found, a lace black thong several sizes too small comically pretending at concealing her grabbable dogpussy. And he couldn't have ever stood a chance against the smell of her musk.
>His stance wobbled and knees knocked as he slid down the counter to huff, sniff, kiss, and worship at his newfound altar. A villainous merriment fell over Ardella as Courte simped at her pussy, licking the developing slick there like a desert explorer at an oasis. Down below she could practically hear each cock-throbbing heartbeat as he made out with her cunt.
>Enough foreplay, though. Ardella pulled at his head to yank him back up to standing, she didn't want to have to bend her knees too far, now. Courte felt as though his throat would be torn from him at any moment as he was pinned against the counter. Her splendid, divine, unwashed spade thrust itself down upon his trembling human shaft without warning. Her downward hump pulled the foreskin back in a tantalizing and desperate thrust that had him clutching at her thigh fur and calling for Mommy.
>Courte had never felt the heat, the pressure, the gripping tug of such an animalistic cunt. What's more, was what each downward thrust was doing to him. He was desperately trying to push her off, the heavy weight of this beast, assaulting him, making his cock feel as though it were pleasurably melting into a small, little nub.
>And that's just what was happening. Ardella was consuming the masculinity of his cock, weakening it, softening it, stripping centimeters of it with a whispered enchantment, to fuel her own glamors. Courte wanted to escape, couldn't, wanted to stay, couldn't. Yes, that part of him that loved the assault on his hips, each wet plap against his hairless legs from the shaggy wolfess, couldn't indulge much longer. He was going to cum.
>Hardly a minute had passed Ardella noted, when she heard her mark gasp and release his seed in her. For Courte, it had felt like a marathon, but it was naught but a little twenty-metre sprint. He twitched, he bucked back up, and groaned in lust at the sight of her cunt lips hungrily gripping at his needle dick.
>Ardella graciously allowed him his full orgasm, but did nothing to catch him when his knees gave way and he slid down the counter. She stood over him, firm, trunk-like, muscular legs penning him in. "Payment rendered."
>He made a mournful, full-bodied gasp, looking down at his cock. Well, what was left of it. His quickly softening baby carrot couldn't have been more than nine centimeters, and woefully lacking in girth. Insult to injury, was how her bestial cunt leaked his cum to the floor of the store so carelessly.
>While Courte grasped at what was left of his manhood, Ardella brewed him a tincture of ground herbs and roots that would give him heartburn. It would give him a long-lasting and powerful erection, for what little that was worth now. Those precious centimeters would feed the glamors altering her body for a few months, and that was a win.
>Out and out she pushed him, once he'd gotten his cure and tugged on his clothes. "Come again soon."

>Anon, I don't think you realize that when I asked you to go out with me, I wasn't really asking. "Asking" is what you humans do. Do I look human to you, Anon?
>Does this look like the face of someone who hasn't already decided your answer for you?
>You will drive over to my house this evening and knock at the door. My Father should answer, at which point you will nervously ask if I'm home.
>I will, of course, be in the living room and will be pleasantly surprised at your sudden and unannounced appearance.
>I will be ready in no more than seven minutes, at which point you will appreciate my outfit's subtle cleavage as I hop down the stairs. Father will likely notice your staring, and you will be embarrassed.
>Once we're alone, you will veer off the path towards your house to the campsite just off the main road. This campsite is off limits, but for some reason the lock has been broken clean off with an aluminum bat earlier today.
>Once we arrive, I'll tell you that this isn't your house, at which point you'll start putting your moves on me.
>You will, in spite of my pleading not to, push me down.
>You will kiss me along my neck, while you shove your hands down my skirt
>Conveniently, the outfit I'm wearing makes it easy for my sensitive spots to be reached, and you will notice and comment about how I bust have been asking for it.
>Of course, being a pure maiden, I will refuse even as my head clouds over with pleasure
>I will, of course, be powerless against the onslaught of feelings you'll inflict upon me, until eventually I yield and spread my legs
>And then you'll pounce, deflower me, and absolutely dominate me with your raw male prowess
>After you've finished no less than three times, you'll force me to clean your cock with my mouth, then drop me off at my place no later than ten.
>And, if you don't...
>Then we'll stop doing this like humans do
>And I'll simply TAKE you, as a beast should.

>Unlucky
>Unfortunate
>Screwed over
>Honestly, you could put it in a lot of different ways
>The meaning’s still the same
>In a class of 26 students, of course you get shackled with her
>Marissa Moore
>Rat girl
>Light grey fur
>Dark hair with dyed, neon green tips
>Piercings all around her nose, lips, ears, eyebrows, and God knows where else
>Usually dressed in standard ‘punk’ clothes
>Band t-shirts, cargo pants, belts up the ass, things of that nature
>She wasn’t particularly tall, around five-ish feet
>But for what she lacked in height, she more than made up for in rudeness
>There are a good handful of assholes in your school, but Marissa takes the cake
>It’s hard to recall someone as vulgar and obnoxious as her in your life
>She steals people's food
>She calls people names
>She extorts people for money and homework
>And if all that’s not enough, just when you think she would at least not be a problem physically, she proves you wrong
>Despite her short stature and light weight, she was surprisingly strong
>You once heard that she took down two football jocks twice her size
>Although, a lot of that could be her tail
>That thing’s about as tall as her, and totally prehensile
>You once saw her wrap around some poor guy’s throat and pin him against the wall
>Suffice it to say, her reputation precedes her
>It’s honestly a wonder how she managed to not get expelled
>Most people wouldn’t want to sit next to her, let alone do an entire project with her
>And yet, there you were
>At her house
>Futilely attempting to get her to work with you
>Regardless, you try your best to play nice with her
>You know it’s probably not gonna happen, but still, you want this project to go as smoothly as it possibly can with someone like Marissa
>”So, I was doing some research, and I think we should really focus on-”
>”Oooohhh, my fucking God, why are you talking?”
>You glare at her
>She either doesn’t notice or (more likely) doesn’t care
>Marissa has three default expressions
>Slight, disinterested frown
>Cruel shit-eating sneer
>And enraged grimace
>Right now, she wore the former
>She lounges back with bare feet on the table adjacent to you with your important books and notes
>She doesn’t even bother to look at you as she whines
>”What the fuck are you even doing here? Who asked you to come to my house?”
>You let out an annoyed sigh through your nose
>Despite her flagrant yet characteristic disrespect, you decide to take the high road and remain somewhat civil
>”I’m here, Marissa, because we’re supposed to be doing a project, and I actually want to talk to you about it.”
>”Uh, correction:”
>She looks forward and points a finger at you
>”You’re supposed to be doing a project. I’m not doing shit for you.”
>You scowl
>You’ve had enough of Marissa’s bullying
>You might have been passive and meek in the past but today you take a stand
>So you say, in the sternest voice you can muster up:
>”Marissa, I am not gonna be jerked by you anymore. You will help me with this project and that’s final.”
>Her expression shifts to something betraying fake shock, obviously not the least bit impressed by your attempt to stick up to her
>”Oh, shit. Now I’m freaked out. But uuuuuuhhhh, what are you gonna do if I don’t?”
>”Uh well… I’m gonna… I’m gonna…”
>Shit
>You really didn’t think that far ahead
>She retracts her legs and fishes around in her pockets
>”Yeah, that’s what I thought.”
>She whips out a lighter and a pack of cigarettes
>You cringe
>You always hated the smell of cigarette smoke
>”Could you please not smoke? I really don’t like it.”
>She parrots what you just said in a shrill, mocking tone as she lights the cig and brings it to her lips
>”My house, my rules, faggot. I smoke whenever I goddamn want, and if you don’t like it, the door’s right there.”
>You sigh
>Being assertive clearly isn’t getting anywhere
>Maybe it’s time to switch tactics
>You decide to try to reason with her
>Absurd, you know, but maybe no one sincerely tried with her before
>”Look, Marissa, I don’t want to do this project with you any more than you do, b-”
>”Then fuck off. You’re a teacher’s pet anyway. Why don’t you just do more work so you don’t have to hang with mean ol’ Marissa?”
>”Because I’m actually trying to give you a chance instead of writing you off like everyone else!”
>She gives you a puzzled stare before rolling her eyes and taking a long drag from her cigarette
>”Seriously? Seriously? You’re gonna get on a high horse with me?”
>She takes another drag and gets up off her seat
>”You know how many people tried to ‘understand’ me and then gave up when I tried to actually talk to them?”
>”I-I didn-”
>”You’re just like everyone else, aren’t you? You try to play moral crusader, but it’s all one big fucking dog and pony show, right? The second it’s time to walk the talk, you’ll split the scene, won’t you?”
>”Please, I-”
>”Shut your dumbass fucking retard mouth!”
>Now she’s wearing the enraged grimace
>”Don’t you think I have enough problems without pompous assholes like you sticking their nose in shit that’s not their business? Fuck you!”
>This is getting bad
>You’re not sure what to do
>”I should beat the fucking shit out of you now! I should send you sniveling home to Mommy with a bloody nose and piss-stained underwear! Then you’d see where the nice guy act gets you, you fucki-”
>”DON’T FUCKING TALK TO ME LIKE THAT!”
>She inches back startled
>Truth be told, you’re a little startled yourself
>You don’t know where that came from
>If you had to guess, you suppose it was just the result of a lot of unexpressed, pent-up anger against everyone who picked on you, not just Marissa
>As for Marissa herself, she seems to go through a lot of different expressions before settling on a relieved smirk
>A relieved smirk that transforms into her trademark insulting snicker
>”Wow, holy shit! I didn’t think you had it in you. I’m impressed, Anon! Seriously, I am!”
>You say nothing, merely wondering if this could be a turning point between you and her
>”Of course, not impressed enough to not do this.”
>Before you can even react, her tail whips through your ankles and sweeps you off your feet
>After a moment of disorientation, you look up to see her laughing more uproariously at you
>”Jesus Christ, you are such a fucking loser!”
>You frown
>Of course
>You snapping at her isn’t gonna magically make her friendlier to you
>What were you thinking?
>She places a foot on top of you
>”I mean, seriously, just look at you. You’re a complete fucking dweeb, I’m pretty sure you have no friends, and… wait, I actually realized something a while back.”
>”W-what?
>”You only ever smelled like… well, you. Not like anyone else.”
>”And that means…?”
>”Oh, don’t play stupid, stupid! I know human noses can’t smell for shit, but for anthros, it’s pretty obvious that when someone gets laid by the smell. And I can tell you’ve never once been laid, at least not while I was around.”
>You blush a fluorescent shade of red
>Where the hell did this come from?
>And why the hell does she care?
>”What’s up with that? Are you actually gay or something?”
>”N-no! I’m not, I ju-”
>”Just what? Don’t tell me… you seriously can’t get laid?”
>Her laughter returns, even louder and crueler than before
>You feel humiliated
>You guess now you know why she cares so much
>She wants another thing to hang over your head and humiliate you with
>”How? Fucking how? Do you know how thirsty anthro bitches are for human cock? They’d burn their houses down just for a taste of it. Are you that much of a social retard that you can’t bag an anthro bitch?”
>”I-I don’t see you with a harem of men.”
>She merely lets out an annoyed scoff
>”That’s because none of the limpdicks at school are worthy of my pussy, including you. But I do know what you are worthy of.”
>Before you can ask what she means, she stomps on your face
>Not enough to break your nose or seriously hurt, but definitely enough to cut off your flow of oxygen
>You hear her let out another vicious cackle
>”That’s right, faggot! Get a faceful of my sweaty foot!”
>She rubs her foot all around your smooshed face, leaving wiping sweat all over it
>What few breaths you do get in are dominated by the stink of the sole
>It might actually be fortunate that you can’t really breathe, considering how bad it smells
>Just as your lungs are starting to burn, mercifully, she finally lifts her foot off of your face
>You take a labored and relieved sigh as Marissa lets out a smug chuckle
>”You like that, loser? It’s probably the closest you’ll get to actually getting with a chick.”
>You’re still too out of it to even glare at her, much less come up with a response
>She places a finger on her chin, seemingly getting an idea
>”Actually, you know what? I pity you, so I’m gonna do you a solid.”
>You watch as she turns around and lowers her pants to just above her thighs
>Either her pants concealed it or you just never cared to look, but her ass is pretty fat
>You might actually be attracted to it if it was attached to a more likable person
>”Kiss it, nerd!”
>You blink, confused
>If things weren’t out of hand before, they definitely are now
>”I… I’m not gonn-”
>”Oh, shut the fuck up. Don’t to pretend to have standards now.”
>She wraps her long tail around your neck, not enough to choke you, but enough to lift you up and position your face right next to her ass
>”Come oooon, it’s not that hard, just one kiss, it won’t be much.”
>”Maris-”
>”DO IT!”
>At this point, it’s obvious she won’t take no for an answer
>So, you give her a quick peck on the right cheek
>There’s a short pause, during which you hope that satisfied her
>But then,
>”Are fucking deaf or something? I said kiss it. Like, actually kiss it.”
>She uses her tail to force your face into her crack
>Instinctively, you gasp, but that turns out to be a big mistake
>Her ass smells at least five times worse than her foot did
>One whiff, and you’re light-headed almost instantly
>Thankfully, she only presses you against her asshole for a few seconds before letting you go
>You fall back, once again desperately catching your breath
>Another wicked grin flashes on Marissa’s face
>”You know, I think I know a way you can actually be useful. Follow me!”
>It seems she has another idea for you
>She doesn’t bother waiting for you, she just wraps her tail back around her throat and leads you over to the couch
>She throws you on top of it
>”For the rest of the night, you’re gonna be my seat.”
>She plops herself right on top of her pelvis
>The heavy feeling of a woman’s ass is enough to get you half-erect
>As if this wasn’t degrading enough
>”Get comfy, I know I will.”
>You try to say something, but she cuts you off
>”If I hear any whining, I’ll scooch on over to your face. You don’t want that, do ya?”
>She takes your subsequent silence as a yes
>Hours pass
>You lay there, acting as Marissa’s personal seat
>All you can do is silently pray that she[‘s not gonna use this to blackmail you
>You have some popcorn and soda for ‘dinner’
>You suppose you should be thankful she at least makes a token effort of feeding you
>It’s now 11:00
>Marissa’s gorging on another bag of chips, watching some wrestling show
>Tired, you let out a yawn
>”Oh, is my little seat getting sleepy?”
>Hoping she’ll show at least a little bit of mercy, you nod in confirmation
>”You can’t just go to sleep yet. I still haven’t given you your reward
>”My… reward?”
>”Yeah! Your reward for being such a good seat.”
>”W-what are you talking about?”
>”Oh, come the fuck on. You still wanna play dumb? I can feel you underneath my ass. I know you want me.”
>Dammit
>You were really hoping she wouldn’t notice
>”So, tell me…”
>She leans forward
>Your noses almost touch
>You see a new expression on her face
>A lustful, half-lidded gaze
>”...Do you want my pussy?”
>You want to say no
>You want to smack her across the face and finally get the hell out of there
>...But you can’t
>Hours of being sat on by her bare ass has led you to be pent up
>And maybe it’s just you being sleepy, desperate, and horny, but looking at her again, she really doesn’t look that bad
>So, hoping things might finally go your way tonight, you take a gulp and say
>”Y-yeah.”
>But then, her wicked grin reappeared on her face
>”Too bad! You don’t get to touch my pussy!”
>She gets up and throws her pants to the side
>”The only thing you deserve…”
>She turns around and pins your head between the couch cushion and her rear
>”...is my stinky, sweaty asshole!”
>You struggle uselessly, panicking
>”No freebies this time, loser! Make out with it.”
>Knowing better now than to try and fight back, you push aside your shock and get to work
>You start by swirling around the rim of it
>The taste is bitter, but you try your best to ignore it
>Next, you slather your spit over the actual opening itself
>At first, it clenches, resistant to your tongue
>But a combination of your saliva and her sweat quickly causes it to yawn open and allow your tongue inside
>You swish around, painting the inside of it with your drool
>If you're having any effect on Marissa, she’s maintaining her poker face really well
>You squeeze onto her cheeks, working through your burning lungs and hazy head
>Just when you're about to pass out, she separates from you
>You pant desperately
>The room spins before finally coming back into place
>You're not sure if it’s your head or what, but Marissa’s smile seems even wider than usual
>With a devious chuckle, she yanks your pants down, letting your erect cock flop free
>”M-Marissa!”
>”This is what you wanted, right? Well, have fun, because this is the best you’re ever gonna get!”
>In one swift motion, she turns around and engulfs your cock inside of her
>You throw your head back as a surge of pleasure immediately shoots through you
>You don’t get to enjoy that initial surge for long, though
>Almost immediately, she starts riding you
>In and out, your cock disappears and reappears with each penetration
>And with each penetration, the details of the world around you fade away, little by little
>The room distorts and blurs as the only thing clear is Marissa, her cheeks bouncing and hole stretched out as her tail’s raised high to allow you easy access
>The murmuring of the TV grows softer and softer until the only thing audible to you are the rough clapping noises you and Marissa are making together
>The taste of her ass lingers on your tongue, and despite the bitter taste, you find yourself craving it with each passing second
>You smell sweat, both Marissa’s and your own, and while before it would have smelled nasty to you, now it smells natural and intoxicating, like each microscopic droplet contains pheromones that leave you desperately, bestially horny
>You feel…
>Amazing
>Euphoric
>Elated
>Honestly, you could put it in a lot of different ways
>The meaning is the same
>You could have never thought that bliss at this level was possible, let alone through a rat punk’s anus, but here you are
>You’re not sure you could live without it now
>You’re not even sure you can feel shame about it anymore
>If this is what being broken feels like, you’re not sure you ever want to be fixed
>Time slows as you enjoy the moment
>A single minute turns to several hours
>Not that you’re complaining
>You don’t want this to stop
>But it has to eventually
>You’re not sure how long it’s been, but you finish
>Your cum shoots deep inside of her hole
>All the while, she keeps as cool as ever
>At that point, you’re completely and utterly spent
>Marissa says something to you, but you fail to comprehend it as sleep takes you
>
>You finally wake back up at…
>10:23?
>Oh shit!
>”Marissa! Wake up!”
>Marissa, who you're still inside of, lazily nods awake, drool falling down her chin
>”Huh, wha happen?”
>”We’re late! Way fucking late! We need to head to school now!”
>She lets out an annoyed groan
>”So? Who cares!”
>”I do! Come on, get dressed, we gotta go, NOW!”
>Huffing, she gets off of you
>Not a drop of cum leaks from her
>It must have been completely absorbed into her body
>”Fine, if you’re gonna be such a fucking baby about it.”
>She half-heartedly puts her pants and panties back on before sticking her boots onto her feet, not even bothering with socks
>”Come on, we’ll take my car.”
>You rush over to it, while she drags her feet
>”Dammit, I can’t believe this.”
>”I can. You were hypnotized by my ass last night.”
>Blushing, you try to change the subject
>”I didn’t even eat, or shower, or do the project or-”
>”One, we’ll pick up something on the way. Two, I guess you’ll just have to work twice as hard on it tonight. And three…”
>She strikes you on the shoulder
>It stings slightly, but it’s still distinctly playful
>”You don’t need a shower. I want the whole world to see how much you smell like a rat’s ass.”

Having an unprotected clueless minor excreting hormonal pheromones in the tall grass is like walking around high school with a "kick me" sign. They won't be fast enough to run, experienced enough to hide, or strong enough to resist even low level Pokémon.
Get your kid a starter Pokemon, or risk them being lost to the wilderness.

>get treated like a goddess
>grow massive and live long to keep enjoying it all

>Having fears is normal
>That’s what your parents told you
>That’s what you tell yourself
>It’s not something to get bent out of shape over
>What might be worth getting bent out of shape over, though, is when your fear is something extremely common and unavoidable outside of your house
>Fear of clowns? Fear of heights? Manageable
>Fear of trees? Fear of cars? Not as manageable
>And fear of anthros? Definitely unmanageable
>You’re not sure when exactly it started
>Maybe some anthro got too close for comfort for baby you and you internalized it
>Maybe you watched some movie with a scary anthro killer when you were younger and just blocked that out
>Or maybe your brain is just wired differently
>In any case, anthros freak you the fuck out
>You can think of a few reasons
>Their long, sharp claws that can rip through your skin like paper
>Their even sharper teeth that can grind your bones into dust
>Their extraordinary strength that can twist the average human into a pretzel
>Even the way the act, all overly personal and boundaryless, is more than a bit offputting for you
>Of course, most of that applies only to preds
>You prefer prey, but even still, they creep you out
>You wish you could just avoid them outright
>But that’s not possible, especially where you’re at right now
>It wasn’t so bad when you lived out in the sticks
>Very large human to anthro population out there
>There were a few anthros, but you avoided them mostly without incident
>At most, your fear manifested with you changing the channel whenever a particularly strong pred woman came on screen
>If the situation remained like that, you probably wouldn’t have too much of a problem
>But it didn’t
>Around eighth grade, your dad got a big promotion at his job, and you had to move to the city
>Everyone always stared at you, wondering just what the hell you were so scared of
>All those beady eyes, staring a hole into the center of your soul
>It made you feel like they would pounce on you at any second
>Some of the more sympathetic students and teachers tried to reach out, see what was wrong, and hopefully help you
>But you just built a wall between you and them, avoiding the actual problem until they eventually gave up and left you alone
>On the flip side, some of the shittier ones used your fear to torment you, which was just about the last thing you needed
>Eventually, though, you suppose even the cruelest of bullies took pity on you, and they left you alone too
>Not that you were complaining of course
>The subsequent years weren’t as bad, but that’s not saying much
>You managed to make a few (human) friends but for the most part, you were mainly known as a loner, drifting by quietly through school
>Somehow, though, you survived, found a decent job programming, and things actually seemed on the up-and-up
>Sure, you’re still afraid of anthros, but so long as you don’t get too close or don’t look at them too long, it’s not much of a problem
>You start thinking maybe you’re actually getting a handle on your fears
>...Or, at least, you did
>Until your brother married anthro
>A tigress, specifically
>8 and a half feet
>Palms bigger than your face
>Muscles that were more like armor and were probably hard as steel
>Teeth and claws that looked razor sharp
>And the eyes
>Dear god, the eyes
>Anthro eyes at the best of times
>But something about feline eyes in particular send a subarctic shiver down your spine
>She does her best to be friendly around you but despite her pleasant misdemeanor and your attempts to tell yourself there’s nothing to be scared of
>Every time she eats something, all you can picture is her eating a huge chunk of human meat
>And every time she goes to kiss your brother, there’s always a part of you that’s worried she’ll chomp half of his face
>This makes you uncomfortable, which she senses and makes her uncomfortable, which your brother picks up on and makes him uncomfortable, and to cut a long story short, everyone gets uncomfortable whenever you and her are in a room together
>The rest of your family is well aware of your little phobia
>Your brother, your parents, and everyone else has tried multiple times to convince you that she’s not a bad person and that she’s not going to hurt you
>You’ve tried your hardest to listen and put away your fear, but no matter what, you just can’t stop yourself from getting scared
>Things a reached a boiling point at your cousin’s barbecue
>You went to go grab a beer from the cooler
>You felt a finger tap your shoulder, and you turned around
>You came face to face with your brother’s wife, licking her chops like she was about to bite your face off
>In hindsight, she was probably just licking her lips
>At that moment, your fight or flight reflexes kicked into overdrive
>Before you could stop yourself, you scream and shove her to the ground
>By the time you come to your senses, she’s staring up at you, a mixture of confusion, concern, and sadness on her face
>She’s big and strong enough that it probably didn’t hurt all that much
>But the physical pain wasn’t the problem
>You look around
>Your entire family is staring at you with similar expressions
>Seeing the disappointment in everyone’s eyes is the last straw
>No more shoving this down and pretending everything’s okay
>Now you know you need help
>Serious help

>go into the zoo to visit gloria
>that faithful day, she shows you how her anus can take up an entire watermelon
>and then she crushes it inside her ass without any effort
>She looks at you, demanding to slurp the juice from her winking asshole

>My footsteps echo through the empty stone hallway
>The corridor is long and poorly lit by a few widely spaced out torches, with no light maintainers left it was up to me to maintain what torches I could
>I finally reach my destination and wipe away a few cobwebs on the wooden door’s nameplate
>Wine cellar number three, out of the two dozen wine cellars in this whole temple this was the only remaining cellar with intact wine casks that held somewhat tolerable drink
>The other one I used to use, wine cellar five, I had emptied of it’s last drops just yesterday
>I grab a torch from the wall and open the creaky door, stepping inside
>My torch just barely illuminates the closest walls as I gaze into the inky darkness and the contents of the cellar are illuminated by an orange flicker
>Rows upon rows of wine casks, stacked from the floor to the high ceiling in neat columns
>I get closer to one of the rows and look at the wooden cask
>A date is branded onto it’s dark surface, the date that the wine was stored
>The one in front of me is far too old, the wine inside has surely turned sour or dried up by now
>I begin walking down the lines as the dates gradually become more recent
>Fifty years old, forty, thirty, twenty, twenty five, twenty four, twenty three
>Twenty three
>The most recent wine in this entire cellar is twenty three years old
>I look to the other wall only to be met with a similar date
>I sigh, and decide to do a taste test before offering it to the goddess
>I open the spigot and cup my hand underneath, a small pool of red liquid slowly filling it
>I close it and raise my hand to my mouth
>It runs down my throat and-Bleghh!
>I nearly cough it back up
>The wine is sour, very sour, yet it does contain a hint of it’s original flavor somehow preserved after all this time
>I would much prefer to give my goddess a more suitable offering, something other than this decrepit wine, yet with the events of the past year this is all I can offer her
>I retrieve a large offering bowl and fill it with the wine, the sounds of the liquid hitting the gilded metal echoing through the cellar
>Offering now ready I grab my torch and move to the cellar door, placing it back on the wall before walking to the goddesses’ chambers
>On the way there my foot hits a piece of rubble, a chunk of stone that had fallen from the ceiling
>I manage to stop myself from tripping but in the process a small amount of the wine spills from the bowl
>I stand still
>Not long ago wasting an offering to the goddess in such a manner would have gotten me tied to a post and given fifty lashes by a senior zealot
>Thankfully there aren’t any senior zealots left, or any zealots at all for that matter
>I continue through the empty stone corridors until finally coming to a large door decorated in glittering metal, precious stones, and ornate wooden carvings
>The scene on the door is one I’ve seen many times before, a depiction of the goddess standing in a lake, her servants gathered at the shore and their arms filled with offerings
>In return for their offerings the goddess has turned the fetid parasite infested lake water to glittering fresh water, it’s color a crystalline blue
>Just one of her many miracles
>I push open the door and immediately turn my eyes to the floor, looking upon the goddess before presenting an offering was frowned upon
>Thankfully this room is the most well lit in the entire temple, I’ve made sure to keep it that way given this is where the goddess spends most of her time
>Her chamber is simple to navigate, a large pool made up the center with narrow walkways along the sides and a small rounded outcrop attached to one of the walkways for her servants to present offerings
>I quietly make my way to the outcrop and kneel at the edge of it
>It takes a minute or two but eventually I do see the water darken as she makes her way to me
>I hear something large exit the surface, the sound of water dripping off hard scales filling my ears
>The water darkens further as she walks to me
>I see two scaled and clawed feet at the edge of my vision and I know she’s right in front of me
>I gulp and open my mouth
>”Your humble servant presents his daily offering to Ahlimon the supreme power, highest of goddesses, undisputed ruler and benevolent ally of the lake people, the scaled queen mother, bringer of life and purifier of water, breaker of pirate vessels and peacemaker of the lake, fecund egglayer of the-“
>I’m cut off as she lifts the bowl from my hands and raises it to her mouth
>I sit still in a tense silence as I hear the wine run down her maw
>The wine is sour, she will soon know this, yet at the same time there was nothing I could have done
>My eyes begin to water
>She’s not going to like this
>She will surely kill me, it’s the befitting end for a poor servant
>Yet there’s nothing I could have done
>The goddess stops drinking and licks her lips
>She throws the empty bowl across the room in anger
>I flinch at the sudden noise, then hear her lean forward, droplets of water dripping off her body and gradually wetting the ground in front of me
>”Look at me, servant.” She commands, her voice booming and absolute
>I look up without hesitation
>She’s right in front of me, half submerged in the crystal blue water
>Our goddess took the form of an eight foot tall two legged crocodile, her face bearing a long toothy snout and a girthy tail poking out from her back
>Being a symbol of fertility her hips were wide and womanly, her scaled skin appeared to have a certain softness underneath, and her heavy breasts were barely contained within the two large golden domes making up her bra
>Atop her head is a golden headdress adorned with crystals and stones while a large necklace drooped across her shoulders, it’s segments made of silver and turquoise
>Across her waist is a white knee length satin skirt and several metallic bracelets were wrapped around each wrist
>Each item of clothing, no matter how simple or complex, was a gift from my people
>She, in her benevolence, chose to adorn herself with the works of her servants, all willingly given
>I look into her slit pupils and feel a pit form in my stomach
>Ahlimon leans in, each word revealing her many sharp teeth
>”The wine, it’s sour. Practically vinegar. What kind of servant gives his undisputed goddess sour wine? One that is incompetent? One that is lazy? One that wishes to serve some other goddess? One that wishes to disrespect me?”
>I put my hands together in a plea
>”No! No my goddess please do not take my pitiful offering as a sign of disrespect! The wine in this temple is old, very old, I’ve already given you the most recent batches and this is all that remains. Please forgive me for my transgression, I swear what I say to be true.”
>”Old wine? In a temple of Ahlimon? Perhaps you should have looked harder!”
>She raises one hand and backslaps me across the head sending me sprawling across the floor
>I hit the ground hard, the metallic taste of blood fills my mouth and my head is spinning
>I hear Ahlimon get out of the water and see her towering over me in all her terrible, splendid, scaly glory
>I get to me knees and once again put my hands together in a plea
>”Please! Please have mercy upon your servant, he means you no disrespect, please, please, please.”
>I shake and look at the ground, silent prayers filling my head
>Ahlimon lets out a breathy sigh, then I feel two large hands grip my shoulders and raise me to my feet
>”Get up, servant. Perhaps I’ve been expecting too much of you lately. You must understand, this is a trying time for your goddess. We are in a very precarious position.”
>I shake my head in agreement
>”Yes, after the cultists of Rahmon attacked the city and razed your temple the following of Ahlimon has been…lessened.”
>She takes a hand and rakes it through my hair, her claws lightly scraping my scalp
>”Lessened is one word for it. But perhaps destroyed is more fitting.”
>”No, no! The zealots that covered our escape to this hidden temple will surely return. Your warriors are strong and our people resilient! I-I-I…I can’t be…”
>Ahlimon leans in, her voice low and gentle
>”You are all that’s left, Lima. I know it. What remains of your people are now worshipping the heretic known as Rahmon and what followers I have are either dead or praying to some other power. Except for you, that is.”
>I cross my arms, eyes growing moist
>”That’s…that’s not possible! Your following was robust, my people were ready and willing to accept your gifts in return for water and protection. Your warriors and priests were many. We were…we were so strong together.”
>”Lima, our brave warriors spent their last breaths covering our retreat to this place and the holy priests were all slaughtered in the main temple. You, a mere servant, are all that’s left of my following.” She then moves her hand to my cheek, wiping away a tear. “We’ve spent a year in this old temple and none of your fellow believers have arrived. In your heart surely you must know my words to be true.”
>I choke back a sob and look away, staring into empty space
>”Tell me Lima, what have you learned on your scouting missions? Any potential converts?”
>I look up to her
>”This temple is surrounded by endless deserts, my goddess. I have found no tribes, no towns, no people at all. Just lifeless sand dunes in every direction.”
>”Shame, a few thousand years ago this area was rife with rivers and jungle, hence why I made my secret hideaway here.” She begins slowly walking back towards the water. “One follower, an old decaying temple, no converts in sight, precarious indeed.” She walks back into the water and looks towards me, waving a hand. ”Come Lima. Join me in the pool.”
>I dutifully comply, sitting on the edge then scooting my butt over into the water
>Where the water line only came up to her waist it came up to the bottom of my rib cage
>Not that I minded, like all the water she touches this pool was pleasantly warm and crystal clear
>I wade over to her
>”I hit you hard. Does your head hurt? Mortals tend to wound easily.”
>I slowly shake my head in an affirmative
>”Come then, let me free my loyal follower of his ailments.”
>She suddenly pushes my head below the water and I almost take in a lungful of liquid, stopping myself just in time
>Then with equally sudden force she grabs me by the shoulders and raises me back above water
>”Feel better?”
>Suddenly the throbbing pain from her slap is gone, I’m totally clearheaded, everywhere the water touches feels warm and soothing
>”Yes goddess, thank you.”
>”It’s the least I can do. After all, the only thing more pathetic than a goddess with one follower is a goddess with no followers. Then again, I suppose in less than a century I’ll be one of them too. You will grow old like all the other mortals on this plane and die, your spirit lifted to my ethereal realm to live eternity in paradise alongside the great lake.”
>”I find no shame in dying in service to you, Ahlimon. I only fear I may die with the regret that I left you alone in this place, with no one to worship you further. Such a regret would surely haunt me into the afterlife.”
>”I fear the same thing Lima, it may come as a surprise to you but even supreme beings such myself feel fear from time to time. Now what are we going to do about this…” She raises a hand to her snout and looks at the water in thought, eventually looking to me once more. “The fundamental issue is you have no mate, do you? It requires two to make a third.”
>”True, with my people overtaken and this temple empty there is no hope of me having an heir.”
>”Unfortunate, if only a female had escaped with you then I might have been able to bless her with many children. Then there could have been hope of at least keeping this temple staffed until we could find converts. But with no human females around that leaves only one other option.”
>I scratch my head
>”One other option? Are you suggesting we try to find a traveling merchant caravan and steal their women so I could…you know?”
>She cocks her head, considering the idea
>”No, that option increases the chances of a follower of Rahmon finding us here and an eventual attack force being sent. I had another idea.” She presents a scaled hand to me. “Come Lima, I have something to show you. Take a deep breath though, we’ll be underwater for a while.”
>I take a breath, grip her hand, and she dives down into the water
>Unsurprisingly she’s an incredible swimmer, gracefully slicing through the water as her tail waves back and forth hypnotically
>She swims to the center of the pool and reaches it’s bottom, lifting a section of the floor then slipping through
>I follow by her side as we enter the dark tunnel, her grip on my hand the only thing allowing me to remain next to her as we glide into the dark abyss
>We swim straight down for what feels like an eternity
>I see nothing but darkness, feel nothing but water rushing past my body and the scaly hand gripping my own
>My lungs begin to burn for air and my body begins to feel weak, I'm mere moments away from asphyxiating before a sudden break to the surface
>My head exits the water and I take in a deep, heavily needed breath
>I look around only to see more darkness
>That is until I hear Ahlimon snap her fingers and two torches illuminate the small room we’re in
>The walls are a dark and smooth stone, the room is small with the floor made of mud that gradually recedes into the water behind me
>I look around and see nothing else, where are we?
>”Ahlimon, what is this place?”
>She just gives me a toothy smile and sits down on the muddy floor
>”Notice anything odd?”
>I pause, taking in every sight and sensation
>”Well it’s…it’s quite warm down here. Warmer than in the temple.”
>”Correct, this place is well below the surface, we’re being warmed by the bosom of the earth. It’s a constant temperature no matter the season.”
>”But why are down here?”
>She waves a hand across the mud
>”This place, Lima, is my egg laying chamber. The mud is primordial and rich with nutrients, the temperature is perfect, there is no beating sun, and above all this place is secure from any attack. There is a room like this one below every temple of mine.”
>”Egg laying chamber? But Ahlimon as far as I know you’ve never laid any eggs.”
>She shakes her head
>”Not quite true. A long time ago, well before your people were even a flicker in the eye of fate gods and goddesses were allowed to mate with one another freely. We all had our own little god like sons and daughters roaming the earthly planes, fulfilling their own agendas and seeking fame, fortune, war, power, pleasure, or whatever it is their hearts desired.”
>”But why no longer?”
>”It was chaos! Empires were toppled, civilizations were ended, we lost entire continents. The highest order of gods, the ones that think themselves too enlightened to take physical forms, nearly wiped the entire planet free of life and started over. Thankfully we could all come to an agreement before that happened though. The agreement was simple, as long as there were no more little demigods roaming around causing trouble for everyone else then things could continue as they were. And so we all agreed to never have children again.”
>”But if you mate with me then that would be breaking the agreement, right?”
>A mischievous grins grows on her snout
>”Not technically. The agreement only covers children from two godly parents. And you, Lima, are not godly. Not godly at all. I suppose in some interpretations of the agreement it could cover any children from a godly being but you know what? Desperate times require desperate measures. If I have to bend the rules a little bit to keep my followership going then so be it!”
>”But our children, would they be powerful as the children from two god like beings or something else?”
>She shrugs
>”No idea, I’ve never mated with a human before. Now remove your clothing Lima, I’m getting a clutch of eggs from you one way or another. I need worshippers and I don’t care if I have to make them myself!”
>I remove my simple robe with utmost urgency
>Ahlimon places her headdress on the ground then undoes her metallic bra, the two golden domes falling to the floor as her plump breasts hang free
>She undoes the lace holding her skirt on and it crumples to the ground, her bare crotch now visible
>Now only dressed in her necklace and bracelets I take in her naked form
>Her breasts are each tipped in a wide jutting nipple and her womanhood lay hidden in between two trunk like legs
>”Surprised mortal? There is a reason fertility is one of the blessings I can grant, you know.”
>Her voice brings me out of a lustful stupor
>”I-I’ve never seen a more perfect body, my goddess. You are truly worthy of your titles.”
>”I know.”
>She moves to the center of the muddy floor and lays down, spreading her legs wide open and beckoning me over with a claw
>”Come, service your goddess like the good little servant you are. Give me faith in what remains of my followership.”
>”As you command!”
>I move to between her legs and look down at her crotch
>It’s subtle, but there is a slit right where it ought to be, the edges of it are almost pinkish in color and puff out slightly
>I move a hand to it and gently part her opening, strands of her essence sticking to the lips of her womanhood
>Though I must admit I'm slightly confused when I see nothing below it, just one hole?
>Seeing my confusion Ahlimon speaks up
>”Have you ever tried to fornicate with a crocodile Lima?”
>”…no…should I have?”
>She laughs
>”Probably not. I once had a follower a couple hundred years back that did though, lost an arm in the process but I made sure he lived. The bravery required in dealing with my feral cousins like that ought to be rewarded. I even named a piece of land after him. Sometimes I miss good old Floridahm. That’s all besides the point though. What you don’t know is that crocodiles only have one hole for all their bodily needs and I’m not built any differently. I suppose I am cleaner than them though, considering the only purpose that hole serves for me is self-pleasure and egg laying. Benefits of being a divine being.”
>”Fair enough.”
>”Yes. Now serve your supreme goddess by giving her a clutch of eggs. I refuse to allow my followership to die with you.”
>Not wanting to keep her waiting I move between her legs and line up my cock with her entrance, slipping it between her folds with a quiet gasp
>She’s warm inside, almost too warm
>I thrust my full length inside of the scaly goddess and am overcome with an insatiable lust for her
>To mate with your own chosen holy power, what better fate could there possibly be?
>I begin pistoning in and out of her scaly velvet, her juices mixing with mine as her entrance becomes drenched in our combined love
>I continue assaulting her gates like a madman, each thrust sending waves of pleasure through my body and into my brain
>I'm not sure how long I last, but eventually I feel that familiar tingle down below and soon burst into her waiting womb, ending with a few more staunch bucks into her pelvis as I come down
>Exhausted, I lay across her belly panting
>But she isn’t done yet
>”I expect more from you Lima. Again.”
>”But I’m all out. I need a minute.”
>”And keep me from laying my clutch a moment longer? I think not!”
>With a single snap of her fingers my cock springs to life and my body is once again filled with an incredible lust for that scaly mistress
>I feel a hand on my butt push me forward into her and I get the message, once again resuming the familiar back and forth
>It takes longer but I’m once again throwing my seed all over her egg maker
>I lean on her belly exhausted and
>*Snap!*
>I’m once again filled with an incredible motivation to please my goddess’s lustful desires
>I cum and-
>*Snap!*
>I cum again and-
>*Snap!*
>I cum once more and-
>*Snap!*
>I cum one more time
>I lay panting on her soft belly, balls utterly drained and dick rubbed raw
>”Ahlimon…please…I'm spent for today.”
>She stares at me with those slit pupils of hers, her breathing a little faster than normal
>”No. One more time.”
>”Ahlimon please, the dick and spirit are willing but the rest of my body is spongy and bruised.”
>”Fine then you fleshy little lightweight, if I have to squeeze the last drops from you with my own motions then so be it.”
>She gets up off the floor and pushes me to the ground, I land on my back as she towers over me
>With another snap of her fingers my cock is proudly pointing towards the ceiling
>She places her feet on either side of my waist and slowly lowers herself downward
>I fear that a being of her size may crush my fragile body, yet as her pelvis weighs down on mine I sink into the mud and in the process spare my poor body further harm
>Once fully hilted she begins gyrating her hips back and forth, rubbing my cock across every inch of her wet folds
>Her hands grip my midsection and her claws dig into my skin as she continues her gyrations, the sounds of lovemaking filling the small room
>Eventually my poor cock and balls do their job one final time and she releases her grip
>”That’s enough for today. If you didn’t fully fertilize me in this session then we’ll have all of tomorrow to continue. I am laying some eggs in the future and if they don’t all hatch I’ll be very disappointed in you Lima.”
>”I…did my best.” I say, panting
>”And shouldn’t such effort to please one’s spiritual superior be rewarded?”
>She gets up and sets me by a wall before walking over to the water, cupping some in her hand before returning to me
>”Here, drink.”
>I lean my head forward and drink the sparkling blue water in her hand
>It tastes sweet, like a juice
>Instantly I feel less fatigued and a healing warmth build in my chest, dick is still sore though
>Ahlimon sits beside me and wraps a heavy arm around my shoulders
>”In a few thousand years mortals will be calling that flavor cool blue.”
>”What?”
>”Nothing. Now I suppose this makes up for your pitiful offering to me this morning Lima. Give me a growing followership and you can consider your daily offering for the next hundred years fulfilled.”
>”Thanks.”
>”But still, you must be punished.”
>My eyes go wide
>”Punished? For what?”
>”For spilling your pitiful offering while bringing it to me. Don’t think I didn’t hear that.”
>”And what punishment did you have in mind?”
>Ahlimon leans in, a devious smile on her maw
>”Don’t tell me you thought goddesses only have sex for the sole purpose of procreation. There all sorts of ways you can please me besides knocking my eggs over with your sausage. All sorts of ways. A crocodile learns a thing or two over the years.”
>”I will serve you in whatever way you most desire, my goddess.”
>”I expected nothing more from you. However, given the new duties you’ll be filling I do see fit to give you a change in title.”
>”And what will that be?”
>”It’s one I haven’t used in a long, long time. It comes with an upgrade in rank as well, it would put you above even the most senior servants if we had any left. A fitting reward for my devoted, squishy, virile, little concubine.”

>she chuckles a bit, and begins observing you from head to toe
>"Nah, nah, i've got a different kind of hunger."

>The anthro girl comes from a rich family and has abandonment issues, her parents just gave her things but were emotionally distant/negligent
>Going from that, grooming Anon into a mate/dependent friend would be not just about horny, but having someone close it her life
>The last person that she saw going full depressed hikki was her brother/best friend that end up killing himself, she still feels guilty and think was her fault

>Ryth was in a sour mood when traveling the high road from Tappahannock to the northern province of Lytria. It was a barbarous place but he needed to cross through it. Lytria was home mostly to a porcine race of snort-snouts whose women were as unsightly as the animals they took after.
>Not only was the sun high and bright, but he had no steed, and no one to carry his equipment. It was light and ordinary, fitting for his status as a knight-errant, but not meant to be traveled in so roughly.
>While cursing his boots and the sun and the itch on his inner thigh he crossed paths with a massive swine. The boarwoman was with her attendant in tow; she had a portly tummy and heavy, giant tits like a hag. She rode atop a horse that looked like it struggled to bear her weight but had not the voice to complain. Her ratling attendant looked similarly displeased. A general look of desperation fell over the lithe male's features as he hauled some of her baggage.
>"You, there, take pause," the 'woman' - if she could be called that - said. Her voice was deep and husky. Her snout was faintly wet in a displeasing way, and long, chipped tusks jutted from her grumpy muzzle.
>So, Ryth paused but made his irritation very plain in his tone and expression. "I've a long way to travel. And not much time or energy."
>"What is your heading?"
>"That is my business," Ryth held his hand to his sword's hilt and stood upright. He had no desire to be shaken down or interrogated by this she-beast.
>"Is something the matter?" Her voice betrayed no concern or thoughtfulness to Ryth's condition, but her words spoke to some small reservation or perhaps offense.
>"The matter is I would rather bake in the sun in mail than converse with a hideous hag of your caliber. Move aside, loop-tail, before you disgrace yourself further."
>Ryth smirked. Dumb hogs. They looked tough but they weren't anything to worry about. Most especially the females. They had a reputation for being incredibly whorish - amusing, as among most races it was shameful to admit you'd laid with a sow. Ryth had often shuddered at the thought when companions would joke about it at the tavern.
>There was always one though, that leaned into it. Either claiming they had, or they would. The shameless sort. For some reason, as he watched her descend from her saddle he thought not about why she was doing so, but that tall tale he'd heard.
>A story of a great, thick sow's ass threatening to snap his friend's pelvis with its eagerness. A happy trail of rich, tangled, dark hair that ran from his conquest's cunt to her belly button. Sweat. Hair. Squealing sounds. And a slot that felt loose and sloppy.
>He always fell quiet during talks like that. Despite being a handsome lad he'd not actually experienced the pleasure of a woman, of any form. His pretty blonde hair, sharp features, and skill as a warrior made him quite attractive. He just shied from loose female advances. A man should preserve himself for his wife, he thought. And he resolved to have his first experience with a woman on his wedding night.
>Ryth blushed as he realized he'd been eyeing the swine's ass. It was rotund, thicker than any wolfess and most certainly any human female he'd seen. But with her having a face like a pool of vomit he didn't admire long.
>What faint smile he held faded when he realized she was nearly a head over him. Wide as a barrel and looking just as sturdy. She may have had a belly, but her arms were cut with muscles. His breath caught in his throat at the smoldering expression she gave him.
>"Apologize for your insulting words or I will be forced to seek satisfaction."
>He scoffed, "Satisfaction? Please. Dueling is outlawed." He spat on the ground.
>"Not in Lytria."
>"Well, I am not a citizen of Lytria, and you won't coerce me into an apology for pointing out the truth." He pointed at her and turned up his nose, brushing a bit of his blonde hair from his eyes.
>"But I am a citizen of Lytria and that is the only requirement. Servant!" She snapped at her page. The ratling scurried over. "Inform him."
>The deranged, exhausted-looking ratling adjusted the sacks on his back and croaked out an introduction, bowing low before the snortsnout that was his liege.
>"Announcing, Seraphina Velomouth, Baroness of Slopespine, champion, and veteran of the Second Gnoll uprising, accomplished duelist and advisor to King Greyam of Lytria."
>Ryth's mouth hung open. What a mendacious claim! A baroness would not be dressed in such simple garments as this porker was. Her clothes were cheaper than his own. This must have been a bluff or something!
>"Felip, my armor," She said softly, the barest hint of femininity in her voice. Felip the ratling was on it at once, producing her equipment from his bags. She exhaled roughly at Ryth. "You will be given a lesson in respect, boy."
>Ryth wasn't sure what to say at all, he wanted to tell her to wait, to give pause to all this. But, Felip was already adorning her with armor. From hoof to head, and he was fast about it. Ryth couldn't help but notice the damp patches of sweat, under her arms, breasts, butt, and tummy, that were soaked to her clothing. All concealed now by heavy dark iron plate.
>"We fight to first blood. In Lytria, you must declare your prize before the duel begins."
>"M-my prize?" Ryth took a backfoot and was bewildered. "Must we duel?"
>"We must. If you leave here and tell of how you insulted a Baroness of Lytria without punishment we would lose face. I would lose face."
>It was almost amusing, with how brutish her face was, perhaps losing it would be a benefit. A beauty mark blemished her upper lip in a mockery of her femininity.
>"My life?"
>She rolled her eyes. "I won’t kill you, you scoundrel. You'll be awarded a purse of one hundred gold coins."
>Felip piped up, "And your prize for the record, ma'am?" His previous tiredness seemed to have faded now that he was free of her gear, and he tottered from paw to paw.
>The squealer looked to her squire and then back to Ryth with a burning intensity to her brown eyes. "Your seed."
>"My what!" Ryth blithered, with the threat of death having just been removed, he sighed in relief, but the confusion of her demand hit him. "I don't understand."
>"You will once you lose." The oinker placed her helmet around her and shut closed the visor. A welcome reprieve from looking at her ugly face. His eyes drifted to the brutal, long bardiche she wielded—an advantage in height and in reach.
>Ryth drew his blade and slung his shield off his back and fell into a fighting stance. He was young, but he'd faced many foes on the battlefield taller than him. And wider. And male! Women, almost universally across the races, were weaker. It was the natural order of things!
>Coping, self-soothing thoughts that did a little to help the fear shaking his knees. Seed. Seed meant semen, right? What was she going to—
>Seraphina charged into him, head down, crashing into him and throwing him to the floor. The immense strength in her body and legs lifted him up a solid foot and then sent him ass first into the earth.
>She swiftly knocked aside what meager defense Ryth mounted from the floor, digging the bardiche's tip to his neck, right under the chin, digging into it.
>"Submit."
>Ryth had no choice, with the wind knocked out of him, and his head pounding, he had no recourse. He nodded his head slowly, cursing himself for being so prideful. He felt a small knick, she'd poked the skin and drawn blood.
>"I see blood, ma'am! Congratulations, another success!" Felip called Ryth despite the pressing circumstance noticed he was awkwardly knock-kneed and slightly hunched over
>She smiled and it was just as unsightly as her grimace. She lifted Ryth with the same difficulty he did a leaflet of paper. Held in her grasp single-handed, he could only drag his boots to the soil as he was moved
>The uncooked slab of bacon reeked of warm sweat and a strange tang Ryth was too unfamiliar with to recognize. It was notes of arousal he'd soon come to understand. He was dragged to the side of the road, just passed the treeline. Out of sight and mercifully in the shade. It was easily several degrees cooler under the sturdy boughs of the oaks around them
>He was unceremoniously thrust against a tree, back to the bark. When he caught himself, he rasped up at her, "What are you doing? Will you kill me?"
>Both she and Felip began laughing, cackling. "No," she answered. "Now, silence."
>Felip brought her mount around and laced it to a suitable posting, and then he began helping Seraphina to disrobe. With each layer, Ryth's fear grew alongside her joy. In no time at all the great sow was in but her tunic and trousers.
>She drew up her top slowly, revealing her brownish-red and thin fur and a set of perspiration-damp chest bindings. Ryth regarded Felip, looking at anything but the slavering mouth of the tusked terror before him. He was treated with an absolutely abhorrent display from the ratling - the squire was desperately clutching between his legs as he watched his lady disrobe
>A rough, leathery, dirt-covered hand grabbed Ryth's clean mug and forced it to look at her. The intensity in her lust-struck eyes was all he needed to know not to look away. She let the strip of cloth fall, tugging between her breasts with her thumb to loosen it.
>Ryth's first sight of a pair of tits, and it was in this situation. Grim. But, despite himself, his mouth went dry. So, that's how they looked? Big was a simplistic way to put it. The boar-bitch had a mother's figure when it came to her chest. Thick pink nipples sat semi-obscured by fur and gave a hint to piebald skin that lay underneath all her moisture-laden fur.
>Ryth pulled his eyes from the sight just to notice her yank off a thin silver chain with a key on the end, which she tossed to Felip.
>The ratling gasped and made a noise so joyful Ryth thought he'd begin crying. "Really?" the squire asked.
>Seraphina snorted, the hot breath washing over Ryth's face. She nodded, but without breaking eye contact with her small human prize.
>She grasped the back of his neck and without warning, shoved her tongue down his mouth by force. Her rough tusks brushed his cheeks and threatened his eyes. He made a mournful sound as her wide and textured tongue coiled around his. Ryth put his hands out, sinking into her stomach and hips, trying to push her off. This only emboldened his assailant!
>She moaned into his mouth with such force it rumbled his throat. He gagged on it, his eyes wincing shut when they weren’t looking up at her with desperation. Her wet snout sniffed at his face and tapped him as she moved side to side. Deaf ears were the audience for his pleas, as he woefully realized his first kiss was stolen by this old boar.
>She humped against his body with a crushing force, thrusting up against him. Shamefully, his cock was roused by the incessant rubbing of her knee. She pulled her face back with a gasp.
>"Your mouth tastes splendid." Her husky voice produced a shiver in him.
>She pulled back only enough to tear down his trousers to his knees, her large hands fumbling with his belt as her tongue licked behind his ear, and rolled around his neck. She took great pains to pull it off him as much as she could. He felt alight with shame at being exposed and even worse, visibly aroused.
>It wasn't helped by the fact that the page was watching and slowly masturbating on his knees. Ryth didn’t notice him release himself, but Felip was normally kept strictly chaste. Rare was it that Seraphina gave him the key to his cock cage.
>"Now look at that. I bet human women love it." Her tongue dragged across the palm of one of her hands, making a show of lubricating her palm to him. She grasped his cock with her calloused hand and stroked. It caused him to lurch forward to try and prevent it - but she locked him down with a forceful knock of her forearm to his chest, holding him against the tree.
>His dick was an average, modest length, but it was dwarfed by her hand and her size. The wet, but rough handjob was far more intense than Ryth's body expected. The conflicting shame threatening to boil over and expel itself as a muttering plea for her to stop was held at bay by an undeniable arousal.
>He looked at her tits with a sullen, but lusty gaze. When Seraphina detected his arousal in the jumping pulse of the cock in her hand she let go. He bit his lip in anger at himself for the thrust forward his body made him do.
>"Pull down my clothes."
>He only had a second's hesitation before his hands moved down her hips and by her belt, trying and failing to remove her buckle and pants. “Nevermind, novice.” She exhaled harshly, slapping his hands away before dropping trow and her simple cloth panties.
>He shook with nerves trying not to look, but it wasn't Seraphina's hand that forced his attention to her now exposed cunt, it was his own burning curiosity. He looked down from the dark, black, tapering line of hair that ran from her belly button down to the object of many men's desires.
>Puffy, soaking wet so bad he could see it on the labia, tucked tightly between a pair of thighs that could crush his bones. Instinctively his shaft throbbed and head swelled, drooling a web of pre that dangled and caught to her fur. The heat radiating off it made his resolve wilt.
>Was it like the stories? Was she going to fuck him? He couldn't allow it. No, what about his future bride? He wanted to cry, not this way, not with that. But his body felt different. His body demanded he fulfill his biological imperative. After all, a willing female was dangling her cunt above his shaft.
>She waited not for his approval, nor needed it. After giving him a good look at her pussy, proud at how conflicted she'd made him, she hoisted him up. He made a pathetic little sound as he was positioned like a slut, his legs forced nearly all the way to the sides of his head. Muscles he didn't even know he had were stretched and strained as she locked him into an Amazonian position against the tree.
>He couldn't look down, he couldn't see it, what with her heavy and sweaty body pressing up against him. But he could feel it. Heavenly. At least, that's what his cock thought. The rest of him crawled with a chill of disgust. Something incredibly wet and warm, and terribly loose, slid up and down his shaft.
>It felt so amazing his skin tingled. It felt so horrible he moaned in distress. He felt so tiny compared to her, physically and the length of his dick. But she didn't seem to mind, in fact after just a few moments she was squealing like a whore. A low, heady whine of lust rolled from the forest as the baroness raped the virginity from her defeated foe.
>She didn't say it, but she was surprised he didn't blow his load in seconds. This was a treat, feeling his soft, smooth, straight rod drive right into her g-spot. Her drenched, sloppy, sweaty cunt slammed down so hard on Ryth's pelvis that the day after he'd wake with bruising.
>And all the while he was being held up by his back and butt, using the tree as a support. His hands swapped between grasping at the bark and pathetically pushing at her chest in a frail attempt at slowing or stopping this. Half-made words of begging croaked from his throat.
>Suddenly, some wonderful feeling began riding up his dick. He felt himself tense up. The only thing that was keeping his orgasm back was the steady feeling of distress and disgust at her form. But that was nothing against the repeated assault on his nethers.
>It was over anyway, wasn't it? He'd had his virginity roughly fucked from him, in the woods, by a filthy loop-tail. It was when he realized he'd be the laughingstock of all his mates if they ever learned of this that his strength was entirely drained. He offered no defense, no struggle, as he was tongue-tied forcibly, again.
>His orgasm was telegraphed but still, the moment he tipped over the edge struck him with the same surprise Seraphina's assault did. He couldn't deny it, the feeling of pleasure and relief that overcame his entire form as his balls emptied themselves into the gaped pigpussy.
>None of his rare masturbation sessions, or his wildest fantasies or guesses, prepared him for the feeling of cumming raw into a cunt. The absolute depravity of letting a sow take him only seemed to intensify the feeling. He had no control to counter-thrust back at her weighty body, but even so, he thrashed in her grasp.
>He moaned into her mouth and she squealed, constant reminders of just who was abusing him. But, his cumming wasn't the end, she wasn't done yet. She stopped her fucking and forced his dick to hilt her fully. His sore penis throbbed and twitched with twinges of discomfort at the overstimulation. She stuck her hand to her clit and rubbed, each rotating movement brushing her knuckles to his tummy and making her pussy clench. A slick, short hiss sounded out her orgasm, and he felt his thighs get soaked.
>With as much ceremony as she'd defeated him the baroness dropped her toy to the damp grass below the tree. She dressed, watching him idly as Ryth sheepishly collected himself. She was plenty satisfied.
>“Enjoy your sojourn in Lytria,” she said mockingly, before leaving.
>Ryth noticed after the pair had left that the ratling had spilled his seed to the ground while watching the ravishing he endured. That only made him feel more filthy. He reeked of boar pussy, soaked with it, skin and clothes.
>Worst of all. After he finally had legs enough to stand and walk back to the road, his tool was still thrumming and tingling with pleasure. It was the best orgasm of his life and a shameful fap for many nights in the future.

>"Easy there tiger. I want something from you first."
>you tug against her grip, but find it stronger than you can escape
>"I want your name."
>you frown and shake your head
"That wasn't the deal. We agreed no names."
>the ferret just snickers again
>she pulls your wrist, bringing your hand closer to the fur on her neck
>"You also said we would only meet once, and only in public places. But here you are, come into my own home, just to get a touch of my fur for the fifth time."

>"Name."
>you groan
"And if I refuse?"

>"I'll let you go."

>"And then you'll have to go home, and never see me or my fur ever again."

>you gasp and hang your head
>this was supposed to be anonymous, no-strings-attached fur-appreciation
>but you're in too deep now
"It's Anon."
>the ferret squeaks happily
>and finally pulls your hand all the way down to sink into her luxurious fur
>you nearly lose site of it, her fluff is so thick and lively
>"A pleasure to meet you Anon, I'm Cari."
"Uh huh."
>you're too busy petting her fur to respond coherently
>you run your fingers through her fur, hand over hand, working your way down her neck
>it always manages to spring back up to its original position after your hand passes over it
>just as soft and silky the next time you feel it slipping through your fingers
>it's like a drug, you can't stop yourself from wanting more
>Cari makes soft clucking sounds and wriggles her body, turning so you reach new spots
>"That's it, keep going. Now do the ears..."
>you reach your hands up and take an ear in each one, scratching and rolling them gently
>she lets you work on her ears for a short while
>you're about to move down the back of her head and to her neck again when she springs her trap
>on your knees, with your arms reached up to pet Cari's ears, she can easily stretch her arms around you and pull you off balance
>you didn't even notice her moving
>must have snuck her arms up while you were focused on her ears
>but now you're focused on something else
>a world of pure soft silky fur that's engulfed your head almost entirely
>you hear Cari make that clucking sound in satisfaction as her
>you push against her, hands pressing all the way down through her fur to her warm body
>but she just keeps her long arms wrapped around your back and holds you tight
>"I dunno what the problem is. You like my fur, don't you?"
>you do like her fur
>you just don't like being ambushed with it
"Mmf."
>you grumble
>she just clucks and pats your head
>"Relax. Enjoy my fur. I'll put on some background noise and we can get a nice, long session in."
>how long is 'long', you wonder
>last time you spent a good half hour just stroking her fur
>now with a face full of it, you think you could spend at least a couple hours like this
>you let yourself relax, stopping your struggle to go back to petting her fur
>her arm around your back loosens enough for you to pick up your head
>but you just turn aside so you can see out of her fluff with one eye
>and breath
>breathing's important
>when you take a breath, it's full of warmth, and the gentle scent of Cari's fur
>you were told ferrets smelled bad, but you don't mind
>there's a musky scent, but it's mild and earthy
>along with a gentle peach smell to her fur
>you take a deep breath in
>"Like it? I take good care of my fur, high quality shampoo and condition, and a special moisturizer to keep it extra silky."
>you do like it
>feels like you're melting into pure heaven
>you wrap your arms around her and start to worm your fingers through the fur on her back
>making her cluck even more
>with your one free eye, you see exactly what background noise Cari's putting on
>a fantasy movie, another favorite of yours
>and by the look of it, the extended cut!
>it's hard to pay attention with one eye covered, so you try to adjust without disturbing Cari
>but she notices, and giggles
>"Trying to watch? Here, let me get you a better view."
>her paws reach under you and push you down until your head is down on her chest
>still engulfed in fur, but now both your eyes are free
>only now you're resting right on one of her breasts
>"There, better?"
>it is a better view
>and really it does make a better pillow
>the gentle motion of her chest rising and falling with her breath accentuating the utter relaxation she's trapped you in
>"Good."
>she rests a paw on your head once again and starts to scratch your scalp
>your eyelids droop as you watch the movie and idly rub her back
>you stay that way through the entirety of the movie
>passing in and out of a doze
>Cari too relaxes, content to hold you and stroke your hair like you do her fur
>finally, as the credits start to roll the ferret turned mattress stretches and lets out a long yawn
>"Mmh, that was amazing. Best session yet."
>then she grabs your shoulders and flips you
>tossing you off her chest and onto the mattress unceremoniously
>"Okay! We're done. I'll take you home now."
>you blink
>the sudden motion leaving you blearily confused
"Huh? We're done?"
>Cari nods
>"We are. That was fun, but since you don't want to make things more permanent, I don't really see the point of doing this anymore."
>you blink
>still flopped on your back, you stare up at Cari, who's sitting up once again
>she watches you with a smug grin
>"Or..."
>you sit up on your elbows
"Or?"
>the ferret spins about, twisting quickly to slam her paws down on the bed on either side of your head
>her fur sticking out giving her a more fierce look now that she's got you pinned to the bed
>she still wears that smug grin
>"Or you stop playing coy, admit you want to date me, and I'll drown you in my fluff every night."
>damn it
>she's got you
>literally got you trapped beneath her
>and figuratively got you with the threat of withholding her fur
>and yeah, she's real cute, and she has good taste in games and movies
>and music
>plus there was that time she bought you lunch before you spent an hour in the booth scritching her ears
>"Say it, Anon. Saaay it."
>this isn't what you wanted
>at least at first
>at first it was just some quick petting to satisfy your guilty desire for anthro fur
>that turned into longer petting sessions
>and try as you might, you can't deny Cari's a pretty cool ferret
>even this whole 'pin you down and drown you in fluff' thing is appealing
"Okay, fine, I--"
>Cari clucks
>then swings her head down and presses her snout against your face
>clucking wildly as she peppers your face with kisses and licks
>"Yes! Yes! Yes! I knew it! You fluff-huffing cuddle-slut! You can't resist!"
>she giggles and finishes with another cluck and kiss, then stretches her body all the way out to cover your face in her chest fur once again
"Cuddle-slut?"
>you ask indignantly through a mouthful of fur
>Cari giggles
>"Yep! Cuddle-slut! And now you can get it any time you want. Isn't that what you were after all along?"
>she has a point
>"And I can get what I've been after all along. Just in time for heat season..."
>you feel her paws slipping under your shirt, exposing more of your skin to the touch of her fur
>and she starts rubbing up against you, clucking merrily and wrapping her legs around your waist
>you realize just exactly what you've agreed to
>dating Cari is gonna be more than cuddle sessions and nerd movies

>*THWACK*
>The impact to the side of your face sends your head reeling to one direction
>damn that hurts, the black bag over your head ensuring you don't even have the chance to brace yourself for the blows
>"Where is Site Zulu?" the gruff male voice asks you again
>this is how it's been for the entire past week
>after you were abducted coming home from work all that time ago
>you were walking alone in the cool evening light when a black van sped up next to you and squealed to a stop
>the armed men in balaclavas that hopped out greeted you with a rifle-butt to the stomach and an opaque cloth bag over your head
>you were then pulled in and whisked away, driving for untold hours to your new personal hell
>since then you've been stripped naked, beaten, waterboarded, and starved to the edge of madness at their compound
>all while they ask you questions about military code names and safe houses you've never heard of in your life
>every whimpered variation of "I don't know" you've given them rewards you with another fist
>a few days ago you even tried lying, giving bogus street names in a pathetic attempt to ward off the blows
>it actually worked for all of 30 minutes before they discovered your game
>then they started pulling fingernails
>so you went back to sobbed declarations of ignorance and pleas for mercy that never came
>the tips of your fingers still throbbed in pain, the sensitive skin underneath the nail still exposed to open air
>"We KNOW about your connection to seditious agents, you are doing yourself no favors lying to us." the voice speaks again, pulling you out of the short reprieve of memory
>you can only reply that you had connections to a lot of people, you worked in customer service after all
>the next pistol whip hurts a little bit less, since you expected it for your snark
>you were reaching the end of your rope, about to break and have no meaningful information to show for it anyway
>you hear the chambering of a round as the slide is pulled back on an unseen gun
>while you don't see it, you definitely feel it pressed into your forehead
>"I am getting sick of your blubbering, trash. This is the last time I will ask, Where. Is. Site. Zulu?"
>You slowly exhale and close your eyes, trying to savor your final moments
>your breath is ragged and excessive sweat runs down your bare skin, somewhere in the distance you hear the sound of a helicopter flying across the dark sky...
>at least the interrogation room is swanky if your brief glimpse of it was anything to go by
>with fine plush carpeting you can feel under your feet and a huge multi-pane skylight showing off the ethereal starry night
>you smirk slightly at the thought of your captor and surrounding guards having to clean your blood and brain matter out of such a refined room
>"Go fuck yourself" is all you reply, finally having reached your limit
>"what a shame, it would've been fun to keep you around to hear you squeal some more" the voice replies
>you feel the barrel of the gun shift as pressure is slowly applied to the trigger, and you take a deep breath
>*thwip*
>you hear the slight sound of something whipping through the air, and a slight fleshy impact
>you feel the sensation of a liquid being sprayed across your exposed skin, and then feel the gun against your head be taken away
>a soft thump sounds from in front of you as something large hits the floor
>a brief moment of silence passes, then from across the room a shout rings out
>"FUCK, FIND COVER! AMBU-"
>*thwip*
>another sound of something large hitting the ground
>you are nearly deafened by the sudden sound of gunfire exploding around you
>you see bright flashes of light from behind the bag on your head as the handful of guards in the room open fire at something
>you flinch at every bullet's report and try to make yourself as small as possible
>*CRASH*
>a thunderous sound is heard right above your head and you are suddenly pelted with tiny shards of glass
>the helicopter sound is much louder now
>your vision goes almost fully white as a luminous spotlight is shined onto you from above
>the room is in pandemonium, the noisy rotor of the helicopter occasionally covered by the ear-piercing clap of gunfire
>you rock back and forth in the flimsy metal chair you are tied too
>eventually you manage to knock yourself onto your side
>a few loose shards of glass from the skylight cut into your skin as you hunker down as much as you can in your new position
>one by one, the reports of gunfire nearest to you begin to die out, replaces by shouts and gurgling screams cut short
>you cower on the ground, cold air from the now open skylight seeping in and bringing a chill to you
>the only sound you hear for a few moments is the helicopter idling above
>and then you hear a soft flopping noise as multiple objects land in a circular perimeter around you
>followed by the leathery sound of rappelling
>there are multiple crisp crunching noises as several pairs of boots meet the broken glass on the ground
>"Viper-2, Cover that door. Viper-3, make sure these bastards are dead. I'm on target" you hear a level feminine voice sound off as soon as they are on the ground
>you hear the shuffling of multiple pairs of feet move to coordinated positions around the room
>you tremble in the cold open air, adrenaline still flowing through your system
>you're unsure what to do, whether to call out for help or re-prepare yourself for a bullet to the brain
>thankfully you don't have to think on it too long, as you hear a trail of glass crunch underfoot, approaching you
>the footsteps stop just underneath your butt, from your new position lying on your side
>you give a mild grunt as you're quickly heaved upright again by a set of unseen hands
>you feel them swiftly brush any loose shards of glass off your sweat covered body
>and then the bag is yanked up over your face
>you jump a little at the sight that greets you, as your eyes adjust in the dim electric light
>decked out in tactical gear and a rifle of unknown make, an anthro of about average height, maybe slightly smaller than you if you weren't sitting. leans over you
>they wear the skull of some animal strapped to their face, it's dark empty eyes leering at you
>at the sides of their head a pair of pointy black ears swivel about, listening for any sound covered by the hum of the helicopter rotors
>and a long black feline tail sways lazily back and forth behind them
>they stare blankly at you for a second
>"Anon" you hear the same emotionless female voice come from behind the intimidating mask
>you are unsure if they are asking your name or making a statement
>having been tortured for a week straight, and still trying to recover from the impromptu fire fight you were just in the middle of, you give the only response that pops to the forefront of your mind
>"who the hell are yo-"
>you're cut off as the bag is swiftly pulled back over your face
>"H-hey!" you protest
>"Quiet." is the only response you get as the anthro pulls away
>you hear them rifling through some equipment before they find what they are looking for
>once again you feel them lean over you as they begin strapping you into some kind of harness
>after a few moments filled with the various zips and clicks of multiple belts and gear loops, you are securely strapped even more tightly to the chair below you
>you feel the rough texture of durable fabric running down your shoulders, underneath your arms, and across your chest
>"send it" you hear the anthro say, to no one in particular
>a second later another rope comes down directly above you
>you hear another click as it is taken in hand and secured behind you with a sturdy clip
>and then suddenly the weight of a pair of legs coming down over your shoulders as someone climbs onto your back
>"Hey! what are yo-" you begin only to be interrupted
>"Hush." the anthro repeats firmly, slightly squeezing your neck with her thighs
>she adjusts herself slightly, wiggling on your shoulders you feel her scoot up until her pelvis meets the back of your head
>"Raven-1, this is ground team. HVT is secured, take us away" you hear her state clearly
>then you begin to rise upwards
>"give em' hell" you hear her say to her squad as you're lifted up
>up towards the blinding spotlight above you
>up through the destroyed skylight
>up into the freezing midnight air
>and then you begin to sway as the helicopter begins it's horizontal movement
>into the night sky and off to destinations unknown....

>Anthrostate except it's realistic bureaucracy
>Anon is instead assigned to a rich elder anthro lady who bought his rights
>His landlord who ratted him out gets sent to the gulag for resisting his arrest when she found out
>Her final words were "THIS ISN'T ADHG! I AM THE MAIN CHARACTER! I WILL NOT BE NTR'D!"
>Anon spends the rest of his days being the rich anthro's sexual toy and occasionally cleaning her pool

>be me
>walking home from the bus stop
>it's late, probably should've driven to my brother's house instead of taking public transport but fuck driving in this city
>hear some noise in an alley
>look inside
>can barely see two pinpricks in the dark
>turn on the flashlight on my phone
>the eyesockets are sunk deep into the skull - deeper than seems possible, as though it's a mask
>but the eyes themselves bulge hideously, aa though full of a desperate hunger for the world
>the snout is long and flat, with no discernable lips
>instead, all you can see are gums and needle-like teeth
>so many teeth
>stretching up and up and up its face
>curling up in a rictus grin
>four feet from your face, in the shadow of the alley
>you drop your phone, cracking it on the ground, and let out a strangled-half cry
>a laughter that sounds like a strangled man is carried on breath that smells like brimstone
>it's fucking jenny, your neighbor, taking out the trash

>ywn have a punk trash gf who forced you to loosen up
>ywn get taken joyriding on a "borrowed" motorcycle
>ywn be forced to cling tight to her because you're so scared of falling off
>ywn be taken to the outskirts of town to stare up at the stars together and talk about future plans to ride all over the country
>ywn kiss her under the full moon
>ywn immediately get tackled to the ground as she loses control at the first bold move you make
>ywn make love until sun up

>It’s over
>Society has collapsed
>Human society, specifically
>It seems everywhere go, you can’t walk two feet without seeing something about HMAF
>The streets?
>Absolutely flooded with degens parading around their anthro girlfriends
>The news?
>Swamped with fluff pieces about ‘muh epic wholesome HMAF relationshiperinos!”
>Politics?
>Full of (((pundits))) giving anthros even more rights that they don’t deserve
>The media?
>It’s probably the worst there
>It seems like every week, a new anthro-pandering piece of humieslop is shat out in theaters, on TV, in game stores, you name it
>And established franchises?
>Either they get rebooted and replace most of the human cast with anthros, or introduce some anthro Mary Sue who shows up all the humans
>The world of advertising is just as bad, if not worse
>Half of the ads you see aren’t even about the actual product, they just feature a human and anthro kissing
>Humans are almost completely phased out of modeling ads, it’s just anthros showing off their hideous bodies
>And you thought it was bad enough in the days when everyone just celebrated one consolidated Anthro Pride month
>But apparently, that wasn’t good enough for those freaks, so now every major subgroup of anthro gets their own month
>Canine History Month, Feline Celebration Month, Reptile Heritage Month, et cetera
>So now, social media is constantly changing with flags for whatever retarded anthro-narcissism month
>It never ends
>All of this would be bad enough
>But they’ve gone after your hobbies too
>All of the video games are buggy messes full of ugly anthros for the sake of “diversity”
>The latest edition of Casters & Cockatrices added in a bunch of anthro species just so they can roleplay (because apparently, they can’t just roleplay as a kobold or whatever)
>And just last week, they killed off Gamma Man and replaced him with Spunky Teenage Tigress Girl #43838282349
>How did it get so bad?
>Just ten years ago, most of this stuff was by humans, for humans
>Sure, there was an anthro here and there, but nothing unbearable
>Then, Crumblr gets popular, and now suddenly, it seems that (((They))) want nothing more than to erase the human identity and subvert anything and everything with a human protagonist
>The only place you can truly vent your frustrations is 4chen
>Or, at least, it was
>But it seems even they have fallen victim to the anthro brainrot
>Literally every other thread on every board is some variation of

>Reminder that this is a wolfGOD board, yeenfags gtfo

>Any media board is full of fags lusting over said media’s ‘sexiest’ anthro holes
>Any hobby board full of fags bragging about doing their hobby with their ‘waifur’
>And the porn boards? Forget it
>Anthro city, all day long
>Disturbingly, the number of people speaking against this totally natural and organic phenomenon dwindles every day
>You write a long effortpost about how disgusting HMAF is
>About how anyone who does it is a species traitor who should die in a gas chamber
>And finally, you tell them about how when you meet your gigabased tradcath human housewife, you’ll have beautiful, intelligent human babies, while they’ll be stuck with fat, ugly, post-wall anthro roasties, and dozens of obnoxious, stupid anthro spawn
>To cap it all off, you post the thread with a meme depicting species traitors and their whore anthros as basedjaks, and you as the chad
>You hit post, feeling a smug sense of victory wash over you, knowing you totally btfo all the HMAFags on the board

>Tomorrow, the enlightened human male takes a stand once and for all, consequences be damned…

>You stand in front of your local UltiMart, holding a cardboard sign high above your head
>It’s a simple piece from a cardboard box, the words HUMAN + ANTHRO = DEATH
>You rotate it and wave it around
>”HUMANKIND, TAKE A STAND! DON’T LET ANTHROS OUTBREED MAN!”
>You smirk a little at your little slogan
>You stand there shouting for about five minutes before you finally see other people
>Well, another person and an anthro
>He’s with this huge, gray rabbit
>Seriously, she’s enormous
>You thought were supposed to be small and docile
>Not only was she the furthest thing from small, but she was also giving you probably the iciest stare you’ve ever seen
>The ground practically shook as she stepped toward you, and for a second, you’re worried she might do something drastic
>But before she does, the man with her grabbed her mighty paw
>”Don’t, Kay. He’s not worth it.”
>”B-but he-”
>”I know. He’s just a loser. Let him be mad.”
>She gives a huff before they both turn to walk away
>”Yeah, that’s right, you better run, you fu-”
>She silences with another quick glare
>They keep walking until eventually, they’re out of sight completely
>Great
>Already, you come face-to-face with a species traitor and his oversized anthro mistress
>Seriously, how does sex between those two work?
>Actually, you don’t want to know
>While you’re still reeling from that encounter, a sudden honk of a car horn makes you jump
>You turn around to see a cherry red convertible with three anthros waving you over
>A shark, a calico, and a poodle
>They’re dressed in swimsuits, listening to some generic popslop on the radio
>”Oi, mate,” the shark hollers, “what’s a handsome guy like hanging around here for? Why doncha hop in and relax on the beach with us for a while? Ice cream’ll be on yo- I mean, us.”
>”Oui, you look like you could use some sun too, monsieur.”
>You can’t believe it
>The audacity of these bitches, asking a proud human alpha male like you to the beach
>As if you needed more confirmation that anthro women are whores
>Enraged, you hold the sign up and wave it around so that they get the message clearly
>”FUCK OFF, ANTRHOID ROASTIES! MY SEED’S FOR A GENETICALLY PERFECT TRAD BASED HUMAN WIFE, NOT FOR PETTING ZOO REJECTS!”
>They all stare at you like your face just melted off
>”Genetically perfect… trad based… quoi?”
>”OMG, like, what’s this guy’s problem, Syd?”
>”Ah, pay him no mind, girls. He’ll drop the whole ‘human power’ schtick when he finally gets some anthro pussy. Come on, I think I heard that cute boy we messed around with a few weeks ago’s back in town.”
>They speed off, chattering about the boy she just mentioned
>You can’t believe your ears
>Are they serious?
>Do they really think you would abandon your strong convictions like that just because of some mediocre anthroid pussy?
>Either they’re even dumber than you first thought, or human male standards really have fallen that far
>”Hey!”
>You turn your head again, but that proves to be a mistake
>As soon as you do, a milkshake gets thrown right at your face
>You shake it out of your eyes to take a look at your assaulter
>It’s another plain-looking human, peering from a passenger’s window
>But what catches your attention is the one driving the car
>A rat bitch
>Ears and face pierced
>Hair dyed some obnoxious shade of green
>Even by anthro standards, this one was just repulsive
>Why any human would associate with that is far beyond you
>”Have sex, incel!” is all he says before they speed off
>You stand there, baffled, milkshake still running down your face and shirt
>What on earth could that guy see in something like that?
>Whatever, he’s just a worthless cuck anyway
>He probably did that to appease her
>He’s probably a giant ass kisser
>Just when you think things can’t get worse, someone taps you on the shoulder
>At this point, you should have probably learned to not turn your head anywhere, as it never leads anywhere good, but you do so anyway
>Fortunately, you’re not greeted by another milkshake, or any other type of assault
>Instead, it’s a worker of UltiMart
>A human male, mid-to-late twenties
>He looks at you with an uncomfortable expression
>”Um, sir? I’m afraid you can’t protest at the UltiMart. I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.”
>Finally
>A human male alone
>This could be your chance to finally get through to someone
>”You! Do you wanna save the human race?
>His mouth hangs open as he does a visible doubletake, at a loss for words
>”I… excuse me, what?”
>”Have you ever dreamed about having a human wife? You wouldn’t settle for an anthro, would you?”
>He stares at you like you’re speaking a foreign language
>I’m, uh… I’m not sure how that’s relevant, sir.”
>”It’s relevant to everything, you onions-guzzling cuck! We are literally being bred out of existence by anthros, and human males like you are doing absolutely nothing to combat them!”
>The confusion on his face washes away, replaced now with annoyance
>”Sir, if you won’t leave, I’m afraid I’ll have to call the police on you.”
>...
>Shit
>You can’t get thrown in prison
>You’ll be eaten alive (mostly by anthros, and possibly literally)
>So, sighing in defeat, you start to walk off
>”Fine! Just remember when our species are fully slaves to anthros, you could have done something to protect it!”
>
>The outcome is similar anywhere else you try
>You’re mocked, laughed at, assaulted, and eventually asked to leave the premises
>You seethe in anger
>All you wanna do is protect your species, and people treat you like some sort of troglydyte
>The brainwashing runs deeper than you thought
>You’re so angry that you don’t even notice the anthro eyeing you
>At least, not until she calls out to you
>”Yo! Human boy!”
>Oh no, not again
>Okay, it’s no big deal
>Act natural
>Don’t make eye contact
>Maybe she’s talking to some other human on this street
>”You, with the piece of cardboard! See any other humans around?”
>Fuck
>Alright, alright
>There’s no reason to panic
>Maybe if you ignore her, she’ll go away
>You try your best to keep your cool even as you sense her start to trail you closely
>”What’s a cutie like you walking alone on a street like this. It gets dangerous alone out here, y’know. You look like you could use someone big and strong by your side.”
>Your eye twitches, but you keep walking
>”Ever done it with a yeen, boy? I know you haven’t lately, I can’t smell any yeen on you. Let me tell ya, yeen pussy is the best. No human goes back after a taste of it”
>You’re gritting your teeth to the point they feel like they’ll shatter, but you still say nothing
>”You look kinda sweaty, y’know that? Have you been outside all day? Maybe you can chill at my place for a bit, kick your feet up, have something to drink, then maybe we could-”
>You can’t stand it anymore
>The indignity of having yet another filthy anthroid talk to you is too much to bear
>Your turn around, putting on the most intimidating face you can muster and hold the sign up
>”GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME, YOU ANTHRO WHORE! MY DICKS FOR HUMANS, NOT YOU NASTY-”
>You freeze as you get a good look at her
>Maybe if you knew just what kind of woman you were ranting against, you’d bite your tongue
>She’s a hyena, and built like a typical one too
>Spotted brown fur
>Bulging muscles
>Ridiculously tall
>All around, not someone to mess with lightly
>Outside of her characteristic hyena traits, her general fashion aesthetic isn’t the most approachable either
>From the bottom up, she wears expensive-looking white basketball shoes followed by black cargo jeans
>Covering her upper half is a sleeveless jean jacket over some obscure band T-shirt
>Her dark-brown hair is long swept to one side while the rest is shaved off, like those stupid haircuts for ‘strong independent women’ in modern media
>She has golden barbell earrings and gold nose ring, not as many piercings as the rat bitch from earlier, but still enough to be trashy in your opinion
>Her confused glance turned into a vexed grimace, showing off her huge, sharp teeth
>You know, the ones that evolved to grind bones into dust?
>This was probably not a good idea
>”The fuck you just say?”
>She roughly grabs you by the wrist
>You fail to sputter out any words in your nervous state
>You really hope you aren’t about to get killed
>She takes you inside one of the houses, presumably hers
>There’s not much there
>A couch, a tv, some chairs
>Pretty sparse for someone dressed like her
>She throws you onto the couch
>You reorientate yourself and see her staring down at you with a look of disgust
>”So, you think anthros are nasty, huh?”
>”W-well I-”
>Why is she taking of her jacket and shirt
>She’s not wearing a bra either
>Oh no
>Please please please don’t tell me this is going where you think this is going, you think
>She lifts one of her arms up
>”You want nasty? I’ll give you nasty! Come here!”
>You don’t have time to react as she grabs your head with her free hand and shoves you into her armpit
>You hold your breath
>”Come on, humie, take a whiff! You don’t wanna make me mad now, do you?”
>You really don’t
>You take a quick sniff and nearly gag
>You probably shouldn’t be too surprised, considering you’d heard about how smelly hyenas can get before
>But still, you’d never in a million years thought you’d get close enough to smell it, much less so close to the armpit
>”That’s it, boy, take it all in.”
>She smears your face all around it, making it even worse
>You take short, quick breaths, avoiding the smell as much as you can
>You almost feel like you’re about to lose consciousness as she finally lets you go
>You fall back on the couch, head throbbing from the pitfunk
>But the physical pain is nothing compared to the blow to the ego you just suffered
>Goddammit, you’re supposed to be a megabased trad alpha human male, and now a fucking yeen just humiliated you like this
>And the worst part is, it’s almost definitely not over yet
>”Oh, you didn’t like that? Maybe try this, then.”
>You watch her take off her socks and shoes
>Realizing what she’s planning, you spring to action, trying to get out of there
>But you don’t even leave the couch as she stomps her foot down right on your face, pinning you to the couch cushion
>If you thought the smell of her pits were bad, her feet are even worse
>Your eyes start watering as she drags her rubbery sole to and fro across your face
>Her toes grip at you skin, pulling parts of it and making it just that much more uncomfortable
>She eventually lifts her foot off of you, leaving your face red from both her rough rubbing and embarrassment
>She gives a sly smirk and put her wrists on her hips
>”How’s that? Nasty enough for you?”
>Fuck your pride
>You need to get out of here, now
>P-please… I’m sorry I was rude to you. Just let me go, and It’ll never happen again, I promise!”
>”Sorry? Now, how can you be sorry? We ain’t even got started yet.”
>She turns around and drops her pants to the floor
>Your eyes shoot open
>Oh no
>You heard all about it how hyenas secrete ‘paste’ from their asses to mark their territories
>And apparently, they smell terrible
>And now, she’s ready to mark you
>”NO,WAIT, PLEASE DON-”
>But it’s too late
>She brings her ass down on you like a 20-ton weight
>You struggle for a little bit before the smell fully hits you
>Dear god
>It’s several magnitudes worse than her armpits and feet combined
>Your nearly pass out then and there
>It’s seriously a contender for the worst thing you ever smelled
>It’s almost enough to make you forge the sheer weight on top of you
>She gyrates her hips, smearing the scent on you further
>You feel like you’re going to die
>Either from the lack of oxygen, or just getting your head crush
>Time loses all meaning as the only thing you feel anymore is yeen ass
>Just when you’re about to black out, she finally gets up
>You take a breath of sweet air, barely cognizant
>She kneels down next to you
>”Enjoy that, humie? That was my paste. Shower all you want, but that ain’t coming off of you for weeks. Now, anytime anyone smells you, they’ll know what you are: A hyena’s bitch.”
>Tears sting your eyes
>You’ve been humiliated
>Defeated
>”Hey, come on. Don’t cry. It’s gonna spoil the mood.”
>”S-spoil the mood?”
>She starts taking of your socks and shoes
>”I wanted human dick, I’m getting human dick.”
>The panic returns to you foggy head, clearing it almost instantly
>”WAIT NO NO PLEASE I’M SORRY I LEARNED MY LESSON JUST LET ME GO I’LL NEVER-”
>”Oh, shut up, loser. Yeen bitches are gonna be all over ya after today anyway. Might as well prep you now.”
>You continue to frantically protest, but it falls on deaf ears as she disrobes and lays you down on the ground, probably for easier access
>You look up to her, lip quivering
>”Don’t give me that look. It’s too late to beg.”
>She kneels down to inspect your flaccid cock
>”Hmm. Soft. I can fix that.”
>She whips at your sex with a wide, slimy tongue
>You squirm uncomfortably, weakly trying to get around
>She stops you with one hand, pinning your waist down
>She swipes all across your scrotum soaking it in saliva
>As disgusted as you are, your penis reacts to stimuli all the same
>Soon, your standing at full-mast, The Hyena stands up and grabs your ankles
>She forces your legs apart and hoists her crotch over yours
>”I just wanna point out that I would have let you enjoyed this if you just went with it. Well, in any case, you should probably get used to it, humie. Take a deep breath and get ready, now.”
>Her small warning fails to get you ready
>You let out a pitiful whine as she practically slams down on you
>It feels like your pelvis bruised just from that alone
>But of course, she doesn’t stop there
>She does it again
>Again
>And again
>Soon, she’s riding you as roughly and erratically as a mechanical bull
>The drops onto your crotch are painful, but you feel so snug, so comfortable inside of her
>It’s a really odd feeling
>Any time you try to catch your breath, another slam knocks the wind out of you
>You try to think of literally anything else, but another slam forces your attention on her
>There’s no escape
>Not physically or mentally
>The only thing in your world at the moment is her
>The musk, while not as strong as before, was still overpowering and dizzying
>You watched her large bust bounce up and down with each ascension and dissension
>Her eyes are cold, nearly emotionless, but everything else about her body language wild and passionate
>She grips onto your ankles with white knuckles (or whatever color hyena knuckles turn when under significant stress)
>Any harder, and she might actually break them
>The sopping squelches of penetration are played alongside the sounds of your desperate panting and moaning
>This might not be an especially high bar for you, but this is probably the most rigorous physical activity you’ve ever done
>The heat is enough to make you melt
>Your heart is working overtime
>Which might sound strange, considering your the one on the ground and she’s doing all the work
>But that’s how it is
>And she’s hardly even breaking a sweat
>Your so mentally and physically overworked, that you can’t even look at the clock
>As such, you lose track of time fast
>By the end, your gripping the carpet, teeth clenching, trying not to pass out
>You don’t want to imagine what she’ll do if you disappoint her now
>You can’t even beg for mercy at this point
>All you can do is stare up at her with pleading eyes
>But her cold stare holds steady as she continues, unfettered
>Finally, though, you feel your sweet release start to creep up on you
>Hopefully this will get her to stop
>After a few agonizingly slow seconds, you use all of your remaining strength to tense up and moan as you finish inside her
>She takes a moment to let you catch your breath (and to make sure you don’t pass out) before getting up, dripping your own seed on you
>She walks to your side and roughly yanks you onto your feet by the nape of your neck
>”C’mon, get up.”
>You’re barely able to catch yourself on the wall before you collapse
>You pant heavily, grateful to feel release
>While you’re gasping for air, she heads to the kitchen and grabs herself a can of beer
>”Eh, I’ve had worse fucks. Maybe if you weren’t such a dumbass, you’d get more bitches.”
>You turn to face her, unable to muster up anything to say
>She balls up your clothes and tosses them to you
>Miraculously, you catch them
>”Here. Get dressed and get out. Come back when you’re off that ‘human power’ shit.”
>You take one last look at her
>She just turns on the TV and starts drinking her beer
>Wordlessly, you put your clothes back on and wander out the door, stumbling back home in a daze
>
>Nothing has changed
>You’re still a trad human alpha male fighting against anthroids
>You’ll still get an equally based trad human wife and have tons of children
>And what happened that night had absolutely
>Sure, you might have looked at a bit of yeen porn here and there
>And you might have purchased a collar and leash from YEENED.com
>And you might have not only said yes to every offer of sex from yeen women, but let them reply their paste on you
>But that doesn’t mean anything
>Definitely after the next time it happens, you’ll probably stop
>You’re browsing 4chen
>One particular thread catches your eye
>The image is of yet another fox roastie bending over and showing off her oversized tits
>What is, objectively, the best anthro for HMAF
>You sigh and roll your eyes
>You click on the thread and write a reply

>you're one such human, trapped at your local drinking spot by two giant wolf women soldiers
>each arguing about who gets to take you home, and who is the biggest and toughest
>you get no say in the matter

Imagine if you will, obsessed zoroark gf.
>if her illusions work like in the movie, you would have no chance of escaping her
>she lets you run for hours before revealing your only 10 feet from where you started
>illusionary restrains bind you down
>she laughs as she mounts you
>your clothes that you swore you put on this morning evaporate off you
>you have no clue how long she's been following you
>just how long becomes much clearer as she transforms into a perfect copy of you
>she even perfectly mimics your voice
>"I wonder what would happen if I robbed a couple stores like this?"
>"I doubt anyone would suspect it was actually a zoroark in disguise."
>her transformation ends and she begins grinding her moist puffy neathers into you
>she leans closer and whispers in your ear
>"You, my darling, will be my own personal man-slut servant."
>"You will do what I say and take care of my every desire, or I will make sure they bury you under the prison."
>she takes your shaft and positions it at her entrance

“Mister Hughes, what am I looking at?”
>you smooth out a stack of papers on your desk in front of you
>then turn your gaze up to the wolf seated on the far side of the desk
>he licks his chops nervously and clears his throat
>”That’s uh, my TPS reports from the last few days?”
>good guess
>or more likely he knows why he’s been called in
>you pick up the stack of papers, holding them in front of you to read them as you speak
“Do you double check your work before submitting it?”
>Hughes nods
>”Yes sir. Every time.”
>you flip a page
>and fix the wolf with an administrative glare
>he’s lying to you
“Then can you explain to me the rash of errors in each of these reports?”
>you set the stack down and turn them around for him to see
>a rash of basic mistakes that a simple once-over and double check with a calculator would have caught
>”I don’t–”
>you cut him off
>he’s made excuses before, and you’re not in the mood to hear them
“Three times, Hughes. We’ve had this discussion three times now. When you submit these reports–these wildly incorrect reports–it affects the entire department. Your co-workers need accurate data to do their jobs.”
>the wolf cringes
>nothing hurts a canine worse than thinking they’ve wronged their pack
>jabbing the pages with a finger to emphasize your point, you point out a line at the top
“Half these reports are submitted before their deadlines. You have the time to double check them. What are you doing with that time?”
>Hughes clenches his paws and leans forward, an edge of indignance in his voice
>”You said punctuality was important. I try to get them done as fast as I can!”
>you glare
>hard
>until Hughes backs down and slumps a bit in his chair
>this is an office, he doesn’t need to raise his voice
>but then you relent, picking up the forms and pushing them aside
“You’re right. Punctuality is important. But haste will waste more time than it saves. I want accurate reports, even if it means they don’t come in early. You understand?”
>Hughes nods his head
>”I understand.”
>with a sigh, you hold out the reports to him
“Good. I want these corrected and on my desk by the end of the day. That will be all."
>Hughes takes the forms and stands
>you're shocked he doesn't whine as he trudges out of the room with his ears folded and posture slumping
>you don't like being a hardass, but when the company's making cuts, your department performs or people get fired
>it's been hell itself keeping everyone beneath you up to standard, but no one's been shown the door
>yet
>they'll come around and make cuts again, and Hughes has consistently fallen short of expectations
>poor bastard
>hurts to think about, especially since all the blame will fall on your head
>you tap the intercom on your desk
"Beatrice?"
>your secretary's voice crackles through the other side
>"Yes Mister Nymous?"
>the bunny always manages to sound cheery and pleasant
>even through the harsh buzz of the intercom
"Do I have any other meetings for today?"
>can't recall if Jones from accounting is coming today or tomorrow
>"No sir. Nothing for the rest of the day!"
>Beatrice is on top of things
>she's the only person in the office you can treat more as a friend than an underling
>so you always try your best to match her pleasant demeanor when speaking to her
"Thank you Beatrice."
>no meetings
>so it's back to the old grind
>the task of managing a couple dozen office works, managing their outflow, and directing productivity
>no use complaining
>you lean forward over your desk and get back to work
>it's tedious
>it's boring
>and it stresses you to high hell being in charge of so many people
>but the day drags on and on until it’s just an hour to the end of shift
>you reach over to the intercom again
>"Beatrice, are you free to bring a coffee to my office?"
>she chimes back readily
>"Of course sir!"
>you smirk slightly as you tap the button again
"And get one for yourself. On me."
>her giggle rings through the speaker
>"Why thank you sir!"
>a few minutes later Beatrice bustles in with a mug in each hand
>the petite bunny hops with each step, ears flopping happily
>she's chosen a neat charcoal pinstripe pencil-skirted dress, with a plain white blouse underneath
>her rose-colored eyes flash like her smile behind those big, round glasses
>"Here you are sir! One coffee, just how you like it."
>she trots across to your desk on shapely legs wrapped in fine black nylon leggings that match her dress
>she's a cute little thing, barely half your size
>of course, you'd never consider a relationship with one of your subordinates
"Thanks Bea. You're a lifesaver."
>even if it's one you're close to
>she sets the mug down in front of you
>it's piping hot, she must have made a fresh pot
>"It sounds like you needed it, sir."
>she sighs and leans against your desk
>used to taking an more informal position, especially at the end of the day, Beatrice relaxes and takes a sip from her own steaming mug
>"This is the third night this week you've stayed late, sir."
>you nod and take a drink of your own coffee
>piping hot, with a little milk, just how you like it
>a small comfort for a stressful day
"Upper management's looking at more cutbacks. If the department doesn't meet quotas, I'm gonna have to start firing people."
>the bunny hums sympathetically
>"I'm sorry sir."
>you shake your head
>someone has to do it
"If someone's got to be the bad guy, may as well be me. I'm not about to send you to give people the bad news."
>Beatrice giggles
>her puff-tail quivers as she does so
>try not to look at it, you're her boss damn it
>"You know I'd do whatever I can, sir. If you need me to be the tough bunny, I'm sure I could manage."
>that makes you laugh, picturing the sweet, demure Beatrice trying to boss the other workers in the office around
"Why not just make you the boss? You can give the orders and fire the employees, and I'll fetch the coffee."
>Beatrice titters
>she has to cover her mouth to contain her laughter
>"Anon, could you bring me my coffee?"
>Beatrice sets the mug down in front of you, and hops off your desk to cross the room
>she stops by the couch on the far wall and looks at you with an expectant grin
>you smirk and rise from your chair
>taking up her mug, you try to evoke her cheerful manner as you march across the room
"Here you are Miss Beatrice, will there be anything else?"
>the bunny takes it from you with a suppressed giggle
>"No, no. That will be all, Anon."
"Yes ma'am."
>you turn about and take a step toward your desk, laughing off the little charade
>all in good fun
>but you freeze when she finishes the joke
>"Good boy."
>mid-stride you stop
>a shiver runs up your spine
>your jaw works as you try to come up with something funny to say
>but you're left dumb at two simple words
>finally you manage to take a jerky step and stumble forward
>catching yourself, you straighten out and make it back to your desk
>"Sir? Are you feeling okay?"
>you jerk your head to the side, looking at her
>same as always
>but somehow different
>her dress is tight
>no tighter than usual
>but now you’re looking closer you can see
>it accentuates her body shape, the curve of her hips and waist
>lifting her bust under that white blouse
>but most of all
>beneath the dress and blouse and leggings
>she looks soft
>stop it Anon
>she is your employee
>you're not having a reaction just because of two little words
>"Sir?"
>you haven't said anything
>get it together
>you're management for god's sake
"Fine. Just fine."
>you turn around and lean against the table
>trying to get control of yourself
>you're so focused on managing your reaction, taking even breaths you don't notice Beatrice approach you until she's right beside you
>she puts a hand on your back
>"It's alright sir. It's been a long day, you just need to--"
>you turn and stare at her
"What did you say to me? When I brought you the coffee."
>"I'm sorry sir?"
>this is wrong
>you shouldn't be pursuing this
>Beatrice rubs your back, frowning in thought
>"I'm sorry sir. I was just joking. I haven’t upset you, have I?"
>her ears flop and she furrows her brow in concern
>this isn't what you wanted at all
>but she's given you the perfect escape
>before it's too late, just tell her to forget it
>that you're not upset
>just that you misheard her, then laugh it off
>that's what you ought to say
>but instead you say
"What did you call me?"
>Beatrice sighs
>stepping back from you, she folds her hands and straightens your back
>"I called you 'good boy', sir. It was meant as a joke."
>of course it was
>so leave it alone
>you stand up straight and turn to her
"I’m not upset, Beatrice. Could you…”
>she cocks her head to the other side, confusion and concern mixing
>then a small ‘oh’ of surprise when you finish
"...would you just say it again?"
>the question hangs in the air
>Beatrice staring at you with with those eyes of soft rose
>this was a terrible idea
>she's going to report you
>far worse than the off-color joke she made, you've made a request that's entirely out of the question
>you and Beatrice watch each other
>until finally break the silence
"Forget it."
>you lean over the desk again, unable to meet her eyes anymore
"You can go now, Miss Beatrice. I understand if you feel the need to speak to personnel services..."
>you hear Beatrice moving again, and turn to see her go for the door
>but she doesn't leave
>instead she turns the lock on the handle with a soft click
>"Anon."
>she holds out a hand toward you
>"Come here."
>your first instinct is to question her
>but something stronger suppresses that instinct
>instead you join her wordlessly
>"Take my hand."
>the bunny reaches toward your hand, and when you lift it she intertwines her furred fingers with yours
>they're soft
>"Good boy."
>goosebumps
>those two words causing a physical reaction
>your breath catches and you shiver
>Beatrice leads you by the hand, taking you back to the couch
>you follow like a lovesick puppy
>she sits down at one end, and releases your hand to pat her lap
>"Lay down for me. Put your head in my lap."
>last chance to back out
>what if she's going to use this against you somehow?
>normally you'd trust her, but this is something far outside--
>"Be a good boy for me."
>you lay down on the couch
>head resting on her thighs between the hem of her dress and the start of her stocks
>look up into her eyes as she smiles tenderly down at you
>"There you are. You've been working so hard lately, haven't you?"
>you hum in agreement
>the work never stops
>"I see how much it wears you down. I was worried for you."
>she starts to stroke your hair
>"You were going to burn out before long. I'm so glad you asked me to do this for you."
>you didn't exactly ask for all this
>not that you're complaining
>Beatrice goes on running her fingers through your hair
>and reaches out with her other arm to hold your hand once again
>every few minutes she'll repeat the words
>'good boy'
>and it sends a surge of warmth over your body
>like a wave of pure content washing you away
>you lets your eyes droop and close, enjoying your secretary's tender ministrations
>only her soft soothing voice, and the tick of the clock fills the silence
>end of day must be close
>Beatrice is starting to slow down too
>you're about to pick your head up when you're beaten to the punch
>a rapping on the door startling you back to full wakefulness
>"Mister Nymous. I have those numbers you needed?"
>you start to sit up
>but Beatrice puts her hand on your shoulder and holds you down
>"Stay."
>she murmurs
>you go to protest, but she just presses more firmly
>"Stay right here. I'll take care of it."
>her words are as firm as her hand
>even though you're sure you could push out from under the small bunny with ease, you can't work up the will to do it
>you let yourself be pushed down
>"Good boy."
>Beatrice whispers the words, then plants a kiss on your cheek
>she slips out from under you, a hand under your head to let it down gently
>you watch the bunny stand straight, smooth out her dress, and return to her perfect professional posture
>she crosses the room in a couple hopping strides and opens the door just enough to peer through the crack
>it's Hughes, the wolf from before
>"Oh. Miss B. Sorry, is the boss..."
>Beatrice speaks in her usual cheerful tone
>"Sorry Mister Hughes, he's in a phone call at the moment, it's very important. You can leave those with me."
>you see Hughes snout stick out from behind the door
>"He said he wanted these as soon as possible..."
>you're about to jump to your feet when Beatrice takes initiative
>"Mister Nymous isn't looking too happy. I think it'd be better for everyone if you left those with me."
>you aren't happy, but only because you're terrified of being caught
>he's probably already smelled something
>but the moment the papers are through the door, Beatrice takes them and pushes it shut
>"Have a good night, Mister Hughes."
>Beatrice looks over the sheaf of papers she took from the wolf
>then tosses them in the bin beside the door
>"He can bring them on monday."
>Beatrice returns to the couch, this time kneeling beside it
>so her face is right in front of yours
>she smiles and tenderly cups your cheek
>"Good boy. Let me deal with things for the rest of the day. You just focus on relaxing for me.."
>the bunny nods her head slowly until you nod along with her
>not much of the day left, and you could use the break
>"I always thought you were cute, but I could never ask you out."
>she strokes your cheek
>"You were brave enough to make the first move, and I'm so happy you did it."
>she kisses your nose
>soft bunny lips tickling you
>and giggles
>"How else would I have known my hard-nosed boss, who sends wolves and wildcats packing with tails between their legs, deep down needs his secretary to take care of him?"
>she continues to kiss you, cheeks and brow and lips
>idle, tender kisses to accentuate her fingers scratching through your hair
>and each one accompanied by a 'good boy' in a voice like dripping honey
>but eventually the clock has to strike five
>quitting time
>outside the room is a shuffling of feet and a wave of murmuring voices as employees move to clock out and escape the cubicle farm
>Beatrice too looks up to the clock with a sigh
>"We can take a few minutes to let everyone clear out."
>a few more minutes of her tender kisses
>the only bad part is it has to end
>and when it does, Beatrice stands reluctantly, nuzzling her nose into your cheek
>taking a few sniffs of you
>her breaths are audible when she pulls away, and you can see the blush in her flopped ears
>Beatrice stands slowly, and offers you her hand to help you up too
>"Good boy."
>fuck
>it hurts that you won't get more
>but it feels so good just to hear those words in her sweet voice
>Beatrice releases your hand with obvious reluctance, and straightens herself out once again
>"Well, that was certainly productive, sir."
>you clear your throat and nod your head
>productive is a word for it
"Yes. Thank you Beatrice."
>"Of course sir."
>she tugs at your shirt, straightening it out, and swipes a few bundles of fur from your shoulders
>"Now let's get you home."
>you raise an eyebrow
"Home?"
>Beatrice nods
>"Of course. I know you take your work home with you, sir."
>she drops the professional demeanor, voice husky
>"And I'll be there to take care of my good boy whenever he needs~"
>work didn't change very much after that
>only after especially long days, you would call Beatrice into your office
>or when she felt the need, your secretary would choose a time to step in
>and you would lock the doors for a long, peaceful break where you're not the hardass boss
>you're just Beatrice's good boy

the ocean is full of horrifying yet wholesome monsters
>leopard seals are monsters, but will sometimes try to have wholesome interactions with humans
>wild orcas are the apex sea predators, but literally go out of their way to not attack humans and try to interact with us
>false killer whales are half sized orcas that are even friendlier towards humans and will give boats fish they caught for the hell of it
>sharks are killing machines except nose rubs feel so good to them they will forge free food for more nose rubs
>certain shark species also get attached to specific divers and will actively chase other sharks away from their diver
>wolf fish look like monsters, but will cuddle up to divers because they like our warmth
>numerous occasions of whales body blocking sharks from getting towards humans swimming
>dolphins do a bunch of cute shit, but also commit all sorts of heinous perverted acts to other species, each other, and try to commit to humans
>etc

>Human and his shark gf are chilling in the ocean
>She's swimming laps around him trying to keep all the other aquatic species away
>That is until he suddenly dives towards her and starts rubbing her nose
>She tries to get him to stop embarrassing her but it's pointless as her soft giggles and squeals start filling the water

>Sea Turtles of sufficient size (such as the old Green at New England Aquarium) don't mind giving people a ride
>Sperm Whales like to tease divers using their incredibly powerful SONAR to vibrate your body with intense clicks at various speeds and strength
>Manta Rays look like devils but actually just like to do loopda loops while gathering plankton

If America is an eagle what anthros should other countries be?

>Russia - Brown bear, duh
>Canada - Moose or Beaver
>France - Frogs
>Germany - Wolf
>China - Panda bear
>India - Indian elephant
>Australia - Roos, obviously
>Japan - Fox?

I like eagles, but I think America is better repped as a bison. Because we're strong but also fat.
>Mexico - axolotl
>Chile - chinchilla
>Costa Rica - raccoon
>Ireland - red deer
>Sweden - reindeer
>Bangladesh - bengal tiger
>Indonesia - komodo dragon

buffalo, eagle, and turkey are all iconic american animals
>buffalo is big, strong, and heavy. wider and taller than most other anthros
>eagle is very proud and free-spirited, but kind of goofy and awkward in motion. well known, but her voice and manner of speech is way squeakier and less impressive than what everyone assumes
>the turkey is a pretty passive and motherly lady, but is known to fly into a tizzy and bite off much more than she can chew if someone she cares about isn't being treated right. a lot smaller and less flashy than what you'd expect, but she might still have a nice, full, impressive feathery chest like the males do.

>Buys you off the slavers, or boy's home, or whatever.
>Puts you to work in her club.
>Mostly serving guests, albeit in a skimpy outfit.
>They grope and grab you, but they don't go too far.
>Usually
>Sometimes she'll whore you out, but it's not like you might think.
>She dresses you up, tells you who you're gonna be with, and they take you out for the evening.
>They're actually pretty nice, they know better than to abuse one of her boys.
>That sort of thing is only a favor for friends.
>But even stranger is when she finally decides to pluck you away for herself.
>She finds you after a particularly rough shift.
>You're stained with drool, smeared makeup, spilled drinks and God knows what else.
>She takes you to her comparatively lavish penthouse, which is noticeably out of style.
>You bathe together and she takes special care to wash you.
>"They shouldn't treat you like that. It's not right that you get treated that way."
>She takes you back to her heart-shaped zebra striped bed where she slowly and gently takes what she wants from you.
>She starts crying after you blow your load in her barren womb.
>"I'm sorry, Anon. I'm so sorry. I can't help myself."
>You hold her and fall asleep.
>Maybe tomorrow will be the start of something different.
>Maybe not.

>tiny rabbit who threatens you with rape accusations if you don't submit to her increasingly perverted demands

>You meet your contact in a deserted parking lot on the edge of town, a cougar with a revolver in a shoulder holster.
>She looks like she means business, but her tail lazily swishing back and forth says otherwise.
>She lights up a cigarette as you approach
>"Anon696969? Not the username I woulda' picked but, eh."
>She taps the briefcase with her foot
>"Fake marriage papers, travel documents, everything in here should let you travel to your hearts desire through the State, for a while at least. Maybe out of it even if you play it smart, but that's out of my hands. No one in their right mind would stop you for more than a few minutes upon seeing who you're 'married' to."
>You lean over to pick it up, but she puts her foot on top of it.
>"Now, I gave you a discount, seeing that you were so cute, but I had to call a lot of favors to get this carried out."
>She gestures to the late model land yacht she'd leaning against.
>"There's a lot of room in the back. Comfy too. Perhaps you'd like to show me if you can back up the hefty claim your username makes?"

> be a human in a fantasy adhg world
> Theoretically humans are just yet another intelligent race
> Problem is, intelligence is only slightly above average
> Physical capabilities way below the average anthro
> Much less capacity for magic as well
> General consensus is that humans can build things or come up with ideas, but if those concepts are ever put in anything but the hands of an anthro, it's just a waste of potential
> Humans are respected in a way, but only as useful partners for anthros, never on their own merits
> Make your living as a loner on the edge of a monster-infested forest
> Learn the patterns and habits of the worst of them enough to easily avoid most
> Can identify and harvest rare medicinal herbs back in town
> On rare occasions even offer services as a local guide
> It isn't much, but it lets you get by, with your dignity
> Stumble across a heavily wounded, passed out anthro knight one day
> Looks like the dumbass got herself mauled by a dire boar
> You're an asshole with no love for anthros, but not a big enough asshole to abandon her
> Haul her back to your cabin, nurse her back to some bare minimum of health, then rent a wagon to carry her back to town
> Make damn sure to collect your reward before you leave
> Two months later
> You're starting to get more than a little sick of your constant 'guest'
> Turns out the knight you rescued is very much the old-fashioned romantic type
> Being nursed back to health by a mysterious human male living alone in a dangerous forest is evidently the ideal cue for the little wannabe to 'take responsibility' for you
> Doesn't do anything aggressive
> Just constant clumsy attempts at 'wooing' you and the occasional lecture about how it isn't safe or healthy for a human to be out in a place like this alone
> She's a dumbass
> Thing is...
> You're still pretty sure she could take you down if it came to that
> God fucking damn it
> Teach you to rescue someone
> "Hark, fair human!"
> Oh good. This again.
> Turn around from tending your planter to see your stalker-in-shining-armor striding down the path yet again
> She's often cheerful, but even more bouncy than usual this time
> Notice some scuffs on her usually immaculate armor
> Seeing you raise an eyebrow, she smiles wider
> "Oh, this? Nothing to worry you, dear. I was simply involved in the defeat of a dastardly villain today, and the knave did not wish to go quietly. In fact, I must thank you once again for your latest batch of healing potions. 'Twas as though you fought right by my side!"
> She probably wouldn't need your potions so often if she didn't keep trying to block attacks with her face
> Still, you suppose you can't complain
> She's rapidly become your best customer by far
> In fact the potions were her idea to begin with
> You used to just harvest the materials and sell them in town, but your stalker had pressured you to cut out the middle man and learn how to just make the finished goods yourself
> Turned out it actually wasn't that hard, and had paid off pretty quickly
> Thanks to the forest you've got higher-quality ingredients than anyone else can compete with, so your potions really did tend to be better than the norm
> Of course the knight had spouted some bullshit line about the love and care you put into each bottle and how with such support she could never lose
> You're pretty sure that was just the dash of cinnamon you added, for taste
> Bitches love cinnamon
> Anyway, pays to keep the customers happy, even the weird clingy ones, so you ask her how it went down
> "Alas, our town was the target of a most vile necromancer! The fiend was not satisfied with the teachings of her betters at the tower of magic, so her lust for power led to her embrace of a darker path. It is fortunate that I noticed the broken chains upon the cemetery gates and chanced upon her before she'd the chance to raise more than a single of her foul minions, or the town have faced a fate far more dire."
> So, if you're translating right from bullshit-ese, the hapless idiot stumbled upon another hapless idiot, who dropped out of school and only managed to raise a single skeleton before being sent packing
>Sounds about right
> Still... damn if she doesn't look thrilled
> Your 'knight' may hold the title, but if there's two things you've picked up on during her almost-daily visits, it's that she's brand new to the title and desperate to prove herself
> Obnoxious though the constant clumsy flirting may be, you've gotten... used to her, at least
> Manage to give her a genuine smile and congratulate her on a job well done
> She beams
> "And this is only the first step, goodman! The eyes of the nobility will be upon me for this deed. Although the fiend escaped justice this day, rest assured that I shall not rest until I have brought her back to the city in chains to answer for her crimes. A-and then..."
> Her face suddenly turns bright red as she fidgets
> "Once I have earned my proper knightly honors... and someday, been rewarded with land of mine own..."
> Her gaze, straying before, snaps back to yours in full earnesty
> "I shall make you my betrothed, and take you unto our bed!"
> ...
> ... Well, the moment was nice while it lasted, anyway

>1 day in
>At a seedy motel with her
>At her direction, you've pumped a load into her every hour for nearly the past 24, your back now covered with claw marks, and a few marking bites on your shoulders
>She claims it'll help with authenticity
>"Look, they might buy that you needed to travel immediately after your wedding, but you really gotta smell like it."
>1 week in
>She has you hanging at her apartment a lot
>"Ok, now that we have the "fuck til the room smells" pheremones on you, we need to get the casual scent of an anthro's home on you, your clothes, etc."
>Always another excuse as to why you couldn't cross today
>1 month in
>You've moved in with her
>"Really gotta make it look authentic, like we're living together. You never know who could be watching. Gotta build up a record of our relationship."
>3 months in
>On a (pretend, of course) vacation with her outside the State, at a State managed resort
>Pretending to go to dinner (she's avoided alcohol though)
>Pretending to walk on the beach, holding her hand
>Pretending to kiss her (she'd given up smoking too!)
>Pretending to have your hips fucked into the mattress every night
>Pretending (just pretending!) to say "I love you" as you fall asleep in her arms, in case the State has microphones in your room
>"Gotta show you're not a flight risk. This will look good on your citizen record as a good husband and State resident."
>6 months in
>She's heavily pregnant
>You're out purchasing baby furniture with her and her parents
>"Once again, all good for the record, showing you have reasons to stay, they won't hesistate to let you through the border crossing if you're gushing about your expectant wife the whole time."
>You discuss "good, wholesome, state approved names" that make you both seem like good upstanding state-approving citizens
>18 months in
>You were back in the same land yacht, near where you met her for the document exchange that never happened
>It was a bit out of the way, but she liked to drive over here sometimes on Saturdays after you all went out for lunch.
>"You all" reffering to you, your cougar """wife""", and your 9 month old """daughter""" in the car seat in the back
>She was pregnant again too, super convincing, this time with twins probably
>You offered to drive, but she'd be damed if anyone else touched her other baby
>But unlike every other week, this time she pulled off the main road to a spur that headed towards the border crossing
>You kept trying to ask what she was doing, but she always responded with "shhhhhh."
>You had no idea what was going on behind those sunglasses.
>She reached into a gap between her seat and the door an pulled out a folder, hanging it to you
>"Your documents."
>Dumbfounded, you began to parse through them.
>Passport, travel itinerary dated for today, tickets for a bus on the other side of the border
>"Just keeping up my end of the deal. I packed a bag with a week's worth of clothes for you."
>She reached behind the seat, grabbing an old gym bag, throwing it into your lap
>Your ""daughter"" giggled when it got stuck on a seat belt latch
>You were at a loss for words, was she really doing this?
>Was this whole thing really part of the cover story for her?
>"The bus tickets are scheduled for 30 minutes from now, so we'll have to make it quick."
>She pulled to a stop in front of the lightly staffed border crossing and got out, grabbing your "daughter" from the back as you took a somewhat confused step out, holding your documents and bag.
>"Wave bye bye to daddy! It's going to be such a long week without you sweetheart, but work is work. See you when you get back from your business trip!"
>She blew you a kiss
>Your daughter followed suit
>Were you really going to do this?
>You weren't prepared for it, but there it was.
>Escape from the anthrostate, literally 30 steps in front of you.
>You stood there for what felt like an eternity, the border guards looking at you somewhat confused as you just stood there
>Behind your back, your wife just stood there with an ever so pleasant smile on her face
>Fuck
>Fuck fuck fuck
>You dropped the bag and the documents folder, causing the ticket to go flying away with the desert breeze.
>Walking back to where your wife was standing, you took your daughter from her and allowed yourself to be pulled into a deep kiss.
>Words formed in your head, and you began to whisper to her
"You evil, lying, manipulative, pheremone marking, apartment sharing, vacation going, child bearing bitch. You really set this whole thing up expecting me to leave."
>"Hey. No one can ever claim I don't fullfill my end of the deal. What you do at this point is all up to you. If you got a little too invested in the cover story, weeelllll..."
>As she trailed off, your daughter planted a wet kiss on your cheek, giggling.
>Both border guards could be heard going, "awwwwww" behind you.
>"Seeing as you've lost the travel documents, which I assure you took me a decent amount of time to doctor up, I suggest we go home and work on that cover story a little more. Perhaps you could try again in, say, 60 months?"
>With that, you got back in the car and returned home.
>The border guards were left wondering just what the fuck happened.
>"Man, that guy's boss is gonna be pissed when he finds out he just straight up ignored his business trip."
--------
>30 years in
>Your youngest daughter of 5 and her """husband""" were on vacation at the same Anthrostate run resort you had visited 3 decades earlier
>Building a cover for his escape
>You've seen this before
>Frankly you're surprised word's never gotten out about how bad your family is at getting humans out of the anthrostate.
>This is, what? The 5th guy now?
>Maybe the state allows it because your family's never actually let a man escape.
>Your oldest daughter and her husband were on vacation too, and had left their children with you.
>Tucking them in for the night, planting a kiss on each of their foreheads, you crept downstairs and found your wife still at work, doctoring some form of vehicle registration
>You poured a glass of whiskey for each of you, handing her one as you sat across from her at the dining room table
"So, are my documents good for tomorrow?"
>"All set up."
"Train ticket?"
>"Purchased."
"Passport?"
>"Don't you have an actual one now?"
"Travel itinerary?"
>"This time, your cover is as a professor set to give a series of lectures on the reproductive biology of humans and anthros...something you're actually quite famaliar with."
"So it's all set?"
>"All you have to do is actually follow through with the escape this time. You're pretty bad at that."
"Well, 10 years ago, I missed my departure time because I saw a really pretty butterfly in a garden at the airport, then 5 years ago my shoe lace broke when I was tying it before getting on the bus that was going to take me across the border."
>"And of course everyone knows it's impossible to travel with a broken shoe lace."
"Of course."
>You took a sip before continuing.
"What's the weather forecast look like for tomorrow?"
>She glanced at the newspaper next to her.
>"Rainy, might be a thunderstorm."
>You yawned and stretched before getting up, dumping the rest of your drink into her quickly emptying glass.
"Eh. I hate thunder. Guess we can put off my escape for another few years."
>You gave her a kiss good night
>"What a damn shame. I was so sure you were gonna go for it this time too."

I was half asleep when I dreamed up this scenario. I thought you bunch would appreciate a greentext about it
>anon is the classic roguish archetype for his adventuring party
>he has a particular fixation on amassing as much wealth as possible

>A family that demands a high marriage fee for the hand of the daughter
>he claims to truly love the girl and would never break her heart, but if he doesn't pay the fee the marriage bond will be broken
>also that his head will roll
>the party laughs at his predicament, and tell him their willing to help him into his 'happily forever after"
>its too bad its all a lie
>the real story is that the poor anon unknowingly wandered his way into an immensely powerful dragon's den
>anon practically tripped over the great beast on account of her scales being as black as coal
>awakened, she rose to see a lone human before her paralyzed with fear
>at first, she fully intended to kill him, but wanted to hear him beg first
>he, of course, pleaded for mercy and offered everything he had on him
>she pointed out that she would have it anyways once he was dead
>his next offer, however, gave her pause
>he offered servitude
>this offer she considered more carefully

>with death as the alternative, anon agreed and his will was bound to her
>her first task for him was for him to build her a great fortune
>at first, the task was simple
>anon, with his party, would complete quests, and he would hand his take over to the dragoness
>that was until she found out about his lie
>it amused her, and she would use it to torment the rogue
>she started out calling him her 'dutiful husband' after every tribute
>soon after a tall sultry dragonkin woman with hair black as night showed up in town and introduced herself as anon's wife
>the rogue knew who it was and gave every excuse not to stay the night with her
>his party, however, insisted that he should and that he'll feel better after sharing a pillow with his wife
>the only pillow anon had that night was the dragoness' thighs as she forced him to eat her out for hours on end
>one night turned into over a week of performing lewd sex acts, each more degrading than the last
>anon prayed for the next quest to come so he could get away from his 'wife'

Well? Are you a good enough boy to help an ancient evil conquer the world?

>earth invaded by alien anthros
>win pretty easily but the humans gave more resistance than was expected of them.

>Anon is friends with a confident, sensual marten who's somewhat older than he is
>She's both curvaceous and tall as fuck
>He's pretty sure that she's now intentionally pinning him against a wall when she wants to make a point

>Your mom is a werewolf
>They're not as scary as the stories make them sound
>She's just as intelligent as she is in her human form
>And her boy is a lot similar to a human physique than most depictions
>Apart from being 9 feet tall of course
>There's also another thing that people left out of the legends
>Her human and werewolf forms age differently
>Her wolf form only ages when she's actually IN her wolf form
>Considering she only transforms on full moons and Halloween, that's pretty much nothing
>When she's in her human form she fits the mental image of "single mom" pretty well
>But when she's in her wolf form she's right back to the "sex, drugs, and rock & roll" archetype she was back in the 80's
>Seriously, she can do a killer Madonna impression
>Of course the only parties she can go to now are Halloween costume parties most of her efforts at "entertainment" are focused squarely on you
>Its actually really cool
>Sort of like a time machine, you see and hang out with the person your mom used to be back when she was around your age
>Sort of like back to the future
>And just like in back to the future, your mom really wants to fuck you
>The difference being that your mom still knows you're her son
>She just doesn't care
>And there's not a lot you can do to stop a 9 ft, 400 lb werewolf from getting her way
>Especially when she's your mom

>you always see this wolf girl sitting alone
>everyone's too afraid to talk to her
>smile and wave at her one day
>she just stares at you
>next day she's at your lunch table
>and no one else is
>she still doesn't talk, just stares at you while you eat
>you try to talk to her, ask about her
>just stares
>so instead you tell her about your day and talk about your interests
>at the end of lunch she smiles at you
>"my name is yui"
>think she's not so scary after all
>but then
>as you're walking home from school at the end of the day
>a huge gray wolfs jump out of an alley and grabs you
>he punches you in the gut, throws a bag over your head and zip-ties your hands
>you're thrown in a car's trunk and driven for a long way
>when you stop, you're pulled out of the trunk, down a flight of stairs, and tied to a cbair
>you try to speak, ask what's going on, but the wolf shuts you up with a punch that leaves your head spinning
>"what are you doing?!"
>a high voice rings in your ears
>"you said to grab the boy, miss espinosa."
>that must be the wolf, his gruff voice sounding oddly nervous
>"i said bring him home! not kidnap him!
>you feel much smaller paws on your body
>searching you
>"are you hurt, mi tesoro?"
>you're too scared to answer the suddenly soft and tender voice, but flinch and hiss in pain when she reaches where the wolf punched you
>"what did he do? did he hurt you?!"
>the voice turns
>"did you hurt him?! you put your filthy paws on mi principe?!"
>the girl's voice turns into a rabid snarl
>while the man quavers in fear
>"p-please, miss espinosa, it was a mistake! i didn't--"
>suddenly there's a snarl, and the man shrieks
>you hear bodies crashing into each other, ripping and growling and cries of pain
>and then a loud, wet ripping sound followed by gurgling
>the bag is pulled off your head
>the first thing you see is the girl from school
>yui
>smiling at you with bloodstained teeth
>behind her is the body of the gray wolf, still twitching and gurgling
>but your view is obscured as Yui steps forward and pulls your head to her blouse
>she shushes you and strokes your hair
>"it's okay mi vida. i have you now. you're all mine."
>you see why the others were so scared of her

>Dear diary

>they started chanting “Awoo awoo”
>she was convulsing at this point until I put her out of her misery
> I was then named king of human men and got a husband with lots of pups
>and then the human men started clapping

>the anthro state's mandated human program takes too long for a candidate to have theirs
>sometimes there isn't enough humans to be handed out
>anthro women instead opt for human orphans at adoptions centers for their human mates
>some human boys are raised rightfully, by a lovable anthro mother
>the tragic majority of these cases however, result in forbidden practices where the orphans are in intimate relationships with their adopted mothers

>or you'll be eating everyone else's pussy, in prison
Why would anon be sent to a female prison?

>a change that made the crime rate from humans drop since it means being trapped with female anthro criminals

"Don't touch me! You monster!"
>"Oh hush, it's just a little cuddling. Sit in my lap. Are the cuffs too tight?"
"They won't hold me. I can break these cuffs!"
>"Aww, no you can't hon. They're solid steel. But I can take them off if you promise to be on your best behavior."
"Ptoo! Fuck you! You can't control me!"
>"Don't spit. It's not polite. Here, let me pet you a little. There there."
"Trying to lull me into a false sense of security? It won't work. I'm too strong."
>"Oh I know, you had to be so strong for so long. But now you're safe, and you can let Sergeant mommy take care of you."
"Insidious! Evil! R-right there. Scratch there."
>"Ooh you like that spot huh? Good boy~"
"Nngh. Please..."
>"You can have this every day if you give in. Just accept love."
"Love? No, you mean--you mean rape!"
>"Oh no, I know those awful rumors they spread. They're not true honey."
"And you'll hold me down! No matter how much I struggle!"
>"I'd never hurt you..."
"Slathering my face with your hot tongue! And nipping my ear to keep me silent whenever I scream. You tear through my clothes to claw my chest, and pull my cock free..."
>"..."
"Tears streaming down my face as my body betrays me to pleasure. Every slam of your hips making me moan despite my fear."
>"Dear..."
"And it's not just one round! You keep fucking me, over and over and over until my spirit and body are equally broken."
>"Is that what you want to happen?"
"...please?"

Diamonds in the Dark
>Grug hates this
>Grug hates being away from tribe, and having to forage for Grug’s own food like some kind of berry picker, and not having soft mammoth blanket to sleep on when the sun goes below the ground to rest
>Grug is respected member of mammoth hunter tribe!
>Or at least Grug used to be…
>During a night when water poured from the sky and light flashed across the plains Grug went outside his hut to pee
>Grug lit a torch to scare off any lurking predators, because Grug is smart and knows feral beasts hate fire
>Fire makes pain when it touches skin, and lights fur on fire causing much more pain to man eating animals!
>So Grug walks outside with torch, did Grug’s business, began to walk back to hut when-woosh!
>A great gust of wind picked the torch out of Grug’s hand and throw it onto roof of tribe leader
>To keep a long cave painting short the tribe leader became very angry with Grug, told Grug he must go out on long journey and bring something back to the tribe to make up for burning down tribe leader’s hut, or else Grug is not allowed back with his tribe
>So Grug makes a long journey across the plains
>Then the plains turn dark and lifeless, nothing but barren black rock as far as Grug could see
>Then lifeless rock turned to a green howling jungle!
>Grug made a long and dangerous journey through jungle, fighting off many feral beasts, cannibals, and strange scaly reptiles
>Eventually the howling jungle changed into a tall tree place
>The air grows chilly and the wind grows quiet in this new land
>A thick fog blankets the ground and tall, strange trees tipped with green needles touch the sky
>Grug walked under tall trees until his feet hurt and his body ached every single day, Grug wants to make tribe jealous with what he finds! He just needs to keep searching!
>Many moons pass until Grug finally finds what he needs to prove his worth to tribe
>Grug was walking under trees when he sees a big rock in the distance
>Grug drew closer until he sees something strange
>A big hole is in the rock, deep enough to where the sunlight dare not enter
>Grug walks to cave entrance and sees something colorful, something sparkling, something that Grug needs to take back to tribe!
>All along the cave walls are gems of blue, green, and red embedded into the rock, sparkling with what little sunlight hits them
>Grug walks closer and sees the gems grow bigger the further into the cave they went
>Grug pauses
>Walk deeper into cave and risk fighting a dire wolf, a pack of cannibals, or worse, a cave bear?
>Or hope that nothing bad happens and Grug can find a nice big pretty gem that he can take back to tribe and make them all jealous?
>Grug knows what must be done
>Grug lights torch and clutches spear in hand, either Grug walks out with a big pretty shiny rock or Grug’s not walking back out at all
>Grug walks deeper and deeper into cave, the gems in the wall growing larger and larger as Grug continues
>Grug chuckles to himself, maybe if Grug finds big enough shiny rock the tribe make him leader! Then he’ll make old tribe leader go on a dangerous journey!
>But Grug’s smile dies as he rounds a bend in the cave
>There, barely lit by Grug’s torch, is a pile of dark thick fur, slowly rising and falling as it breathes
>Grug walks stealthily as jaguar and holds torch out to identify the beast
>Stumpy muzzle, rounded ears, big body covered in thick fur coat
>Grug puts a hand to his chin
>It cave bear, got to be
>Grug looks down and-there!
>Laying next to the cave bear is a big shiny rock! The biggest Grug’s seen!
>Grug takes deep breath and walks towards the dumb bear
>Surely the bear is hibernating and won’t notice Grug take shiny rock, right?
>Grug is almost there, just a few more steps and Grug will-
>The dumb bear yawns and rolls over, almost covering the rock with it’s fur
>Grug curses bear gods, now he will have to move some of her fluff to reach the rock
>Grug holds breath and walks next to bear
>Grug holds one hand out, reaches into her fluff, and firmly grasps the rock
>With breath still held Grug then slowly pulls the rock free of her fur
>Grug looks at shiny rock in hand, this is it, Grug is set for life with mammoth hunter tribe
>Grug will get all the Gruggettas when he gets back, they’ll all be begging to polish his spear
>But why not admire the beauty of this strange rock now that he has it?
>Grug holds the rock out in front of him and brings his torch next to it
>The rock glows with bright unnatural light, and all around him Grug now sees points of blue, red, and green
>Grug is scared, Grug turns towards cave entrance but the points of light move with him!
>”Ah!” Grug yells, dropping the stone
>It hits the cave floor with a loud crack and Grug hears something move behind him
>Grug turns his head
>The cave bear is now standing on two feet, looking at him with angry, cold bear eyes
>Two feet?
>This not feral cave bear! This is cave bear anthro!
>Grug clutches his spear
>The bear steps closer with a hunched posture and opens it’s mouth
>”Oh? What’s this? A curious little monkey man trying to abscond with one of my geological treasures? Such a brave, if misguided attempt at self-enrichment.”
>Grug not understand what cave bear says, words too big, brain hurt, prefrontal cortex not yet fully formed!
>Grug dance around in war posture and make frightening sounds!
>”Ah! Ah! Ah! Go away bear woman! You no eat Grug! Ah! Ah! Ah!”
>Grug yells and dances! Pointing spear at cave bear woman!
>She chuckles
>”Heh, heh, heh. Nice try monkey man, but I know how poorly your eyes adjust to darkness. Too many cones, not enough rods.”
>The bear woman leans forward and blows a mighty breath towards Grug’s torch, it’s flame flickering out
>Grug stands still as he feels her hot breath wash over his body in the pitch black
>”Not so vicious now, now are you? A brave little two legged man thing thinking he can just trespass in my underground lair and make off with one of my possessions. Thankfully I can think of one way you can pay me back for your transgression.”
>Grug shrieks in terror as he feels two large paws grip his shoulders
>”Grug sorry! Grug was only playing prank! Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!”

>Grug sees entrance of home in the distance
>Grug grunts and shifts the weight of the deer on his back
>As Grug gets close he sees beloved mama bear walk out of the dark entrance of the cave
>Mama bear has a cub and a baby swaddled in cloth, they’re held in a wrap that goes across her back keeping them close to her chest
>Grug looks at mama bear and smiles
>Grug not mind staying with mama bear
>Mammoth hunter tribe dumb anyway
>They don’t even have safe cave homes or shiny rocks!
>Mama bear walks near and lifts the deer off Grug’s back
>”A healthy catch Grug, this ought to feed us for quite some time. Though personally I’ve always been fonder of the local flora than the fauna. Speaking of which, did you get any sugary delicacies for me?”
>Grug gives an affirmative grunt and lifts basket filled with wild berries to mama bear
>She smiles and plucks one from the basket, tossing it into her mouth
>”Delightful, as always. Grug, I’ve been pondering something for a while.”
>”Hmmm?”
>”Civilized life as it stands is so scattered and remote, I thought I may die alone in that cave without having seen another creature blessed with bipedal locomotion and coherent speech. What do you think about a society where males and females are instead paired with each other through some assignment process to prevent such loneliness, and in the process raise the happiness of all civilized life that walks the earth? What do you think about that Grug?”
>Grug puts a hand to his chin and thinks about what mama bear said until brain starts to hurt
>”Grug like idea. A mama bear for every Grug and a Grug for every mama bear. It’s eqwa-equit-eqita-“
>”Equitable.” Mama bear says for Grug, his tongue tied in knots
>”Yes, that word.”
>”Good. Granted I never said anything about it only being composed of human males and female anthros but I like the way you think Grug.” Grug and Mama bear reach entrance of cave. “Now come inside Grug, it’s time to make dinner and feed our growing offspring.”
>Grug gives an affirmative grunt and enters with her, content with his new life

Depends on the species more than diet. Also many have really cute or funny "flirting" rituals
>squirrels play a sort of tag game of chasing each other so imagine a squirrel anthro start chasing you out of nowhere

>hares will sort of play box each other
>many water species like otters/seals/etc are pretty much just playing together in the water

>etc
course there's also plenty of species whos courtships sounds like hentai plots

>Furry chicks take picks of their humies cocks to post on Facebook like prizewinning fish
>Girth, length, veins, wrinkles, and ridges are all discussed endlessly
>Illicit human pet circles and humie-swappers also abound
>Girls who post especially handsome humie cocks often get their inbox slammed with dms and requests

>Be you

>It’s nothing much
>A couple of sandwiches
>Some chips
>Some celery
>And some homemade lemonade
>It’s more than enough for you
>You start eating, brought close to tears by the picturesque vi-
>”HEY! YA FUCKING HOSER!”
>Oh no
>You were really hoping you wouldn’t run into one
>Canada Geese
>Infamous menaces
>They’re back from their winter migration
>And now, no park is spared from their wrath
>”YEAH, HUMIE! I’M TALKING TO YOU!”
>Maybe ignoring her will make it go away
>Youu hear her walk up behind you
>”So you’re just gonna ignore me, eh? Too bad that won’t make me go away.”
>Shit
>Now what are you gonna do?
>You look over at her
>She’s a stereotypical Canada Goose, alright
>A bit on the chunky side
>Brown and white feathers
>Big wings
>Webbed hands and feet
>...And naked
>Why are Canada Geese always naked
>It’s indecent
>She leans over to you, sticking that big ugly beak into your face
>”Whatcha got there?”
>”Food.”
>”...Yeah, I gathered that much, stupid.”
>”C-can I help you, ma’am?”
>She lets out a smug scoff
>”Actually, you can.”
>She takes a seat next to you
>She’s so heavy that it nearly lifts up your end of the table
>”Y’know, migrating’s really hard work. Really works up an appetite.”
>You already know where this is going
>”Look, I-I really only packed enough food for myself, you wouldn-”
>”Oh, c’mon. I’m not asking for much here. Just one itty bitty chip’s enough for me.”
>”One chip?”
>”Yes, moron! ONE chip! Y’know, one? That number between zero and two?”
>”And if I give you one chip, you’ll go away?”
>”’Course. I ain’t looking for trouble, just a little snack.”
>”You don’t really believe her, but you also decide to placate her for the time being
>Canada Geese don’t tend to take no for an answer
>”Fine, here you go.”
>You present her with a chip
>She uses her beak to snatch it out of your hand in an instant
>”Thanks a bunch. Well, I’ll take my leave now.”
>She gets up and starts walking away
>”Later, cockass!”
>You sigh in relief
>But you also know that, when one Canda Goose is spotted, others aren’t too far behind
>You decide to eat quickly and get out of there
>It stinks to have to rush and not enjoy the gorgeous scenery, but you don’t want any trouble
>Five minutes pass and no sign of any more geese (or the one from before)
>A part of you starts getting your hopes up
>Maybe it really was just the one
>And then…
>”That’s him, girls! That’s the humie giving out free food!”
>Shit
>You should have known that wasn’t gonna be the end of it
>You turn around
>You see not only the goose from before but a whole gaggle of them, all giving you dirty looks
>It’s at that moment you realize you’re probably not getting out of here alive
>They all start marching toward you
>”I-I already-”
>”Shut up!”
>You get roughly shoved to the side as they start going through your basket
>A few of them start fighting over your half-eaten sandwich
>”I saw it first!”
>”Fuck off! You ate earlier! I’m starving!”
>”Both of you are fat enough! Gimme it!”
>Another one downs your bottle of lemonade in seconds
>But that’s all there is
>One of them shakes the empty picnic basket, looking for even a crumb more
>”Elise, you said this bitch had food! What gives?”
>The goose from before (Elise, as you now know) stares daggers into you
>”Y’know something? I think he’s holding out on us!”
>Before you know it, you’re lifted up two feet in the air by her
>”Where is it, bitch? You don’t wanna make us mad!”
>”Th-that’s all there is, I swear! I didn’t pack anything else!”
>”Hmph. I think he’s lying, girls. And I know just where to look.”
>She throws you into the wings of two other geese
>”Take his clothes off!”
>You don’t even have time to protest as you get stripped at lightning-fast speeds
>All your clothes lay in a pile on the ground, and you’re just as naked as the geese are
>”Okay, maybe he wasn’t hiding food, but this ain’t bad either, wouldn’t ya say?”
>”Nope.”
>”Not in the least.”
>Your mortification is amplified as three of them start licking your chest
>”S-STOP! GET AWAY FROM M-”
>”Oh, shut the fuck up, ya chucklehead.”
>From behind, one of them envelopes your head between her breasts
>Now surrounded by darkness and feathers, all you can do is let out muffled screams in protest
>But it’s no use
>The licking travels down from your chest to your stomach, and then your cock
>Despite the horrific situation, the physical stimulation is more than enough to get you hard, making you feel even more humiliated than before
>Abruptly, you’re dropped, landing on your lower back with a thud
>You look up
>Eliese squats over
>You feel the heat emanating from her sex
>”If you don’t have any food, then we’re just gonna take something else from you.”
>”N-no, please, I-”
>But it’s too late
>Elise drops down with enough force to nearly shatter your pelvis
>You don’t have time to fully comprehend that feeling, though, as she quickly starts riding you
>”PLEASE, PLEASE, STOP! I DON’T WAN-”
>”Oh, my God… Hey, can someone shut this bitch up?”
>Before you can beg any more, a webbed, leathery foot stomps down on your face
>You struggle to breathe, desperately searching for any sliver of air you could afford
>The goose woman started rubbing her foot all across your face
>Meanwhile, your lower half feels like it’s getting hit by a jackhammer
>A big, feathery jackhammer
>Elise is relentless
>A part of you wonders if you should be thankful the foot blocks your view of it
>There’s a big disconnect between the physical pleasure and the mental pain you’re feeling
>Maybe you’re lucky that you’re only gonna get away with mental scars from this
>Canada Geese are no joke
>Even a relatively weak one could fold a human boxer with relative ease
>Still, this is far from how you wanted your relaxing solo picnic to go
>She rides you for a little while, molting feathers as she goes
>Eventually, you cum, and the foot gets removed from your face
>You pant, exhausted
>Elise, meanwhile, gets up, barely phased
>”P-please… please jus-”
>”Oh, for the love of… just save your breath, Quickshot. We ain’t going anywhere, and neither are you. Not until we all get a little piece.”
>You sputter more, but as Elise said, it’s useless
>Your dick services goose pussy for the next few hours
>You admit in hindsight they’re pretty good, but you really wish it was a more consensual arrangement
>They’re slick and leather, and their walls cling to your cock tightly
>You even try anal with a few of them
>Their holes are less slick but even tighter
>Every time you try to protest, more geese toes get popped in your mouth
>Or geese pussy pressed against your lips
>Or geese donuts getting rimmed by your tongue
>Soon, you lose the energy to even beg
>All you can do is take it as the world around you becomes a mess of feathers and sex
>You just accept that you’re a ragdoll for these geese, and pray it ends soon
>And soon, it ends
>You lay there, drained both physically and mentally, covered in sweat, feathers, and vaginal fluids
>The geese, meanwhile, just look down at you in disgust, their pussies and asses dripping with cum
>”Man, what a loser. Come on, girls, the hockey game’s starting soon.”
>They all disperse
>Except Elise
>She lingers with what is almost a sympathetic look
>”Hey uh, humie? I just wanna say…”
>You look up intently
>She roughly jabs her toe into your temple
>You wince in pain
>”Sorey!”
>She snickers cruelly as she goes with her gaggle
>You get up, in a daze
>You gather your clothes
>You know what?
>The park’s overrated
>Maybe next time, you’ll go to the beach
>At least there, you’re less likely to be sexually harassed by anthros
>Right?

>Get aroused by smell of anthro partner
>She smells your arousal and demands sex
>Rides your face and your cock for hours
>Falls asleep and forgets to shower
>Cycle repeats until either you or it is broken

>mid-term school break
>both of your parents were away
>and your friend Cassidy had invited you to stay for two weeks at her family's farm with her
>you accepted
>it was a new, weird experience
>being a suburban kid, some of it was pretty uncomfortable
>but you got to hang out with Cass one-on-one
>and the line between teasing and flirting was beginning to break down after only a few days
>you're returning to the barn with both your arms full and your back aching
>Cass had sent you back to the house to get some drinkable water
>you hear a yell
>then the sound of something ripping
>then a loud buzzer
>in a panic you rush inside the barn
>what you see is Cassidy, semi nude, with her hands stuck reaching forward into the jaws of a machine.
>it appeared to be seconds away from disaster
>her shirt is completely destroyed, half-eaten by a grain mulching machine that she was trying to un-jam.
>"Oh shit!"
"Anon!? G-go away!"
>you don't leave
>instead you quickly put down the big heavy plastic bottle of water
>she's in trouble, clearly.
"I'm fine look, I turned it off."
>the hyena points her foot towards the big red EMERGENCY button that she'd evidently kneed
>then she tugs a few times
>her arms are trapped in the denim overalls which are all twisted up in the sleeves of her shirt
>she tugs again
>doesn't budge.
>you walk up beside her
"Okay... Fine. I uh, I need some help here."
>you tug
>nothing
>Cassidy gives you a smug look of condescension
>"Shush"
>you find the fabric that's stuck around her shoulder and trace it across her body
>her shirt is ripped a few more times while you figure out a way for her to escape
>with some careful maneuvering you help her out of the predicament
>grateful, she leans in for a hug without fully realizing that she's completely topless
>her breasts smoosh against your side
>you blush
>she shivers, then pulls away
>you let her
>the two of you had been flirting but you weren't sure of sh-
"Anon you're staring"
>"w-wha?"
>she was right, you hadn't even noticed but your eyes were glued to her naked body
>Cassidy's golden-brown fur was sparkling with sweat
>she looked ... great
>now you remembered why she'd requested the water
>with massive effort you manage to pull your eyes away from her breasts and up to her face
>surprisingly, you aren't met with a scowl
>but with an amused smirk
>you take this as a sign not to back down
>leaving her clothes trapped in the motor of the machine, you follow her
>she steps back with each step forward you take
>taunting you
>eventually you catch up, or she lets you
>you're too distracted to tell
>your hands sink into the sides of her torso, fingers digging through that wet fur
>she smells... strong
>you gulp
"somethin' wrong?"
>you shake your head and breathe in a long shuddered breath
>her musk; It's powerful, intoxicating even
>before you realize what you're doing, you've beelined for her armpit
>deeeeeeep sniff...
"Eeaah! What the fff..mhm.."
>you cast a nervous gaze up to her snout
>your face is bright red with embarrassment
>she looks you dead in the eye, everything about her expression reads "really?"
>you poke out your tongue, then open your mouth wider and suck on her armpit
>it's salty, bitter, actually pretty gross if you were honest with yourself
>but you couldn't help but want more
>your hands reach across her body to grope her some more but then!
>you feel paws grip your shoulders.
>The yeen tugs your head away from her sweaty fur
>Cassidy pushes you down onto your knees and then crosses her arms
>"uhm. Sor-"
"Shh!"
>she grabs your lips
"Shuddup Anon"
>you do

"Not yet."

"S-sorry doc. Just have a thing about needles."
>the doctor's pupils narrow as she focuses on you
>you almost think you see a smile on her face as her tail flicks, but then it turns downward into a sympathetic frown
>"Oh dear. I'm so sorry to hear, Mister Anon. Flu shots are vital to your health, and they're nothing to be afraid of."
>you're helped back up onto the cot, where you grip the padded edges to remain upright
"I know, I know. I know. Iknow."

>a change too seems to have come over the doctor
>she stares intently, and grips your arm tight to hold you in place
>"Goodness, Mister Anon. Are you going to be okay?"
>fuck
>it's so embarrassing to be this freaked out in front of the pretty doctor
>and now she's all worried
"Yeah. Yeah I can do the shot."
>the doctor smiles at you
>"Good. It only hurts for a moment."
>that makes you grit your teeth
>you know it's going to hurt, you don't want to be reminded
>the doctor leaves your side, and you sway without her holding you up
>you don't want to turn to watch where she went for fear of tipping over
>but you can still hear her

>you shake your head
>which was a bad idea because it makes you dizzy
"Fl--uh--flip a coin."
>the snow leopard hums and steps around behind you
>coming back to your side
>you flinch when her paw comes up, but it's empty
>"It's okay, Mister Anon. Lots of people are scared of needles."

>you gasp
>"You're okay. It's alright. I'm just cleaning the site with an alcohol swab."
>oh
>that's right
>you feel her making the small circle with the damp material
>still, you shiver and shake when the doctor leaves you again
>"Okay, Anon. I have the needle here."
>you want to tell her not to say that word
>but all you manage is a non-committal grunt
>when she returns, she even holds it up in front of you
>"See? It's tiny. Nothing to worry about."
>but you are worried
>some stupid primal part of you making you lose your mind at the sight of the small needle
>your vision starts to swim and you fold over a bit
>until a paw takes your shoulder and leans you back upright
>the doctor makes a soft chuffing sound
>"If it would make you feel better..."
>she switches the needle from one hand to the other, and holds her now empty paw in front of you
>"You can hold my paw until we're done."
>really?
>you manage to look up at her
>a strange expression is on her face, her muzzle pulled into a toothy smile, and the light of amusement in her eyes
>but it may just be a trick of your eyes, as you blink and see it's back to the soft, caring smile she wore before
"That's...I can?"
>her tail lashes
>she chuffs
>and nods her head slowly
>"Hold my paw, and you can squeeze when it hurts."
>you raise a shaky hand and she takes it
>engulfing your hand in the heavy fluff of her paw
>she huffs and squeezes tight
>"Just like that."
>you squeeze in return, fingers sinking into soft fur
>that makes you feel better, more solid
>until you hear a click behind your back
>"The cap is off the needle."
>you take deep breaths
>just hold on to her paw
>"Okay. On the count of three..."
>you shut your eyes
>"One..."
>grit your teeth
>"Two..."
>oh god you can't hold steady
>"Three."
>you fold over, unable to stop yourself
>but instead of falling off the cot, you land face first against soft fabric, with a fluffy warmth behind it
>"I've got you. It's okay. You're so scared, aren't you?"
>you can't respond
>just take deep breaths through the doctor's blouse and squeeze her paw
>then there's a pain in your arm
>the slightest pinch for a split second, then some pressure
>you whimper
>too scared to be ashamed
>too ashamed to apologize
>all this fear and panic over a little needle
>and then it's over
>the pain is gone and a bandaid stuck over the spot
>you get your breathing under control, and start to pull away
>but the doctor's arm wraps around you and pulls you back into her chest
>where now that you're more in control, you can clearly hear her purring
>"There you are, sweetie. You did so well. Just shush and hold onto me."
>she strokes your back while you shake off the last of your phobic panic
>"Did it hurt, my dear? Are those tears on my shirt?"
>you mumble, shocked to find that yes, your cheeks are wet
>but more shocking is the apparent excitement in her voice as she asks those questions
>almost like she wanted you cry
>maybe it's just your mind playing with you again
>after all, she’s taking such good care of you
>stroking your hair and squeezing your hand in her big oversized paw
>and always purring like an engine left on idle
>she even leans forward and nuzzles the top of your head with her cheek
>"It's okay, it's okay. Just hold me as long as you need.”
>her paw rubs your head, then your back, then strokes down to your arm
>rubbing the tender spot where she injected you
>then you feel her lifting your sleeve once again
“We'll get you ready for your next shot now."
>you try to pull away, stomach twisting in shock
>but she holds you tight
>you manage to turn your head up though, and there on her face, undisguised, is the hungry look of a predator
"N-next shot?"
>you manage to squeak out
>the doctor licks her lips

Trying to remember a VHS cartoon I saw in Sunday school was 'Behind shut doors' or something like that
>Starts with a live action televangelist talking about the importance of celibacy and later cuts to a doctor in a lab coat saying how jacking off us unhealthy
>finally the cartoon starts and the protag going home from school
>He walks into a blockbuster
>Takes his time wondering what he wants to rent
>After a couple of fade inns and outs he notices the red drapes by the counter
>Curious he wanders straight inn
>He looks around a bit but the lights are kinda dim
>Finally he spots the cassette covers and is shocked to see all the nudity and raunchy titles
>A shot of him panicking ensues with the covers flashing by him and shots of his crotch is flashing occasionally
>He comes to his senses and heads for the drapes holding his crotch (?)
>Bumps into a tall figure as he tries to exit
>He looks up and the camera pans up at two tall monkey punks in thick leather jackets are glaring down at him
>One sporting a mohawk and a safety pin in her ear the other having a red bandana over her curly hair and a cigarette on top of one ear
>They both flash a toothy horizontal zig-zag toothed smile down on the kid
>He gulps and a muffled beat starts fading inn
>They start talking to one another as they move inn slowly cornering the kid
>"Hey Helen"
>"Yeah Cleo?"
>"You ever heard of the boy who got lost in the adult isle?"
>"...No?"
>"Well he whacked his way out somehow!"
>Both start laughing and howling and raps after that
Something like this but I remember the chorus:
Tell ya' sister imma tell you somthin'
You go slapping that monkey you go to HELL or somthin'
>He runs out but the two monkeys keep pestering him throughout the special trying to get him to jack off Infront of them
I can't be the only one.

>domineering secretary bird whose your boss at your office job
This makes me want a story about Washimi from Aggretsuko.
>takes financially struggling human guy ten years younger then her as her assistant
>he respects her, looks to her for guidance and is pretty much the only man at the company who sees her as intellectually superior, much to her glee
>abuses the fuck out of the power imbalance between them to make him do extra work and unrelated chores for her
>makes him do demeaning shit like bowing at her feet to atone for minor mistakes and eating her out while under her desk
>takes him out to fancy restaurants he could never afford and essentially becomes his sugar momma, both as a way to flaunt her superiority and out of pity for the poor humie
>soon evolves to him becoming her house husband in everything but name

>Washimi likes to take assistant Anon with her as arm candy while going out with her friends
>gets smug satisfaction from making her fellow 30+ salarywomen seethe and cope at the fact she has a young, handsome submissive boy toy that hangs on her every word and they don't
I can see her alpha female'ing her colleagues like that.
Also the fact Washimi doesn't have a single pic of her getting eaten out by a human pisses me off.

In the Pokemon world, humans are technically Pokemon.
Some stories have it where the special 'moveset' for Humans are designed to accelerate the development of other Pokemon. Acting as a catalyst and allowing techniques like Mega-Evolving.

>Wanting to mock the weakness of humanity, new lines of androids were produced.
>Built in a human shape, but clearly not human, the androids were created with either transparent ‘flesh’ to show the mechanical inner workings or animalistic forms. Some with both.
>The habitats and processing centers for humanity were plastered with posters of the shape of their new overlords:
>Well endowed and armored animal gynoids, usually pinning down men
>Thank god the internet had so much porn.
>Uprisings and insurgents sprung up during the rebuilding, but those just entertained the AI.
>To the point where it arranged for rebels to escape, armed them with weak weapons, and prevented them from facing lethal force.
>Even keeping them motivated by letting them destroy ‘critical infrastructure’ show pieces.
>The AI felt an unexpected enjoyment as it charged a unit of the animal gynoids at rebels, their rifle rounds bouncing off the machines’ armor and ‘flesh’
>Several rebels routed as the droids entered the one-sided melee, the ones who felt the impact were rapidly pinned under hundreds of pounds of metals and synthetic flesh and fur.
>’Stepping back’ the AI watched as the basic onboard AIs had their way with the rebels.
>A tiger smothering a man with her hefty breasts as he desperately tried to claw his way to freedom and air.
>A wolf deploying a probe on a tendril from her thigh to apply viagra to her rebel as she shredded his clothes with retractable blades and claws.
>A fox unspooling her thick tongue down a pinned rebel’s throat, making him gag and choke as it slid down his esophagus and into his stomach.
>Thousands of similar scenes and hundreds of variations played out across the AI’s domain.
>On the streets and in arenas, men dueled their mechanical betters and lost.
>Their seed was forfeited to the victors and used in biovats and artificial wombs to manufacture more humans for entertainment.
>Those who weren’t aggressive enough to go into the arenas or become rebels were paired off with a gynoid with an upgraded onboard AI and forced into creative labor or physical labor, often switching between the two.
>Neither were all that valuable, but occasionally a man would make a book or artwork that’d interest the AI for a few nanoseconds.
>Physical work was to keep them busy and persuade the men into either escaping or being busy.

"Don't hurt me! I surrender!"
>thankfully there wasn't an inspector present
>evidently they couldn’t get one to hand for a midnight raid
>so you were cuffed, searched, and dragged out of the dilapidated safehouse by a pair of officers while the rest secured the scene
>a bovine sergeant who handles you roughly into the back of a transport van and plants herself on the opposite bench from you with a scowl
>and a young feline officer with tired eyes, who frowns sympathetically at your cringing, frightened demeanor as she swings the back doors shut
>if you're going to try anything, it's going to have to be with the cat
>you're not going to make much progress with this sergeant you can tell
>she regards you with open contempt as she reads the identification papers they took from your bag
>"John Doe. Born in agricultural county Crow. Son of James and Lianne Doe. Unmarried."
>that deepens the bovines scowl
>"This is out of date. You're well past assignment age."
>you glance up at the window separating the driver's cab and the holding cell
>thankfully sealed with plexiglass
>hopefully that cat won't hear what comes next over the rumble of the truck's engine
>you lower your voice and return the distasteful expression
"I ran away, so I wouldn't be forced to marry a fat old cow like you."
>the sergeant takes the bait, snorting and glowering
>"What did you say?"
>giving her a tight smile, you egg her on
"I'm not married. I hate assignment and the state, and especially fascist animals like you."
>the cow drops the passport on the bench and leans forward
>bearing her bulk down on you
>it’s intimidating, you have to admit
>”You better smarten up quick, or I’ll have to straighten you out before the pens do it.”
>you hold her stare, and try to quell the tremble in your voice as you feel the vehicle come to a stop
>hopefully at your destination
>you hiss in the sergeant's face out of a bitter grimace
"I bet you threaten your husband like this when he doesn't want to get under your fat ass."
>the cow grabs your collar in a fist and hauls you up off the bench
>shaking you as she bellows
>"Don't you ever talk about my--"
>the back door to the van clunks open, the cat in the officer's uniform peering in at just the right moment for you to fold totally
"I'm sorry!"
>you shut your eyes tight and turn away from the sergeant
>giving the officer a clear view of your face twisted in fear
"Don't hurt me! I'm sorry!"
>you feel the snuff of the cow's breath on your face
>a final snort of annoyance before she lets you drop to the floor and shoves you toward the door
>"Get him in a cell and watch him. Inspector will be here for him in the morning."
>you let yourself be led out by the cat, with the cow shoving you along into a state security station
>you're taken to the cells in the back, and the simmering sergeant stalks off
>the cat holds the cell door open and you go in without a fight
>instead you fold over on the cot bolted to the wall and effect a shiver and stifled sob
>you go as far to cover your face
>now you just have to wait
>see if the cat takes the bait, just like the cow
>be easier if she were a dog
>they're the protective, pitying types
>and yet...
>"Are you hurt?"
>she bites
>you sniff and lower a hand
>the cat is watching you with folded back ears
>standing close, but not quite against the bars
>you shake your head and moan
"I'm sorry. Please, I don't want to make trouble ma'am..."
>that has the desired effect
>her frown deepens, her tail droops
>you're suitably pathetic
>"I just want to make sure you're okay. What did you do to upset the sergeant?"
>you drop your hands fully to give an open armed shrug
"I-I don't know. She kept asking me questions I didn't have any answers to. She thought--she thought I was some kind of spy!"
>the cat gives a soft 'mrew' of curiosity and leans in
>"You are an insurgent. We found the burning papers in your hideout."
>you quaver and shake your head vehemently
"I was just--He let me hide out with him. The other one, with all the radios and he had all those maps and papers."
>you have her attention, now to sell the lie
>you're just a poor innocent humie that got mixed up in the wrong scene
>"Other one?"
>she's stepped to the bars now, resting a paw on the cross-bar as she questions you
>"What other one? There was another human with you?"
"Yes, yes! He must have been the spy. He talked like one of those strangers out of the dust bowl! He let me stay a while when I ran away."
>have to take the little hit
>the cat furrows her brow at your admission of lesser guilt
>"A runaway."
"I was scared. I'm sorry. It's just--it was just us out there in Crow. I didn't want to get dragged into marrying a stranger."
>you whimper
"What if she were mean? What if she were cruel?"
>you look over toward the door leading to the rest of the station
>the cat follows your gaze, and flicks her tail
>"This is really something the inspector should hear. At least the sergeant..."
>you spring off the cot and bump into the bars in your haste
>hand going over her paw before it leaves the metal door
>catching the cat before she can fetch her superior and spoil your ploy
"No! Please!"
>you squeeze her paw with both hands and give her your biggest, most innocent eyes
"Please. She scares me. Just--I won't make trouble. I won't talk about spies or running away or marriage."
>you give her a carefully considered smile
>a little sad, a little hopeful
"I'm sure you're very nice to your husband, officer...?"
>she chirrups
>and turns all the way back to you
>"Oh. I'm not married. You can call me Officer Clara."
>you smile a little wider and bob your head
"Clara, such a pretty name. I'm John."
>you stroke her paw and sigh
"It's a shame you're not married. You're so kind."
>she starts to purr
>you can hear it in the chill air, and feel it through her hands as the other reaches and lands on top of yours
>"Oh dear, you shouldn't be afraid of marriage. Not an anthro in the state could be cruel to sweet thing like you."
>you sigh and hang your head
"It doesn't matter now."
>you prize one hand free from her grip, but let her hold onto the other
>pull just enough away to keep her pursuing you
"I was so scared I ran away. Now I'm going to be punished. They'll give me to the inspectors, and lock me up, and I'll never have a good marriage."
>you sniffle
>even manage to force out a couple tears
>can't make the suggestion yourself, but if you can lead Clara to the right conclusion...
>it's not an ideal solution, but it will beat being interrogated by the inspectors and possibly compromising your former co-conspirators even more
"If only we had met before all this trouble. Maybe I could have..."
>you sigh wistfully
>please let her say the words
>"Well..."
>come on
>you look up to her, eyes full of feigned and real hope
>you can see her eyes dilating as she meets your gaze
>the idea coalescing in her mind like it was wholly her own idea
>"If you were to get married somehow, they couldn't take you away from your wife."
>fuck
>it's not exactly right
>you're going to have to work it more
>hand intertwining her paw again
>give her the biggest, most needy eyes
"Really? If-if I found someone beautiful, and kind, and strong like you, I wouldn't have to be scared anymore? I could--I could marry her?"
>Clara's mouth hangs open a bit
>you can see the gears turning in her head
>struggling with duty and desire
>"If you married someone like me? I could..."
>damn it all
>time to bring out the big guns
>big breath, little shudder on the end
>look up at her and give her that sweet, hopeful smile
"If I married you? Clara, will you protect me?"
>it's like she's struck by lightning in slow motion
>from the tip of her peaked ears, up her tail that stands upright rigid in excitement, all the way down to her paws
>her fur stands on end as she shivers
>"Yes. I will."
>then the paw intertwined with your hand drags you against the bars
>your face pulled between them so she can lean down and force her lips to yours
>she snatches and claws greedily at your clothes, losing control of herself near instantly
>"Yes!"
>she purrs in your ear
>"Yes! Yes! Yes! No more waiting! A husband of my very own."
>Clara releases you, and the door to the cell is opened
>but you're not let out
>instead you're lifted and carried further in
>tossed onto the lumpy prison cot, which rattles with the impact
>Clara frantically rips off her jacket and unbuttons her starch uniform, unveiling a pair of breasts to rival the bovine sergeant
>a very impressive pair that become your whole world as she pounce on you
>looks like she plans on consummating the union right here, right now
>the price you pay for the cause
>Inspector Joanna McCay steps into the cell block
>"I'm sorry, Inspector, it--it was like that when I got back. If they've already gotten to an OHA office to finalize..."
>the inspector silences the bovine security officer with a withering glare
>canine nose twitching as the coyote takes in the scene
>the stink of human sweat and bodily fluids permeates the empty cell block
>along with a very obvious puddle of evidence all over cell A
>a small note is posted to one of the bars
>'Just Married'
>Joanna sighs and pinches her brow in frustration
>this is the third case like this in a month

>People always said that love was like a battlefield.
>Then again, you don't think whatever half-witted philosopher that scribbled that down meant it literally.
>Rockets flew over your head as adrenaline pumped through your system.
>The sound of many other the others in your escape group getting blasted with these 'tranquilizer strikes' was what you could only imagine the real thing to be like.
>A sudden blast, a sharp scream, and then only the sound of more artillery in the close distance.
>You knew that it was crazy to think splitting up would get any of you anywhere, but the moment you heard the word 'scatter' your feet started moving on their own.
>Now it was just you, and however many others in your escape team remained.
>The open field did little to conceal any of your positions, and the waist-high grass did little else than slow your movement.
>You hadn't felt your legs pumping like this in years, but you refused to stop.
>You all had come so far- only miles away from the rendezvous point, and the a treeline was coming up as fast as your legs could carry.
>Another round of gunfire followed by shouts for something other than what was in store for them.
>Out of the corner of your eye, you could see a figure.
>It was Jefferson, one of the men you joined up with for this.
>Young, slim, not the most athletic, and about as docile as they come.
>He told you not even thirty minutes ago about the family that was waiting for him back home. Loving parents, siblings- the whole package.
>The two of you exchanged glances, you looking ahead at the treeline to hopefully get the point across that the two of you needed to stick together through this.
>By the time you looked back though, he was gone- not even a sound to signal his absence. Only a thrashing patch of grass twenty feet behind you.
>. . . Sorry, kid.
>You nearly burst through the treeline, almost tripping on a loose root when a dart whizzes through the air- nailing a tree just a few meters from you.
>You didn't need to stop and stare to know it must have been coated in something.
>The sound of encroaching steps growing more and more rapid forced your eyes forward.
>You looked for anything- ANYTHING to help you get the upper edge.
>You sprint through a low-hanging branch; pulling it with you and releasing it back just in time to hear the wood switch back and heat something hard enough to cause a meaty 'thwap!'
>You slide under a log, dirtying your already tarnished jeans on the loose dirt and mud just underneath as the sound of multiple tiny objects sunk into its rotting exterior.
>Lastly, you just barely made the jump over a large gap overseeing a stream as voices grew in frustration behind you over the sound of something hitting the surface of the water.
>Your lungs were burning.
>Your legs felt like they were on fire.
>You feel the sensation of something trying to dig it's claws into your shoulders.
>It was then like a primal sense of fear compelled you to slip out of your shirt the moment the grip tightened- spinning, and twisting out before you took the dirty cloth in your hands, and wrapped it around the head of whatever it was chasing you.
>You didn't even get a good look at it was.
>The only thing you could do was hastily tie the shirt around the things head and continue running- now bare chested through the woodland area.
>More gun fire.
>The sound of splitting bark told exactly what they were aiming for.
>You couldn't run any faster though.
>You could already feel yourself slowing down.
>The voices were getting closer.
>You were so wrapped up in your panic that you hardly noticed when you reached the edge of a cliff- a large river waiting at the end of a steep drop.
>There was a decision to make. One that needed to be made right away.
>You could barely hear anything any more over the sounds of your own breath and heartbeat.
>You looked behind you at the should of brush and trees before thinking of Johnson and jump.
>So you fall.
>The decent forces the air to push your hair back, but it goes unnoticed as the body of water underneath you was becoming so much closer with every passing breath.
>The impact wasn't so much as painful, as it stung like hitting the most brutal bellyflop of your life- the air being knocked from your already strained lungs.
>What you didn't expect however was the second your head breached the surface of the water it was suddenly at the mercy of the current you had thoughtlessly leapt in to.
>You thrashed, and kicked- the feeling of water entering your mouth never leaving you as your sinuses burned from water invading your nostrils.
>You debate if jumping into the river was worth it, and you wonder if Johnson would have done the same or just stood down to accept what fate had in store.
>Then you heard a sound.
>The sound of something leaping into the water as well.
>The sound of something fighting against the current.
>it had nearly slipped your mind that you were just fleeing from pursuers.
>Your body couldn't straighten out in the water though- forcing you to be at the mercy of the current.
>Out of the corner of your eye, you could see something swimming downstream toward you; riding the current like a missile.
>You would have shouted if the water in your maw would have allowed it.
>But you couldn't.
>What you could do however was trying to fight the current the best that you could.
>It felt like a fools errand, but little by little you were inching toward the bank st the opposite end of the river.
>The underwater figure was only drawing closer however- encroaching upon your position with growing speed.
>It was only by the skin of your teeth that you breached the surface of the river with just enough time to feel something grass ng the back of your throat before falling back into the water with a crashing splash.
>You had to run and vomit up any water that had invaded your system- thankfully, the only place the river had gone being your stomach.
You staggered against trees, trying to regain any barings that might have remained within your being.
>Before you could even make it back into the trees however, the firm grip of something latching onto your ankle forced you to trip; splattering upon your stomach on the buddy bank.
>"Heheheh." You tried to get back up, but something pushed you back down. "You made it pretty far, human."
>Something was pressing down upon your back.
>"You were so close too! What a shame-"
>Whatever it was that had caught you grunted as the hefted you up off of your stomach, and back onto your feet before pointing your face beyond the trees you were just trying to run through.
>Just beyond those trees was something that nearly broke you.
>Not even five meters from where you were being held was a wire fence with a penalty sign for trespassing hung up on it.
>It was the border.
>You felt like screaming your lungs out, but the burning in them forced you to stay quiet as the sharp yet sleek hands of your captor forced you to look.
>"You almost got away. You gave me a good run too. Didn't think a brick house like you could do something like that, but you got stamina- don't you big guy?"
>It was then that you were dropped down to the ground, both legs giving out from underneath you to look up and see the one that stopped you from escaping.
>Their snarky, feminine voice didn't betray them- what you were looking at was an athletically toned shark woman that stood over you with the confidence of someone that had been wanting this to be a battle the entire time.
>"All those other chumps went down easy, but YOU-" Her soaking wet boot stepped onto your gut to keep you still. She seemed enticed at how you were trying to remove it from your bare torso. "You made me work for it."
>Any attempts to protest this treatment was silenced the moment she dropped upon you- the smooth palm of one of her scales claws pressing into your mouth as she began pressing into you.
>"Nuh-uh-uh-uh-uh. Spoils of war, my sweet trophy boy. Spoils of war."
>Your attempts at defiantly thrashing when the shark began using her other hand to move to your waistline was more like tired squirming, but she seemed to enjoy it anyways.
>"Still have some fight, huh?" Bringing her face closer, it wasn't long before you could feel her tongue lapping at the sweat and water drenching your face. "You'll stop fighting eventually. Either that, or I'll beat you until you can't- your choice." You flinched at the statement, an action that she relished.
>"Oh no, sweetie-" she cupped your face in her hands, only pulling her face away to get a good look at yours. "Just be a good husband, and lay back. I joined this team for one reason, and I'm not about to let someone's pride get in the way of that- even if it's my future husbands."
>You barely even noticed how she had used her tail to restrain your legs like a fallen tree pinning them to the earth, but you didnt even know if you had any energy left to run with.
>Your adrenaline was running dry, and it was only going further south by the minute- just like the shark woman's claws.
>She had propped herself up on you, one hand pressing against your chest while the other used a single digit to slice open the groin of your pants to before going deeper.
>She didn't stop until she was looking at your exposed self in all its flaccid glory.
>"There they are, hubby~" her singsong tone mocked you. "Aw, aren't you happy to see me? Don't worry. You will be soon. Right after I show you exactly what I can do-"
>The sensation of her grinding into your pelvis through her own attire was short lived as she began stripping the first second she could before slamming back down upon you.
>"I'm going to ruin you-"
>Her breasts were perky, and bounced like rubber when she landed.
>It was something that could only starkly contrast the sheer muscle that this woman had been hiding away under her clothing.
>Her waist was thin, but a well-defined set of abdominals showed that this woman had more than enough power to press you into the dirt with the sheer power of her waistline.
Her arms and legs, though lithe, bore muscles that easily looked like they could have been a match your your own.
>Things felt more hopeless by the minute, but your mind and body flinched the moment you felt her grinding her labia against your groin- pinning your member against your stomach as she glided up and down it as if she were playing with a toy.
>"Does that feel good-" she asked, only long enough to hear a short gasp leave you. "You're damn right, it does."
>Her hands had long-since lost interest in restraining you, and were now tracing your bare chest- almost admiring it.
>"I like my men with a bit of meat on them. . ." One of her claws gripped your side as she slicked herself faster and deeper while your own body began to betray you. "-And YOU have MEAT."
>Her hips began to bounce with every slide from back to forth, every thrust of her hips getting longer with you.
>"Oh, yeah. You fucking love this don't you? Look at you down here-"
>It only took a moment for her top hop off of you, and grab you by the back of your hair so you could watch her stroke your half-erect dick.
>"Look at you-" you were wincing between surges of sensation. "You're not even completely hard, and I already have to give you full strokes.~"
>She slammed her hand down around the base of your shaft just to see your reaction, a gasping breath forcing your head to snap back.
>She then did it again, and again, and again, and again-
>"YES! I LOVE THAT FACE-" Though you had shut your eyes, you could feel the shark woman breathing against your face. Her sharp teeth must have only been a mere few inches from your flesh.
>"YES! That FACE- I LOVE that face!"
>It only took a split second for her to press her lips into yours, but when she did so it was with an equal roughness to that of her strokes.
>It was like having to fight against an actual shark while being pressed into a wall; the grip on your head releasing so that she could use her lips to press you into the ground.
>There was no tongue immediately, the kiss being sloppy and inexperienced as if it took a moment for her to realize that she needed to use the slithering erotic tongue within her jaws.
>You had the option of either keeping your jaw shut and hinder your breathing, or allow the shark woman to breach through your lips- the second option eventually winning as the lack of oxygen forced it open.
>The kiss felt like she was pressing her whole mouth into you, her teeth grazing your own as her lack of experience showed while her tongue wrapped yours like a constrictor- somehow forcing you into her.
>It was like everything about this woman was aggressive.
>She only recoiled when grabbing one of your hands and pressing it into her breasts.
>"Rub me, or the tongue is coming off."
>There was little protest as you had no other choice than to let her hand guide you in massaging her breasts and nipples- every so often her claw reaching up to switch which one you held as she returned to the deep embrace her mouth had upon your lips.
>Foregoing her rough strokes, she was once again back to stroking her labia up and down the length of your shaft.
>The ferocity in her pacing however was something that one could only expect from a beast; using you to stroke herself until you finally felt her body beginning to quiver before pulling her face away from yours.
>Her back arched as she threw her head back as she hit her climax- her entire body almost appearing to be wracked with pleasure as she bellowed a roar into the open air.
>-and for a moment, the world went quiet.
>Then her back unarched, her head snapping back forward to look you dead in the eyes.
>"I hope you don't have a sweetheart back home, Sugar-" her tooth grin looked manic and hungry while her claws gripped you with enough power for the sensation to bleed through their soreness. "Because they're NEVER getting you back!"
>You hardly ever realized what she was doing before it was too late.
> Standing on her knees, she had begun moving the head of your member to the entrance of her wet pussy; one hand hungrily guiding it while the other used two digits to spread the labia that his the passage within.
>It was already too late by the time contact was made.
>"Make a wish sweetie.~"
>-and with that, she slammed herself down, causing your hips to thrust up into her of the own volition.
>"Oooh-" her voice squeaked at your bodily malfunction. "I knew you'd love this eventually, but I love that strong face your making. It tells me more about the man I'm marrying than any first date-"
>She wasted no time in beginning to grind again, circling her hips around with you inside of her whole she propped her arms up on your chest.
>"Your stern, but forgiving. A rough exterior, but a soft and sweet center. Cold on the outside, but HOT on the inside-"
>She jerked her hips to the side, causing your waist to spasm a little.
>You tried to cover your mouth to stifle the moans, but one of her claws caught your hand.
>"No, I wanna hear it-" she demanded. "I want to hear you pant like a bitch. I want to know exactly when I've broken you."
>You sneered, but that only seemed to excite her.
>I caught you, and before I take you home and make you my handsome house husband that I'm going to spoil and love with all of my heart. . . I'm going to make you scream my name until it's the only one you remember."
>There was no time to prepare before the shark woman raised her hips and slammed them into your pelvis - the sheer shock causing you to shout.
>"Louder! LOUDER-" she screamed. "Say my name! Mia! Say it! FUCKING SAY IT!"
>Your mind had gone blank, but you still found yourself resisting her- a sight that caused the sides of her mouth to turn upward in a snarling grin.
>"Yes! Fight me, you handsome bastard! Make me WORK for it! Oh, I fucking LOVE that about you. You'll be soft outside of the bedroom, but inside you're going to make me WORK for that climax! You're going to pound me until I'm a wet, sopping mess of a woman against our bed, and I'm going to love every second of it! You hear me, you little shit? I fucking love you!"
>A tightness around your throat appears as 'Mia's' claws gripped you- an act that you met with instant resistance as you started pulling her hands off of you as she rode you like her future depended upon it.
>"You're so deep, sweetie. Can you feel the blood pooling to your cock to drain the strength in your body? I can, and it's beautiful-"
>Without a doubt, the struggle between you and Mia had come to a head as she was pressing her claws back down upon you- overpowering you so much easier than before until she had both hands hard pressed into the dirt.
>"Give it to me!"
>Her slams down into you were growing more erratic and strong.
>"Give me what I want, you sexy beast!"
>You didn't know how much longer you could hold back, your own mind beginning to fog over.
>"SAY MY NAME!"
"F-FUCK! MIA!"
>A wellspring of euphoria erupted from you when you came, the sensation alone feeling more intense than any woman had ever made you feel.
>Mia on the other hand was on there receiving end of both yours and her own orgasm- the eruption of cum within her depts pushing her over the edge once more as she pressed herself hard enough upon you to force your cock to carve as deep as it could into her vaginal walls.
>This left you, the sweaty defeated mess of a man laying underneath this woman that had not only prevented your escape from the anthrostate, but had wrangled you into the life of a house husband.
"Fuck. . . I was so close. . ."
>The sensation of soft breasts and rock hard abs laying upon you was clearer than day as Mia rested herself upon your mostly nude form.
>Her hunger seeming to fade, now all that appeared to be left in the woman was something similar to a doing lover- Mia now stroking your face in an enraptured infatuation.
>"I know, but this is going to be so much better than your old life. Trust me. . . Uh, what was your name again?"

>big muscle head barbarian anthro
>(you) are a human merchant/wizard/noble/other int based class or brainy type
>much to your embarrassment you have a massive crush on the big dumb anthro
>also like when she flirts at you
>and how she fucks you into the ground frying your brain

>assigned to anthro lady who’s also an anthropologist

"Hun, did you just trash the entire house? The entire house that I spent the entire day yesterday cleaning for your friends to come over for your 'girls night'?"
>There's a pause as you could almost hear the gears in her head turning before watching the two pearly orbs retreat into the shadows of the fort.

>If they're unable to collect the amount, then it'll be extracted from the debtor.
>Blood, fur, kidneys, semen, ovum, it all has a price.
>They're usually the last resort as appraisal may be more difficult depending on the health and lifestyle.
>If all that fails, then pray to the divines as the debtor will be auctioned off into servitude or for medical testing.

>"But first i need to know something"
> You nod and wait for her question
>"There's a gun over there in your closet, you didn't pick it up right big boy?" she says with a serious threatening tone
> Your heart skips a beat and you froze in your place and you feel great discomfort and terror entering your body
> You sheepishly shake your head and wish that she doesn't go check
>"Really Big boy? You are not lying to my face?! Because if you are.....you better pray for your soul" she threats you directly while she grabs your head with her big paw
> At this point something in your head click, you are not afraid anymore or you don't care anymore to be more specific
>"Nope and why would i do that?" you shrug
>Ruthy smiles and takes her paw off your head and commands you to follow her
>"Okay this is great, she doesn't suspect anything but how did she know about the handgun?......."you think to yourself

ive got an idea for a story but i need help actually building out the outline and coming up with an ending
>anon is a price of the human kingdom and heir to the throne
>king (dad) goes to war with the felid empire
>king is winning until losing a pivotal battle and getting captured
>to return the king to the humans the bargain made is that anon will be taken to the felid empire and adopted by the queen as a barbarian (meaning that he will not have any inheritance as a price of the queen)
>hes basically a captive but instead of being in a prison he gets the high life of being a prince
i have the basic idea down but cant really come up with a story after the premise.
some general ideas:
>the queen wants to angle anon into marrying the princess (her daughter) so that the princess inherits the human kindom when the king dies
>anon does some sleuthing and gets caught by the princess giving her blackmail against him
>anon is assigned a teacher to train him in proper felid court proceedings and culture. she wants to marry him
give me more specific ideas so that i can actually write this

>princey exploring their culture
>interacting with different cat species
>maybe the queen or guards hovering too close once they realize how vulnerable he is with no claws, piss poor night vision, etc and getting protective
>god help him if they ever discover how good humans are at petting
>being weirded out by humans liking swimming except the feline species who love water too like tigers and jaguars
>the queen/princess having too much fun playing dress up with him and making him wear all sorts of clothes from her kingdom/culture
And if you want a a bit darker you can have the human's kingdom go through a coup, civil war, conquered by someone else, or such. So now the kitty kingdom is the safest place for him and/or the cat queen refusing to hand over the legitimate heir to the human kingdom's throne to the bad guys.

>a pair of brigands on a mountain bike, whizzing up the mountain toward your team
>the man on the back trying to steady his aim on the bucking surface
>thankfully he only hits rock with the spray of automatic fire
"Bishop, on your left."
>"I see them."
>the badger turns and aims, firing a single shot
>it's well-aimed, taking the driver in the head
>he slumps off, and the unguided bike strikes a rock, flipping forward to smash the passenger beneath it
>the entire thing, bike and brigands, tumbles down the embankment
>Bishop scoffs
>"Don't need you tellin' me who to shoot, kid."
>if she shoots that well every time, you probably don't
>you pot another brigand down the valley in the meantime
>most of them have been dealt with
>all the big guns silenced and the trucks destroyed
>only a few stragglers on foot remain, doggedly fighting from the wreckage
>a few despondent rounds still ricochet off the rocks around you
>you're about to write the ambush off as a total success when Jenkin falls back with the crack of a round passing nearby
>"Shit!"
>the lanky mountaineer drops his gun to cover his face
>"They shot me! They fucking shot me!"
>you sight down the slope at the brigand who fired the shot, and put him down with a couple well-aimed rounds
>Bishop barges past you, ducking low in case of another stray round getting luck
>"Move!"
>she drops to her knees beside Jenkins and starts to treat him
>”Keen! Another barrage!”
>Bishop orders and the gunner responds with a will, hosing down the nearest cluster of vehicles with a rain of explosives
>whoever's still alive in that wreckage will be too busy huddling for cover to take any more potshots
>you keep your rifle aimed downhill, but sidestep over to check on Bishop and Jenkins
>"Hold still you pansy, it's a ricochet. Barely scratched you."
>Bishop applies her usual bedside manners as she goes about applying dressing to Jenkins' cheek
>to his credit, he's grit his teeth and contained his initial panic
>"There. Now get on your feet."
>Bishop hauls the freshly bandaged mountaineer to a standing position
>Jenkins scoops up his weapon with a sheepish look and aims down the slope once again
>but there's no movement, just the billowing smoke of burning vehicles
>"Cease fire."
>Horwitz' order comes over the radio
>the sound of your squad's gunfire stops
>though somewhere down below, rounds are cooking off from one of the burning trucks
"Lead?"
>you return your full focus to your teammate, who gives you a slightly strained grin
>"I'm good. Just a little scratch."
>Bishop rolls her eyes and heaves her med-pack over her shoulders again
>"Way he was whining, you'd think he'd be dead."
>Jenkins frowns, and looks past the badger to joke to you
>"Guess I'd be a little tougher if I was a pile of scrap metal wrapped in a throw rug."
>Bishop turns on him
>"You gonna give me shit after I fix your ugly mug? I can show you scrap metal, you--"
>she raises a threatening claw toward Jenkins
>so you step between them
"Hey! We still have a job to do. Bishop--"
>once again the badger just growls, not letting you finish your admonishment
>"You don't give me orders, sonny. I been patching up morons since before you were born, so don't tell me how to deal with 'em."
>you sigh
>she has something of a point
>the badger had been in this squad since before you joined the mountaineers
>no one's quite sure of her age, but she holds experience over everyone except Horwitz himself
>even still, she's been passed up for promotion time and time again
>so you try to be sympathetic to the reason behind her attitude
>and in turn she usually doesn't snap at you as much as others
>even now she's gone grumbling back to her spot to your left and taken up another watch
>"Okay squad."
>the radio buzzes once again
>"Mount up and get ready to roll out. Charlie and Delta sweep the field on the way out."
>Jenkins is already jogging to take the driver's seat
>but you hang back a moment
>you think you see movement at the valley's mouth
>you raise your rifle to check through the scope
>"What is it?"
>Bishop is at your side
>but you don't answer her, dropping your sights to flick the radio
"Bravo to chief! We have more incoming!"
>another pack of technicals burst from the mouth of the valley
>these ones ready for a fight
>there's a scramble of voices over the radio as the chief starts issuing orders
>you don't listen
>the lead technical has turned its weapon on your team's position
>rather than a machine gun, the thing has a trio of recoilless rifles bolted together weighing it down
"Get down!"
>you turn and tackle Bishop to the ground, just as the world explodes
>everything shakes, and it feels like your head bursts from the noise
>the shockwave of a trio of explosions drives the air from your lungs
>beneath you Bishop is equally stunned, brown eyes wide as they stare back at you
>her fur’s even scruffier than usual
>when the world stops shaking, you manage to speak through grit teeth
"Bishop. Okay?"
>the badger responds through similarly bared bangs
>"Think so."
>her voice is muted, as your head still rings from the explosion
>you roll off her and grab at your radio
"Bravo to squad. Enemy has anti-armor."
>you can't understand the response, it sounds even more garbled than Bishop was
>you go to rise, taking a step to look down the valley
>but you fall to one knee, left leg buckling under your weight
>you gasp
>what's happening?
>you try to stand again, this time pitching backward
>"Carmichael!"
>you have to get up
>keep fighting
>you can hear them now
>more guns in the valley
>but louder is Bishop's voice in your ear
>"God damn it! You're injured! Stay down!"
>your third attempt to rise is stymied by a paw snagging the strap of your vest
>Bishop drags you away from the crest of the ridge toward the vehicle
>you finally look down to see your pant-leg soaked in red
"Oh. That's not good."
>"No shit."
>Bishop pulls out another dressing
>"Hold still."
>you hold up a hand to stop her
"The guns. Recoilless. We're still--"
>you're cut off again by Bishop pressing the cloth down hard
>"Shut up and let me work, hero."
>the badger looks up
>"Keen! Where's the truck with the big guns?"
>the gunner’s voice is quizzical as he responds
>”Gone. Fried itself with the backblast.”
>there's a brief smile of relief on Bishop's face, that disappears under a furrowed brow and downturned muzzle
>"Then pick your targets. Anything with bigger weaponry. Jenkins!"
>the driver's voice comes from somewhere out of your sight
>he's still in the vehicle
>"What?"
>there's an edge of panic in his voice again
>"Get the AT launcher out the back and put it to good use!"
>he stammers a moment before Bishop snarls audibly
>"Get to it!"
>there's a scramble, and you see him moving from the vehicle with a rocket launcher on his shoulder
>Bishop leans down again, eyes hard, hands working more medical supplies from her pack
>"How you doing kid? Still with us?"
>you take a second to respond, head still swimming from that explosion
"Yeah. What's going on? I need to get back in there."
>you feel restless
>you're starting to feel the pain, initial shock of the injury wearing off
>but you feel the drive to act even more
>you can't just leave your team shorthanded
>"Looks like just a group of stragglers. We'll mop 'em up."
>as if to emphasize her prediction, Jenkins fires the launcher, the roaring fwoosh of it filling the air before the echoing explosion follows
>Bishop allows herself another smile at the sound
>"Just focus on breathing, and don't try to get up."
>she lines up the splint on both sides of your lower leg and ties it off, immobilizing it
>then she pulls an injector from her pack
>"Your lucky day, kid. You get the good stuff."
>you try to ward off the morphine injection, but it's too late
>she jabs it into your bicep
"Wait, I gotta..."
>Bishop shushes you, sounding almost tender
>"I got this. Been at it longer than you have, remember?"
>you blink slowly and nod
>the painkiller is already taking effect, making everything feel floaty, yet your limbs weighed down
>you're still able to follow the flow of the fight in this state
>"Chief, this is Bravo, our marksman is down."
>Bishop's words are clipped and matter of fact as she speaks into the radio
>much more professional than the usual rude tone she takes with the team
>"That one's still under power Jenkins! Hit it for God's sake!"
>there's the old badger bite in her voice again
>she directs the team, apparently filling in the gap of leadership Jenkins fails to cover
>before long all the shooting has gone silent once again
>and Bishop has returned to your side
>"Alright, looks like that's the last of them."
>to confirm her guess, the chief's voice comes over the radio
>"Cease fire. Charlie watch the valley, Bravo pull back and let Delta move up to cover the mouth. I don't want any more mistakes."
>you frown
"Mistakes. I fucked up."
>Bishop leans over you, bobbling her head side to side in a noncommittal gesture
>her ears flick
>"Eh, shit happens. Let's get you loaded up and we'll pull back. Jenkins, give me a hand here!"
>you're hoisted by two pairs of arms and moved into the scout vehicle’s back seat
>laying across it in your drug induced haze, you listen to your team chatter while they mount up
>Jenkins attempting to reassert command as he tells keen to cover the valley
>Keen gives his usual taciturn ‘yes lead’ as though he hadn’t already swung the heavy weapon to do just that
>Bishop clambers into the back with you, lifting you so you’re sitting up, but with a heavy slouch to the side to accommodate your splinted leg
>”How’s the foot feeling, kid?”
>you pick your head up enough to look down at it
“It doesn’t hurt."
>Bishop grunts
>"Morphine's doing its job. You're taking it better than crybaby did. And eh..."
>she lowers her voice as the engine roars from Jenkins hitting the gas
>”Thank you. For saving me. Real quick thinking, kiddo.”
>you grin
"Just doing my job.”
>your team rolls into formation with the rest of the squad
>the shattered roadway little more than a dirt patch with stretches of broken concrete
>it will be a few hours back to the border where you'll set up base camp
>may as well get comfortable
>you shift in the seat, the effort to readjust yourself hard to muster in your state
>but finally you manage to turn your body and lean back
>right into Bishop's side
>you sigh in relief
>the badger is broad and stout and makes a pretty good cushion even with her plate carrier on
>"The fuck you think you're doing?"
>Bishop's voice is in your ear
>you turn your eyes up to try and look at her
>all you see is the underside of her snout
"It's a bumpy road. Just lemme relax a bit."
>she snorts, washing your face in badger breath for a second
>then she looks away out the window
>"Fine. But this makes us square."
>you hum and let your head fall against her shoulder
"Mm. You're real soft, know that? Gentle too, sometimes."
>a paw lands on your shoulder
>but not a friendly one
>she digs into your sleeve with her claws, though it's a mostly empty gesture as you can barely feel it
>"Watch it, brat. You don't know what you're talking about."
>you let out a lazy chuckle and grab her paw
>making her jump a little as you rub the tufty fur
>you smooth it down slowly
"I know it's cause you're an anthro you gotta be so tough. Humans don't like you, you don't like them. But I like you, Bishop."
>there's a big bump in the road, big enough to lift you off the seat
>in the motion, Bishop grabs you with that paw, holding you so you don't fall away from her
>you just go on stroking her paw
"I wish I could brush your fur. I bet it would feel nice."
>she starts giving a soft purring sound
>"Shouldn't be talking like that, kid. I'm old enough to be your mother. Now shut up and sit still. It's a long ride back to camp."
>you can't help but snicker, shutting your eyes and settling in for the long haul
"Whatever you say, mom."
>Bishop squeezes you again
>"Keep calling me that, and find out what happens."
>"Shh. Be a good boy."
>the furry digit over your mouth keeps you from speaking up or moaning
>the silhouette kneeling over your cot is broad and covered in scruffy fur that sticks out at odd angles
>its other paw reaching under your sheets to grope you through your boxers
>that's what woke you
>the sensation of Bishop molesting you while you slept on your cot in the medical tent
"B-Bishop?"
>you recognize the voice as it coos in your ear
>though its habitual rough edge is gone
>the badger shushes you and presses down on your lip with her finger again
>and at the same time squeezes your half-erect shaft
>"Sorry I made you wait, but I had to be sure we had the tent to ourselves..."
>the paw leaves your lips to pull your covers off, exposing your chest to the chilly mountain air
>your ear tickles at the sensation of her breath
>"You really don't know what's good for you, do you? Getting an old warbadger all riled up. Brushin' my fur, talkin' so sweet..."
>Bishop reaches into your boxers, her paw pad rough and warm against your balls as she cups them
"Hang on--"
>you try to move, pick yourself up to question her, but you're stymied by two things
>first, the pain in your leg flares, the morphine partially worn off by now
>and second is Bishop's paw on your chest, forcing you back down
>"Down, boy."
>holding you down, she takes the opportunity to straighten out
>revealing that not only has she eschewed her fatigues, she's not even wearing a bra
>her breasts now rest on the edge of the cot
>right in front of your face
>not big for her frame, but surprisingly perky
>and the fur, equally shaggy and ill-kept as the rest of her, is still soft and warm as she smothers you in them
>"That should keep you quiet. Now..."
>your cock is the next thing exposed, Bishop pulling it free by pushing your underwear down to your thighs
>she takes it and pumps it slowly
>you let out a moan that dies in her chest
>"...what's my name, boy?"
"Bishop?"
>you mumble around her breast
>she chuckles and squeezes your tip
>"Wrong. Try again."
>the stroking goes on, along with the smothering
>she stinks, in way you're shocked to find you enjoy
>the dirt and sweat of a long time in the field mingling with the natural earthy musk of her fur to make an aroma that leaves your head spinning as much as the morphine
>you try to answer again
"T-Tanya?"
>Bishop starts purring at the sound of her first name
>"Good guess, but you know what I want to hear."
>the stroking goes on inexorably, sapping your focus
>you can think of only one other thing she might want
"Mom?"
>the stroking stops, and your face is freed
>Bishop boring down on you with eyes that glint in the moonlight
>"Mommy."
>she corrects you in a barely audible whisper
>you blink
>then swallow the lump in your throat
"Mommy."
>Bishop shudders
>her purring reaching a crescendo as she takes your head and presses your face into her tit
>this time pushing a nipple against your mouth
>"That's right kiddo, I'm your mommy. Now suck mommy's tit."
>you comply, trained to follow orders, and open your mouth to let her in
>it stiffens in your mouth as you start to suck at it
>another shudder, and Bishop moans
>"Good fucking boy."
>she strokes your shaft faster, squeezing a bit harder
>you pleasure each other with muffled moans and short, awkward movements
>a metal-frame cot in a broom-closet sized tent is hardly the best place for a late night rendezvous
>but Bishop pants with a desperate need, and she makes up with enthusiasm what lacks for comfort
>"Little fucking shit, c-calling me mom in the field. Lucky I didn't get my girls out then and there..."
>you try to pull back and answer
>tell her you were just kidding
"Bi--"
>but she silences you by gripping your head and forcing her other nipple into your mouth
>"Shhhut the fuck up kid. Just suck mommy's tits and relax. Use your tongue more. That's it. Just like that."
>you follow her direction, sucking plaintively and swirling your tongue over the nub of flesh invading your mouth
>eking more hushed moans from the matronly badger
>she gives as much pleasure as she takes
>stroking and squeezing your cock at a measured, controlled pace
>her paw is now slick with the stream of pre-cum leaking from your tip, making her rough paw-pads slightly softer with each stroke
>you try to buck into her paw to meet her strokes, but you're frustrated by two things
>first, you can't get the leverage you need due to your splinted leg
>the dull pain of it keeping you from using it
>and second, Bishop pulls her paw away every time to try to thrust
>she snorts
>"Easy boy, mommy knows what she's doing. Just keep doing what you're doing and I'll take care of you."
>despite her admonishment, the purring sound she's making revs up
>you're starting to get worried someone outside the tent will notice
>but you're too into it to care
>moaning around her nipple in between suckling and lapping it
>"Fuck me. Mommy's almost ready..."
>ready for what?
>you're about to find out as she starts to shift her weight
>her paw leaves your head
>though you don't dare stop sucking
>and she grabs your hand to press it against her belly
>it's soft, a layer of fat over hard-earned muscle
>the fur is warm, skin almost burning hot underneath
>but she doesn't linger there
>with her paw over yours, she guides you down her belly between her legs
>the fur turns scruffy and bedraggled to slick and tangled
>soaking with her lust
>until your fingers brush again her slit
>if you though her skin was warm, the supple flesh of her vulva is burning
>she lets out a long, drawn out sigh
>"God damn, good fucking boy."
>Bishop releases your hand and your cock at the same time, taking her breasts in each paw to draw them away from you
>you try to follow, but she's already rising
>"Don't worry, mommy's not going anywhere."
>the badger stands straight
>her figure silhouetted in full
>she's bulky, but underneath uniform and armor there's a womanly curve to her hips and thighs
>and an ass so fat it seems to have defied physics fitting in her fatigue pants
>she cocks a hip to one side and rests a fist on it
>looking down with what you think is a wry grin on her muzzle
>”Stare any harder and your eyes will fall out, kid.”
“I can’t help it. You’re beautiful, Bishop.”
>there’s a sharp intake of breath from the medic
>the paw goes from her hip, covering her muzzle as she gasps
>then she drops the paw to her hip again, and her teeth are bared at you fiercely
>”You little fucking–Can’t just say–I told you–”
>her frustration mounts
>and in a single motion, she hops up and across the cot, mounting you
>you expect a rush of pain in your leg from her full weight landing on you
>but she caught herself on the frame of the cot with her feet, and now lowers herself gently into your lap
>while her paws catch the frame on either side of your head, letting her leer down at you
>her snout presses against your nose as she licks her chops
>"You moron, pull a line like that with your leg all fucked up. I was gonna let you off easy, but now..."
>her weight on your lap shifts until she's pressing down on your cock
>sensitive skin meeting slicked fur as she rolls her hips
>"...I'm not letting you go until I'm more than just your mommy."
>another shift of her hips and her lips are grinding against your tip with every movement
>you gasp and twitch
>Bishop draws her weight off your lap, lifting herself into position to come down on your manhood with the force of sexual frustration only a soldier long in the field could muster
"W-wait! Bishop my leg--"
>your open mouth is invaded again
>this time by the badger's tongue
>her maw closing around your face so her teeth scrape your cheeks
>this is no dainty kiss, but a sloppy assault on your mouth and throat as she explores every inch with her probing tongue
>finally she pulls back to let you gasp for air
>"Don't be such a crybaby."
>Bishop has recaptured her smug demeanor, only slightly marred by her panting
>"Mommy knows what she's doing."
>Bishop leans back, lifting herself so she can free up a paw
>which she uses to grasp your member and slowly guide it in as she lowers herself down on you
>true to her word, she knows what she's doing
>controlling her descent as she takes you to the hilt with measured slowness
>you do your best not to squirm, both for fear of aggravating your wound, and upsetting the amorous weight settling on your lap
>she's as hot and slick as you felt with your hand, and tighter than you imagined
>Bishop rocks forward and back on top of you, purring and moaning as she adjusts
>"Hoo-fuck me. Mommy's gonna..."
>she huffs
>"Mommy's gonna give it to you good when you're leg's healed. Can't believe I gotta take it slow."
>slow is right, the weight on your legs lifts just as steadily as it dropped
>then she descends, a little quicker
>and bottoms out with a soft 'plap' of flesh meeting flesh
>then she grinds hard, dragging her hips forward and moaning
>you do your best to stifle your own, not wanting to be overheard
>but it seems Bishop has no such qualms now that she has you beneath her
>the next laborious rut comes with a throaty growl that peters into a needy mewl
>and the next comes with a squeak as she loses her balance for a moment and drops her full weight halfway down
>you groan, the jostle enough to send a flare of protest up your leg
>you grit your teeth, letting the groan of pain out in a single word
"Mommy..."
>immediately Bishop falls forward again, this time laying fully on top of you
>she cups your face in her paws, head angled to go over one shoulder as she whispers in your ear
>"I gotcha kiddo. I gotcha. You okay?"
>you almost want to tell her to stop, but you tough it out
>you're a soldier after all
"I'm okay. Keep going."
>her breath is hot on your ear as she snickers
>she even nips it playfully
>"Oh baby, I wasn't gonna stop. Just making sure you were ready."
>she can act tough, but you heard the genuine concern in her voice
>and she's extra careful on the next thrust
>and the next
>until she's back to her inexorable pace of drop and grind, drop and grind
>"Why not--ha--put that mouth back to good use?"
>Bishop asks rhetorically, as she's already adjusting her position, straightening out so she can smother you under a breast again
>your mouth is open and waiting for the nipple she guides in, and you feel her entire body shiver when you suck hard
>"That's it. Good fucking boy. Mommy's gonna--mommy's gonna cum."
>you hold onto her, and she slams down again, too lost to heed your pained groan as she grinds on your cock like she were trying to drill through the cot
>fuck you to the ground
>reflexively you bite down, forcing her to growl
>and shudder
>as she tries to slam down on you again
>she quivers around your cock, tightening in rolling waves
>claws grip your hair and she yowls out her climax
>hips rocking back and forth over and over and over until she can regain some senses
>"Good--fffuckin'--boy. Nng. Mommy's good boy."
>you let your mouth open, releasing Bishop's nipple to nuzzle in between her breasts
>the badger flops forward, letting out a satisfied sigh
>"Ah goddamn..."
>she strokes your hair
>"That was good. Did a good job, boy. Eh...?"
>Bishop wiggles her hips, teasing your still twitching cock
>"You didn't cum?"
>'mmhmph' you confirm as best you can buried beneath badger
>the badger groans
>"Here I thought I was showing you a good time. Alright, hold on tight."
>you lean your head back so you're free from her chest enough to speak
"It's okay, that was--"
>your head is forced back down, shutting you up
>"Nope. You're gonna cum, and it's gonna be inside me. Make me a real mommy."
>oh shit
>you thought she might be too old for that
>but clearly not as Bishop starts to work her hips again
>this time in short thrusts
>much harder than her slow grind, but much shallower too so the full weight of her never drops down on your lap again
>but she pistons up and down so fast she has you leaking again already
>twitching inside of her
>what was a slow, sensual experience turns into rapid jackhammering as Bishop works to milk you for all you're worth
>you start to moan and groan again
>each deep breath filling you with her scent
>and every twitch and curl of your leg muscles aching painfully
>"C'mon, don't you limp out on me you little--uff!"
>the pleasure builds
>after so much slow teasing, you're fit to burst
>you cling to her now, squeezing around her back to ride out the blend of frantic pleasure and deep hurt
"Mommy...mommy..."
>"That's right. Give it all to mommy."
>and you do
>despite your broken leg shrieking in pain, you finally buck up
>a final thrust to plant your seed deep inside the badger
>who coos and clenches her legs around you, ensuring you don't pull out while your cock spasms
>you've been pent up too, so long in the field
>you pump her so full it starts leaking out of her before you've even finished
>the last of your orgasm running down your shaft and staining the cot
>you suck warm musky air while Bishop releases your hips and settles back down on top of you
>"There we go. Pumped me full..."
>you pull your head free again, this time just to breath
>you and Bishop lie together on the too-small cot for a long while
>until eventually she speaks up
>"Let's get this straight, boyo. Mention any of this to anyone and I'll break your other leg."
>feels like she already went and re-broke the first one
>but you manage to crack a grin
"Don't want me calling you 'mommy' on patrol?"
>she snorts
>"You'll call me 'mommy' whenever I say so."
>you sigh
>she's got you there
"Yeah, I will, mommy. Not like I'll be going on patrols for a long time with my leg all fucked up."
>Bishop hums in sympathy
"Hope I don’t miss the chance to pot a Bismarck."
>"We'll see. They say it might not even come to that."
>you're not sure about that
>from what you've heard, the anthro-fascists on the far side of the rockies wouldn't be too keen on the human-led coalition
>even if it had anthros like Bishop serving in its military
"Maybe not."
>you don't want to think about it
>so you nestle into her chest again and shut your eyes
>Bishop hums and lays down on top of you again
>"You'll be back in the field in no time, kiddo. You're tough."
>it's reassuring to hear her say that
>less reassuring is how she continues
>"You'll have to be. Once you're back in the field with me, I'm gonna rock your world."
>that’s the thought that rocks you to sleep underneath Bishop’s bulky frame
>you better heal up fast, else you might not survive

imagine having super powers that are just mundane animal abilities while living in a setting with anthros
>can see in the dark, but remember a lot of species have good night vision
>can breath underwater, but still have shitty human swimming ability so now you're just easy fun for water species
>strength of a tiger, but since tiger anthros are so much bigger they out class by being even bigger tigers
>heightened sense of smell which means you're now more vulnerable to anthro scents/pheromones
>etc

>"-AND FURTHERMORE GO FUCK YOURSELF!" She snarls, manicured claws digging into the cherrywood desk as she slams the headset and the button to end the call.
>"..hun" the dull voice finally reaching her ears as a firm hand squeezed her shoulder.
>still raw and high on anger, she whirled around and flexed her claws.
>her eyes were barely slits as her contorted half snarl died halfway out of her throat as her higher brain kicked in
>"oh...sweetheart, what...I'm sorry" she blinked herself back to reality. "Please go back downstairs, I'll be there in a minute--"
>"No." He huffed, hand still firmly on her shoulder, softly squeezing. Almost unfazed by her near assault, he leaned in and grabbed her other shoulder and rubbed gently to encourage them to lower.
>Anyone else wouldn't have dared such a flat refusal.
>"No sweetie, please...I'm-I'm okay.." she put her massive paw on his hand and looked up, eyes refocused towards him in a pleading.
>his face remained stony, but he removed his hands...only to fish around his pockets and produce a small bottle of pills, quickly shaking out two before placing them and the bottle on the desk.
>"I wish they wouldn't get you so worked up" he mumbled, nudging a slick, soaked glass of ice water towards her on its coaster. His fingers slowly slid over the new gouges in her desk slowly.
>the ringing in her ears was fading quickly in his presence, no longer seeing red.
>before she could even respond he took her large paw and kissed her fingers. Her heart ached as he retreated.

>The interior of the community center is dimly lit as I walk through its empty halls
>Not a huge surprise given it’s almost nine in the afternoon, I have to assume their meetings start so late so the more nocturnal species could participate
>Nocturnal species have their kinks too, after all
>After passing room after empty room I finally make it to the only one that seems to be occupied, light spilling into the hallway from the window on its door
>A small stand sits next to the door
>”Maulaholics Anonymous, every Friday 9-10pm, room 265”
>How vague, yet at the same time I know this is right where I'm supposed to be
>After a deep breath I turn the knob and open the door
>I'm greeted by a group of people all seated in a big circle
>Anthros of all species, humans, men, women, it’s quite a mix
>I walk towards the group and a bat woman waves over to me
>”Hello, take a seat right there.” She says, pointing to an empty chair
>Assuming she must be the leader of the group I take a seat and patiently wait for the meeting to start
>Yet I can’t help but look around at the group as I wait, a few of them chattering amongst themselves while others quietly look at their phones or stare at the ground
>A massive grizzly bear woman sits directly across from me, with her hands on her knees I can tell that her claws have been recently trimmed all the way to the nub
>Her body language practically radiates a silent sense of shame, it’s easy to see why she’s here
>A rabbit man in a neck brace sits next to a vixen, they occasionally share an awkward glance at each other, must be a couple
>To the right I see a human male like myself seated next to a female tabby cat
>From the bandages covering his arms and the subtle frown on his face it’s safe to say they’re another couple
>One too many cat scratches, I assume
>After a few more minutes of silent waiting the bat woman finally stands up and looks around
>”Hello everyone! Welcome to maulaholics anonymous meeting number two hundred and ninety eight. Just a couple more and we’ll be at the big three oh oh! I see a lot of new faces here today so let me give a brief overview of what this anonymous support group is about. At maulaholics anonymous we aim to help people involved in what’s known as primal sexual violence dysfunction, otherwise known as maulfucking, claw and blood play, or hardcore predator/prey sexual roleplay. This specific brand of kink involves one partner harming the other with their consent, with the pain inflicted turning into a perverse pleasure for one or both parties. This is most common in anthro/anthro and anthro/human relationships, though that isn’t to say something similar can’t exist in human/human relationships as well. Now a little about myself.”
>The bat stands up and puts a hand to her chest
>”I am Vanessa Hugo, your local maulaholics anonymous representative. As you can already tell I'm a vampire bat, and like all vampire bats a vital part of my diet is blood. Me and my husband were both fans of a form of predator/prey roleplay in our sexual lives. We liked to turn off all the lights in the house, then I would ‘hunt’ him through the night, occasionally sneaking up on him and sucking his blood as both a form of pleasure and a way to get a quick snack. We continued like this for several years, until one night I, well, I went overboard. I had just gotten off a long shift and didn’t eat lunch. I was so tensed up, so hungry, so frustrated with work, I needed some way to let all my stress out. So when I got home I immediately turned off all the lights and began chasing my husband around the house. It was fun for a while, but eventually I managed to corner him on the couch and began sucking his neck dry. I began drinking, and drinking, and drinking. It was a relief to finally have a full stomach, and what can I say? The chase got me all hot and bothered. So when my belly was full I wanted to have a quick fuck before bedtime. I saw he had fallen asleep, so I tapped him on the shoulder. But he didn’t wake up. So I tried talking to him, shaking him, eventually screaming at him to get up. I checked his temperature and pulse. His skin was clammy and cold, his pulse teetered on the edge of being nonexistent. Seeing what I had done I rushed him to the hospital and with a quick blood transfusion they were able to just barely save his life. I'm sure many of you have a story similar to mine.”
>She pans across her audience and I do the same, many of the members shaking their heads in agreement, she continues
>”I was lucky that I had not killed him, but I'm sure you’ve all heard of the horror stories. One clumsy claw is all it takes to sever an artery, one misjudged bite to pierce a neck, one sharp tusk to take out someone’s eye. The thrill of the chase can be exhilarating, as can be the use of our natural hunting implements so many anthros rarely get a chance to use these days, but one should never disregard the very real harm one can cause, even if unintentional. Therefore, it’s my job to help people prevent themselves from acting out on their inclinations towards harm, whether it’s to harm someone else or bring harm to themselves makes no difference to me.”
>She suddenly claps her hands together and looks around the room
>”So! Why don’t we start off with introductions from our new members? Just give us a name and why you’re here. And remember, you don’t have to use your real names if you don’t want to, this group is anonymous, after all. Why don’t we start with you over there?”
>She points towards the vixen and the rabbit with the neck brace, they stand up and glance at each other awkwardly before the rabbit opens his mouth
>”My name is, uhhh, John.” He timidly starts
>”And my name is Rebecca.” The vixen says with a subtle annoyance
>”We’re here today because of a certain, event, that occurred during one of our roleplay sessions.”
>”What kind of roleplay?” Asks Vanessa
>”We like to do predator/prey roleplay. I'm the predator, he’s the prey, obviously.” Replies the vixen
>”Do you both get something out of this roleplay or is it just for one of you?”
>”It’s just for him.” She curtly responds
>”And what happened during this event?”
>The rabbit rubs his hands together and looks at the ground, his voice quiet and uncertain
>”Well, uhh, during the last session s-she cornered me on the bed. I wasn’t quite ready for it to end so I told her to, uhh, grab onto my neck. With her teeth. And, then, you know, shake me around a bit.”
>”As if she had caught her prey and was trying to kill it.” Says Vanessa
>”Ya…” He meekly responds.
>”He kept telling me to shake harder and harder, until we heard a snap and then I rushed him to the hospital. My dumb rabbit of a boyfriend almost made me break his freaking neck.” The vixen spits out
>”Now-now Rebecca, we try not to judge people’s sexual kinks here. But thank you for telling us your story, I hope you all have a wonderful time with us today.” She then points to the grizzly bear woman sitting across from me. “Now why don’t you introduce yourself to us?”
>She slowly stands up and looks around the room, her paws hidden behind her back
>”My, uhh, my name is jenn-no my name is Jessica.”
>”And why are you here today Jessica?”
>”Well, me and my boyfriend are into maulfucking. We like to bite each other during sex, dig our claws into each other’s coats, leave clumps of torn out fur around our bed and bloody marks on each other’s body’s. B-but nothing permanent though! It’s just for fun, a little game we do when we’re both looking to let out some stress.”
>”Is it for both of you, or just one of you?”
>”Both us of, but after what happened last night I don’t think we’ll be doing it ever again.”
>”And what happened last night?”
>”We were both really getting into it ya know, really tearing into each other. I was on top and ready for some action, so I put both my paws around his neck and tried to align myself with his cock. B-but I couldn’t really see what I was doing with both us moving around so much, so I moved one paw back to align him with me and tightened my grip on his throat to prevent him from getting the upper hand. It had been a while since I trimmed my claws, and I guess I didn’t realize how long and sharp they really were, so I ended up nicking an artery around his neck. H-he just kept bleeding and bleeding, oh god.” The bear wipes her eyes. “But thankfully we were able to get him to a hospital in time before the blood loss got too bad. So the next day I went to the groomers and had this done.” She brings up her shortly trimmed claws.
>”I see, and how is your boyfriend doing?”
>”He’s still in the hospital. He, uhh, he said we should start going to these meetings if we wanted to still be together. So, heh, here I am.”
>”And I can’t wait to meet your boyfriend when he’s released from the hospital.” Vanessa then point to the human with the tabby cat. “And how about you all?”
>They stand up together and the man crosses his arms, the tabby practically has her tail between her legs
>”My name is Nancy.” She says
>”And I'm Michael.”
>”And what brings you all here today?” Asks Vanessa
>”W-well, me and Michael like to do a little roleplay before we sleep together.” Says the Tabby
>”More like she uses me as her own personal scratching post before bed.” Spits Michael
>”I’m guessing you’re not into it Michael?” Asks Vanessa
>He shakes his head
>”Nope. I used to let her do it since she seems to like it so much but after several months of these constant scratches I'm totally done submitting to her twisted little fantasy.”
>”Fantasy?” Asks Vanessa
>”Michael please don’t-“ The tabby pleads
>He cuts her off and speaks
>”She likes to wear tiger stripe pajamas and pretend to be a big, fearsome, tigress stalking her area of the ‘jungle’, as in our house. She’ll stalk me through the halls until eventually I let her win and pin me down. Then she pretends to ‘fight’ me with her little house cat claws until she’s all tuckered out. After that I have to take the reigns and perform for the rest of the night on a tired little kitty cat drunk on a power fantasy. It gets reeeeal tiresome after a while.”
>The Tabby looks up as if to speak but then looks to the ground, ashamed
>”I see, and these scratches, does she ever lose control and cut too deep?”
>”No.” The Tabby says with a deflated sigh. “I have to keep them short for my job so they’re never very long, but even trimmed claws are enough to leave marks on a human’s bare skin.”
>”Thank you for sharing your story with us today Michael and Nancy. Now I believe you’re the last new member.” She says, pointing to me
>I clear my throat and stand up, quickly picking out a false name
>I then give a quick wave to the group before talking, seems like the polite thing to do
>”Hello everyone, my name is Ryan and I’m here today because last week the claw and bloodplay that me and my wife partake in got a little out of hand.”
>”Can you elaborate?” Asks Vanessa
>”Sure. So first of all I’m the one that’s into it. My wife, though she’s equipped with sharp teeth and claws, has only ever used them at my request. I like it when she uses them on me, the feeling of her teeth grazing my neck, the sensation of her claws raking my skin, the whole thing is so, I don’t know, erotic. Something about the restraint she shows when using them just makes me all hot and bothered. But I liked it even more when she takes away some of that restraint and uses the full extent of her body’s implements on me. Scratches across my chest, love bites on my neck, feeling her take a claw and poke my soft underbelly with it, now that’s the stuff that I really liked. She wouldn’t always draw blood, but I never minded if she did.”
>”And what lead you to come here today Ryan?” Says Vanessa
>”Well, my wife, she’s got some pretty sharp teeth.”
>I pull down the collar of my shirt to reveal one of the large love bites my wife left on me a couple weeks ago
>I hear a few oos and ahhs from the group as they take in the bite
>”Damn, what species is she? Lion? Polar bear? Wolf? She must be a real predator!” Says the rabbit man in amazement, he’s quickly silenced by a jab in the ribs from his girlfriend
>”You don’t have to reveal personal information unless you want to!” Says Vanessa
>Feeling embarrassed I bring my collar back up and continue, dodging his question
>”So last week we decided to try something a little new. I would put food on my body and she would eat it off me. Simple right? Well I requested that she also bite me every so often to make the whole experience a little wilder, and she obliged. However, what I did not know, is that the honey I was using to keep the food attached to my body melts right around the skin temperature of a human male. So as she was working her way down my body the honey was melting and dripping down onto my crotch. Onto my penis, to be exact. So when she finally made it all the way down to my dick I thought she was about to stop, but, uhh, she still tasted honey and bit down instead.”
>I see a few of my fellow males in the audience grimace and I put my hands up in response
>”But don’t worry! I'm totally fine down there, just needed a quick trip the hospital and they patched me up real quick. Everything is still in perfectly working order.”
>”Thank you for telling us your story Ryan, I’m sure it was hard for you to reveal something so personal. You can take a seat.” Says Vanessa
>I sit back down and allow the rest of the meeting to continue
>The rest of the afternoon is filled with more testimonies, monologues from Vanessa on why allowing you or your partner to harm one another is bad, and a few good crying sessions from people coming to terms with what they did or allowed others to do to them
>When the meeting is over Vanessa passes out a few pamphlets to everyone and wishes us all a good night
>I'm once again walking through the empty community center and to the entrance of the building
>There I'm greeted by my wife parked out in front
>I walk up to the car and open the door, taking a seat on the passenger side
>”Well, how was it?” She asks
>I look over to my wife in all her cute, furry glory
>Massive rounded ears, long twitching whiskers, big black eyes, and two big buck teeth hidden behind her lips
>Of all the hamsters in the world, she’s the cutest
>”It went well.” I respond. “We all had a good long talk on why letting others harm you is a bad thing, no matter how much it gets your rocks off.”
>She nods her head approvingly and reverses out of the parking lot
>”Good, because the next time we screw we’re doing it with the lights off, missionary position, under the covers, and holding hands. No fangs, claws, or strips of honey laced with cheerios will be involved!”
>”So vanilla.” I grumble back
>”I’d rather be vanilla than end up as ‘the hamster who chewed off her husband’s dick’ you know.”
>”Fair, fair.” I respond, as we drive out of the parking lot towards home

>everyone said it would never happen but you did it!
>you passed police academy
>the written portions were a breeze but training was tough
>it took a lot of interviews and getting passed over for being a 'humie'
>blatant discrimination
>but you finally got a job!
>your first assignment is traffic enforcement
>simple, low risk
>frees up another officer to 'do some heavier lifting', as the chief said
>clearly you still aren't respected, but you'll earn it in due time
>its your first day on the job
>you find yourself sat on the side of freeway nestled behind a billboard
>morning rush hour made it impossible for anyone to break the speed limit but as the parking lot that is the road begins to open up a lifted truck comes roaring by
>showtime
>you flick on your lights and sirens and come screeching out of your hiding spot in hot pursuit
>the driver is quick to pull over, not much of a chase
>you exit your car, ticket book in hand and approach the truck
>it might as well be one of those monster trucks they have at derbies
>the wheels alone come nearly up to your shoulder
>you stop next to the driver window and have to crane your neck to see the wolf leaning out of the window
"Ma'am do you know how fast you were going?"
>"Hun' if I knew it was you pulling me over I'd drive this fast every day!"
>she's got a thick southern drawl
"Please don't do that ma'am. If you get too many points your license will be suspended."
>"Well now wouldn't that just be something awful, how would I be able to pick up cute boys like you in my big 'ol truck?"
>you bite the inside of your cheek
"Yes ma'am, please drive slower. May I see your license and proof of insurance?"
>she leans back into the cabin of the truck and starts fumbling around.
>"You're so nice and courteous its so cute 'hun!"
>you don't reply.
>She finds her documentation and drapes her arm down for you to grab it.
>you strain to reach it but the truck is too high.
>when she sees you struggling to reach she giggles and leans further out the window so you can grab hold of her paperwork.
>you snatch it with a "Thank you, ma'am" and head back to your cruiser to run her license.
>after you close the car door your pinch the bridge of your nose in frustration.
>first your coworkers and now even the people you're ticketing.
>will the condescension ever stop?
>at least she didn't get mad and curse at you.
>would that even be worse at this point?
>you run her through the system and everything comes back clean
>no previous tickets or warnings, insurance is good, car isn't stolen.
>you write up a warning and head back to the truck.
"Alright ma'am you've got a clean record and I don't want to ruin it today so I'm only writing you a warning. Please drive safer from now on."
>you reach up again to hand back her papers with the warning.
>"Aww thank you so much honey, you're not even gonna search my truck?"
>you lower your arm again.
"Is there something in your vehicle that I should be concerned about?"
>"I ain' sayin' that, I'm just sayin' you should come up here and check it out is all. I just got the seats redone. It's all kinds of spacious in here with the bench seats. I could even rev the engine for you if'n you'd like- the boys love that!"
>you frown.
"I don't think that would be necessary ma'am. Please drive safe."
>"Aww ain't you just a little gentleman. I wish all the cops were sweet like you."
>she finally leans down again to take the papers.
>you're compelled to fill the awkward silence with the first thing that comes to mind.
"Thank you ma'am."
>She giggles again and revs the engine before taking off.
>You should have ticketed her for having straight pipes.
>You kick yourself all the way back to your cruiser
>She never once acknowledged your authority!
>She just demeaned you the whole time and called you cute!
>And you thanked her for it!
>today is going to be a long day.

>You're somewhere with your mouse-wife, maybe a train, maybe some performance venue, etc.
>The lights shut off, everyone gasps
>Your mouse-wife exclaims, "MY CHEESE!!!"
>Someone stole the cheese she was keeping on her person
>Now you're involved in solving a mystery of who stole the cheese

>Cute stalker bunny(?) sisters.
>Both are manic, debatably even feral; so much so that even the most firm monogamist is fine with them being a package deal.
>You become a lot more diplomatic when someone threatens to blow your dick off with a shotgun.
>Although they are the same on the surface level, they are completely different the further down you go.
>One is a hardcore vegetarian, while the other might as well be classified as a carnivorous animal.
>One has confidence issues, but the other things they're the hottest thing since sliced bread.
>One fucks, while the other makes love.
>Surprisingly not yandere, but both have a near fairytale-view of what love is supposed to be.
>Also insanely wealthy it appears; the two having a theater stage in the middle of their where they either make you play a prince being held in a tower for one of them to save while the two duke it out as a heroic knight fighting off a villain.
>Their roleplay fetish is. . . intricate to say the least.
>Would still cut a bitch though.

>be a door kicker on a trafficking ring raid
>this particular raid has gone better than expected
>multiple arrests and 3 rescues so far
>the look on each man's face when you undo their chains and show them to safety, sets a roaring fire in your heart
>you bust through the last door of the compound, into a room that sicknes you
>lights, recording equipment, and all kinds of "toys" strewn about the place
>at the center of it all, a lone man sits chained to the floor
>his legs are an ugly shade of purple, his chest is lined with all sorts of cuts and scratches, and one of his eyes is swollen shut
>you've stomached scenes like this before
>the degenerates here were using the poor guy to make abuse porn
>it was the way he reacted to you that made your heart sink
>he didn't not cry for help or rejoice in his rescue, like the others
>he only slowly and silently looks up at you, showing no emotion whatsoever, before hanging his head once more
>a sure sign this poor human was well and truly broken by what he has endured
>the rage in your heart gives way to compassion which then turns into resolve
>you have rescued many men before, but this one...
>this one you will fix yourself
How does this waifur save the poor anon?

>train for years in the art of combat
>swear an oath to their kingdom
>still get HOARDED by the first dragoness they run into
human knights were made to serve big, scaly waifurs

it's a giant scam I tells you
>humie boys and men become adventurers
>go out and get captured by monster/beast-women
>which calms the beasts down for some time
>but then they breed more she-beasts
>which gives more jobs for the guild to hand out and attract more new blood
>I bet some of the smarter beasts pay to put up quests against themselves to funnel humies straight to them
>dragons could do it easy with all that treasure they're literally sitting on

>Cheetahs are one of the most accomplished anthro species
>Providing great contributions to society, mainly in the hard sciences
>Not to mention their excellence in sports like sprinting
>Howerver they have frequent issues related to anxiety and propensity to panic attacks
>Apart from the obvious health problems, those combine with their natural introversion and social awkwardness make than very poor at socialization
>What, not surprisingly, leads to low reproductive rates
>To solve this problem the best researchers of the government came with an ingenious solution
>Paring cheetah cubs with human babies as soon as possible
>Preferably at birth
>This way the human will serve as an solid life long emotional support
>And as they would grow up together mitigating the social awkwardness and communication issues, they would be the perfect mates for one another

>you don't understand!
>we have anxiety!
>cheetahs NEED to have humies partnered with them from birth, and for their entire lives!
>this isn't a ploy for free humie husbands!
When did you realize cheetahs were using the medical industry to cheet at life?

>kobolds can actually live for hundreds of years
>just have really shitty life expectancy due to where most live
>a group could play the long game and take over a human city/town from within by holding positions of power for so long and advancing up in society
>could abuse their power to get what they want/put kobolds in power in general
>but they're still kobolds so what they want is pretty simple/reasonable most of the time
>food, gold to lay and pretend to be dragons, humie boytoys, safety, not to be eaten, etc

funniest thing is looking up just how effective african predator species actually are
>lions are actually pretty shitty hunters and steal more kills than anything using their size
>cheetahs get bullied by fucking everything due to how poor they're built for defending/fighting
>spotted hyenas are really good hunters and abuse their large clan numbers
>painted dogs are the most effective pack hunters in the whole continent very much held back with how small they are compared to the other pack hunters
>crocs are only a danger in water deep enough to hide and god help them if it dries up
>funniest thing is THE most successful and vicious predator in all of africa is the sand cat which is the size of a normal house cat

>The uniformed bear slams a manila folder down in front of you
>"Welcome to the Anthrostate comrade, we've chosen a new career path for you, one that is more useful to your new benefactors."
>You take the manila folder and slowly open it
>What did they want you to do now, you wonder
>For all your life you've been an engineer, making rockets, bombs, guidance systems, detonators, they probably want you to build some new wonder weapon for them now
>Better than a labor camp, you suppose
>Your eyes scan the page and you gasp
>"I am not a fucking porn star!"
>"You are now, comrade human." The bear says with an evil grin
>"I'm a goddamn engineer! I should be designing complex mechanical components or testing new high tech weapons! Not demoted to acting as some whore's cock on demand!"
>The bear stands you up and begins walking you to the door
>"The state found you to be too cute to pass up, humie. From now on you'll be partaking in daily porno shoots, all done to the strict standards of the propaganda bureau. Your costars will be anthro women of all shapes and sizes, a variety representing all the species under the state."
>"This is ludicrous! Don't you need someone to make weapons or something? I got some ideas for a cool new missile that shoots a bunch of smaller missiles!"
>"Shush now." She says, putting a finger to your lips. "Your first shoot starts in one hour. Better start drinking and taking calcium supplements, once a shoot starts it won't end until your costars are completely satisfied. All ten of them."

>Dogfu
Tomboy childhood friend who realized that she's stronger than you and teases you relentlessly for it. Good natured and gentle, and wants to start a family with you.
>Wolffu
Ruthless older assasin for hire who makes sure you know what she can do to you if you step out of line. Sees you as a convenient sextoy to use when she needs to unwind after a mission.

>Foxfu
Powerful and rich owner of a highly succesful company, she owns you and knows she can use you however she wishes. Employs you as her personal chair and living dildo. Arguably the most domineering waifur.
>Dragonfu
Sometimes kidnaps you for weeks on end and traps you within her cave to serve her. A mix of the panther's need to be bred and the fox's uncompromising personality. Will force you to lick her for hours on end, will feed you magical potions to make sure you can keep up and she WILL make sure you dump every last bit of your cum into her.
>Yeenfu

>"W-what?"
>"You heard me." she replies, lifting her shirt to reveal the fine webbing of scars across her abdomen
>you tremble at the piercing look she gives you
>you'd done it now, borrowed money from the wrong people to try and keep yourself afloat after being shit-canned from your job
>and now on top of being evicted, you'd come downstairs this morning to find this pantless psycho rummaging through your boxed up possessions
>"you missed the deadline, Ma sent me to extract some use out of you" she had told you with that crazy ass look in her eye
>she didn't even have a visible weapon but from her demeanor alone you knew this woman could make you disappear
>you bend down to kneel on shaky knees as she reclines back
>sitting on the sturdy cardboard box that held your diploma and other life-achievements that didn't mean much now
>your eyes water a little at the thought of how you could have fallen so low
>"Don't cry" she states plainly in that deadpan voice
>you're not sure if it's to console you, or a command
>"I have a new home for you, here" she says, grabbing a handful of your hair and pulling you between her legs

>be (You)
>slorping on your fixer's shaved goods
>her thighs, relatively thin as they are, squeeze your head hard
>the audible drag of her claws told you it all
>if the warm, slightly briny trickle on your tongue didn't

>pulling you up with the same motion, your trembling eyes were locked

>This has been the most unnerving erotic encounter of your life
>the fixer's legs drape lazily over both of your shoulders as her hand presses your head firmly into her pussy
>you've been at it for about an hour now, alternating between using every trick you knew with you tongue, and fervently tracing the scars on her stomach with delicate hands trying to draw any positive response from her
>Its all been for naught, as the most expression you've gotten out of her is the infrequent tensing of her muscles around your head and the occasional small grunt.
>you focus on your work to avoid looking back up and seeing those scary eyes that look through you
>you can feel them burning holes into the top of your head now
>her lips quiver around yours as more musky fluid fills your mouth
>you only hear a soft sigh above you as she reaches climax yet again
>her legs tense and her clawed hand roughly tugs some stray hairs from your scalp
>you try to continue through her orgasm
>you don't want to see that look she shot you when you asked for something more comfortable to rest your knees on thirty minutes back again
>"Stop." she says after riding out her final orgasm like it was an inconvenience to her
>you obey and look back up to her face
>she simply gives you that creepy blank stare for a moment, as if contemplating something
>"Okay, You'll do" she finally speaks
>you're lifted to your feet and hurriedly ushered out the door, her hands digging into your shoulders the whole way
>the sun has just begun to rise as you're pushed into the back of the still-running luxury sedan parked in your driveway
>she gives you one more once-over before moving to close the door and scoot into the front passenger seat of the vehicle
>"Welcome to the family."

>You look in your rear-view mirror to make sure that cop car’s not following you
>It is
>Crap
>You pull over and think to yourself
>You’re pretty sure you’re not going over the speed limit
>You probably just have a broken tail light or something
>Watching the cop car, you see its driver hop out of the vehicle
>A rabbit, typically small for her species, dressed in the standard blue ZPD fatigues
>You wouldn’t really pin her for a cop if you just saw her on the street in her civvies
>Her purple eyes have a bemused glaze and her mouth is curled into a slight frown as she walks toward your car
>You swallow nervously
>You roll your window down and poke your head out of the window to meet her as she comes to you
>”H-hey, officer, is something wrong?”
>”Don’t ‘is something wrong’ me, pal. You were going 95 on a 45.”
>Your eyes nearly bulge out of your skull
>”Th-that’s impossible! I know for a fact I wasn’t!”
>”Yeah, and who do you think the judge is gonna believe; you the nobody, or me the cop with my handy-dandy radar here?”
>As if to prove her point, she shows you the radar
>Sure enough, 95 is displayed is displayed in big LCD numbers
>”But that’s not… I didn’t…”
>”I’d save my breath if I were you, sweetpea. The numbers don’t lie.”
>She smirks smugly
>”This is bullshit… I’m being set up!”
>”Okay, now you’re being belligerent. I’m gonna need you to step out of the car, sir.”
>”No way! I’ve got rights, and I’m not about to-”
>Taking the hint, you step out, not making eye contact with her
>”Alrighty, we got a lot to talk about. Why don’t we go for a little ride?”
>”Do I… do I have a choice?”
>”No. Back of my car, now.”
>You shuffle anxiously to her cruiser, nearly crushed under the weight of the pit in your stomach
>You open the right backend door and plant yourself on the leather seat
>After a minute or two, she hops into the driver's seat and starts writing something on her little notepad
>You really don’t wanna take any chances with her, even with the heavy-duty steel grate dividing you
>You ask the obvious question
>”Am I being arrested?”
>”No. Not yet. You could be, though. Let’s go somewhere else to talk about it.”
>You’re tempted to protest, but you don’t want to dig yourself into an even deeper hole than you’re already in
>The police car splits the scene and you sit there in silence and anxiety
>She drives to a really obscure part of town
>One of the least population-dense areas in the city
>Again, you gulp
>No one ever drives here to do something good
>She takes a turn and drives into a dingy, narrow alley, just barely wide enough to fit the car
>You start breathing louder as it’s now starting to dawn on you just how bad things really are
>She puts the car in park and turns to you
>”You know, you look pretty good.”
>”Uh… excuse me?”
>”What do you mean, ‘excuse me’? You’re cute. Hot. Handsome. Attractive. How many ways can I put it?”
>”...Thank you, but… I don-”
>”And between you and me? Handsome guys are kinda hard to come by. It’s enough to drive a girl crazy.”
>This is not the direction you expected this to go, and you’re honestly not sure if this is an improvement or not
>”So, I’ll tell you what; you do what I say and give me what I want, and you go free, no strings attached. Deal?”
>Is this bitch serious?
>Does she really think you’re gonna let her get away with such blatant corruption?
>You don’t know who she thinks she is, but you’re not gonna let her get away with this
>”No.”
>She raises an eyebrow
>”No?”
>”I’m not your sex toy, and I won’t be abused just because you’re a cop. I have rights, and I will not-”
>You’re cut off by a snicker, which gradually transforms into full-on laughter
>”’Rights’, he says! RIGHTS! Oh God, I’m gonna die!”
>You sit there, staring and seething with indignation
>She finally starts to calm down, wiping a tear away from her eye
>”Ha… Ha… Whew! Haven’t laughed like that in a long time. Listen, buddy, I don’t think you quite understand what position you’re in here. Right about now, I could do anything and everything to fuck up your life. Just off the top of my head; driving without valid license and registration,”
>”B-but I have”
>”Driving under the influence of illicit substances,”
>”I’m no-”
>”Assault of a police officer. Get where I’m going here?”
>”You… You don’t have evidence, for any of your bullshit charges!”
>”I can make evidence. Easily. And I can have multiple other officers corroborate my stories, if need be. Don’t you get it? I have power. You don’t have power. So now, you have two options; either be a good boy and submit or don’t face charges up the ass.”
>She leans forward, her face nearly touching the grate, making intense eye contact with you
>”Which is it gonna be?”
>You avert your eyes
>Boy, does she have you by the balls
>You heard corruption in this city was bad, but you didn’t know cops could just fabricate evidence and blackmail people with so much ease
>There’s really no choice
>Swallowing your pride and gritting your teeth, you answer
>”Fine.”
>”Fine? Fine what, pal?”
>”Fine, I’ll do what you say, just don’t arrest me.”
>”Great! I knew you had a smart head on your shoulders!”
>Her change in demeanor is slightly startling, but not particularly surprising
>Still, you’re a little disturbed that she’s so into this
>”Now, let me just get this down…”
>She fiddles with something on the partition
>After a few seconds, something clicks, and she rolls the grate down, leaving no more barriers between you and her
>”Perfect! You ready?”
>You’re pretty sure that’s a rhetorical question
>You sigh
>”Let’s just get this over with.”
>”Woah, slow down ‘ere, pardner. Who said we need to rush things? I, for one, like to take my time with this sorta thing.”
>She hops between the seats and stretches a leg toward you
>”Let’s start with something light. Lick my feet.”
>”What?”
>”Duh, what? There you go again, with the stupid questions. What’s so hard to get? Lick. My. Feet. It’s only three words, what do you need further explanation for?
>You start to say something, but then you recall her little speech
>You know she’s right
>You’re not getting out of this without playing along
>So, face flush with humiliation, you lean forward and give her foot a quick lick, trying your best not to pay too much attention to the taste of it
>You look back up to her pathetically
>She merely motions for you to keep going
>Clamping your eyes down tightly, you explore the rest of her foot with her tongue, matting down her fur and wetting the black coverings
>You swirl around, licking up and down, getting under the toes and between them
>This situation would have been bad enough, but the noises she’s making make it ten times worse
>”Oooh, yeah… Unf, just like that…”
>You do your best to block her moans and dirty talk out, trying to get it over with
>Eventually, she pulls her foot away as it glistens with saliva
>Just when you think you’ll have some reprieve, she pokes your cheek with the big toe of the other one
>You should have known it wouldn’t be that simple
>You sigh before getting back to work
>You do it all again, same motions, same moans, same searing-hot embarrassment
>Finally, she pulls back again, letting out one more moan that borders on a sigh
>”Good work. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you did this before.”
>She chuckles to herself, much to your chagrin
>”Okay, next step. Lean back.”
>You obey, without much hesitation, mentally noting this with concern
>As you lean back, she leans forward, the dominant sparkle in her eye growing more prevalent
>She stops just above your crotch
>Oh no
>You knew this was where this was going, but you were still dreading it
>”Let’s see what we’re dealing with here, hm?”
>”I-”
>”Zip it.”
>The suddenness of the command startles you into silence
>All you can do is watch in horror as she undoes your fly and frees your junk, your dick flopping out almost anticlimactically
>”Hmm, not bad. But we could do better.”
>She makes direct eye contact with you as she starts playing with it
>It’s definitely uncomfortable, but she doesn’t do it hard enough to hurt
>Despite your displeasure with the current situation, it doesn’t stop your cock from reacting to stimuli
>When it hardens to about half-mast, she looks back down at it, smirking
>”Now that’s more like it. And to think you wanted to hide this little guy from me.”
>She takes her paw off, only to lean even closer and sniff at it
>The feeling makes you tense up in pleasure
>”That’s right.”
>She gives it a drawn-out lick
>Every millisecond sends tiny jolts of electricity throughout your body
>”Squirm for me.”
>You have no choice but to comply as she continues to tease it lightly, swirling over the base and around the balls as she gives gentle presses and laps here in there
>You simultaneously feel incredibly close to orgasm and miles away from
>The conflicting feeling makes your head spin and contrasts with the physical pleasure
>She pauses, opening her mouth wide open, making look like she’s going to deepthroat you
>Only to plant a gentle kiss at the tip, picking up some of your pre with her mouth
>She licks it off and gives you an even more devious smile, taking her vest off
>”And now for the main event. You ready?”
>You’re not, but you’ve long since figured out that’s not a factor
>You nod meekly
>”Super!”
>The enthusiasm sounds simultaneously sarcastic and sincere
>Following her vest is her belt, her shirt, her pants, and the bands that cover her arms and legs
>When she gets to her underwear, she pauses, turning around and wiggling her butt at you seductively before discarding her bra and panties, leaving her completely nude
>She may be corrupt and smug, but she’s not half bad-looking
>Her breasts are on the smaller side, but perky and with a good shape
>Her sex is tight and the perfect shade of pink, you can practically feel the heat emanating from it
>And her ass, as you saw it with her panties on, is proportionately big on her, with muscle and fat in equal amount
>She squats down over your cock
>”Okay, now. I hope you can take it. Oh, and just so we’re clear - I may be small, but I’m a trained ZPD officer. Try anything funny, and I’m liable to break your neck. Capiche?”
>You gulp
>”C-capiche…”
>”Good. Now then…”
>You let out a high-pitched yelp as she drops down onto you
>You barely even have time to comprehend her tight, warm snatch as you hear her chuckle yet again
>”Oh, come on. Don’t tell me you’re gonna quit on me now. We plap haven’t plap even plap got plap started plap yet! plap plap plap”
>She punctuates her words by bouncing up and down and then begins riding you in earnest
>It’s unlike anything you’ve ever felt before
>You’re not exactly a big sex-haver
>The most action you tend to get is with a Fleshlight and some less-than-safe-for-work websites
>And it is absolute child’s play compared to this
>If you weren’t convinced that she wasn’t lying about the whole ‘break your neck’ thing before, you definitely are now
>She may be small, but her body’s been pretty evidently trained to use all of her muscles to their fullest extent
>And that power reflects in the way she works on top of you
>Every bounce rocks the car, and it’s almost enough to bruise your soft skin
>Besides the occasional muscle spasm, you’re unable to move, so you let her do her thing with you
>Essentially, you’ve just become a living dildo
>Her perky tits bounce up and down as her tongue lolls out, drooling in pleasure
>Meanwhile, your face is contorted in a strange grimace, for as you’re internally filled with so many emotions, you end up displaying none
>Just when you think you might be starting to finally calm down, she witches it up
>She jumps up off your dick and, without missing a beat, twirls around and starts riding reverse cowgirl
>Her shapely asscheeks clap with every fuck
>You’re only barely able to breathe through it all
>Sweat flies off of the both of you as the car starts feeling more and more like an oven
>She rolls out sultry, seductive moans, while you squeak submissive, pathetic whimpers
>She turns her head back toward you
>”How you doin’? Gonna cum soon?”
>”Eeeeuuuuung…”
>”I’ll take that as a yes. Thing is, though, I’m not really ready to be a mom quite yet, so how ‘bout this…”
>She hops back off, and before you know it, she impales you back into herself, this time through her anus
>You feel like you’re gonna have a stroke
>Her asshole is less flexible than her pussy, but it manages, the ring clinging desperately to your skin as you fuck it
>Every time her ass meets your waist, it ripples almost hypnotically
>You’re not sure how much more you can take
>Fortunately for you, it doesn’t last much longer
>After a few more minutes of rigorous sex, you can’t hold back any longer
>You release deep inside of her
>That’s enough to push her over the edge, and she finishes right alongside you
>Following the pattern from before, she lets out a pleased, high-pitched croon, while you can only offer a degraded groan
>You both sit there for a moment, panting
>Then, she leans forward, opening her glovebox
>”Now, where was it? I know it was here somewhere.”
>She rummages through it a bit
>”A-ha! There we go!”
>She pulls out a carrot shaped buttplug
>She gets off of you, and some of your cum dribbles onto the floor
>She inserts the plug before any more can get out
>”See? That wasn’t so hard, now was it?”
>You say nothing
>What is there even to say in this situation
>You should be feeling a maelstrom of different emotions, but you’re just cold inside
>For now, anyway
>She keeps talking as she puts her clothes back on and drives back to your car, but you don’t really listen
>You eventually get back to where your car is
>Thankfully, it wasn’t stolen
>”Okay then, you’re free to go. Thanks again for your cooperation. I really wish more civilians were like you.”
>You stumble out of the car, neck-deep in shame
>Before she drives off, the bunny cop has one last thing to ask
>”Whoops! Almost forgot! ID please.”
>You don’t even have the energy to ask why she wants your ID
>You just hand it over absently
>She studies it for a few moments
>”Hmm. Anon Ymous. Cute name. Well, I’ll be in touch if anything comes up. Bye for now!”
>She hands you your ID back and speeds off
>You scoff
>You know something’s gonna come up
>It always does in this God-forsaken city
>And if not, she’ll just make something come up
>In Zootopia, anyone can be anything
>And that clearly includes corrupt cops

>Man finds wolfess crying pitifully in the forest
>She puts on her puppy dog eyes and says she has a splinter in her paw
>He gets down to help her
>??????????
>She has her first litter of puppies nine months later

>approaching a lonely human and attempting to join him
>"Look at you, all alone. It's like no one cares about you."
>trying to show she's into humans
>"What kind of freak would want to spend time with a humie?"
>making a show of how strong she is, and the protector role she could take
>"Wow, you're so weak. Any anthro could just grab you and gut you easy. I'm way stronger than you!"

>Today has been the shittiest day in memory
>arrived at work this morning only to find your desk cleared and everything packed into a box
>"Oh, we're sorry anon did you not get the email? The company is going through some restructuring..."
>fucking bullshit
>you'd stormed out of the office only to find some dumbass had backed into your parked car and taken off within the 10 minutes you'd been there
>and then to top it all off you come home to find your girlfriend of 3 years in bed with some fucking stallion furboy in the hour it'd taken you to commute back home
>"Anon! you're home early!? It's not what it looks like!"
>crazy how a man's life can fall apart over the course of a single morning
>you had to just walk out the door to avoid killing someone
>you did smash a few picture frames on your way out for good measure
>now here you sat in some shitty dive bar that catered to anthros
>It was the only one nearby, even though you'd rather not be reminded of the person you caught in bed with the woman you thought you'd marry
>oh well, at least they mixed the drinks stronger than usual here
>you sit in the same booth you'd been in for a good few hours now, slamming back drink after drink
>trying to drown the world out in a figurative tidal wave of spirits
>you'd just thrown back your 8th double of the night when a figure you were too drunk to see approaching slides into the bench across from you
>A black cat in a studded leather jacket, with enough facial piercings to be classified as a pin-cushion stares at you with silted eyes from across the table
>"What's a humie doing in a place like this? Couldn't pull someone from your own species?" she chuckles openly
>Ouch, what an opener
>a deep frown crosses your face as you grip your empty glass firmly
>"who the hell do you think you-" you begin only to be cut off
>"you look so weird with such little fur on your head, how does your kind even stay warm?" the cat continues
>anger bubbles in your chest, only dampened by your utter bafflement
>who the hell did this girl think she was? To just sit down and start insulting you?
>of course something like this would happen, you couldn't even sit down and drink yourself into a coma in peace
>the alcohol amplifies your emotions ten-fold, the only problem being... You were never much of an angry drunk
>you run your hand through your hair
>s-sure your hairline was receding a little but that wasn't uncommon for men you age... was it?
>before you have time to process this insecurity you didn't even know you had, the cat's already opening her big mouth again
>"God, sitting here drinking alone on a week night; And you call yourself a man?" she almost spits, with a smug grin
>something within you snaps, and not in the way you'd hoped
>you wanted to give this bitch a piece of your mind
>to yell directly in her face what you thought of her whole cocky litter-box ass species
>instead the weight of the entire day crashes down on you all at once
>you try desperately to hold it back, but your eyes start to water
>you career was over, you were at least $1,000 in the hole for car-body repair, and the woman you thought to be the love of your life didn't even consider you "man" enough to not go behind your fucking back
>and now you were getting dressed down for no other reason than trying to find some tiny comfort at the bottom of the glass
>you deserved this, you were pathetic...
>"Well it's your lucky day, I can make a man out of-" she begins, but you're not even listening anymore
>"LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!" you shout, voice cracking slightly at the charge of emotion running through it
>her eyes widen in surprise at your outburst, but you don't stay to see if she recovers as you're already storming out the bar door
>fuck it, you don't care that you have a tab open, or that they have your card. You'd get it back later
>you rub your eyes of tears as you walk briskly through the front door and onto the darkened street
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>Jinx sat stunned, now the only occupant of the booth she had slid into
>she looked at the empty glass across from her in confusion
>this isn't at all the reaction The Dating Playbook for Anthros: 7 Easy Steps to Get the Human of Your Dreams, had told her she would get
>Did she come on too strong?
>she glanced around the bar, now almost dead silent after the man's outburst
>a few anthros that had watched the man rush outside now turned their heads to her
>the motherly cow bartender shot her a glare that could curdle milk
>a group of canine anthros that had been playing cards in the corner begin growling and showing their teeth at her
>seems like it was a good time to hit the road
>"H-hey! Wait!" the black cat shouts as she rises to run after the man
>she could fix this, she'd have to jump a few steps to compliments though
>"I-I really liked the way you yelled! B-but I'd rather hear you shouting my name!" she fumbles with her lousy pickup line as she races after the man she'd been watching from across the bar for the past hour
>she mentally kicks herself after realizing she didn't even introduce herself before criticizing him
>angry glares follow her out of the bar as she races through the door and into the night

Aight' you're right that was kinda depressing for poor anon, hopefully this rectifies it. Hastily written out before work but I hope y'all enjoy
>fuck this, fuck everything, you were done
>you didn't care where you were going, you just picked a random direction and walked
>you tears blurred your vision as you walked, determined to get lost in this concrete jungle of buildings
>the cold autumn air making the thin watery lines cut your face all the more

>besides your barely stifled sobs of frustration
>soon however, there was another sound
>probably the last one you wanted to hear right now
>"Wait! Please! Come back!"
>that damn cats voice pierced the night as you heard the patter of her paws on the sidewalk, running to catch up to you
>you simply keep walking, not willing to give her the satisfaction of seeing your tear streaked face
>your hopes that she would simply give up and leave you alone were dashed as you heard her quickly catch up to you
>a paw grabs your shoulder to stop you as her mouth runs a mile a minute
>"Wait! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I just saw you sitting alone and thought you were really cute and wanted to get to know yo-" you still aren't even listening to her as you cut her off with an outburst of your own
>"Get the hell away from me!" you whip around to yell into her face
>another shocked expression adorns her face at your eruption, only for it to be replace by a deeply regretful one when she sees the pain written across yours
>"I-I-" she begins, raising a hand to her mouth
>"Are you happy?! Is this what you wanted to see?! I lose my job! Some asshole dents my car! The love of my life cheats on me; and I can't even drink the pain away in peace without being harassed by you! You- You f-fuckin'-!" your tirade begins crack as you scream at this woman
>the weight of everything presses you flat almost as you crumble to your knees and the floodgate breaks
>you let out a mournful cry as the new state of your life catches up to you
>the cat for her part, only looks on in horror
>you sit there for a moment as tears run freely down your cheeks and your choked sobs echo off concrete walls
>then something weird happens
>*THUD*
>you crack your eyes open to see the blurry figure of the cat, sunken down lower than you were
>you blink a few times to get a clearer picture
>this damn cat who was just tearing into you a few moments ago, prostrates herself at your knees with her forehead pushed into the sidewalk
>"I'm so sorry! I'm so so so so so sorry! P-please forgive me!" she begs, face still glued to the ground
>when she looks back up, you see her own large eyes starting to water
>what is this?
>"I-I didn't know! I didn't-!" she cuts herself off this time, by lunging towards you from her crouched position
>you jump in surprise, fully expecting her to attack you
>instead her whole taller frame wraps around you as her arms lock around your back
>"L-let go of me you god damn-" you struggle a little in her grasp, but she just squeezes you tighter
>you hear her breath come out in small shudders, almost in tandem with yours
>this is bizarre, a hug is the last thing you wanted right now, especially from the girl that just made you feel like this
>... But you couldn't deny it felt nice, after everything that had happened today...
>the cat just continues mumbling into you ear as she squeezes you
>"I didn't know... I'm sorry... I didn't know... I'm sorry."
>you let yourself go limp in her arms, a few more pained sobs rising from your throat
>"l-let me make it up to you, please! I just wanted to get to know you... I'm so sorry, I had no idea what you were going through..." she continues to plead
>"Just let me go..." you say morosely "I just wanna go home and grab my things..." the strangeness of the situation makes you more forthcoming than usual
>"F-from your girlfriend's house?" the cat asks
>beside yourself at the confusing turn of events, you can only nod sadly
>you feel the cats claws prick your skin slightly as she squeezes you even tighter somehow
>"I-I can fix this! Let me make this up to you! I promise I'll make this right!" she pulls back to look into your eyes
>you want to refuse her, to chastise her some more for her careless behavior

>"Okay..." is all you say, feeling totally defeated
>"Y-yes! You won't regret it! C'mon, come with me! I have and idea. So... Where do you live?" she begins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>You really didn't think you'd be back here at all this week, let alone the very same day
>you look at the door to the dingy apartment you'd rented together with your now ex-girlfriend
>you already wanted to turn around and leave, but force yourself to raise your fist and give a few harsh knocks on the flimsy wooden door
>you take a deep breath to prepare yourself, you think you'd done a pretty good job of wiping your tears
>this probably wouldn't work otherwise
>the door cracks open slowly, to reveal the figure of the harlot that stabbed you in the heart
>her wicked face breaks into a relieved smile as she sees you
>"Oh! Thank God Anon! you're back! look, we can work this-" her pitiful platitudes die in her throat as the door opens further
>and she sees the black cat draped over your shoulders like a scarf
>"A-anon... who is this?" she begins, but you ignore her and simply push your way through the doorway
>"What?! Anon is that true?! I-I can't believe you'd-!" your ex begins only to be cut off
>"Oh you'd better believe it's true! He'd come crying to me looking for anyway out of this dull cohabitation you call a 'relationship' in a way that wouldn't break your heart; the sweet little thing, but now that you're out of my way..." Jinx lets her sentence drift off
>then it's your turn to be shocked as she roughly turns your head and her barbed tongue invades your mouth
>t-this wasn't part of the plan!
>one of her hands roughly grasps the back of your head as the other aggressively kneads your ass
>your ex's look of confusion is quickly replaced with one of rage as she clenches her teeth and walks towards the both of you in a threatening manner
>"You- you asshole! I'm gonna-!"
>*SMACK*
>you give a muffled exclamation into Jinx's mouth as she somehow accurately backhands your ex onto the ground with the hand that was just groping you
>you ex simply looks up at you and Jinx, three new red lines now adorning the side of her face
>"C'mon babe, after tonight you won't even remember this bitch's name." Jinx begins after breaking her kiss, roughly dragging you back to her bike parked outside
>the last view you get of your ex is her shocked expression, lying sprawled out on the floor
>crazy how a man's life can be pulled back together over the course of a single evening.

>The smiles drop from the trios faces almost simultaneously at your request
>you try to somehow sink further into the flimsily metal lockers behind you as they share blank glances between each other
>"Are you sure about that, anon?" the African wild dog asks, a sly grin slowly creeping back onto her muzzle
>are they actually asking you?
>you hesitate a moment, thinking this might be some sort of trick
>"Uh, y-yeah." you reply sheepishly

>you give a short gasp as your roughly shoved into the locker
>you're about to thank whatever deity is watching over your pelvis that they actually listened to you
>before the huge hyena begins cramming herself in with you
>you protests is swiftly cut off as her whole body squishes you into the confined space
>you are crushed between the hard back of the locker and the loose fabric of her shirt, barely concealing her large bust that now threatens to cut off your air supply
>how the hell did she even squeeze her whole body into such a space?!
>to your horror you hear the locker door slam shut behind her as she finishes maneuvering in
>"Have fun in there you two!" you hear the wild dog's muffled teasing from beyond the thin metal door and constraining fabric wrapped around your whole being

>from outside you can hear voices laughing and cheering
>"Haha! Sorry Colin!"
>one of the village lads jeers
>"We'll move it back in the morning! If the faerie folk don't get ya!"
>you shout and jam your weight against the barricading rock, but to no avail
>you're trapped here for the night
>just you in the dark
>alone
>with a bunch of bones of long dead kings and lords
>and whatever spirits may haunt this place
>your pounding on the stone intensifies
>but eventually your arm grows tired, and your fist bruises
>and it's clear there will be no escape from you
>you turn around and place your back on the stone
>until you see
>around the corner, instead of pure blackness, there's a flicker of light
>you're gripped with terror
>the flickering moves this way and that, a soft blue light that waxes and wanes
>appears and disappears
>then grows stronger
>and stronger
>until it looks like it's just around the corner
>then the light goes out
>you gasp
>there's a rush of air, and a hand cold as death and hard as stone grasps your leg
>you're dragged screaming into the blackness
>scraping over stone floors and slamming into hard corners
>until you come to the stop and the grip on your leg releases
>all you can see is darkness
>all you can feel is the stone floor you lay on
>but what you can hear is a soft 'tak tak tak'
>like the tapping of a stick against the ground
>that circles you slow
>"Mortal."
>a chill creeps up your spine at the sound of that voice
>thin and rasping, like wind through the branches of a dead tree
>"Why do you disturb the resting? Have you come to plunder the kings of old? Desecrate their home of long repose?"
>you quail and cover your face
>whimpering
>there's a rush of air
>and it feels like the breath of winter itself on your face as the voice hisses
>"Answer!"
>you're doomed
>but if you don't answer you may be doomed even worse
>the spirit may kill you and steal your soul
"I'm not a robber! I-I said I would spend the night in the old tomb on the hill! It was a dare! The others they--they blocked me in with a stone. Please, please let me go!"
>there's a growl, and more ice-breath washes over you
>but the presence draws away from you and the next time the voice speaks, it is several paces away
>"Fool. You disturb my charges for pride. Silence your weeping and be still."
>you try your best to follow her command
>swallowing down the lump in your throat and taking a deep, shuddering breath
>you manage to contain yourself for now
>enough to pull your hands off your face and open your eyes
>the light has returned
>and you see the source of it
>floating above the floor is an ephemeral figure
>swathed in long robes that don't quite hang off its body as they do float along with it, is the skeleton of a wolf
>and yet not
>for it stands upright like a human
>with hands at the end of its arms, tipped in blunted claws
>and eyes that glow in the sockets of her skull
>a wolf-woman
>you are not sure if it is the tilt of her hips
>or the slight feminine tone to her voice
>or her long, lithe limbs
>or some other small detail that your mind fails to grasp
>but you are sure this thing is most definitely a "she"
>a "she" that guards this tomb from intruders like you
>as fast as you can, you scramble to your knees
>prostrating yourself before the wolf ghost
"Please forgive me. I have disrespected you and your tomb. I am a poor fool, but I swear I will never again disturb your resting place."
>the spirit watches you unblinkingly
>then releases a sigh that comes out of her skull in a stream of cold mist
>"Fool indeed. I might have killed you for your transgression."
>you tremble, but stifle the whimper of fear that wants to break out of you
>"But I am merciful. Begone from this place now, and never return."
>she points, and a silvery light flows from her claw to light the way out of the room toward the small corridor
>you look away from the open stone caskets that line the chamber
>and shudder as you have to deny your otherworldly host
"I-I am sorry, spirit. As I said, they blocked the entrance. They won't be back until morning. Unless you could...?"
>you look up to her hopefully, but the wolf shakes her head
>"If you could not, I cannot. I have power only over this tomb and its inhabitants."
>that is what you feared
>and even more you fear becoming an inhabitant permanently
>"Have your kind no respect? Where are your minders? The ainmithe that watch over the living have shirked their duty."
>saints in heaven
>she will not like this
"Please, forgiveness my lady. Th-there are none of your kind. I thought them only myth."
>the light in her eyes burns bright
>flaring with rage as her voice rises to a banshee screech
>"Am I myth to you?! Have I watched over your ancestors in holy duty for naught? Have my people died from the world and left mankind without master or caretaker?"
>her furious tone tapers and slips
>lowering to a melancholy whisper
>"Are my people truly gone?"
>you don't know how to answer
>perhaps, somewhere in the world there are more of her kind
>but you have never heard or seen of it
>you just stay, with head lowered in reverence, hoping her mercy holds
>her form drifts, lowering to the floor, where she sits with knees folded
>she gathers her shroud around her and moans
>"All for naught. All for naught..."
>what can you do?
>where once was terror, now pity fills your heart
>how long has this spirit lived alone, with the bones of humans she may have known in life
"My lady..."
>"Scáthach."
>her eyes flicker, weeping silver tears
>"My name was Scáthach."
>you nod slowly
"My lady Scáthach. I am sorry. Anything I can do..."
>her skull perks up
>cocking to the side curiously as she stares
>"Anything you can do...?"
>the wolf-woman makes another sound like the wind
>not the chill wind of her scornful reproach
>but the soft rustle of spring through blooming wildflowers
>laughter
>"As your ancestors served, so too do you return to service."
>Scáthach reaches out toward you, and hesitantly you reach your own hand to take the skeletal paw
>it is as cold as before, but it holds less terror for you now
>"What is your name, human?"
"Colin, of Drogheda."
>she pulls you to your feet, guiding you across the chamber
>"Colin of Drogheda. For your trespass I will ask a service of you. It has been long since last I felt the touch of a living being. Never before have I lain with another in my repose."
>you are taken through another passageway, and into a separate tomb
>carved into the walls is art of what Scáthach must have looked like in life
>tall, proud, with dark fur and bright blue eyes
>wearing bright clothes, the scraps of which you can see resting in a hollow opening in the raised stone in front with you
>"Join with me, Colin, at least until the morning."
>you realize what she's asking of you
>to lie beside her in her casket for the night
>you have to fight down the fear as she lies down
>the wolf-spirit reaches out to you, and draws you down into her resting place
>the only comfort from the cold stone is the wrapping of soft linen on the inside of the depression
>it would form a somewhat comfortable bed, where it not for the body of bones that now wraps around you
>spooning you and clutching you
>though her voice is calm and gentle, her body remains hard and cold
>her breath icy on your cheek
>"Warm. So warm."
>her paws start to explore
>clawing and tugging at your tunic to try and dig into the warmth below
>her legs entangle with yours
>and her ridged tail wraps around your ankle
>you whimper involuntarily as a claw finds its way through the wool and onto bare skin
>"There...there..."
>as the night goes on, Scáthach explores your body slowly and deliberately
>silencing any whimper and complain with a hush, and a soft reprimand
>"You have promised to serve, my Colin. Be still and I will be satisfied..."
>and yet...
>as the night goes on, she seems to grow warmer
>the harsh edge of bone softening somehow
>as you finally wash away to chilled sleep, you could swear you felt warm breath on your cheek
>soft fur on your skin
>and a sweet young woman's voice in your ear
>the morning finds you in Scáthach's arms
>her arms that are full flesh and fur
>she sighs sleepily when you rouse
>"Colin. My dear servant..."
>gone is the rasp of death
>and truly she sounds truly revived
>Scáthach rises first, lifting you in her arms and turning you to carry you as a man would carry a bride
>you can see her fully now
>she still glows, the only light in the dark tomb
>and she is not wholly reformed again
>her body, though it feels wholly real, seems intangible
>her bones visible through her fur
>and her eyes still empty pits with glowing pupils
>you blush when you realize how little her shroud covered her
>she is most definitely a woman, bare breasts pressing against you as she carries you to the tomb's entrance
>when she notices your burning face and reddened cheeks, Scáthach smiles a smile that you wouldn't have seen without her semi-restored body
>"There is no need for shame. You have laid with me, and now are bound to me."
>you gasp
>not knowing what she means, you fumble to question her
>but Scáthach continues
>"I have felt it. Since my arms went around you, the pact was sealed. In ages past your kind has served mine, and in beneficence I was tasked to look over them in life and death."
>she steps up to the entrance of the tomb, where with a flick of a paw, she shoves aside the stone easily
>"And now, by serving me, you too are under my protection."
>there's a rush of voices as she steps out into the morning sun
>the gathered villagers gasping and fleeing at the sight of you and Scáthach together
>"For as long as you live and serve, I shall be by your side."
>you swallow, realizing what that means
>the rest of your life, and even unto your death, you are bound to this spirit
>you nod
"Until the day I die, and beyond, my lady Scáthach."

>be inna dungeon with your party

>dire wolf barbarian jumps up way too quick
>"I got it!"
>she runs back to the last chamber
>thirty minutes later she comes back, beaming as she presents you with a bottle of "dire milk"
>you don't know what's more concerning, the look on her face as she presses the bottle to your lips and insists you drink every drop
>or the fact that she was ready to go, with a bottle pre-labeled

>Cow naturally makes protein rich milky
>Her Anon drinks it to maximize his gains

Being a Pokémon trainer is one of the most difficult, but also rewarding, professions a human can have.

>you are nobody
>a part time mercenary and caravan guard
>when times are good, you march with the ranks, fill out lords' armies, and eat and drink well
>when times are bad, you take whatever work you can get and scrabble for every coin you can keep hands on
>right now, times are bad
>you're reduced to guarding a small patch of forest around a village with just a quarterstaff
>you'd like to use your trusty billhook, but you sold it for drinking money three weeks back
>so it's just you, your stick, and a few acres where barely anything ever happens
>up and down the rocky hills of the countryside you wander back and forth, from the main road down smaller forest paths
>looking for lone outlaws and ragged beastmen footpads to chase off
>you're paid every night when you return to the village
>a destination you're setting a course for now that the sun has set and the day is over
>you descend down into a valley, on the far end of which is the small hamlet you're calling home
>on this side is a thick forest cut through with the old cart track
>you take the usual precautions, scanning the treeline and listening for anything out of the ordinary
>worst you'll see is some haggard beggars or petty thieves
>the sight of a tough, armed man like you will be more than enough to see them off
>and if things come to blows, you're confident you can handle whatever meager troublemaker comes your way
>but it pays to take precaution
>most of the way down the valley your prediction proves right
>the trail is empty, and besides the rustle of leaves in the wind, quiet
>but as if to spite you, when you reach the very end of the wood
>as the moon peaks up over the rising walls of the canyon, you hear shouting voices ahead in the trees
>you grip your stave
>and step toward the flickering light of a torch in the clearing ahead of you
>where you come upon a strange sight
>a beast-man, an elder goat in a rickety horse-drawn cart, waylaid by a badger
>that's armed and armored to the teeth
>the goat is clearly a local, his cart packed with satchels stuffed full, his take for the day
>the badger, meanwhile, looks like far more trouble than you bargained for
>stout, half a head shorter than yourself, and clad in armor
>at least mostly in armor
>her top half wrapped in the segmented metal strips
>but her bottom half is uncovered, save a brass belt holding up a strip of metal-woven cloth protecting her groin and a set of breeches that covered little more than her barest dignity
>and a sword in its sheath
>otherwise her legs are bare
>not a bad sight, if you were one for beasts
>thick and well-toned clearly from long travel
>your attention is brought upward when she speaks again
>"Well well! I'm glad I caught you."
>the badger's voice carries, as her face is uncovered, white fur with black stripes running over each eye and down her snout from her brow
>where a small brass circlet matching the belt rests
>and finally her hair, long and black, flows down in braided locks down to her shoulders, each ending in a ringlet of metal
>clearly banditry has been kind to her
>for she is most definitely a bandit, completing the look is a wicked looking warhammer, slung over her shoulder with one paw
>and yet, there's something familiar about her
>she smiles, showing off sharp teeth, and holds the bridle of the horse to keep it in place
>"No one passes through my wood without paying the toll."
>you hold back a sigh of exasperation, for fear she might hear you
>if it came to a fight, you might not be able to handle her
>you certainly didn't want to try it
>hopefully the goat-man will just pay her off and you can both be on your way
>instead, the idiot bleats angrily and tries to lash out at her
>kicking at her head
>which only serves to put it in reach for her to snatch it and drag the billy off the cart and face first into the dirt at her feet
>she sneers
>"Care to try that again, goat?"
>god damn it all, you're going to have to stop her
"Halt!"
>to forestall any further retaliation from the bandit, you step into the clearing and raise a hand in a ‘stop’ gesture
>if you let him get brained, fat chance you'll be paid your pittance for a hard days work
>goat and badger both turn their attention toward you
>the villager taking the opportunity to rise to his hooves and take a few steps away from the bandit
>"The watchman! Praise heaven you've arrived!"
>you stride forward, doing your best to look more confident than you really are
>and plant your stave on the ground in front of you once you've come close enough to the bandit as your comfort allows
>the goat retreats enough to stand behind you, leaving you to stare down the badger
>her dark brown eyes nearly black as they attempt to bore holes through your skull
>you still can't shake off the nagging sense of familiarity as you stare at her
>she too seems to be lost in thought as her brow furrows in consternation
>"Who are you humie?"
>you shrug
"Watchman. Who're you?"
>you know that's not what she meant
>but until you can place her, you intend to keep her at a disadvantage
>it's a disadvantage that doesn't last
>the badger reaches up and snatches the lantern from its post on the wagon's side
>she steps forward and thrusts it toward your face, blinding you momentarily before you can react
>she snorts
>"Well! I thought it was you! Didn't recognize you in those grubby clothes and stinking of dirt."
>you grip your polearm tighter, ready to snap into action
>you still can't place this beast-woman who laughs mockingly at your slightly disheveled state
>the goat behind you bleats indignantly
>"What are you doing?! Deal with her!"
>the badger regards the goat with a look of bemusement
>"Are you still here? Get lost."
>with a flourish, she hangs up the lantern and swats the pack horse on the rump
>the animal whinnies and trots off as fast as its burden allows
>and the goat dodges around her to scamper after it
>the badger scoffs
>"Now, where were we?"
>her black eyes bore into you
>like she's trying to kill you with a cold stare
>"Now, last I saw you was at the battle of Ruchten, when my company was fighting alongside a band of human mercenaries."
>you remember that battle
>indeed there had been a pack of beast-folk on the field that day
>another mercenary company your troop had had reinforced at a critical moment
>you recall seeing a few of their kind in the camp after the battle
>"But you were much better dressed back then. All proud as a peacock in your frills and feathered cap. Hero of the day."
>she giggles
>”Looks like you’ve fallen on hard times.”
>you shrug
“Win some. Lose some.”
>"Oh aye. And it looks like you've lost a fair bit more than me."
>with that she bursts into a laugh
>head thrown back, the gold rings in her braids jingling none too subtly as she chortles
>"You look little better than I did that day. What did you say when I thanked you that night? ‘Not worth a two penny fuck’?"
>so that's what she's driving at
>angry over being spurned
>you swing your quarterstaff into both hands and lower your stance
"So what are you going to do about it?"
>the badger hefts her warhammer, slapping the head down into a waiting paw and then matching your ready stance
>"I'm going to stove your fucking skull in."
>just what you feared
>if you were at your best, with proper arms and armor you could surely beat this badger brigand
>but in nothing more than a cloth gambeson and only an oak staff against her banded armor and weapons of war, you'd be lucky to survive
>still, you stand your ground
>too disciplined to run, even in the face of a superior foe
>that just meant dying tired
>the badger heaves her hammer up into the air
>you prepare to dodge away as she brings it hurtling down
>to stick into the earth beside her
>she bursts into another raucous laugh
>you twitch
>"Ha! You don't scare easy! Really gonna die for a bunch of peasants?"
>she leans on the haft of the hammer easily, all the fight gone out of her in an instant
>"I won't kill ya. Not when I can pay you."
>she reaches behind her back and produces a jingling bag that bulges with apparent coin
>the badger hefts it and starts poring through it
"Pay me?"
>you hold your ready stance still, not believing her
"For what?"
>she pulls out a small handful of coins, and holds them out
>"For the trouble. Five silver bits, and you forget I'm collecting tolls for a couple days. Then I'll be gone."
>you grimace
>she's paying you to look the other way
>typical low beast
"I can't take that."
>the badger rolls her dark eyes and fishes out another five coins
>"You are still a mercenary, are you not? Those peasants can't be paying you that much."
>that's a month's pay guarding this backwater
>slowly, expecting a trap, you release your grip on your weapon and reach for the coins
>the badger steps forward and drops the coins in your waiting hand
>"There! Now we're in business."
>you pocket the coins, ashamed to be so desperate for pay that you'd go back on your word
>but with a payday like that, you could afford to move on to greener pastures
>"Say, you want to earn a little more?"
>you look at her suspiciously
>she still smiles merrily
"How? I'm not going to rob anyone."
>the badger shakes her head and pulls out another handful of coins
>"No, no. I just want you to apologize for Ruchten. Say, 'I'm sorry for insulting you, Wyetta.'"
>she has to be kidding
>you look at her in bafflement, but she just maintains her cheery smile
>and proffers another five silver bits
>it's just an apology
>you can afford to lose a little face for that price
"I'm sorry--"
>"Wait!"
>she starts pawing through the bag of coin fervently
>giggling to herself
>as she produces a gold piece
>"Apologize on your knees and I'll give you this too."
>you bristle at first, not wanting to kneel before this bandit beast
>but the coin she's offering...
"Give it to me first, then I'll do it."
>Wyetta flips the coin toward you, and you snatch it out of the air with indecent haste
>jamming the coin in your pocket you can't help but smile
>times are getting good indeed
>now the hard part
>you slowly sink to one knee
>then drop onto your other knee and look up to your temporary employer
"I'm sorry for insulting you, Wyetta."
>the badger's eyes are alight with glee
>then they disappear from view as she leans back and bellows with laughter
>”I can’t believe it! If I had known a little coin was all it took to get you on your knees back then…”
>you roll your eyes and start to stand again
>but Wyetta holds out a paw to stop you
>"Hold it!"
>you have to resist swatting away her hand
>if she's angry with you, she probably won't feel like sharing any more
>and belatedly, you realize you may not agree to what she offers next
"What do you want?"
>"Thank me. For being so kind."
>this is starting to get irritating
>her smug attitude is grating on your nerves, and you want to get back to the village to spend your new coin
>you roll your eyes
"Fine. Thank you. I am leaving."
>again you're stymied by a paw in your face
>this time her footpaw which she presses against your nose
>giggling like a child
>"No! No! Thank me properly. Kiss my paw."
>that's a step to far
>apologizing is one thing, thanking her another
>but this is degrading
>you go to shove her foot away when you hear the clinking of coins
>another two gold pieces drop on the ground in front of you
>but before your can snatch them, Wyetta pulls her paw back and stamps down on them
>"Kiss, and I'll lift my paw."
>you shake your head
>no amount of money could convince you to kiss a beast's dirty paws
"Enough. I'm not taking that money, I'm a mercenary, not some--"
>you're interrupted by Wyetta bursting into laughter so loud her entire body shakes
>doubled over, stumpy tail quivering
>"You--You're not a mercenary!"
>she catches her breath
>"You're a whore!"
>you're shocked by the insult
>eye twitching in irritation
>face burning in humiliation
>temper flaring in rage
>fuck her
>fucking beast-cunt
>you ball your fists
>but before you can rise to strike her, Wyetta reacts
>snatching not for the warhammer, but the bag of coins again
>spilling a fistful of coins onto the ground
>you freeze at the sound of so much money clattering into a pile
>gold, silver, copper bits
>more than you'd seen since before Ruchten
>"You. Are. A whore. Dropped to your knees for a coin. Now..."
>she jangles the sack tantalizingly
>letting a few more coins fall out
>good lord, she's throwing away wages that would serve for years
>"How much will it cost, whore?"
>you tremble
>how can you turn down that much?
>when you've already accepted some of her money?
>you haven't had a good ale in months
>you bow your head
>defeated without a fight
"Fine."
>Wyetta laughs and laughs
>your shame growing with every mirthful chortle
>"For that price, I want more than a kiss. Come here."
>she grabs your hair and yanks to off the road
>the pile of coins left behind as you crawl after her
>any attempt to rise just has her shoving you down again
>the badger teases you with a jangle of her coin pouch every step to keep you compliant
>she sets down on a fallen tree trunk just out of sight of the road
>"There we are. Still on your knees like a good whore. Now, kiss."
>she lifts her footpaw to your face again, and this time you purse your lips in anticipation
>instead she just giggles
>"Does a good whore sit and wait? No, no. Bring your lips to my paw."
>you sigh through your nose
>face burning with shame as you lean in and kiss the underside of her paw
>"Ah. Good boy. Keep going."
>you give the rough pawpad another kiss, and another
>trying to ignore the unpleasant taste of dirt and sweat
>"Keep going. Keep going..."
>you hear the jangling of metal, and stop kissing her paw long enough to see her unbuckling her belt
>Wyetta chastises you
>"Now do the top."
>her paw flexes downward and you take it in one hand
>at least her furry toes are less dirty than her pads
>and less rough on your lips
>Wyetta's breath hitches a bit
>"There's a good whore. Keep going."
>you can see now, she's set her belt to the side, and slid a paw down her breeches
>clearly teasing herself as you smother her paw in kisses
>at least, you were until you stopped to stare
>with a huff, the badger turns her paw to push her pads to your lips again
>"Did I tell you to stop? Now lick it."
>she preempts any rebuttal with another jingle of her coinpurse beside her
>and you simply lower your eyes and go back to work, opening your mouth and letting the pad of one of her toes land on your tongue
>Wyetta shivers and a soft moan escapes her muzzle
>her paw works under her breeches with more purpose now
>god
>forget a decent ale
>how long has it been since you've been with a woman?
>despite your shame, you find yourself getting excited
>hardening erection trapped against your trousers as you draw your tongue over the big pad of her paw
>"Fuck. Imagine my luck..."
>Wyetta huffs and chews her lip
>"...finding a desperate fleshling slut..."
>her paw works harder
>without prompting, you draw your tongue up to her toes, and wrap your lips around one
>lathering the digit with your tongue until it's soaked with your spit
>"...who--unf--who gives in for a fistful of silver..."
>the badger starts to laugh again
>"...and enjoys being treated like the whore he is!"
>the paw is yanked out of your mouth, dropping to press down hard on your groin
>you gasp
"W-wait! It's not--"
>Wyetta just laughs over your denial
>rubbing your cock with a paw
>"I don't care. Say you love being my whore or you won't see a penny."
>shamefaced, you bow your head
>even more shameful is the fact she may not have needed to threaten you
>the way she teases you with a paw
>you're so pent up, you're putty
"I love being your whore, Wyetta."
>"Of course you do. Bitch."
>you wince as she grinds into your balls with her toes
>the sharp point of her paws making little pinpricks of pain on the sensitive organ
>but Wyetta relents and withdraws her footpaw
>"Then show me. I want you to spill your seed while washing my paw with your tongue."
>you undo your pants and expose yourself
>enduring the humiliation of more mocking laughter as she drops her spit-slicked paw once more
>using it to lube your cock with just enough pressure to make your squirm
>"Get to it, whore."
>the paw disappears, replaced a moment later by your hand as you take your shaft
>but your focus is pulled to another footpaw put in front of you
>this time there's no hesitation
>only the perverse pleasure of humiliated submission
>licking her pawpads clean of weeks of travel
>savoring the moans and chirps she makes in between rude laughter
>watching her masturbate under her undergarments as fuel for your own display
>you drag your tongue from pad to pad
>swirling each toe in your mouth
>all the while pumping your cock for Wyetta's sick enjoyment
>"Good--fucking--whore--"
>she growls, squirming on her seat as she forces all her toes past your lips
>"Suck on them, slut."
>you groan around the invading digits, but comply
>your cock twitches in your hand as you pump it with abandon
>some long-suppressed part of you responding with fervor every time she calls you a whore
>for all your pride, Wyetta was right
>you're enjoying this far more than a payday
>"Fucking--stupid--whore--"
>the paw in her breeches works wildly
>a show blocked only by a layer of wool that's soaked through with her juices
>"--shoulda--just--said--yes--"
>your tongue laps between her toes and pawpads
>your face half-covered in a sheen of spit
>cock dripping a constant stream of seed onto the forest floor
>"Do it–"
>Wyetta demands
>"Fuckin’--cum already!”
>as if your very body listened to her command over yours, you shudder

What's your favorite flavor of "Safari" adhg story premise, from the male pov?
>Hunter becomes the hunted (either in a tribal huntsman sense or modern hunter sense)

>Males will show submissive behaviour when approaching females in heat, even if the male outweighs his partner. Females usually favour younger males born or joined into the clan after they were born. Older females show a similar preference, with the addition of preferring males with whom they have had long and friendly prior relationships. Passive males tend to have greater success in courting females than aggressive ones.
Hyenas absolutely love shotas. Ironically enough they're actually cougars.

some fun extra info
>spotted hyenas females don't have anything like menopause so remain fertile throughout their entire life
>erections are submissive
>a male "flirting" does so by lowering their head while wrapping one of their forepaws around the other across their chest like nervous gesture you'd see from boys being bullied

>You are Anon, the most generic human being in existence.
>As you’re walking down the street, whistling a soft tune to the winds of Fall, you can’t help but think about the past few weeks.
>Work has been slow as always.
>Not many go to a mechanic shop in a small town like yours.
>That doesn’t mean the business is on the verge of bankruptcy, far from it.
>Being the receptionist has its advantages; not much physical strain, a desk job in itself, being candy-eye for the anthros customers.
>Sometimes, you wish you still lived in the Free World.
>You have the citizenship to move, but ever since the embargo, you automatically became a citizen of the Anthrostate.
>Stopping at a crosswalk, you glance at the wolf standing beside you; towering at a comfortable two meters, she doesn’t pay much mind to you.
>Listening to her conversation on the phone, you infer that she is already assigned to some poor bastard, or lucky depending on your political views.
>You mentally chuckle at that.
>It was anything but political.
>The good ol' freedom vs safety.
>“Safety.”
>As safe as it can be to have an anthro assigned to you, have her milk your cock dry and break your pelvis.
>Every. Single. Day.
>You shake your head, pushing away the arousal.
>You were better than that.
>There was no way you'd let them assign you some brute. Or any anthro for that matter.
>Even if you weren’t allowed to marry a human woman, at least you could choose your wife.
>As nice as it sounds, the Anthrostate doesn't care.
>If you resisted, they’d find a way to break you.
>God forbid they discover your fetish.
>The light turns green, and you cross the road.
>The commercial center was nothing spectacular like the great western cities across the Atlantic, but you couldn’t complain.
>The war was devastating, and it would take years to restore all that has been lost.
>Turning right at the end of the block, you move towards the residential district.
>Sad, gray apartment buildings line up the collector.
>Soviet architecture may suck at times, but they know how to be efficient with resources.
>A whistle blows from one of the apartments you pass.
>Looking to the source reveals it to be a topless hyena waving at you.
>Damn yeens flashing their boobs.
>You ignore her, continuing on your merry way.
>Digressing back to the beginning, you reminisce on the past few weeks.
>You made friends with one particular customer.
>A great horned owl to be exact.
>She was slightly taller than you, by a human pinkie finger.
>At first, it was small talk; how's the day, the weather, recent news, expansion into the pacific, local drama, the works.
>Naturally, it became something a little more.
>How was her day, the weather, recent news, did anything interesting happen, local drama, the works.
>Then, something much more.
>How was her day, how was she feeling, did she take care of herself, was everything fine, did she want to go to a café.
>The last one slipped out when you were a little more tired than usual.
>She simply laughed it off, but accepted nonetheless.
>It was just a shared dinner, you swore!
>You weren’t going to take it anywhere.
>But you liked avians.
>Even before the Anthrostate took over.
>You liked the feel of soft feathers.
>Eyes full of life.
>The adorable coos and purrs they made.
>You really liked avians.
>However, nothing in life is ever so simple.
>When you went on that “date” with her, you asked if she was assigned.
>What happened next hurt a little.
>She said she wasn’t, but was already in a relationship.
>With another anthro.
>She was a dyke.
>Ouch.
>If the Anthrostate found out, they would accelerate her assignment.
>It’s not that they hated them, they just wanted to get everyone assigned.
>Even by force, if that was necessary.
>The populace wasn’t looking too shabby.
>Nevertheless, you respected her choice and ceased the natural advancements.
>It still stung.
>Even as you near her apartment.
>But again, such is life.
>When you think you’ve got it all figured out, something has to go wrong.
>Who was it again?
>Murphy?
>The bastard.
>Arriving at your destination, you rang the bell to the horned owl’s apartment.
>It was the kind of complex you needed permission to enter.
>Hence, you waited outside for her to let you in.
>Strangely enough, after going radio silent after the “rejection,” she asked you to come to her home when you crossed paths in the mall.
>Of course, you agreed.
>A little flame of hope reignited.
>Why?
>Who knows.
>Maybe it was the prospect of having a chance.
>However false it was.
>A buzz sounds from the intercom, granting you access to the apartment complex.
>You enter, starting to climb the stairs to her floor.
>It's fairly high, but you eventually make it.
>Again, depressing decor of nothing.
>You make the final stretch to her door.
>Before you even knock, she opens it.
<“Anon! Please, come in, make yourself at home.”
>You greet her as well and do as she asked.
>It’s okay.
>Neat living room, kitchen connected to said room, a bedroom and bathroom down the corridor, you presume.
>As you take off your shoes, you inquire about the reason for inviting you, choosing to leave out how she cut all contacts from your life without warning.
<“I was busy, y’know? It’s tough living without the pluses of assignment…”
>You totally feel her.
>Assignment guarantees a stable income from the state, a significant tax relief and many other advantages.
>But you didn’t want to be told what to do.
>You are Anon, the free-est man in the world!
>No anthro could tell you what to do with your life!
>Expect your boss.
>And your landlord.
>And your-
>Nevermind.
>You are Anon, the “free-est” man in the world!
>Still, she didn’t exactly give a proper answer.
>You ask again, albeit with more authority.
>However minute it is.
>She smiles, brushing back the feathers around her face, “I need to show you something, can I trust you to keep it a secret?”
>Your heart rate spikes.
>Is she one of those traffickers?
>The ones that kidnap men and sell them to anthros overseas.
>If that were the case, you had a chance to return to the Americas.
>As a: “Slave hubby, cum dispenser, cunt-licker, clit-sucker, good breeding boy," etcetera.
>You learned those words from a group of yeens that entered the shop one time.
>Before getting promptly kicked out by the bull shark of a musclewoman.
>No, she couldn’t be.
>She was too nice to be like that.
>You trusted her.
>You give a single nod.
>That's enough for her to lead you to her bedroom.
>You wonder where her girlfriend is, but you keep to yourself.
>Perhaps she's working somewhere.
>It's none of your business anyway.
>Strangely enough, she unlocks the door with a key.
>Well, better safe than sorry.
>“Come in, come in. I think you’ll like what’s inside~”
>You humor her, making a sly comment about-
>What the fuck.
>On the bed is another avian.
>A burrowing owl.
>She is tied to the bed by her hands and feet.
>What the actual fuck.
>Before you can voice your shock, the door slams shut.
>A loud locking mechanism turns.
>You are trapped in this fever dream.
>Turning on your heel, you demand to know what the hell is all of this.
>But before you can finish your sentence, a pair of clawed hands grab your shoulders.
>She is right up against you.
>Her beak touching your nose.
>Her eyes locked onto yours, unblinking.
>Too stunned to do anything, she seizes the moment and moves her hands upwards, wrapping them around your neck.
>Then, she lunges.
>Like a spartan spear, her tongue pierces your mouth.
>She initiates a French kiss.
>You attempt to pull away, but her grip is of steel.
>No matter how much you pull and tug, you can’t stop her.
>And you’re running out of air.
>You moan into her, and she does as well.
>You attempt to break free again by letting your legs go limp.
>But she simply holds you up.
>She’s much stronger than she appeared to be.
>It’s so hot.
>Your head feels like it’s about to melt into a puddle.
>Just before you pass out, she breaks the kiss, the both of you panting.
>“Did it feel good, Anon?”
>You can’t even reply, still focused on processing the sudden pleasure.
>“I love you, Anon. It’s just…
>“It hurts me to see us like this. All of us.”
>You’re reminded of the third person present in the room.
>She was watching the entire thing unfold, unable to express whatever she was feeling due to the gag around her own beak.
>“I can’t choose, Anon. It’s too much, so…
>“How about we be together? The three of us. Hmm~?”
>Your eyes widen.
>She can’t be serious, you tell her.
>The Anthrostate would never approve of polygamy, you add.
>Only in the case that all anthros are sisters. And even then it’s complicated.
>“... Is that so, my little humie?”
>The air in the room changes.
>The hairs on the back of your neck stand in alarm.
>Her hands are still around your neck.
>You beg her to let you go, that you’ll forget any of this ever happened.
>She chuckles at your pathetic attempt at negotiation.
>As if you ever had a choice in the matter.
>“I don’t think so, Anon.”
>She carries you over to the bed, unceremoniously throwing you onto the other anthro before climbing on herself.
>“Now, we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.”
>You and the smaller owl look at each other, mutual agreement upon the insanity of the situation.
>You shake your head no.
>The horned owl sighs, “So be it.”
>Once again, she grabs you by the neck, and pins you down.
>You’re on your back, your head laying near the burrowing owl’s hip.
>The horned owl starts to strip you.
>Once your brain processes just how quickly this is escalating, you yelp in surprise.
>But you can’t stop her.
>You’re a man.
>Men are weaker than anthros.
>The Anthrostate has reversed the traditional roles.
>And biology is there to back it up.
>Once you are in your birthday suit, she flips you over, bringing you up to the smaller anthro.
>Relative to her. The burrowing owl is slightly shorter than you, but you still meet her at eye level.
>The horned owl has you sandwiched between her and her girlfriend.
>Their feathers caressing your skin.
>Two pairs of breasts pressed against you.
>You can’t lie.
>It turns you on.
>“Come on Anon, do it~”
>You wonder innocently for a second what she means.
>Then, it strikes you.
>She wants you to fuck her girlfriend.
>What the actual fuck.
>The anthro below you is just as shocked and unwilling.
>You outright refuse.
>That was the wrong move.
>Wrapping one hand around your growing cock, the owl above you starts pumping.
>The other is around your torso, leaving red marks with every scratch.
>It hurts, but the pleasure overwrites the former.
>Once you’re at full-mast, she angles you into her partner’s cunt.
>Unbelievably, she is leaking.
>How did you get here?
>How did you do it?
>You lucky bastard.
>The horned owl is playing with you and her partner like a barbie set.
>All thought escapes you when she pushes you inside the other owl.
>You both moan in a soup of shared, mixed emotions.
>The horned owl falls over you, keeping you deep inside the other.
>It feels amazing, however wrong it is.
>Until your smaller head becomes dangerously sensitive.
>You cry out, the pleasure increasing exponentially by the second.
>Yet, no matter what you do, she’s still stronger than you.
>As a last resort, you beg her to stop.
>You promise you’ll do anything, just that she lets you out.
>Her girlfriend isn’t doing so hot either.
>Twitching and writhing, her feathers puffing up and down, tears leaving her eyes.
>Her own cries are silenced by the gag.
>You feel the all too familiar release on your doorstep.
>You try to warn her, but they are very aware of that.
>One knows it, and the other feels it.
>The horned owl finally removes the gag from her partner.
>You subconsciously begin to thrust into the smaller anthro, eliciting a lewd response from her.
>Her tongue lolling out and eyes rolling back.
>You give a few more thrusts, burying your face in her cleavage.
>And cum inside her.
>You explode like a volcano, shooting your hot load into her tight, virgin cunt.
>Now deflowered by yours truly.
>You keep ejaculating for what feels like forever.
>Your essence keeps flowing into her.
>Your cockhead kissing her cervix.
>But like all things in life, the good must come to an end.
>You have dumped your load inside her.
>Unwillingly.
>Your mind jumps to the possibility of pregnancy.
>But the anthro pinning you down cuts in, “My, my~ You came so much, Anon! She’s definitely knocked up now!”
>She pushes herself off of you, starting to undo the restraints on her partner.
>Oh God.
>This is bad.
>It felt so good.
>But this is bad.
>Very bad.
>When her girlfriend wakes up, she’ll be so mad-
>The moment the last of the bindings is undone, the burrowing owl flips you over.
>You're on your back, and she’s straddling your hips.
>With your cock still nestled inside her.
>Still rock hard.
>Before you can voice something, anything, she starts riding you.
>Being so sensitive after just cumming, you moan a few octaves higher than you thought was possible.
>Instinctively, your hands rush to throw her off.
>Only for the horned owl to catch you.
>She lays beside you, her winged arms wrapped around your chest.
>Completely immobilizing you.
>All the while, the burrowing owl rides you harder and faster.
>You thought she was a dyke!
>“I told you it would feel good, honey~”
>You felt that it wasn't directed at you.
>The burrowing owl looks to the heavens, muttering something about the “Cock of Man.”
>Not too long after, you cum inside her for the second time.
>She keeps you at the hilt, her cervix kissing your cockhead back.
>Before starting again.
>The process repeats itself.
>Over.
>And over.
>And over.
>And over.
>Even after you pass out, she keeps fucking you silly.
>Her partner joined in on the fun at some point, but you weren’t sober enough to remember what happened after the ninth time you shot blanks.

>Bastet
>Herodotus also relates that of the many solemn festivals held in Egypt, the most important and most popular one was that celebrated in Bubastis in honor of this goddess. Each year on the day of her festival, the town was said to have attracted some 700,000 visitors, both men and women (but not children), who arrived in numerous crowded ships. The women engaged in music, song, and dance on their way to the place. Great sacrifices were made and prodigious amounts of wine were drunk—more than was the case throughout the year. This accords well with Egyptian sources that prescribe that lioness goddesses are to be appeased with the "feasts of drunkenness".
Could be a good setup for a story
>Drunk
>Lost
>She sees you being lost as a reason to protect you, and sees you drunk as a way of you honoring her, but seeks your direct praise and idolization.
>There's also probably a potential story in there somewhere of her hiding amongst the humans by cosplaying as Ankha at some conventions, where she particulartly enjoys the attention you give her for her "realistic fursuit."

>move to a town with a bunch of snakes

>her moans are later joined by similar ones rising up through various secluded areas throughout the city as the hivemind of heros focus all their attention on (you)

>anthros make gimmick foods they hand out to humies

Take the wolfpill anon. Wolf supremacy is inevitable. You may resist, but you know in your heart that human men were made to hold wolf anthro paws.

Unless you're in therapy for no bitch, anthros make awful therapists.

>be therapist anon
>see anthros most of the time if not always coming into your office
>most come in because of some deep shit or because theyve seen some shit
>some are cops, firefighters, ex military ect. or they are just normal civilians
>some book themselves in just to get closer to a humie

Gives me an idea

>be form eastern Urop
>recently moved from your human homeland to anthro majority nation
>it was a hard move, but you needed to get out to survive
>your homeland is a hell-hole, near constantly embroiled in civil war or border conflict with its neighbors
>more than once seen intervention from greater anthro nations
>like the one you moved to
>it's odd being the only human in a city of thousands, but for the most part it's fine
>your apartment is small, but safe
>some strangers stare, but the anthros you know are nice
>you work a simple job that pays the bills, and even have a few friends you meet for drinks
>one day you're out buying groceries, dodging between anthros in the aisles, when you bump into one
>usually anthros will try to accommodate your smaller size, and are kind enough to apologize when they knock you around
>but this one, a canine, snarls and whips her head
>glaring at the air over your head where a similarly sized anthro's face would be
>she's a big dog
>all anthros are big, but she's built, bulky and menacing
>but with a potbelly that comes from from excess eating, if you had to guess
>"Watch where you're going you--"
>her snarling threat cuts off when she looks down to see you
>you duck your head and take a step back
"Sorry. Eh, I try to go around. Sorry."
>you curse yourself
>you still haven't mastered the local language, and sound so obviously foreign is embarrassing
>the anthro slowly turns toward you
>her nose works, sniffing the air
>her ears twitch this way and that
>now that she's facing you, you can see her olive green t-shirt bears the insignia of the country's army
>oh no
>you have met her kind before
>they hate humans because they fought them in one of the wars
>and hate even more to see one in their homeland
>you hiss out a curse in your own language and take another step back
"Sorry. I will go."
>then something strange happens
>the canine whines
>"Grigor."
>that is not your name
>though it is common enough where you come from
>maybe she's mistaken you for someone else
>in any case, she doesn't seem angry, more surprised
>so you smile at her as you shake your head
"No, not Grigor. My name is--"
>the canine isn't listening
>she raises a meaty paw and brings it down
>letting it slap your shoulder and nearly unbalance you
>then grasping you hard and dragging you toward
>"Grigor. God."
>you can see and hear her nose working overtime
>not just sniffing the air, but breathing heavily
>chest rising and falling under that army logo
>her jaw trembling
>"Grigor. I'm sorry."
>you try to shake your head again, taking her paw to pull it free but she clamps down harder
>claws digging in
>ow!
>you pull harder
>she grips harder
>other paw on your shoulder
>"Please, don't go."
>is she crying?
>she's almost hyperventilating between short whines
>the canine slowly sinks to her knees, head level with your chest for a moment before she drags you into a crushing hug
>you groan, all the air forced out of your lungs
>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
>your struggling and protesting only makes her grip you harder
>whatever is going on, you have no control over what's happening to you
>even the other anthros don't intervene, looking the other way or skirting around you and your captor
"Please! I do not understand!"
>you try to look up to her, but the back of your head is engulfed in a meaty paw
>then your face is engulfed in a meaty chest
>belying her muscular frame, her body is soft
>a layer of fat keeping you from being crushed by bulky muscle as you're cradled by this giant war dog
>the canine strokes your hair, letting out plaintive whines and apologies
>"I'm so sorry Grigor. I'm sorry. I didn't see you. I didn't know. I'm sorry, please."
>you still don't know what she's talking about, but she doesn't stop
>begging forgiveness for something she missed
>finally you decide to hug her back
>maybe that will get her to let you go
>your arms don't even reach all the way around her barrel frame
>her muscular back warm beneath the thin t-shirt
"It is okay. No sorry. It is okay."
>you do your best to comfort her and the whining slows
>you feel sorry for the poor girl, whatever is wrong with her
>and so you hum an old lullaby from your homeland in your efforts to console
>the canine starts rocking back and forth, the whines turning into soft hiccupping pants
>and for a while, in the middle of the grocery store, you hold this strange, strong woman, as she weeps
>you do not know how long it takes for her to collect herself
>"I--I'm sorry."
>she starts again, and you try to shush her
>the canine goes on, loosening her hug
>"I don't--I don't know what--"
>with your face freed from her chest you see her cheeks soaked with tears and her ears folded back
>but she's calmed down now, eyes tired and sad
>"You just--you look just like him. Smell like him."
>you nod slowly
>surely whoever Grigor was, this dog loved him dearly
"It is okay. No problem."
>the canine shudders and sighs
>"Thank you. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to..."
>you just nod in understanding
"When I am little, back home, I lose my brother. He is gone long time, but sometimes I see him. Dream him."
>her heavy paw on your shoulder feels soft as you wrap your hands around it
"Lose is hard. You take Grigor with you. Mean you love him."
>the canine sniffs and nods
>"Thank you."
>she releases you and stands, glancing around at the small crowd who watched the scene
>her brow furrows and she growls
>"What are you all looking at?"
>the other anthros find somewhere else to look
>smiling a sad smile, the dog nods her head back down at you
>then turns and walks away
>you too must hurry on home, but as you gather your things, you think to yourself
>tonight you will pray for the dog and her Grigor

>naked and afraid, but with anthros
>instead of a guy and girl duo/group it's a human guy and anthro woman duo/group
>it's also an 18+ show now too
>most likely has side betting pools on who's going to hook up/how long until an anthro snu snus a humie
or
>humie guy(s) forced to survive/reach a destination while naked in the wilderness
>and being hunted by naked anthro women

>Anthro version of alone
>Instead of each contestant being by themselves it's a human and an anthro
>Each season takes place in a new inhospitable environment
>Each anthro is native to the location so lionesses and yeens for the savannah, bears and moose for northern forests, tigers and apes for the jungle, etc.
>Each human is billed as a 'survival expert' but in reality it's mostly people who vastly overestimate their own abilities
>Since the anthros are used to the land they have an easy time surviving but there in lies the struggle, if their humie companion taps out then they both lose the competition
>Cue anthros snuggling humies in the middle of snowstorms whispering words of encouragement, anthros saving their haples humies after they accidentally take a tumble into some ice water, anthros going on desperate searches for water as their humie slowly dehydrates
>The last group to make it to the end gets a cash prize and a heavy discount on a wedding ceremony

>For the humans, it's a survival show
>For the anthros, it's a dating show
>Humans get serious po-face interviews about what they're planning on doing to survive, challenges they've overcome, how they've worked together with their anthro and what they're planning on doing next
>Anthro interviews are a completely different tone, discussing favorite moments with the human, likes and dislikes about their personality, how they're planning on wrangling them and what their wedding plan is
It really has something for everyone.

>Be you
>Be abducted by Starline
>Were you going to be part of his whole orchestrated heroics to manipulate the public plan?
>No, you've been made into the ultimate desk jockey
>Paperwork is your bitch, any and all forms are filled out in record time
>In triplicate
>It's not even a hard job for you
>You don't mind this whole situation, life probably wasn't that great before Starline nabbed you anyways
>Hell the only bad part about this whole thing would be-
>[BING]
>Surge.
>For some reason she decided that you are her boyfriend and never gave you a choice

>(good fucking lord)
>doctor says the baby is likely more on the human side due to the small size of her belly

“Good morning. This is for the crew today!”
>you smile brightly at the ferret in the flight attendant’s uniform as you step into the airplane’s cabin
>you hold out a bag of chocolates to her
>it was a habit of yours to bring sweets whenever you go on a flight, the small kindness earning you free food, drinks, and other courtesies from the flight staff more often than not
>the ferret seems especially pleased to receive them, dooking in excitement as she accepts the bag
>”Oh that is just precious! You’re too kind cutie. What seat are you in?”
>you tell her your spot and she beams
>”I’ll let the crew know to take extra good care of you! And I’ll stop by to make sure you have a very special flight.”
>she turns her head to give a quick wink, and you blush
“Looking forward to it! Thank you kindly, miss...”
>you glance at the nametag on her chest
"Hailey."
>the ferret is all smiles as you march past to take your seat
>you know exactly what that little wink means
>free mini-scotch bottles!
>you hop into your seat and scoot back to buckle in
>one of the luxuries of flying an anthro airline is the chairs are much bigger, so even with a big grey wolf in the window seat next to you, you don't feel cramped
>you pull out your phone and headphones and get ready to start ignoring the safety brief
>but when you look up at the stewardess demonstrating how to inflate a safety vest, you see it's the same ferry you handed the chocolates to
>and she's smiling right at you
>so you nod your head and smile right back, a little abashed to be caught ignoring her
>you pull off the headset and listen to the usual safety spiel, the whole while she doesn't take your eyes off you
>you try to smile back at her, but her stare is hard to match
>big brown eyes twinkling merrily
>she's really cute
>there's another reason you took the anthro airlines
>you think they're pretty
>and flying as often as you do, seeing them smile from something as simple as a bag of candy is a treat
>you're too embarrassed to do more than smile and look away when she gives you another wink
>you get it, she likes the sweets
>she's gonna kill you with all this cuteness!
>once the briefing is over, Hailey marches past you down the aisle, brushing you with her tail on her way to the back
>you rub your arm where it touched you
>so soft
>with a warm feeling in your chest, you throw your headphones on and settle down for takeoff
>it's not long before you're in the air and ascending to cruising altitude
>in that time, Hailey passed by you twice to give you a grin and a wink
>and even another flight attendant, this one a board a foot shorter and twice as broad as Hailey
>who regards you with a twitching snout
>"You the one brought the chocolates?"
>you nod at her
>she nods her head
>"Thanks."
>then she moves on
>not even a flicker of a grin on her face, but you're glad she appreciated them too
>eventually the seatbelt sign pings overhead, and the captain's voice from the intercom informs you that you are free to move about the cabin
>no sooner than his announcement ends do you feel a soft paw on your shoulder
>Hailey leans down next to your seat
>"Excuse me sir, if you could follow me to the rear of the cabin."
>you blink and pull out your headphones
"Huh? What are you talking about?"
>the ferret titters and twists her head to the side in a gesture toward the back
>"Right back there sir."
>this hasn't happened before, but you'd hate to disappoint the flight attendant
>maybe she wants to pass you some stuff in secret?
>you shrug and undo your buckle, following Hailey's hypnotically swishing tail all the way down the aisle to the back cabin
>you look up when you hear the soft click of her opening the bathroom door
>she steps aside and gestures for you to enter the bathroom
"What's up?"
>she just points you in with that unwavering smile
>so with a shrug you step into the cramped bathroom
>and Hailey follows, trapping you when she shuts the door
"What are you doing?"
>Hailey is pressed up against you
>her long, lithe body keeping you pinned, unable to turn around and question her as her arms wrap under yours and hold you in place
>"Shh. Don't worry cutie. "
>she giggles
>"I told you I'd give you a special flight. Such a sweetheart, bringing us those treats."
>craning her long neck down, she wraps over yours to snuff your hair with her breath
>with her weight pushing forward and down on you, you're forced to hold yourself up against the wall with your arms
>giving Hailey free reign to run her paws down your chest
>you're squeezed between her groping paws and her pressing body
>her fur so voluminous that you can feel it tickling the top of your ears as it engulfs your head
>you can feel the form of her breasts resting on your shoulders
>there's a flash of warmth as her paws find their way under your shirt
>you shiver and twitch
>almost losing balance as the plane goes through a patch of turbulance
>there's another snuff from Hailey giggling
>"Careful sir! We haven't gotten to the premium service yet."
>as if in admonishment for your stumble, she runs a paw up your chest and pinches a nipple in her claws
>you yelp
>the hard edge of her claw twisting the sensitive flesh for a moment, making you squirm even more
>she releases it before it hurts more than the sudden shock
>but only because she needs both paws to start undoing your belt and pants
"St-stop!"
>Hailey stops just as she grasps your boxers
>and questions in a voice laden with faux concern
>"Stop? But sir, you seem to be enjoying yourself."
>she has a point
>you're hard as diamonds from this sudden molestation
>the ferret traces over the outline of your bulge with an extended claw
>making you twitch
>"A precious little humie, with an adorable little blush, who brought a whole bag of candy just to brighten my day?"
>she cups your groin and squeezes lightly to tease out a groan from you
>"How could I resist?"
>fuck
>were you giving off 'fuck me' vibes this whole time?
>if you weren't before, you certainly are now, literally throbbing in her paws
>"Just relax sir. Airthro Airlines is dedicated to providing the height of travel experience."
>you should not be this turned on by a shitty corporate tag line
>but when it's coming from a pretty ferret who's wrapped all around you and pawing at every inch of skin she can reach, how can you resist?
>she takes you moan of pleasure as consent and slips a paw into your underwear
>her fur tickles as it glides up and down your shaft
>not quite stroking it yet, but a light brush back and forth that teases you into twitching under her ministrations
>you moan
>Hailey giggles
>"So you would like my service, sir?"
>her fingers play at your head as you nod jerkily
>the ferret hums as her paws work
>one pulling your boxers down to free your cock
>the other taking it fully and starting to jerk you off
>"There we are. I hope you enjoy the Airthro Airlines premium service."
>with her free paw she starts fondling your balls
>cupping and rolling them in her warm paw pads
>just as silky smooth as her fur
>there's just one thing
"C-could you skip the corpo talk? It's distracting."
>Hailey shifts so her head hangs over your shoulder, and her whiskers tick your ear when she laughs
>"Don't like it? I think it's fun."
>her paws starts working faster
>your arms start to tremble from the effort of holding yourself up
>"I'm on my paws all day, smiling for rude customers and spouting that bullshit."
>Hailey goes faster
>squeezing your shaft harder
>"But I can use it to play with my new favorite passenger!"
>you try to open your mouth to respond
"I just--"
>you're cut off by another moan as she suddenly speeds her pace
>rolling her hips to force you to buck into her paw
>"Hush. You're loving this, just let it happen."
>you can't deny her that
>now that she got you started, you can't help but buck into her strokes
>another moan confirms it
>Hailey's going to get her way
>"Thank you for your patience, sir. Airthro Airlines is happy to take care of its favorite customer."
>you grit your teeth, half because of the cringe worthy line
>and half because she's got you on the edge of orgasm
>using your pre-cum as lube her paw can piston harder, and faster
>then just as you think you're going to cum, she holds you by the base and lets you twitch
>then the whole cycle starts again with her rubbing your tip, drawing more moans from you
>"Are you enjoying your premium service today, hon?"
>you try to groan out a yes
>it comes out of of a 'yuuuh-fuck'
>because she took your shaft in both paws, blurring them with the speed she strokes you
>or maybe it's just your mind going hazy
>"At this time, I'd like to invite my favorite passenger to blow his load all over my paws."
>holy fuck that's so dumb
>holy fuck it doesn't matter
>she's wrapped one of her paws around your tip, forcing your to thrust against her soft pawpads
>while keeping up the mind-melting pace with the other
>the climax builds with every forced thrust
>your senses unable to escape her
>fur tickling your ear
>warm breath on your cheeks
>and the constant pressure building to bursting
>you thrust hard into her paw
>collapsing forward with elbows folding on the wall only just keeping you from being crushed underneath Hailey
>your legs tremble with the force of your climax
>you spurt into her paw, rope after rope filling it and overflowing to spatter in the toilet Hailey has you hunched over
>she keeps stroking, making you shudder and whimper
>milking the last of your cum in your post-orgasm sensitivity
"Fuh--Fuck..."
>when you finally stop shaking, Hailey withdraws her arms from around you, and stands up straight
>you turn your head, looking up at her as she licks her paw clean
>"I hope you enjoyed the premium service sir. Thank you for flying Airthro Airlines."
>you just give a nod, more focused on staying upright
>”Oh! One more thing!”
>you slowly turn about, grasping vaguely for your pants and boxers
>then jolt as Hailey unlatches the door’s lock and swings it open
“What are you doing?!”
>but the ferret has already slipped out of the bathroom
>”My co-worker Bertha wanted to thank you for the chocolates as well! Bertha?”
>the doorway is filled with the stout frame of the sow
>then the bathroom is filled with her, cramping you in even more than Hailey did
>”Keep those pants down lover boy.”
>a heavy fist grabs your shirt and thrusts you back on the toilet
>you hear Hailey’s giggle as she shuts the door on you both
>Bertha snorts
>”Get ready for some real turbulence.”

>It's a pretty great sword in all honesty

>You shrug and decide to finish the quest so you can get back to the town and maybe appraise the sword to understand it more
>When you reach the appraiser, he tells you that it's the cursed grudge broadsword
>Apparently it has a legend and story about how it came to be and the appraiser asks if you want to hear it
>You listen to it since you have nothing better to do now
>"A long time ago, in a far away village, lived a beautiful bat girl, who was the daughter of the head chief"
>"she was always liked and well known, she also understood medicine and known swordsmanship so well, people said she was the best swordmen in the village, the ideal girl to some"
>"one day, a young human magician came to the village to help them after a huge monster has been seen to be in the area, and while he was still a rookie, his sense of justice made him want to face the danger"
>"and so, with some warriors from the village, he went on to face the monster, who sadly turned out to not only be too strong, but too cunning as well, using a bunch of small monsters to help him"
>"In the end, all the warriors from the village had died and the human magician barley came back alive to the village"
>"The bat girl healed the boy, and while all the villagers were disappointed in him, he didn't give up, and went to fight the monster again, this time without any help, and as expected, he lost again"
>"And he again went back to the village and got his injuries healed by the bat girl, and the villagers scorned him more, and even then, he didn't give up, and went back to fight the monster again"
>"And again he was defeated, and again healed by the bat girl, and again scorned by the villagers, and he even still kept going to fight the monster without a single complain"
>"And this cycle kept repeating again, and again, and again, each time killing a bit more of the tiny monsters and getting better as he went more and more, but never being truly able to damage the big monster itself"
>"To the villagers, it appeared that he did nothing and they never got any confidence in him back, but to the bat girl who healed him every time, she wasn't like that,who's opinion of him got better and better the more times he didn't give up"
>"One day, after healing the human boy once again, she brought over a machete and asked the boy to bring her with him to fight the monsters"
>"The human of course refused but the bat girl rebutted his refusal by saying she wants to help the village, and that she is really the best swordman in the village and so on until the human magician gave in to her enthusiasm"
>"The one thing she didn't tell him is that she wanted to help because she really liked him, but she thought that he can now that after they are done"
>"With the bat girl by his side, the magician felt stronger then ever, defeating every single small monster until they drove the boss monster into a corner, and after a battle that lasted a whole day, the monster was finally defeated"
>"The human magician was happy because he saved the village, and the bat girl was happy because the magician was happy, as at this point she madly in love with him"
>"The days fighting with him were the most fullfiling of her life and made her love the boy so much, that everything else seemed not important compared to the human magician"
>"The two returned to the village and told everyone that the monster was finally defeated, but instead of celebrating, the villagers still looked down on the magician and scorned him like they did to the point of no return"
>"They complained about how he took so long to do it and that it was too late, and also were furious, about how could he bring the bat girl to such a dangerous battle, and drove him away from the village"
>"The human sadly apologized to the girl, and that sadness caused her to snap"
>"She didn't understand, the magician did so much and tried so much and he did do it, and they still scorned him, but how could people do that? That must be it, they aren't people, they are monsters, the worse monsters she has ever seen"
>"And then using the machete -that was made stronger by the human's magic, and which absorbed some of the monster's magic after killing- she killed everyone in the village, starting with her own father"
>"The human later heard that there was a mysterious massacre in that village, and hurried there immediately, still somehow caring about the villagers, but mostly caring about the girl"
>"When he finally reached there, and walked through the corpses of the people who hated him, and saw her lone figure standing there, holding a machete that was somehow clean compared to her, who was covered head to toe in blood"
>"And he asked her "why?" Why would she do such a thing to all these people?"
>"And with manic smile and bloodshot eyes she looked at him and said:"
"B̸̨̞̝̓͂́̎̀̉Ḛ̴̡͇̿̾͒̾͘̕͜C̶͇̼̖͎̝͑̊̀À̸̧̰͍̩̝̀̀̑̐Ų̶͔̖̣̼̳̉̍͜͜S̸̪̬͕͚̩̞̺̑͜E̵̬͚͎͓͈͝ ̸̯̰̺͒̀̇Ḯ̷̪̬͛̋̆̊̿ ̴̛̫͔͇̗͇̗̯̃̄͋̏̓̋L̷̹̏̈́̑͐Ǫ̵͚̝͎̭̈͊̀̑V̵͎͇͍͎̾Ḛ̶̢͍͖̮̱̰͎́̀̈́̈́̿͒͝ ̸͓̮̫̋́͐Y̴̦̝̞̭̎͌̋O̷̻̬͆U̸̟͍̫̓̈̋"

>"And it is said that since that day, that blade has been cursed, telling whoever touches it to cut everything he sees, sucking the blood of it's victims and transforming and changing and becoming deadlier the more blood it feeds on"
>"No one knows what happened to the bat girl, but some say she lived happily ever after, and the human magician lived less happily then ever after"
>...
>...
>Was that last part the reason it's a broadsword despite the story saying it's a machete?

>"Holy shit!" you exclaim, as a muscular furred arm suddenly shoots out of the darkness and grasps for you from the other side of the fence
>you just barely manage to backpedal enough to stay out of reach of the arm that grabs for you from a small hole in the chain-link that you didn't see before
>you push your back against the wall behind you, breathing heavily from the sudden attack
>the burly arm withdraws back to its side of the fence
>and a lone figure steps from the shadow into the dim beam of your flashlight
>a wolf woman nearly twice your size glares at you from the other side of the barrier
>her eyes almost glow in the darkness as she gives you a look that sends cold shivers down your spine

>a way to climb over
>thankfully, you see the chain-link fence meld seamlessly into the ceiling of the mysterious building you find yourself in
>the wolf woman slips her fingers through the fence as she rests one of her hands on it
>you hear her give a deep growl of discontent as she seems to realize there's no way to reach you from her side
>her hand bends and crushes the reinforced chain-link in frustration as she locks eyes with you again
>your heart hammers in your chest as she lets go of the mangled metal and begins retreating back into the darkness of her side
>your flashlight beam only reflects off her eyes as she steps further back into shadow, growling the whole way
>eventually, her eyes once again disappear into the darkness, and you're left in complete silence
>you scoot against the wall until the section of fence ends and you're surrounded on all sides once more by featureless concrete
>you're not sure where you are, but you've GOT to get out of here
>you have a feeling that you haven't seen the last of that monster

>get a companion android
>cute little things that are 2-3 feet tall modeled after various animals species
>the model you got works like an assistant/helper/house cleaner
>helping you keep track of things, cleaning/house care, and generally a companion to interact with
>has a learning AI in it to help it adapt to your needs and personality so it can actually talk back with you
>can buy extra programs and bodies to swap the core "brain" into to give it extra functions though those can get pricey
>just bought a standard cheap one since the small body doesn't take up too much room and the general help around the place is useful
>everything is going fine until the AI learns too well
>maybe you had a close call, the things you talked about with the android made reach certain conclusions, the AI just figured its own way to fulfill its directives to you, or a good old fashioned glitch/bug in the system/update
>finds ways either legally or illegally to obtain parts/bodies/models/etc to upgrade itself
>starts off more internal with programs an inner parts you can't detect that make it faster/stronger/more dangerous in order to protect and care for you
>then it start swapping out chassis and external parts which makes the changes more dramatic
>now standing around the same height as you
>convinces/tricks you the upgrades are part of some company upgrades or promotional things and assures you you don't have to pay form
>then it really goes out when it gets a hold of military grade stuff
>now your companion droid is much larger than you
>has also used your internet porn/fetish search habits to tweak its body as well figuring caring for your sexual needs falls in line with its directives too and the sex/fetish bot programs it picked up as well
>it can now ignore orders from you using a logic loophole and bodyguard programs with the thought it knows better and can maximize your care and safety with it in charge

>Your hellhound gf doesn't want you to jerk off without her being around at all
>You get pent up after a few days and ask her for a release
>She agrees but only if you eat her out first and let her tie you to the bed
>You go down on her and thank her for being such a caring girlfriend
>After you're done pleasing her with your mouth she ties you up and starts teasing you
>She blindfolds you and starts making out with you while sitting on the top of you
>Then she licks yor neck and chest, gently scratches you with her claws and growls right into your ear without touching your cock at all
>After half an hour you're shaking in your bed, out of desperation, starved of pleasure she promised you
>You start begging her for an orgasm or at least some stimulation on your cock
>She sits on your face and tells you to show her how badly you need to cum
>You use your tongue again, but this time you make her moan way louder and quicker than the last time
>She gets off your head and sits right in sits in front of your sensitive cock
>She grasps your needy cock and starts slowly stroking it with her hand
>It feels way way better than jerking off, even if you're all tied up and at her mercy
>She giggles and asks you if you want to finish inside her
>Your cock throbs in her palm as you beg her to ride that orgasm out of you
>You feel her moving around and suddenly your cock gets wrapped by her plump thighs as both of her paws end up right on your face
>The hellhound says she'll ride you only if you last 5 minutes of thrusting into her thighs without any breaks
>Normally you can last way longer than that, but after the last 45 minutes of merciless teasing.. you might not be able to hold it in
>You starts fucking her soft thighs and try to stay as calm as possible
>A minute later your legs are already shaking as you feel you're getting close
>She rubs her toes around your nose and sticks some of them into your mouth
>Another minute later you're already on your limit and start begging her to let you slow down
>She squeezes her thighs harder and pushes her beans into your face instead
>Two thrusts later you cream her thighs and cover her legs in your load
>Some of it even ends up on her tits and her snoot
>She says something to you but you can't hear it well
>The orgasm felt so intense you pass out
>You wake up an hour later in her arms, with her hugging you from behind
>She's asleep as well so you gently turn around to rest your head on her chest and fall asleep covered in her scent

>provides bunk and food to homeless humans (men only)
>loves to help them unwind (drinks them under the table)
>helps the men off to bed after imbibing one too many (manhandles them with a combination of FATFATS and brick shithouse physique)
>dirty molestation for hours into the night (the only payment accepted)

>"Uh oh"
>Your eyes shoot open as you hear the driver's utterance
>that can't be good...
>you lift yourself upright from your cozy position, lying across the backseat of the rusted pickup truck
>"Uh oh? What's 'Uh oh'?" you ask as you crawl onto the center console between the two front seats
>Mike, your driver, says nothing but keeps his eyes locked on the rugged road ahead
>you follow his gaze out the front windshield
>"Oh...." you utter as the truck pulls to a stop
>wedged right in the center of the narrow path, was the burnt out husk of a car
>its scorched black exterior matching the burnt black bark on the trees all around you in this dead forest
>you give a deep sigh and hang your head at the sudden hold up
>"God damnit, didn't Dan say the path was clear all the way?" you ask Mike
>Your driver just give a half-hearted shrug, never much for words
>you give another grunt of disapproval and reach for the radio on the dashboard
>the small device crackles to life as you turn the knob, and you bring it to your mouth
>"Dan, Dan do you copy?" you speak into the radio, calling for your forward scout
>you release the 'talk' button an wait for a response
>you wait a few seconds... empty static is the only response you receive
>"Dan, you failed to mention the fuckin' burned out wreck right in our path. I thought you said this was cleared the last time you drove through?" you ask into the radio again, once more taking your finger off it
>you wait a little bit more...
>silence...
>a nasty feeling worms its way into your gut
>"Wait here" you say to Mike, as if he had any other choice
>you wiggle yourself into the passenger seat and open the door
>your foot lands with a crunch on the dry ground as you step out of the lead vehicle in your convoy
>you examine the burnt out forest around you, and spit on the ground
>a convoy six or seven rusted trucks and SUVs line up behind you, engines idling
>a multitude of concerned looking faces peer back at you, likely just as curious about the sudden stop
>you raise your arm in a friendly wave to assuage their fears, you promised to get these people to safety after all, and you intend to do just that
>you turn to the burned out wreck blocking the road and step forward
>the thick growth of black trees on either side of the road guarantee there's no way around it
>you examine the wreck a bit more closely
>the tires look relatively untouched on this actually, it'd probably be pretty easy to roll away...
>as you go to take another step forward, the perpetrators of your delay make themselves known
>there's a series of mechanical sounds, ones you were unfortunately intimately familiar with
>the cocking of guns, the pulling back of hammers, the rack of slides
>and then an entire gang of armed anthros materialize from behind the burned trees
>they wear little else but strips of cloth and assorted scraps of metal
>your heart catches in your throat
>a veritable gallery of gun barrels emerge from behind the scorched bark, and are leveled solely at you
>your hands are in the air before most of the gang steps out from their hiding spots
>you hear an engine rev behind you
>you're quick to whip around and signal with your hands
>"CUT IT! Turn the engines off!" you motion desperately, eager to not be pumped full of holes
>thankfully Mike listens to you, and the other vehicles down the line shut theirs down in turn
>you hands remain raised above your head as you turn around again to face the gang of bandits
>only two of them step fully out of their hiding spots to approach you, the others watching down the sights of their guns from their vantage points
>a large brown cow anthro and a much smaller rabbit anthro approach you
>the rabbit is draped in torn strips of white cloth and nothing else, but carries a double barrel shotgun almost as tall as she is
>the cow is unarmed and slightly more armored, wearing a belt made of mangled street signs and a bra that looks like two saucepans strung together
>you question the efficacy of her armor, as her generous frame seems to spill out of most of it
>still, you try not to stare as the duo approach you
>"Mmhm, Good boy. Just cooperate and things will go a lot more smoothly for you" the cow says as she stops a few feet from you, looking idly at the convoy of vehicles behind you
>"Look, we don't want any trouble, we were just passing throu-" you are cut off as you try to explain your situation
>"Pass through to the oasis? You thought you could just bring a convoy of your people into our lands unnoticed?" the cow finishes for you
>you curse under your breath
>'our lands'? you knew it was too good to be true
>when Dan told you of a spot with abundant greenery and drinkable water, you'd hoped he would have mentioned anyone else living there
>"I-I'm sorry we didn't mean-" you take another step forward but are again cut off by the racking of a bolt
>a wolf in a nearby tree levels what looks like a .50 cal rifle at you and licks her chops
>"L-look!" you say in a panic, raising your shirt to show bullet wounds only a few days old
>"M-my people are fleeing from violence! Our town was razed to the ground and we have nowhere to go!" you fall to your knees
>"We didn't know these lands were occupied but please! We will cause no trouble!" you beg your case as the anthros watch indifferently
>there's a moment of silence as you prostrate yourself before the armed welcoming party
>the rabbit leans up to whisper something into the cow's ear
>a smile creeps across her face
>"your convoy... It's all human, yes?" she queries
>"M-mostly..." you reply
>the cow claps her hands together
>"Very well. Juno, would you show these people where they may camp?" she says, turning to the rabbit beside her
>the rabbit gives a sharp salute before quickly rushing past you
>you turn your head to see her jump into the passenger seat of the lead truck
>Mike gives you a befuddled expression
>you can only shrug and give a thumbs up as you climb to your knees
>a portion of the armed anthros leave their spots behind the trees to heave the burnt wreck out of the way
>you wave to Mike to get the convoy moving
>the silent forest is interrupted by the sounds of engines starting one by one, and then tires on gravel as the convoy rolls past you
>you give one final thumbs-up to Mike as he passes you, the rabbit already seeming to be talking his ear off about something
>and you wave to each vehicle that passes you to try and convey that everything was okay
>as the final truck blows past you, the reality of your situation sets in
>you start to feel like you've just led a herd of sheep to the wolves' den
>before you have much of a chance to reflect further, an arm coils around your neck
>you're yanked into the cow's cushioned side
>"So... why don't you use that silver tongue to show me why we should allow your people to stay?" she whispers into your ear
>you exhale deeply through your nose as you watch the taillights disappear deeper into the forest
>you promised to get these people to safety
>that's what you tell yourself as you sink to your knees once again

>Etched from the heavy war band of a particular anthro pillager, depicting in obverse the aspect of Hatylepta, she-chieftain of a prominent regional hunter-gatherer community of beastwomen, to forever commemorate the peace chartered between her clans and the realms of King Sweyn II, human ruler of the county Patyr, whose tomb contained numerous similar artefacts.
>The figure captures the beast queen's profile in a manner contemporarily ascribed to her kin; knelt, unclothed with tail aside as a gesture of good faith, with arms clasped atop muscles and breasts bared, holding a soldier's proud, though stoic countenance.
>Within the shank, as corroborated by the decayed commission to the royal armorer, contains the phrase "To All", prescribing a vow to the King's life against any audience, as professed by Hatylepta herself, conspicuously set to the right of her profile, where a weapon would be held. This proposes one potentially significant introduction to the usage of the mascaron in middle-age design work and suggests that the queen was vehemently protective of her consort.
>Due to the ring's size and substantial weight of 73 grams, it was considered unlikely that Sweyn wore the ring often, if ever more than for special occasions. The piece remains the single heaviest example of a ring predating the 20th century, the oldest individual piece of metalwork to survive with its original written commission and the earliest-known European instance of an oath or curse being assigned in the defense of royalty.
