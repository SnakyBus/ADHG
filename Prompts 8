ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

>Be you
>Get into a relationship with this one goat girl
>Barbara-Phoebe Metcalfe, or B.P., as most call her
>You’ve been dating for six months now
>It might sound too early to say, but you honestly think she might be ‘The One’
>You met her at the movie theater, in line for your favorite director’s newest feature
>Turns out it was her favorite director, too
>So, after the movie’s finished, you start talking
>And talking
>And talking
>And liking her a little more with each passing second
>She likes the same food you like
>Shares most of the same hobbies you have
>Same political views, too
>By the end of the night, you feel as though you’re comfortable with her
>More comfortable than you probably should be with a stranger
>So you began talking some more
>As the days went by, more and more, you felt as though you couldn’t bear being just friends with her
>So, one day, facing your fears, you asked her out
>And she said yes
>So, after that, you and her were boyfriend and girlfriend
>Your parents, and other people older than you, warned you about the potential downsides of a relationship
>About how there was a honeymoon phase, and then, little by little, that phase ends, and you start noticing flaws in the other person
>Then you start arguing, and after a while, the two of you will have to figure out if the relationship could survive.
>But time passed, and the honeymoon phase seemingly never ended
>You never argued
>Never even disagreed on anything
>She always laughed at your jokes
>Always warmed your heart with her smile
>Always comforted you when you let yourself be vulnerable around her
>It feels like you’ve been in a dream for the last six months, and you don’t want to wake up
>The only minor flaw is that she’s oddly avoidant about talking about her past
>But you don’t care
>You’re more than willing to look past that for everything else she’s done for you
>Well, actually…
>There is something else
>Obviously, you wouldn’t tell anyone, but you and B.P. never had sex before
>You admit, part of that is because you can’t really work up the nerve to ask
>But a part of you also kind of feels she’s too… innocent?
>Like having sex with her wouldn’t be right
>But no, why think that?
>She’s a grown woman
>She’s fully capable of making her own decisions
>And besides, she’s more than attractive enough for your tastes
>Cute face
>Nicely-shaped pair
>Feminine hips with an ass to match
>The perfect balance of skinniness and thickness
>Just like with everything else about her, her looks are perfect
>The truth is, you’ve been wanting her for a while now
>And tonight’s the night you’ll ask
>And that’s where you’re at right now
>You, munching away at the last of the spaghetti she made
>Her, finishing up the cookies she made for dessert
>God, you love her food
>Just like you love everything else about her
>She sets the plate of cookies down on the table, along with two glasses of milk for you and herself
>”Careful, Anon. The tray’s still hot! And I’d definitely dip these in milk for a few seconds before I’d eat them.”
>You smile stupidly
>Her voice itself is nearly enough to put you at ease
>”Don’t worry, I will be.”
>”Good!”
>She gives another cute smile as the two of you start eating the cookies
>You say nothing as you chow down, mentally working up the nerve to ask
>Apparently she takes notice
>”Anon, you got a kinda funny looking on her face. What’s wrong?”
>Your first instinct is to say ‘it’s nothing’ and drop it
>But no
>Not tonight
>Tonight, you man up and be honest with her
>”Listen B.P., I was…”
>You stammer a bit, trying to find the right words
>She tilts her head at you curiously
>”I was just wondering if, you know, tonight, we could…”
>She’s leering over toward you now, fully paying attention to you
>”...Take it to the next level? If you want?”
>She puts her hand on her cheek
>”Oh, Anon…!”
>A visible blush starts to show on her cheek
>”That’s a big thing to ask.”
>You’re blushing now too
>You start to wonder if this was actually a good idea
>”I-i-if you don’t want to, that’s okay, we don’t-”
>She seems to think for a moment, but then…
>”No, I want to.”
>At once, you feel like a huge weight has been lifted off your shoulders, but you don’t feel completely elated
>Already, you’re worried you’re unintentionally pressuring her into something
>”Are you sure? I-if you don’t want to, tha-”
>”I said I want to.”
>You’re surprised
>You never heard her so serious or confident about something before
>”But my question is, are you ready?”
>”M-me? I. uh…”
>”Sex isn’t something to be taken lightly, Anon. Once you have it with someone, things change, in ways you might not be able to predict. Are you positive that you want me, here and now?”
>You’re not really sure what she’s talking about
>Why is she suddenly the one your decision in the matter?
>But the confusion doesn’t last long
>Your want… no need for outweighs any other emotion right now
>You can’t back out now
>”Yes. I’m positive.”
>She gives another smile and walks over to you
>”That’s all I needed to hear.”
>She plants a kiss on your cheek, sending a jolt of ecstasy around your body like electricity
>”Why don’t you head off into the bedroom and get more… comfortable. I’ll put the food away here.”
>You merely give an awkward ‘okay’ and head to the bedroom
>This is it
>This is the night
>It’s happening
>With a sigh of anticipation, you begin to disrobe yourself
>Shoes, socks, pants, shirt, underwear
>Now you sit in wait, nude as the day you were born
>You’re only waiting for about a minute before B.P. comes in, closing the door behind her
>”W-wow, you look even better than I could possibly imagine.”
>By now, all the blood in your body is concentrated in your face, leaving you looking as red as a tomato
>”Th-th-thanks…”
>”Okay, I… guess it’s my turn, now.”
>You watch, mesmerized as B.P. undresses herself
>First, she takes off her brown sweater, and then the turquoise t-shirt underneath it
>Next, she slips off her black tights, leaving her in only her undergarments
>Then, she does it
>You nearly start drooling as she undoes her bra, her beautiful breasts bouncing out
>You’re so busy staring at them, that you almost don’t notice when she takes her panties off
>Dear God…
>The brilliant white of her fur
>Her soft, feminine curves
>She’s divine
>”You’re… beautiful…”
>She lets out yet another dainty, girly giggle
>”Thank you, but I’m not done changing yet.”
>Puzzlement creeps up on you as you wonder what she could mea-
>...Huh?
>She’s… growing?
>You wonder if you’re seeing thing right
>Yes, you are
>She is getting taller before your very eyes
>One foot…
>Two foot…
>Three foot…
>Until what was once a tiny goat woman who barely reached your chest now towers over you
>But that’s just the beginning of the changes
>Her fur starts changing color
>From white, to whitish-pink, to bright pink, to light red, to cherry red, and finally stopping at crimson
>Her eyes, too, change color
>Darkening to pitch black, only a small sliver of magenta serves as a pupil
>Wait…
>She’s not done growing
>Her breasts, ass and thighs begin growing from ‘kinda thick’ to ‘massive’ rapidly
>Meanwhile, the excess fat everywhere else shrinks and shrinks until she has a feminine hourglass figure
>Horns sprout from the sides of her head, growing taller and spiraling out until they’re about a foot from the scalp each
>Another set of eyes blink open under her first one
>Two black, leathery wings like a bat sprout from her back
>Lower on her back, a long black tail ending in a triangle also sprouts out
>You stare, mouth agape, too horrified to even scream
>B.P.(?) throws her arms to the side as if she just did some sort of trick
>”Tada!”
>Her voice sounds like B.P.’s normal voice, only spoken concurrently with a much deeper, more demonic one
>”Surprised? Confused? Okay, I’ll fill you in on everything. Just take a seat on that bed right there.”
>Too shocked to even think of doing anything else, you mindlessly obeyed
>”Okay, so, in the simplest terms, I’m a succubus.”
>”A… s-sucu…?”
>”Oh, but don’t worry! I’m not one of those ‘drag you to straight to hell’ kinds of succubi. For me, just feeding off your emotions is good enough.”
> Your mind thought so many thoughts at once that it crashed, leaving you staring at her near catatonically
>All you could do what is sit and listen
>”Positive emotions, specifically. And you gave me a lot. Happiness, love, gratitude - but one emotion fills me up better than anything.”
>She leans forward, making you revile back in fear
>”Lust.”
>”I had to be careful. I had to make sure you didn’t suspect anything, If I showed my hand too earlier, you’d run away, and where would I be then? But guess what? After you told me tonight that you wanted me - I had a feeling that you did, but better safe than sorry - the I knew. I have you, right where I want you. Now, you’re all mine, simple as that.”
>Tears sting the corner of your eyes
>Lies
>All of it
>Every word she said
>Every memory you had
>Every laugh you shared
>Down to her appearance
>The woman you loved, the woman you thought was “The One’...
>... Was a complete fabrication
>The cold, numbing shock gives way to a flood of other emotions
>Anger
>Betrayel
>Fear
>Sadness
>You grimace as the tears flow down your face
>Fianally, B.P. notices
>”Hey, Anon, no. Don’t cry. Listen, I know it’s a shocking thing to hear, but if you only-”
>You let out an enraged scream and bolt for the door
>You don’t make it far as B.P. grips you by your wrist
>”Anon, please, there’s no need to be upset. We can-”
>”SHUT UP!”
>You uselessly try to yourself out of her grasp
>”YOU BITCH! YOU CUNT! I LOVED YOU, AND YOU LIED TO ME!”
>”Please, cal-”
>You start striking her, your punches bouncing off of her body harmlessly
>”I HATE YOU, YOU HEAR ME? YOU MAKE ME SICK! GO AWAY! OR KILL ME! I JUST DON’T EVER WANNA SEE YOU AGA-”
>A kiss cuts off your infuriated ranting
>B.P. forces her tongue into yours
>It’s much longer now, reaching down into your throat
>And the texture’s different too
>Yet, it also feels… familiar
>Similar to all the other kisses the two of you shared throughout your relationship
>It makes you mentally flashback to those times and…
>Well, it doesn’t put you at ease, but it quells your red-hot anger down to mere disappointed disturbance
>She eventually pulls away, leaving a long string of drool dripping from her black tongue
>”There, now wasn’t that comforting?”
>You say nothing, merely staring at while breathing heavily
>”See? I’m still the same-old B.P. you fell in love with, I’m just… different now.”
>”You lied to me…”
>”Oh, sweetie, I had to. You’d run away if I did. And besides, I can tell, even if you may not realize it right now, you still want me.”
>To further prove her point, she grabs you by the wrist and forces your hand to touch one of her breasts
>The last thing you want is to feel aroused right now, but you can’t help but squeeze it softly
>It’s the perfect consistency in your hand
>Not too hard, not too firm
>To you chagrin, your penis, softened by the shock, hardens again to about half-mast
>B.P. merely giggles
>”See? Told ya.”
>You look away, but don’t say anything to refute it
>She traces her hand cross her cheek
>”Humans have these delusions of grandeur that they’re somehow ‘virtuous’ and ‘pure of intent’. But in actuality, that couldn’t be further from the truth. Oh, they might say or do things that make them seem better than they are. Donate to charity, sing against the evils of society, et cetera, et cetera. But give them enough power, enough hatred, enough lust, and eventually, they will all fall victim to their vices. And you know what? That’s fine.”
>You turn back to her
>”Humans are weak. Humans need to be told what to do. They know it. That’s why their slaves to those they see as a higher purpose. Religion, politics, culture - all excuses for humans to follow something considered as better than themselves. And you, Anon, are without, purpose. But I can help you with that.”
>You say nothing as she locks fingers with you
>”Follow me, Anon. Make me your new reason to live. All I ask for is your emotions, and in exchange, I will give you everything you could ever want and need. Food, sex, love - no one could ever give these to you as I could. I know that deep down, you know it’s true, so come, submit to me.”
>You say nothing still
>About a minute of silence passes
>”Still not sure? Okay then, I’ll make it easier.”
>She walks over to the bed and sits down
>”I will give you an ultimatum. Either you go to that door and leave, letting go of all the happiness I could ever possibly offer you…”
>She raises her foot up
>”...Or you could come here, kneel down and lick my feet, submitting to me completely. Which will it be?”
>You struggle to think
>You look at the door
>This is madness
>You can’t submit to a succubus
>You should end this right now
>...But
>Can you really turn your back on B.P.?
>You remember all the good times with her
>Even now, thinking about them makes you feel warm inside
>You look back at her
>You look into her eyes
>They’re unmistakably the eyes of a demon, and yet…
>You look at them, and instantly see B.P.
>That feeling of love is returning to you, and despite the other complex feelings you’re feeling, you can’t let it go
>You turn and walk to her foot
>You stare up at her
>She gives an expectant smirk
>You shouldn’t
>But you need to
>So, you stick out your tongue and drag it across her foot
>She lets out another giggle
>”I knew you would make the right choice, Anon.”
>You proceed to clean her foot with her tongue
>You shower the sole with long licks, leaving it covered in spit
>You even work to get it between her two hard toes, made of enamel
>When that foot’s done, you repeat with the other one
>When that’s done, you elicit yet another giggle from her
>”Good boy!”
>Good boy
>Somehow, being called that only entices you more
>Without warning, she lifts you up and put you up on the bed
>She nuzzles your now erect cock
>”And it looks like he enjoyed that just as much as I did.”
>You blush in slight embarrassment
>”Just teasing. Now I’ll show you why you made the right decision.”
>This time, she’s the one licking
>First, up the length of your shaft several times
>Then on your balls
>Then on the area around
>Rinse and repeat, with that thick, long black tongue of hers
>You thought it looked a little strange at first, but you find yourself falling a little more in love with it with every lick
>Then, she peppers some kisses in there too
>Each one gives you a little jolt of ecstasy when you do
>Finally, after what feels like hours of foreplay, she puts the entirety of your dick into her mouth
>You nearly cum then and there
>It’s so warm
>So Inviting
>Ironically, you feel like you’ve entered heaven
>But she’s careful
>She keeps you on the edge
>Ever so close, yet ever so far
>Her tongue wipes all around as you exit and enter her throat, over and over
>Finally, after you-don’t-know how long, your body tenses and releases, and B.P. effortlessly catches it in and swallows it
> You're left panting, nearly gasping for air as B.P. scurries herself over your head
>”So, what do you think? Good, right?”
>You let out a satisfied groan, which apparently suffices as a ‘yes’ for her.
>”Good.”
>She places her hand under your head and gently lifts it up
>”Open up.”
>You absentmindedly comply
>She pops her nipple into your mouth.
>”Start sucking. Trust me, you’ll be glad you did.”
>Again, you comply
>Warm milk flows into you
>It tastes… sweet
>And feels silky
>And is oh, so delicious
>You can suck on it all night
>But alas, B.P. pops the teet out of your mouth
>”There we go!”
>”Wh-why did-”
>”Why did I just breastfeed you? To get my essence into you, silly! Now, I can do lots of neat things to your body. Like this!”
>Her eyes glow, and you’re suddenly rock hard again
>And eager, too
>”Sit up, please.”
>Like the good boy you are, you obey
>B.P. sits down on your lap, her soft and wet cunt pressed against your cock, and her thick ass pressed against your torso
>”I think we’ve pussyfooted around long enough, don’t you? Time for the main event.”
>With little warning, she practically jumps onto your dick, and you groan loud enough to almost constitute a scream
>She immediately starts bouncing
>Somehow, it’s 1000 times better than her mouth
>It takes all the strength you have not to pass out
>Her soft butt constantly rubbing against you isn’t helping matters, either
>Soft, lewd plap after soft lewd plap rings out
>Again, you lose track of time, focusing only on the pleasure at hand
>It’s only when she, again, french kisses you do you realize you’re about to cum
>When you do, you scream into her mouth
>You collapse, unable to take any more excitement for the night
>Getting up, B.P. tucks you and herself into bed
>She gently caresses your body
>”We’ve had a very exciting night, haven’t we?”
>You’re too tired to even grunt at this point, but it doesn’t seem to be needed
>”You’ve made entirely the right choice. You will be happy with me. That’s all you need. Now and forever.”
>She gives you one final peck on the forehead
>”I love you, my little weakling.”
>That’s the last thing you hear before you fall asleep
>
>You wake up, and smell… pancakes?
>Must be B.P.
>You go out, and that’s exactly what you see
>B.P. cooking pancakes without a care in the world
>You blink
>She’s… normal
>Short, white, hornless, no wing, no tail
>Not at all the B.P. you remember from last night
>”Morning, Anon!”
>Her voice is also normal
>You shake your head
>A bad dream
>That’s all it was
>A ba…
>A dream
>You take a seat
>”Morning. Smells delicious, like usual.”
>She finishes plating the pancakes and sets them on the table
>”Glad you think so. Guess what? There was Jehova’s Witness this morning! Can you believe it? What are they doing here?
>”Really? Damn, that’s annoying. At least he’s gone, though.”
>You grab a good few pancakes and put them on your plate
>”So, what’s on the agenda today?”
>”Oh, I was thinking we could just stay in and relax for a day, just you and me. After all…”
>You can swear, for a minute, her eyes go black as she says
>”There’s so much fun to be had.”
>You shake your head
>She looks as normal as ever
>”Everything okay, Anon?”
>You think for a moment
>”Yeah… yeah! Everything’s fine.”
>And everything would be fine
>Now and forever
>Because now you know for sure
>She’s ‘The One’

>Be Anon, anthrostate troublemaker
>Not some asshole who fled city to city leaving crying wives behind
>Not the type that would be a part of a resistance group
>Not some prick who leaked classified documents on "Yeen Shaker Central"
>Not some nutjob conspiracy theorist ranting about alien lizards coming to kill all anthros and steal their husbands
>You just had a nasty habit of selling smack and other fun stuff in slums... And getting caught that is
>Should've known that well groomed german shepherd with baggy jeans and shades wasn't a customer
>The judge, a nice old sheep, felt sorry that such a "smart and capable humie" like yourself was wasting his life doing petty crime
>She sentenced you to rehabilitation at some correctional facility for disobedient humans, until you cleaned your act and became hubby material
>Sadly, you turned out to be a pain in the ass to deal with whilst in the nuthouse
>You kept hoarding pills that you stole from the facility's pharmacy (oh yeah, you also picked locks from time to time to help a gang of [literal] coons loot some houses) and trading them back to the other patients
>One of which nearly ended up dying from OD, which got you in solitary confinement, where you weren't allowed to communicate with the other guys even during meal time
>After 1 week of this fiasco, you were really starting to get crazy so you decided to leave this room the only way you were allowed, in a medical emergency
>You started to bite into your wrists hard enough to draw blood and call the guards for help
>When you arrived at the clinic they had you stitched and put you on suicide watch
>They prescribed you some anti-depressants which you pocketed for later use, and you had to attend meetings for humans on the brink of self-destruction
>You noticed one skinny guy next to you playing on his little console, so when the (literal) elephant in the room walked out you showed him the little bottle of pills
"Hey, wanna do a little trade?"
>Few hours pass and your game is interrupted by 2 bear guards, one polar and one grizzly, coming into your cell
"Hello ladies. What can i do for ya?"
>They don't reply, instead they pull out their batons and proceed to kick the living shit out of you
>Turns out the kid ate the whole fucking bottle prescribed to you. Hmm, maybe you should've scratched the label with your name on it before you handed it to him
>This new event causes the doctors to kick you out of the facility for being a "danger to others" and you spend the next 2 weeks in a station cell waiting to be called into court
>Back at the justice building you are greeted by the same judge that gave you your sentence
>To your surprise, she decided to put you on parole, stating that if you crossed the line this time you would be sent to an even harsher facility
>"Anon, i'm putting a great deal of trust in you. Don't make me regret this."
>You can't believe this, you're getting a second chance at freedom... And all you had to do was nearly kill 2 junkies
"You have my word, that i will not peddle dope, ever again."
>Fast-foward 6 months with a never ending cycle of being arrested for drug trafficking, going to different facilities, getting ejected from said facilities and being put on parole
>You arrive back at the courtroom
"Hello again!"
>You happily greeted a not so happy looking sheep on the bench
>She didn't say anything, she kept staring at you like the disappointing child you are
>"Anon... So far you have been kicked out of 4 different rehabilitation centers for humans."
"Continue."
>This causes her to stop reading her paper for a few moments, just to give you the stink eye
>You were taking the piss at this point, and the sweet wooly judge has had enough out of you
>"Due to your lack of any significant progress in the facilities and in public, aswell as your detrimental actions towards other humans in rehab, you have proven to be unacceptable for any and all human penitentiaries."
>For some reason this causes your current mood to turn 180
"I-I don't understand, what does this mean for me."
>"It means you can't live in society and you can't be near other humans... I have no choice but to transfer you to Boulderkeep Prison."
"W-w-what!?"
>She slams the gavel and your fate is sealed, in an anthro prison
>...
>Yeah, you're fucked and soon enough, more ways than one

>Be me
>A mother who has a sweet humie husband and two adorable humie sons
>Decided to watch a family movie that was playing in theaters
>It’s about a magical humie prince who wants to save the magical land from an evil dragon lady
>Reach at the climax of the movie
>Sees a tough anthro women coming in and ask for the humie protag for some help
>’No! I don’t need no anthro women to tell me what to do’
>Sudden burst of cheer from my humie sons
>Mfw the downfall of human males starts with this movie

>Man goes to work at an arctic research station
>Gets blinded during a blizzard and stumbles off into the surrounding icy wastes
>Search teams find no trace of him, presumed dead
>Is later found safe in the den of a native polar bear woman some months later
>Family wants him to return to civilization
>He refuses, who would help his new wife take of care of their cubs if he left?
Many such cases

>"--was telling me about you. Said you looked about ready to bolt all night."
>you had seen the chill looking rodent once or twice, usually hanging out with people
>didn't realize he had noticed you too
"Yeah. Guess it's uh, not really my scene. I'm not used to parties."
>the goat nods
>"I get that, I get that. You can hang out in here with us if you want. Take a seat."
>you look around
>all the seats are occupied by anthros
>a snow-leopard sat beside Ike the capybara on the couch rounding off the group
"Uh, where do I...?"
>the goat leans back on the loveseat and pats her thigh
>"Right here man. Plenty of room."
>you don't move, unsure if she's joking or not
"On...your lap?"
>the yeen snickers
>"I don't think he's ever even talked to an anthro before."
>that sets Ike and the snow leopard laughing as well
>even the goat chuckles out a bleat
>"That right?"
>you shrug and grimace apologetically
"Kinda. Haven't really talked to anyone since I got here."
>the goat gives you a reassuring grin and pats her thigh
>"It's cool dude. Anthro thing. Have a seat."
>you do your best not to feel like a weirdo as you sidle around and sit down on the goat's thigh
>legs turned inward so they're in between hers
>you feel her hand on your back as she settles in again
>"There we go. I'm Gerta."
>Gerta the Goat
>she must have caught your smirk cause she rolls her eyes
>"I know, I know. It's from my grandma."
>you shake you head
"It's a cool name. It's cool. I wasn't laughing. Anon, by the way."
>it was kinda funny, but you don't want to be a jerk
>Gerta starts rubbing your back as she goes on
>"I don't mind dude. S'a funny name. Anon's pretty cool. Lotta humans with that one."
>must be a cultural thing
>you never thought about it much
>right now you're thinking about how good her hand feels rubbing your back
>how long has it been since you last had physical contact with someone that was on purpose?
>must have been when you hugged your mom goodbye at the beginning of the semester
>Gerta goes on rubbing your back, and you find yourself leaning into it
>despite her size and muscle, her embrace is still soft
>"So what you studying, Anon?"
>you go on to explain your college situation to her
>how you transferred from out of state
>and your own little community college in bumfuck nowhere had no anthros at all
>but now you're here, small fish in a huge pond
>as you go one explaining, you find yourself getting closer to Gerta
>or maybe she's getting closer to you
>she's leaning forward again, and over toward you
>and you find yourself leaning sideways into Gerta just as much
>feeling her warmth
>until finally you're resting your head on her shoulder, rubbing your cheek against soft fur
>and her arm is wrapped fully around you
>Lou, the hyena, was in the middle of explaining his own college plans when he's interrupted by the sound of a lighter striking
>"I'm gonna light up. Guys want some?"
>the snow-leopard holds up a joint that she had been working on lighting
>Ike grins, and Gerta bleats happily
>"Shit yeah girl .You were holding out?"
>the snow-leopard gets the thing burning and takes a puff on it
>you watch as she passes it over to Ike, who repeats the motion
>then over to Lou, who has to awkwardly puff at it while laying down so he doesn't disturb the mouse
>she hasn't woken up since you slammed the door
>then it reaches Gerta
>she has to lean away to take her turn at it
>"Hey dude, want some?"
>she holds it down at your level
>you hesitate again
"I uh, never really..."
>you'd been straight-laced all your life
>this is all new to you
>Gerta rubs your shoulder reassuringly
>"It's okay dude. You don't have to. Just hope you don't mind us passing it around."
>she hands it off to the snow-leopard again and the ritual repeats
>by the time it's reached you again, you've worked up a bit more nerve
>this is your big break
>you came to a party
>you're making friends
>and also sitting in their laps
>Gerta's basically cuddling you at this point
>so when it comes around again, you speak up
"Can I try this time?"
>that earns a chorus of soft cheers from the group
>"Woo! That's the spirit."
>Gerta holds the joint between two fingers
>rather than passing it to you, she holds you close and presses them against your lips
>it's an oddly intimate gesture
>"Just take a small hit. Don't try and kill the whole thing."
>you grunt your affirmative around her fuzzy fingers
>and puff on the joint held to your lips
>it tastes smoky and earthy
>and a some kinda citrus on the end there?
>you suck in a bit more, but it's too much
>first you sputter
>then you cough
>Gerta pulls her hand away from your face as you double over and cough hard
>she pats your back gently
>"Easy dude, easy. Told you not to kill the whole thing. You alright?"
>you manage to catch your breath after a few seconds
>already you're starting to feel it
>a low buzzing in the back of your head that slowly ramps up while Gerta passes the joint again
>you lean against her, feeling calmer and easier now
>it's rather pleasant, for a new strange sensation
>her fur feels real nice right now, and you wrap an arm around her waist
>Gerta chuckles and holds you by the shoulder
>"Feel good dude?"
>you just hum and nod your head, brushing your face against her shoulder fur that feels so soft
>and her body's so warm
>you love this
>cuddling with Gerta is awesome
>do anthros get to do this all the time?
>Gerta and the others go on talking about school, then movies, then the music that's playing
>you mostly just hold on to her hand hum non-commitally whenever anyone speaks to you
>Gerta rubs your back and her voice hums in your head when she speaks
>at one point she leans down and kisses the top of your head
>that puts you over the moon
>you like this goat
>she's real nice
>even with her funny eyes and her big muscles and the funny goat laugh she does
>you can't help but giggle at the though of it
>Gerta snickers too, even though you didn't tell her the joke
>that just makes you laugh more
>you take another hit the next time it comes around
>then it's right back to squeezing her
>feeling the fur of her belly under your fingers
>you shut your eyes and let your weight rest fully on her
>"Looks like he's falling asleep."
>that's Ike
>Gerta shifts beneath you
>"Yeah. I'll find him a bed."
>you feel your legs lifted, and your body tilted back
>you crack an eyelid to see she's lifted you into a bridal carry
>like in those old Gisnep movies except backwards
>Gerta carries you out into the hall, and down a flight of stairs until she finds a room that's dark and mostly quiet
>you're set down on a soft mattress
"Gerta."
>you look up to her
"I think I love you."
>she snorts
>"Baaa-haha! Dude we just smoked a little weed and cuddled. Get some sleep."
>you snag her wrist when she turns to go
>you don't want her warmth to leave you
>Gerta gently pulls your hand off of her
>"Fine, fine. We can get coffee tomorrow."
>that makes you smile
>you'd love to see her again
>and you'd love to...
>"And you can sit in my lap, too."

Police Moo-tality
>Living on the western frontier ain't easy
>There's banditos marauding the wilds, feral snakes and other critters waiting to eat your eyes out, the merciless sun tanning your hide, drunks looking for fights, among other things
>But thankfully there’s always a sheriff in town to put a stop to the dangers posed by your fellow man
>Or at least, there used to be
>Sheriff Espinoza, may the old dog rest in peace, took a bullet to the noggin during a raid on some local highwaymen a few days ago
>You aren’t sure who’s riding in to replace him but you don’t really care, you’ve always been good at keeping a low profile despite your inhibition towards alcohol and the occasional bar fight you find yourself wrapped up in
>Speaking of which, it’s a bright sunny Saturday morning here in La Hembra, just the perfect time for you to mosey on down to the local saloon and wet your whistle
>You get off your straw bed and stretch, streaks of sunlight illuminating the dusty air of your humble shack
>You put your shoes and hat on and walk outside, greeting Mary the seamstress and Henson the leather smith as you pass them on the street
>Good folk they are, mostly keeping to themselves and keeping busy with their daily toil
>Unfortunately you couldn’t say the same thing about the German Shepard approaching you
>Samson was his name and selling all manner of snake oil and lies was his game
>”Hey, hey Anon. Come here.” He says, waving you over
>You stop and cross your arms
>”What is it this time Samson? Come to sell me another potion to cure my hairline or stiffen my masculinity?”
>”No, no, no. I just couldn’t help but notice who just arrived.” He pulls you close and points to a woman mounted on horseback coming into town. “See her? That’s the new sheriff.”
>You squint your eyes against the bright sun and take in her details
>A Holstein heifer she is, black and white splotched face with a bright pink nose
>She wears a billowing leather duster and worn tan colored Stetson, a mean look on her face as she scans the town
>She’s armed with a lever action across her back and a six shooter on her hip, a golden badge pinned to her duster
>”Ya know Anon, I think I’ll be taking a nice little vacation while she’s in town. If you had any sense you would do the same.”
>”Pfff! Coward! She’s just a little cow lady. Ain’t nothing I would worry about. Hell, she ain’t even got horns like her male compatriots!”
>”It’s not the horns I would be worried about, it’s her proclivity for handing out arrests like candy.“
>He suddenly grows quiet as the sheriff trots past us, she looks in our direction briefly then turns back to the road
>”I, uhhh, I think I better get moving.” Samson says, quickly fast walking away towards his carriage
>You chuckle and continue towards the saloon, glad that you won’t see that slippery dog for the next several days
>After making your way to the bar you begin conversing with the bartender, downing a few beers and shots of whiskey, your usual morning routine for a Saturday
>After exhausting all conversation and feeling your vision start to blur you decide to retire to your shack
>You stumble to the entrance, bust open the saloon doors and-
>”Hold it right there partner.” Commands a foreign voice, deep yet feminine
>The new sheriff you saw earlier stands in front of you, hands on her hips
>Wanting to make a good first impression you stick your hand out for a handshake, it wobbles in the air as you wait for her to take it
>”Howdy! I’m Anon, you must be Sheriff Espinoza’s replacement.”
>She remains silent, chewing a piece of straw while giving you a lookover
>Eventually she returns your handshake, her grip is strong for a woman
>”That would be correct. I’m Sheriff Leche. I came in from Dallas this morning.”
>”Well I think you’ll find La Hembra accommodating. We got a general store, and a post office, and they even installed one of those telegraph thingermajigs not long ago.”
>”And a saloon.” She says, eyes drifting up to the sign in front of the place
>”Yes ma’am. It’s a fine place. Now if you don’t mind I really must be going.”
>You try to step around her but a hand on the chest stops you
>”You’ve had a few to drink today, haven’t you?”
>”A touch.”
>She leans in and sniffs
>”It’s not even noon yet, Anon.”
>”…so? It’s the weekend, I can do what I want.”
>The cow gives a wicked smile
>”Now that kind of attitude I don’t find very welcoming. Bandits do what they want, criminals do what they want, law abiding citizens however can not. They must live within the letter of the law.”
>”What’s yer point lady?”
>”Public drunkenness is against the law, Anon.”
>You wave your hands around in disbelief
>”Now that ain’t no law I ever heard of what kind of hot new devilry is this crap I can’t believe that you would-Hey!”
>The cow grabs you by the arm and begins leading you to the stockade in the center of town
>”Hey! Where you takin’ me?”
>”The stockade. I hereby sentence you to three days of confinement and public humiliation.”
>”What the- Now hear this! Sheriff Espinoza only ever sentenced me to one day maximum in the stockade when I got a little tipsy and accidentally socked someone in the bar. Three days is totally unfair!”
>”Well I'm not Sheriff Espinoza. Three days is what I sentence you to. Maybe less if I think you learn your lesson before that. I have little tolerance for drunkards and troublemakers.”
>”Drunkard? How dare you call me that! I am merely an innocent enjoyer of fine liquors! It’s a hobby! I-I need to drink for health reasons anyway! I get aching joints if I don’t drink! And heart palpitations too!”
>She laughs
>”Ya sure pal, I’ve heard all those excuses before. Now settle down while secure you.”
>She lays your neck and hands in the stockade then locks it
>You drunkenly struggle in your bindings but find it useless, they won’t budge
>”This is totally uncalled for! You alcohol hating heifer! Denier of fine drink! How dare you do this to me!”
>She stands in front of you and crosses her arms
>”I’ll be back tonight to let you into the jail. There I’ll give you some food and water, then next morning we’ll do this all again.”
>You shout disjointed curses at her as she walks away
>Thankfully your punishment isn’t too harsh for the rest of the day, you were either on good or neutral terms with most of the town
>Mary’s boys came around in the afternoon and threw a couple of tomatoes at you though, little fuckers
>When night fell Leche came to free you true to her word, then you spent the night in a jail cell after a dinner composed of beans, cornbread, and water
>In the morning you ate a small breakfast of biscuits and water then you were back out in the stockade
>Today most people were working so few came to mock you much to your relief
>Yet it proved to be the sun that became your most vicious menace, by mid-afternoon the water you had for breakfast had long been used up
>Your skin was dry and joints ached, your mouth felt like cotton and your body yearned for hydration
>By the time night fell Leche came out of her jailhouse and stood in front of you, hands on her wide hips
>”Well, have you learned your lesson? Promise never be under the influence of the devils drink while out in public?”
>You try to spit on her hooves only to find your mouth dry
>”Screw you! Power tripping cow! I’ll drink and stand where I please!”
>She leans in, voice filled with stern disappointment
>”I'm sorry to hear that. Guess you’ll just have to wait out the rest of your sentence.”
>”I think I will. Now release me so I can at least have a little water before bed, I'm positively parched right now.”
>”No.”
>”No? You have to give me something! I can’t do another day of this with no freakin’ water! The sun’ll dry me out till I'm nothing but bones.”
>”New directive from the city came in. This part of the country has been having a drought something awful and I'm to deny water to prisoners if they only committed minor crimes and have served over half their sentence. That water is better served either going to crops or law abiding citizens. You are neither.”
>”I-I’ll die then! You can’t do this! It’s murder.”
>She puts a hand up to her chin, thinking something over
>”Well, where the water’s going has already been decided. However, they made no such order regarding a certain other kind of sustenance.”
>”Huh?”
>The cow undoes her leather duster then the shirt underneath, untucking a hefty breast from a lacy bra
>You stare in shock for a few seconds, goddamn this woman had some heavenly mams hidden under that duster of hers
>”You should consider yourself lucky, Anon. This heifer’s willing to help you out in your unfortunate situation. A breast’s worth of milk ought to tide you over till tomorrow, keep you from an early death from dehydration.”
>”An unfortunate situation that you put me in with your excessively long sentence. Just let me go!”
>”Let you go? After you tried to spit on the hoof of a duly appointed sheriff and denounce her good intentions? I don’t think so pal!”
>“Fine. I take back everything I said and will never wander around in public while intoxicated ever again. Cross my heart and hope to die.” You say, trying to cram sincerity into every syllable
>Unsurprisingly, she doesn’t fall for it
>”No. I don’t believe you. Now either suck my tit or risk ending up in a casket by the end of tomorrow.”
>You squint an eye and slowly nod, her intentions becoming clear
>”Oh, I see how it is. This is all some sort of perverse pleasure for you, isn’t it? You lecherous cow women must like it when someone suckles from your teat, makes you feel all funny down below. Well I’ll tell you what Leche, I won’t give in to your deviant cream filled fantas-“
>She suddenly leans forward and grabs your chin, her wet pink nose coming up to your own
>”Listen here you little mongrel. It took me three weeks to make it down here on my horse. Three weeks of nothing but rough road and bad weather. We heifers need our breasts drained every week and I haven’t had a chance to do it in three times that long, if you listen closely you can probably hear it all sloshing around in there, you get my drift?”
>You slowly nod in understanding
>”Ya, okay. But why not just do it yourself and save me the trouble?”
>”I, uhhh, I can’t give milk unless someone else is watching.” She whispers, an embarrassed tone in her voice
>It takes all your self-restraint to not burst out laughing
>”You, heh, need a, heh, peeping tom to release the floodgates? You know I have something of a similar issue myself, though it’s the opposite in nature.”
>”Oh shut up, normally my sister would help me out in a situation like this but she’s a hundred miles away and I'm not about to ask some stranger to help me out on the road. Which leaves us in a fortunate situation with you needing milk and me needing to give it. Now unless you want to end up as a pile of dried up bones tomorrow you’re going to do the draining for me tonight. Now put on your best calf impression and get to it.”
>”In the middle of town? This is scandalous! Uncouth!”
>Leche puts her breast in front of your lips then draws her duster around the both of you, hiding her chest and your head from prying eyes
>”There, it’s the middle of night so it’s doubtful anyone will be aware of what I’m doin’ with ya.”
>”Okay, okay.”
>You lick your chapped lips and stare at the pink nipple less than an inch from your mouth
>Sure, you don’t particularly like helping officers of the law, but not doing it may very well end with you dead tomorrow
>And hell, you always did wonder if bovine anthro milk tasted any different from the feral kind
>You crane your neck forward and latch on to her puffy teat, gently sucking
>Within a couple of seconds the first milk enters your mouth and wets your dry tongue, it feels heavenly as it makes it’s way down your sore throat
>With relief washing over your body you find yourself unintentionally suckling with greater intensity, body desperate for more of the life giving liquid regardless of the fact it’s coming from a power tripping sheriff
>Leche stares down at you from above, an occasional soft moan escaping her lips betraying her otherwise stoic persona
>Your appetite for her milk grows ravenous just as her output begins to drop
>With each suck she gave less and less, coming down to just a few drops no matter how much effort you put into freeing her milk from it’s plushy prison
>Leche leans back and removes your mouth from her tit, cream dribbling down your chin
>”Take it down a notch cowboy, this one’s empty. She ain’t got nothing left.”
>”I’m still thirsty.”
>”You can have the other one tomorrow morning for breakfast. Ought to keep you hydrated for the rest of the day.” She tucks the breast back under her bra then buttons up her shirt, standing up to her full height. “You can spend the night in the jail, then I’ll give you ‘breakfast’ just before dawn. By nightfall tomorrow your sentence will be served.”
>”This is insanity. Forced to suckle from the teat of my supposed protector just to keep my life. Satisfying her satisfy perverse carnal desires in the process, it’s disgusting.”
>”Forced? You seemed to be into it just as much as I was.”
>”Was not.”
>She walks around to the rear of the stockade and grabs your package, her fingers finding their way around your erect cock
>You give a surprised grunt and she chuckles in response, unlocks the stockade then escorts you to the jailhouse
> With something in your stomach you fall asleep quickly and in the morning you wake up to another bright sunshiny day
>True to her word Leche allows you to drink from her other breast, this time in the privacy of a jailcell rather than the public stockade
>And it’s a good thing she did, today must be a record breaker for temperature
>The sun beats down on the sand with a scorching intensity as heatwaves rise up from the ground
>By the time the sun falls below the horizon you’re well and truly on the edge, skin flaking and mouth dry
>When you see Leche approach she gives you a canteen of water which you chug down greedily
>The cow then unlocks the stockade and sets you free
>Desperate for some kind of liquor based relief you stumble into the saloon and immediately order a shot of whiskey from the bartender
>You swig it down and look outside
>Leche is still by the stockade, she gives you an unreadable stare before turning towards the jailhouse
>Not wanting to get caught for public intoxication again you get your fill of liquor then request a room to stay in, deciding to head back to your shack in the morning
>Morning arrives, you walk out the door and-
>She’s right fucking there again, waiting for you
>”You’re a wanted man Anon.” She says, sucking on a piece of straw
>You raise your arms up in exasperation
>”What is it this time?! I ain’t done nothin’! I’m perfectly sober I'm telling you!”
>She spits the straw out
>”I have it on good authority you’ve been drinking in public. That’s illegal.”
>”Drinking in public?! I’ve done no such thing! The last alcohol I tasted was last night and I was in the saloon the entire time!”
>”Never said it was alcohol you were sucking down.”
>”What in tarnation are you…oh.”
>She shifts her hooves and smiles
>”Why don’t you come on down to the jailhouse and we can discuss options. I would hate for a man like you who has such a…thirst…for life to end up in jail again.”
>”Guess I don’t have any other options, do I?”
>She shakes her head and spits on the ground
>”Nope. In fact, I can already think of something you could do in place of a prison sentence. Public service. Maybe you could come down to the jailhouse, let’s say once a week, and carry out any tasks I assign you.”
>”Once a week huh? Awfully specific.”
>”If you do well I may even make you my deputy around town. But make no mistake, I’ll always be the one in charge of you, ya hopeless drunkard.”
>”I already told you I'm not a drunkard! It’s a hobby!”

>Milfy director adds a very clear self insert into the storyline
>Same species, same age, even has the same fur coloration and hairstyle as the director
>This new character's backstory is that she's an old friend of the prince's mother who's come to protect him to make good on some kind of deal she made to his mother years ago
>But what he doesn't know is the other side of that deal
>In return for protecting the prince she gets to marry him, thus making her a princess
>Director basically creams her pants every time they're on screen together

If an anthro wants this humie dick she better have
>Long, sharp, curved, claws equally capable of tearing into competing females and leaving scratches on my back during a night of bestial passion
>BIG MEATY PAWS for those claws to be mounted on
>A mouth full of pearly whites for leaving love bites on my delicate skin and ripping into the carefully cooked meats I'll be making for her
>A body covered in plush groomed fur, occasionally unkempt if she comes home after a hard day at work and she needs some immediate stress relief
>Fluffy soft ears for me to rub and nibble on as she rests on our bed after a night of primal rutting, my baby batter seeping it's way into her bun oven
And I refuse to settle for anything less!

>You went off to college, leaving your best friend Alex behind.
>The day before leaving you said your final goodbyes.
>The very same evening she knocked at your door.
>Drunk but determined, she declared you were hers forever. She wasn't going to let you leave.
>And there, on the same couch you two had lost hours to video games, she pounced on you as if the two of you were still kids.
>Play wrestling? You hadn't done that in years. It made you laugh.
>Things got quiet when you felt her teeth slip around your neck, and the tears going down her cheek.
>"You HAVE you stay now! You're my mate! I know you love me too...!"
>Oh, Alex...
>You hear a knock at your dorm door as you're reading this.
>Opening the door, a grinning coyote kisses you before you even know what's happening.
>"Hey Non! Where does my stuff go?"
>Unfortunately for your roommate, coyotes mate for life.

>Lights your house on fire
>Waits for a crowd to gather then rushes in to save you
>Busts through the front door with you in a bridal carry to the cheers of spectators
>News about the heroic lioness saving a poor humie travels across the country
>Offers to let you stay at her place while you get your situation figured out
>Begins subtly turning you into her ideal mate while you're at her mercy
>?????
>Cubs
All according to keikaku

>Be you
>Journalism major
>Thesis deadline rapidly approaching
>Still no subject to write on
>Just when all hope seems lost, however, you finally get some inspiration
>Not far from your college is the town of Shan-srbavayr
>Very small, only about 200 people
>Little to no amenities besides houses, some farms, a small schoolhouse, a small market, and the church in the center
>Almost nothing is known about it, barely even any photos online
>Naturally, there are rumors swarming all around it
>Mostly obvious ones, ranging from cults to fronts for government experimentation
>Also, apparently they have allies in high places, making it easier for them to do their business without the public knowing, whatever business that may be
>You look for as much information as you can, but come up mostly empty-handed
>Just the aforementioned conspiracy theories and the most basic info available
>You’re just about to give up for the day and go play video games when you finally stumble across something
>A phone number for a ‘representative’ of the town, Marcus Neumann
>You call it
>The phone rings four times, but the other end picks up just before it goes to voicemail
>”Hello?”
>”Um, hi, my name is Anon Ymous, I’m a journalism student at Bright State University.”
>You pause, but Marcus stays silent, so you continue
>”Uh, I saw that there’s not much information about your town on the internet. It’s subject to a lot of unsavory rumors, and um… I was wondering if maybe an interview with a few locals could dispel them.”
>Again, no answer
>You only hear faint whispering on the other
>You can’t make out much, but you’re not sure it’s English
>”Um, hello?”
>”Yes, we would love an interview.”
>The abruptness of the response nearly startled you
>”Oh, uh, okay! Can I come on Saturday, around noon?”
>”Yes, that will be just fine. Thank you.”
>Alright. Th-”
>Again abruptly, Marcus hangs up the phone
>Well, that was… odd
>But at least you got your subject
>Now just to get the info and make a decent thesis
>
>Saturday comes before you know it
>At around 11:10, you hop in your car and make your way toward Shan-srbavayr
>Gradually, on your way, buildings start disappearing, until you’re driving in dense, dark woods
>You check your GPS repeatedly to make sure you’re not lost, but every time you check, it still says you’re on the right route
>You knew the town was rural, but you had no idea it was this far out from civilization
>You gulp, starting to have doubts
>Nevertheless, you stay on route, determined to get your thesis written on time
>Finally, you see signs of human life again after what feels like hours of driving
>The trees give way to a clearing and the first thing the first thing you see is a man tilling soil
>He’s an older man, roughly in his mid-to-late 40s, wearing dull shades of brown and blue, topped off with a sun-bleached sun hat, and a goatee with a few grey hairs in it
>Perhaps naively, you slow down and ask the man for directions
>”H-hey, I uh, am looking for a guy named Marcus Neumann. Would you happen to know where he is?”
>The man says nothing, he merely looks up and stares at you
>His face shows no emotion, merely studying you
>He steps a few inches closer to you, making you uncomfortable
>Finally, after a few agonizingly slow minutes, he lifts his arm up and points down the road
>”Uh, th-thanks!”
>It’s not really helpful information, but at least he gave you something resembling a response
>You drive off, glad to escape that encounter
>Not long after, you come across a house, with what is presumably the family who lives there all standing in the front yard
>A father, a mother, a son, and a daughter
>They all stare at your car with the same blank expression the man from before gave you
>Apparently not learning your lesson, you decide to stop and ask for directions
>”Um, excuse me, but… Do any of you happen to know where Marcus Neumann is?”
>Again, silence
>But before things could get more awkward, or before they could answer, you hear a voice calling out to you
>”Anon Ymous?”
>You turn your head to the side
>You see another man walking to your car
>He also appears to be in his forties, with blond, somewhat balding hair and pale skin
>He wears a light beige coat with a black undershirt, white pants, and brown loafers
>You suppose this must be him
>You get out of your car
>”Y-yeah, that’s me. Marcus, I presume?”
>”Correct. Welcome to Shan-Srbavayr.”
>Well, he talks unnaturally, almost robotically, but you’re just glad someone’s talking to you
>”Really, the pleasure’s all mine. Now, about the interview-”
>”There will be plenty of time for that, but is this truly the right time to discuss such things? Come with me.”
>You guess he has a point, it wouldn’t really be appropriate to just talk in the middle of the street
>”Oh, right, haha. Lead the way.”
>He begins walking, and you closely trail him
>Every time you look at someone, they’re all giving you the same face
>They even drop whatever they’re doing just to stare out you
>It’s seriously creeping you out
>Marcus, apparently sensing your discomfort, speaks up
>”You must forgive them. They are not used to strangers in this town, much less ones with cars.”
>”I… guess that makes sense.”
>Besides that brief exchange, the trek through the village is utterly silent
>No talking from you, Marcus, or any of the other villagers
>Now you’re really getting creeped out
>You just hope this doesn’t end in a Wicker Man scenario
>Fortunately, though, you reach your destination in almost no time at all
>The two of you stop at a decently sized house with white walls and a red roof
>”Here we are. This is my house.”
>You at first find it strange you went to Marcus’s house, but thinking on it, you guess it makes sense
>After all, he is the ‘representative’ of this place
>He opens the door
>”Please, after you
>You make you way inside, seeing several other people surrounding a fully set dinner table with plenty of food on it
>”Uh, who are…?”
>”Close friends. Please, sit down at the table.”
>Not wanting to be rude, you take a seat on the chair closest to you
>”You must be hungry after such a long trip. Please, eat. I insist.”
>You almost say no, but then again, the food does look good, and you had a light breakfast
>So, ignoring the screaming voice in your head telling you to run, take a dinner roll and pop it into your mouth
>Marcus takes a seat adjacent to you
>”Now, Mr. Ymous, what was it you would like to discuss in your interview.”
>”Oh, well I was just wondering about this town, and how… and how…”
>You really should have listened to your intuition
>The world blurs together, and stars swaying from side to side
>You only notice how heavy your body feels when you're on the ground
>The last thing you see before you lose consciousness is Marcus and some of his ‘friends’ looking down at you
>
>You wake up, groggy, not even realizing the danger you’re in
>At least, not until you realize you can’t move
>You tug at the restraints on your hands and ankles to no avail
>You’re laid out on a stone slab, arms and legs splayed to the side, mouth gagged
>To make matters worse, besides the gag, you’re completely naked
>You look around
>You seem to be in some sort of old-school cathedral, with no light besides some candles place here and there
>You’re watched by a crowd of people in brown robes, along with several other people in red robes
>You can’t make out any of their faces
>Immediately, you start to panic and scream through the gag
>Everyone ignores you as one of the guys in red robes, whose voice you recognize as Marcus’s, raises his arms and starts talking to the crowd
>”Rejoice, brothers and sisters, rejoice! For today, Marmina, Mother of Flesh, shall be reborn and purify yet another wayward soul!”
>What the fuck is this psycho babbling about?
>You want out
>NOW
>Two other freaks wheel in some sort of sarcophagus containing the mummified remains of…
>What the hell even is that?
>It’s skull almost looks like a dog’s
>But the body is shaped and proportioned like a human’s
>You’re so distracted by that, it nearly failed to notice the fact that the skull has no eye sockets
>This just keeps getting stranger and stranger by the second
>”A donation is required. We shall give Our Mother the blood of man, so she can return to the realm of the living and grace us with her presence.”
>One of them grabs your arm, and another pulls out some sort of strange tool with a long, metal tip
>It takes a few seconds to realize what it is
>A syringe
>You struggle uselessly before screaming into the gag as the needle is injected into your arm and blood is drawn out
>It’s a pretty big syringe, too, and by the time it’s finally done draining you, you feel woozy, your skin losing tone
>The one with the needle pours your blood into a small bowl held by Marcus
>Several of the others pour several basins of water into coffin, filling it to the brim
>”Oh, Mother of Flesh, please accept this gift, and come back to us so that we may offer another humble and loyal servant to serve you endlessly.”
>He pours the blood into the water, and then he and the others kneel down around the coffin, chanting something you can’t understand
>After about a minute of chanting, the water instantly fogs up and ripples before a hand pops out
>Well, perhaps that’s generous
>It’s covered in sickly white fur, each finger ending in a long, sharp, black claw
>Another ‘hand’ comes out, and subsequently, a head
>It’s covered in long, flowing gray hair obscuring its ears (assuming it has any)
>It’s face end in a long, canine snout, with a wet black nose and glistening, sharp teeth
>It’s eyes…
>Don’t exist
>There’s just fur where they should
>It takes a step out, body dripping from the water
>Its body is that of a chubby human woman’s
>Belly jutting out
>Breasts large and dangling
>Thighs jiggling from each step
>Hips wide
>Standing on two feet that also ended in long, sharp, black claws
>Your mind goes almost completely blank, unable to even comprehend what you’re seeing
>She turns to the crowd as they kneel before her
>”Greetings, my children. It is always so very lovely to see you.”
>Finally, she takes notice of you
>”Oh, and I see you’ve brought another soul into our home.”
>Immediately, you start struggling again
>Marmina either doesn’t notice or doesn’t care
>She merely strolls towards you, sniffing the air
>”Oh, yes. He is lost. Without purpose. His soul will never find peace without divine intervention.”
>She her head over yours, staring at you (or would be, if she had eyes
>”But worry not. Through me, all can receive salvation.”
>She removes the gag from your mouth
>”First, one must accept me into their very being.”
>She points one her breasts toward your mouth
>”Drink from me, my child.”
>To the best of your limited ability, you try your best to move your mouth away from the nipple
>”N-no! Get away from me, you disgusting freak!”
>The really seemed to set off Marcus and his crew
>”Heresy!”
>They begin to advance toward you, but stop when Marmina raises a hand to them
>”Stand down.”
>Immediatlely, they stop and kneel down
>She turns back to you and gently drags across your skin
>”He knows not what he does. He only lashes out because he is scared. We must teach him that he is safe in the embrace of the Mother of Flesh and that he shall be saved for his cooperation.”
>She speaks softly, her voice almost full of pity
>As terrified as you are, it’s hard to not feel she’s being sincere
>She once again speaks directly to you
>”You are not in danger, my child. You are not being punished. No one here hates you. I understand change can be scary, but I promise you, the change I will give you will be a good one.”
>She once again points her nipple at your mouth
>”Please, drink.”
>You grimace
>You know no is not an answer
>Either she’ll keep insisting until you crack, or she’ll sic her followers on you
>You give up
>You pop her nipple into your mouth, hoping it’ll get you out of this sooner
>The milk is rich and warm
>You sob between gulps, tears streaming down your cheeks
>Marmina, for her part, pets your hair and coos to you
>”There, there, my child. Keeping drinking, just like that.”
>She hums a strange song to you
>You suck, and suck, and suck until eventually, she pops out of your mouth
>”Well done, my child. Now I am apart of you, in mind, body, and soul, and nothing shall ever change that.”
>You shudder, full of milk, feeling violated
>Speaking of which
>Now she’s fondling your exposed scrotum
>”But now, I must make you a part of me.”
.”W-What?”
>”We must become one, and in order for that to happen, an exchange must be made. I gave you my milk, and now, you must give me your seed. Your virility.”
>”N-no, I can-”
>But it’s too late
>Marmina’s fondling has gotten you hard
>Against your protests, she mounts on top of you
>”I sincerely hope you enjoy this, my child.”
>As you tightly shut your eyes and look away, she starts riding you
>Up and down she goes as she squeezes your shoulders
>”Look at me, Anon.”
>You refuse
>”Look.”
>You reluctantly oblige, and are nearly sick when you once again see her lack of eyes
>How the hell did this happen
>All you wanted was a good subject for your thesis
>And now, you’re being raped by some monster while some insane cult watches
>What did you do to deserve this?
>Her breasts bounce with every lewd plap sound made
>She pants, her tongue leaking slimy drool on your face, making it just that much worse
>But possibly the worst part about it is, even though your mind is sickened by it, your body likes it
>The dissonance between the two feelings makes you wanna vomit more than anything else
>You try your hardest to resist, but you can’t betray your biology forever
>Eventually, you finish, cumming inside of her
>As you do, she bites down hard on your shoulder, causing you to cry out in pain
>She releases your shoulder from her jaw, and you see a deep bite mark where she did
>A few seconds later, she gets up, and you let out a shaky sigh, half out of relief and half out of disgust
>”Now, your essence is inside of me, my child, as mine is inside you. Now, we can begin the final part of your salvation.”
>One of the followers hands her a dagger with some weird runes on it
>Fear shoots up back in you
>”N-No, please don’t!”
>She addresses you offhandedly as she slices her own palm with the blade
“NO! I’ll do anything but please, don’t-”
>You see it before you feel it
>9 inches of metal, right through your abdomen
>”Now, who you were yesterday is gone, replaced by who you are today! Walk as one with me, bathe in my light, and follow my path, so that you may live eternally as an extension of me!”
>You can’t breathe, the dagger feeling like a twenty-ton weight on your stomach
>She starts chanting something in, presumably, some sort of ancient tongue
>You wait to pass out and die, but you don’t
>In fact, the pain goes away almost instantly
>You feel… something surge throughout your body
>With every word she chants, you actually feel more alive
>And then…
>
>In conclusion, Shan-Srbavayr is a lovely, warm, and welcoming town off the beaten path plagued by rumors propagated by ignorance. It is a place with a tight-knit but friendly community with a deep touch of spirituality and tradition. To restate it plainly, my life was changed for the better at Shan-Srbavayr, and I can’t wait to go back. If you would only open your mind and ignore bogus conspiracy theories online, you would realize just how great visiting a so-called ‘backwater hamlet’ could be.
>And, done
>That’s your thesis
>You hope it does good, because you can’t wait to graduate college and go back to your real home
>With your real family
>And your real mother
>Knock-knock
>Who could that be at this hour?
>You open the door
>It’s your friends, Tyler, Cierra, and Damien
>You look at their eyes
>They’re so lost
>They need guidance
>But you can’t play your hand now
>That would drive them away
>”Oh, hello there. What can I do for you this evening?”
>They look at each other, slightly concerned
>”Uh, Anon, you good, bro? We haven’t seen you in a while, and you look kinda… frazzled.”
>”Do I? I guess I was just preoccupied with my thesis.”
>”Uh… Y-yeah! That makes sense. Anyway, we were going to the beach next Sunday, wanna come?”
>You grin
>”Oh, I think I have a better idea.”

What would role play be like for anthros? I assume something like this

>besides the standard “wild animal being hunted by a human hunter”
>many roleplays are species specific
>jaguars act like mesoamerican natives while their husbands act like conquistadors
>horse anthros make husbands act like cowboys or ranchers
>farm animals like cows, pigs and sheep have the standard farmer shtick
>wolves have the whole “red riding hood” thing for them”
>boars pretend to be Germanic warriors facing off against a Roman legionnaire
>dogs have the whole “man’s best friend” thing, often with a praise kink as well
Any others I’m not thinking of? I got nothing else to think of.

>Unlucky with the ladies
>Can barely remember the last time you got laid
>Decide that enough is enough and tonight’s the night
>Shower
>Put on your best clothes and perfume
>Go to a local dance club with the intent of finding someone
>Not really one for clubbing, but hey, there’s gotta be at least one girl for you there, right?
>You pay the entrance fee and head in
>You’re grateful this isn’t one of those fancy clubs that block people off on status,
>Otherwise, you wouldn’t have a chance to get in
>You have a few drinks, not enough to get you drunk outright, just enough to get you buzzed and loosened-up
>Then, Operation Pussy Hunt commences
>You talk to one cute chick with blonde hair and a green dress
>She tells you to fuck off before you finish your sentence
>Next, you try a whole group of women sitting at a table
>You leave after they all start uproariously laughing at you
>After that, you actually manage to hit it off with this short chick at the bar
>At least, until her boyfriend comes back around
>You barely manage to slip away into the crowd before getting your ass beat
>Every single attempt ends similarly
>Woman after woman
>They all reject you in spectacular fashion

>”Don’t you think this place is a little crowded? What say you we go back to my place and get away fr-”

>That girl on the wall over there

>Trying your best to look confident (and failing), you strut over to her
>”Heya. Name’s Anon. What’s yours, beautiful?”
>She says nothing, merely forming an X over her mouth
>”Oh, uh, you can’t talk?”
>She shakes her head
>”Well, uh… That’s fine! Say, you lonely? Looking to get away?”
>She smirks and nods her head
>”I see. Me too. In that case, why don’t you come back to my place? We can relax a little there.”
>She nods again
>You’re almost in disbelief
>This is really happening!
>Nevertheless, you (poorly) try to keep your cool
>”W-well… right this way, then!”
>The two of you leave a club and hail a cab
>You tell the driver where to go
>You don’t try to make conversation, both because you’re bad at it, and she’s presumably worse at it
>Instead, she nuzzles her head into your shoulder
>This girl’s really into you
>Looks like you really hit the jackpot tonight!
>After enjoying the moment for a bit, you make it back to your apartment
>You invite her in and turn the light on
>”Here it is. Casa de Anon. Not much, but it’s home, y’know?”
>She seems more preoccupied with looking around,
>Not that there’s much to look at, honestly
>Meanwhile, you’re completely enamored with how she looks
>Her breasts push against her velvet dress
>Her ass does the same
>And her legs are long and slender
>It’s like you bagged a bitch from a magazine
>You don’t even know her name, and already, you’re completely infatuated with her
>”Hey, uh, you look… You look amazing, y’know that?”
>She looks back at you and gives you another sly smirk
>She pats her hands over her eyes twice
>You tilt your head, somewhat puzzled
>She does it again, and then you get the message
>”Oooohhh, I get it.”
>You giggle and cover your eyes
>After a few seconds, she taps you on the soulder
>”Wow, that was fa-”
>You do a double take
>The girl that was there just a few seconds ago is gone
>Now, standing in your living room, is something else entirely
>Something big
>Something monstrous
>Something with unkempt black fur and wild red hair
> Its claws, three on each hand and foot were blood-red and sharp
>Speaking of blood-red, that was the same color it had around the eyes and mouth
>You know what this thing is
>A Zoroark
>You’ve heard stories about these things
>How they use illusions to fool people
>How they lure unsuspecting trainers in with said illusions and then do whatever with them
>Apparently, most of these are just rumors and don’t have much in the way of evidence backing them up
>Still, one clearly tricked you and is now inside your apartment
>And you don’t like it
>You start to scream, but within a second, The Zoroark tackles you to the ground and muffles you with one hand
>It brings a finger to its lips and shushes you
>You continue to panic for a little bit, but after a few moments of futile struggling, you calm down
>It gives a wicked smirk and, once satisfied that you’re not gonna freak out anymore, begins to shift its weight down your body
>You take the split second to grab your phone and attempt to call… The cops? Pokemon control?
>You don’t know, anyone to get this thing away from you
>Not missing a beat, however, The Zoroark’s hand darts for your phone and rips it out of your grasp
>It shakes her head and wags its finger before crushing the phone with not much effort
>You’re fucked
>It travels down your body, resting on your junk and stretching its leg toward you
>You look up at it
>It makes a licking motion
>When you realize what it wants, your eyes shoot open and you frantically shake your head
>”Nuh-uh. No way. Get off me, you disgusting animal, or I swear to God, I’m gonna-”
>It repeats the motion with a sterner face, its claws squeezing your legs and piercing through the fabric of your pants
>Figuring that making the beast on top of you mad probably isn’t the smartest idea, you gulp and start licking
>You do your best not to dwell on the taste of it, merely trying to get it over with
>After you soaked the entire sole with your spit, you repeat with the other foot
>When that’s done, The Zoroark gives a malicious snicker and looks behind itself
>Apparently, it noticed your humiliating erection
>You don’t enjoy this, of course
>The friction of her body against your cock just made you hard
>It gives its lips a lascivious lick
>It yanks a couple of porno mags from your coffee table and studies them for a few minutes
>You say nothing, wondering what on earth it could be planning
>Finally, it does an understanding nod and throws the magazine aside
>It gets up off you, giving you a chance to breathe
>You’re about to say something, though you’re not sure what
>You don’t get the chance to, however, as The Zoroark changes again
>This time, its chest expands outward, giving it two large breasts
>It turns around and sticks its ass toward you just in time for you to see it, too, balloon in size
>Its thighs also get chunkier, and its hips jut out more
>It - well, she, apparently - then turns around and strikes a flirty pose
>Does this thing want what you think it wants?
>Screw that
>You’re leaving
>As soon as you start running, she grabs your arm and pulls you into a forceful kiss
>Her long, slimy tongue dance in your mouth as you cringe
>She pulls away, leaving a string of saliva between your mouths
>She squeezes your wrist and forces you to touch one of her tits
>They’re big and soft
>You would almost enjoy it if it wasn’t covered in fur
>After she apparently feels you’ve had enough of playing with her breasts, she roughly shoves you to the ground
>The only warning you get is a playful wink before she takes a seat right on your face
>You panic but, again, it’s futile
>After a few moments, you calm down, trying to focus only on breathing
>There’s a small bit of airflow between her nose and her whole
>But even if you can breathe, the smell might just drive you mad
>It’s earthy and musky, not quite like anything you’ve smelt before
>And smelling it’s just about the only thing you can do right now
>You hear another faint giggle before you feel something
>The Zoroark’s ripping your clothes off
>You’re tempted to go back to struggling, but you don’t, knowing it won’t solve anything
>Once it’s finished, your shirt, pants, and underwear are in tatters, living you completely exposed
>She teases you at first, using her still-wet feet to play with your cock
>After watching you squirm for a bit, she gets more active
>She leans forward so her face is right above your penis
>She gives it tender licks, giving you a jolt of unwanted pleasure with each one
>She looks back at you and gives the same licking motion as before
>You don’t bother putting up a fight
>Closing your eyes and holding your breath, you start eating her out while she plays with your dick
>You try only to focus as much on your own pleasure as possible while avoiding thinking about the current circumstances
>The two of you swirl your tongues around each other’s genitalia, eliciting great feelings of lustful ecstasy
>It gets to a point with you sucking on her clit and her sucking hard on your cock
>You have to admit, for a monster like this, she’s pretty good
>But before either of you can cum, she pulls away from you on both ends
>She stands up, leaving you panting on the floor
>You barely even notice her grabbing your legs and hoisting them up by your feet
>She gives you another wicked smile, and before you know it, you’re inside of her
>You let out a loud moan you would probably be embarrassed of if you were in any state of mind to care
>She starts riding, violently, but with care
>You believe this is what’s called a ‘mating press’
>She squeezes onto your feet as you fuck her repeatedly
>You give short, labored breaths, using every ounce of strength to not pass out
>Your cock gets completely covered in slick as it rapidly enters The Zoroark’s pussy
>She knows just how to keep you on edge
>An hour passes before you finally cum
>When you do, your scream is muffled by another kiss
>Her chest pressed firmly against yours
>You twitch and spasm a bit
>Strangely, despite the circumstances, you feel… oddly comfortable
>Like you’re under a big, heavy blanket
>You feel like you could go to sleep right now
>In fact, you do
>
>It’s been a few days since then
>The Zoroark, or Zoe, as you’ve started calling her, hasn’t left, and you don’t think she plans to
>Everytime you try to show her to someone, she uses illusions to disguise herself
>She’s more or less invited herself into your life
>You lay wither her, head laying on her lap while she sits, watching TV while drinking a cold beer
>If nothing else, you can take solace in one thing
>Operation Pussy Hunt was a success

> Be an ordinary citizen on Coruscant, working in a restaurant not far from the Jedi Temple
> See all kinds of colorful figures come and go
> Distracted padawan bunny girl comes in on leave one day
> Has her meal quietly in the corner but bumps into you when she's leaving
> Apologizes, then hesitates, and sniffs the air
> Leans into your shoulder and takes a deeeep breath
> Comes back flushed and with eyes slightly glazed

if you don't mind, what do you like about the anthrostate stories?

Personally, I find the premise fascinating.
The idea of an entire society working on the basis of a twisted interpretation how romantic love should work is captivating.
I mean, I wouldn't actually want to be there. It is a dystopian world after all. But still.
I think it is something similar to watching a car crash in slow motion to me. It isn't "nice" but I cant stop watching.
A marriage shouldn't be mandated by the state, and the relationship shouldn't be strictly hierarchical to the point of one being the owner of the other. Yet for the people living in those worlds it their normal.
It's probably similar to the way I Like "yandere" characters. Yet I wouldn't date a crazy bitch irl.
Idk I'm kinda bad with words and the idea of a woman stronger than me calling me "cute" and "good boy" makes me diamonds.
