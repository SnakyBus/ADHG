Day 42 of invasion
>Be Lt. Darius Rupert of the PDF
>Be evacuating another supply depot as Feminids advance across the planet
>Suffer surprise attack from Genestealers , hybrid infiltrators, but they were dealt with swiftly.
>Now you're trying to get as much ammunition loaded onto the cargo shuttles as possible asap.
>And to top it all of, a local noble was trying to get someone to evacuate him and his valuables.
>Matthias Ward the 13th was inbred as they came and resembled a squig in a suit.
>He was rumored bedfellow to the late Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge
>You had no desire to find out. All you wanted to do was escape to a fortified position.
>Marching over to the mostly intact Salamander, you asked your subordinates for a sit-rep.
"Sir, major enemy force twenty minutes away."
"How did this get so close?"
"Trygons and Raveners have been digging tunnels all over the place sir."
"Additional reports of traitorous elements and Genestealer cults providing mechanized transport."
>Wonderful...how long had the Genestealers been here to begin with, and how did they aviod detection for so long?
"Sir, Baron Ward wants an ETA on transport of himself and his collection."
>Looking at the Comms officer, you decided to indulge the slightly heretical and sensible part of your brain.
"Inform the Baron that due to misfiled paperwork from the Administratum, authorization cannot granted for...6 months and nine days."
>The Comms officer does, while you grab a dataslate containing inventory, trying to find the most valuable items to load.
"We might last about five minutes against this assault..."
"Sir, Baron Ward states that is unacceptable-"
"Then tell the ft bastard to pack a suitcase an get over here, we leave in twenty four minutes."
>You begin barking orders for the withdrawal, desperate to deny the Xenos anything of value
"HE SAID WHAT! HE DARES!"
>The ostentatious Ward Estate trembled under duress, mostly because of the upcoming attack.
>The other portion was provided by the spherical wobbling mass of angry nobility screaming in his quarters.
>His servants did their best not to flinch, enduring a storm of swears and spittle.
>The baron would be loading up his private shuttle, bu a cultist had made off with it.
>His collection of 1/6 scale Astartes models, his life's work, were stuck here with him.
>After a few more minutes of swearing, he stopped abruptly and stood, going to where his techpriest was working on a special project.
>Administratum misfiled paperwork, he was about to misplace a monstrous misplacement of his own.
>The Lt. would rue the day he defied Matthias Ward the Thirteenth!
>Entering the sidechamber, he looked at the pod that had come in on a bulk freighter a few years back.
>Upon it were emblazoned two very noticeable things, the first being the Officio Assasinourm's Seal.
>The other thing was the words, "Eversor XXX"
>Someone, somewhere, had well and truly fucked up.
"Tech-priest, tell the assassin to target Lt. Anon, and eliminate any Tyranids in the area!"
"As you wish, so shall it be done."
>The Tech-priest would do his best, but the nature of the subject within the stasis capsule made things tricky.
>Said Tech-priest had a bit to much confidence in his own skills, doubly so to those who knew what he was messing with.
>After a moment, the Tech-priest had finished uploading the commands, and de-activated containment.
>90 seconds later, the room was thoroughly coated in gore, oil, and scraps of armor and weapons.
>XXX heaved great gulps of air, twitching as drugs pumped into his bloodstream.
>He'd eliminated the people who dared to co-opt an Officio Asset, and thought themselves of higher standing than the Office.
>They had been successful in implanting their target however, PDF Lieutenant Darius Rupert, his location, and what was to be done.
>Grunting, XXX tore the over-sized syringe from his arm, cursing the ultramarine cosplay Ogryn.
>Grox Breeding Hormone...a full fifty cc's...explained why he felt so hot, and his synth-skin suit so tight in the crotch.
>Gripping his bolt pistol, the Assassin streaked down the halls of the mansion, gutting any unfortunate between him and the exit.
>XXX didn't bother with doors, he created new ones in walls as he sped toward his target.
>The HIve Tyrant snarled under her breath as yet another probing strike was thwarted
>She'd been sent to lead an attack on this supply depot, preventing the defenders escape, taking as many as possible.
>Her infiltrators had been identified by a Lt. before they could do any major damage to the guardsmen.
>Their Captain was out of commission, sure, but the Lt. had rallied his men and set up a line of defense.
>He'd even thwarted the efforts of a Ravener brood and several Lictors...impressive for a human.
>Still, this would make taking the humans alive a touch more difficult, they were organized.
>Worse, her scouts, living or otherwise, found the defenses to be well manned and planned.
>Removing that lieutenant took priority...and she had just the...individual...in mind.
{{Prepare the Dimachaeron}}
>The Hive Tyrant rumbled as she marched toward the human positions, her forces moving as she directed.
>Biovores expelled spore mines toward their target to soften it up and provided cover for the advance.
>Inside a dedicated transport creature, the Dimachaeron began to stir from bio-stasis.
>Things, for once, are going well, which means that everything is going to go sideways any second now.
>The Tyranids had run into prepared kill-zones and small minefields, though the bulk of their formation hadn't arrived.
>Another spore mine slammed into the ground, releasing a pink haze that Guard and PDF came to dread.
>Anyone who inhaled it would start moving as though heavily drunk, and reported a surge in libido.
>Thankfully, the supply depot had plenty of masks, heavy weapons, and explosives in stock.
That and a few of the power dildos had been shipped to your unit, and led to a surprising tactic.
>Tyranid Synapse creatures were isolated and pinned down, before/during/after inserting one.
>While probably heretical, any Tyranid in a short radius felt it too, preventing them from fighting.
>There was a roar as another pair of craft left ground, a Valkyrie and a supply shuttle.
>Casualties were starting to mount, those who could were being moved to the evac point.
>Other had been taken by the Tyranids, dragged into the hordes kicking and screaming.
>And the last fallback action had gone well, in another five minutes, all aircraft would be off the ground.
"What the frak is that!"
"Shoot it! Shoot it!"
"It's tearing through us!"
>Ah, the other boot just dropped, now you just needed to figure out what in the name of the Emperor had hit the line.
"West flank, start pulling back, I don't want those Tyranids to overrun the landing pads."
"Not Tyranids, some skull faced fraker is ripping apart everything in his path!"
>Not Tyranids...well, that's not good.
"Sir, what are your orders?"
"Begin final fallback maneuvers and board the shuttles, try and cover the west flank."
>You give a short salute, grab your bolt pistol and saber, before heading to the west flank.
>Your about halfway there when Tyranid fire starts peppering your position.
>A pack of Gaunts seems to have broken the line, and they look all to happy to see you.
>You hadn't been slacking off in your weapons drills, and you put three of the things down.
>Problem was, there were nine of them left and they were starting to try flanking you.
>Something human-shaped, black, and incredibly angry slams into them from the left.
>Bowlingpins.wav
>Seconds later, all but one of the Guants is dead, and is being violently violated by the thing.
>There's no small feeling of dread when you recognize just what hit the West Flank
>An Eversor Assassin, and it looks a little too happy to see you.
>Dropping the now catatonic Guant, it points at you, before making a slitting throat motion.
>Somehow, you can hear that blubbering Baron Laughing from here.
"WRYYYYY!"
>Yo back up while firing your bolt pistol, mentally writing up your will and testament.
>Suddenly, you trip on the edge of a drainage trench, falling backwards as the Assassin leaps at you.
"SKREEEEE!"
>Something thunders up, casting a shadow over you, before the Eversor is yanked from overhead.
>Landing in the water unharmed, you stand upright and turn to see what the frak that was.
>There was a very large Tyranid, slightly larger than a Carnifex, and with what looks like doubled up Lictor arms.
>You waste no time in scrambling out of the trench, grabbing the creature's attention.
>Suddenly, Its ribcage opens up, as the Eversor forces its way out in a grotesque parody of birth.
>Tearing your eyes from the damned thing, you run between a pair of containers, back towards the landing pads.
>The Eversor starts screaming, and the sound drops off rapidly, the 'nid probably having thrown him.
>Already you can hear the thing stomping towards you, smashing containers aside.
>Weapons-fire and Tyranid screeching are the backdrop to snarling and sundering metal.
>Glancing at your wrist chrono, you see you have 90 seconds to get to a Valkyrie.
>Your foot slips in a random patch of oil, just a pair of massive talons strike a few meters away.
>The 'nid is perched on the tops of the containers, claws snapping at you like a pair of tongs.
>You put two bolts in it, before it yanks the gun from your hands, tossing it aside.
>It grips your boot, hoisting you several feet off the ground, chest maw flexing open as it laughs.
"WRYYYYY!"
>The Eversor landed on the claws, slime-coated and a little battered, but no less murderous.
>You manage to free yourself from your boot with panic induced kicking, landing hard on your shoulder.
>There is a lot of screaming, but you just focus on running as though a daemon is on your heels.
>The Assasin is flung into the side of a container with enough force to dent it, but is up in seconds
>The Tyranid is assailed with toxin and brutal slashes, but it isn't even phased.
>Somehow, the dueling killing machines are always one step behind you, and you manage to reach the landing pads.
>Craft are already starting to take off, and the gateway slams shut behind you cutting off most of the screaming.
>You sprint with everything you have left to the nearest Valkyrie

>The Dimachaeron had had enough of her latest, and by far most persistent and stubborn, Assailant.
>Her target had escaped, and would likely be airborne in moments.
>The skull faced creature, for no human could take that level of punishment, seemed equal parts irate and erect.
>Well, if the wannabe wanted to fuck with her, she Would FUCK HIM!
>Her lengthy upper limbs slammed the feisty little shit to the ground, pinning his arms to the solid surface below.
>Drooling lower lips engulf his throbbing dick, before she slammed down.
>Every time he started thrashing, she'd apply just a little more force, he was sturdy enough to take it.
>He might have been unmatched in terms of ferocity, but he;d been merely modified.
>SHE, on the other hand, had been designed with DNA filtered through numerous battles.
>It would only be a matter of time before he succumbed to her relentless mating instincts.
>The roaring of numerous engines barely drowned out his cry as he exploded within her.
>His thrashing lessened, and she knew for certain a few more ought to teach him where he belonged.
>The Valkaery was lifting skywards when the gates at the far end of the pads were smashed open.
"Lt. Hive Tyrant!"
>You looked out the rear door of the drop-ship to behold a monstrous intelligence.
>Tyranids poured through the gap, but towering above them were a pair of Tyrant Guards, and the Tyrant herself.
"Orders sir?"
>On the one hand, killing her would devastate the local 'nids, but a warrior brood with venom cannons...
"Do not engage, just get us out of here. We can't risk it."
"Aye sir."
>Before the ramp closes, you could swear she was looking at you with a hungry grin.
>Adrenaline wears off, and you begin to laugh and cry at the same time.
>You're alive, and your plevis isn't beign ground into paste.
"Praise the Emperor."
>An hour later...
>The Hive Tyrant looked at the scene before her, utterly amazed as how one little thing could do so much damage.
>The discovery of Servitors had been shocking enough, but this thing was in a league of its own.
>Currently, it was immobilized by bio-resin and sporting a cracked pelvis at best, and a very flaccid member.
>A Venomthrope and Zoanthrope attended it, keeping it sedated and calm respectively.
>Not far from them was the slightly emaciated, very exhausted, and very satisfied Dimachaeron.
>Another Venomthrope attending her to neutralize toxins, and a Tyrant Guard permitting the normal violent organism to suckle.
>Shaking her massive head, the Tyrant reached into the Hive-Mind, alerting the others to the threat the Lt. posed.
>Moments later, she was given some inserting information, the good Lt. was related to General Powerstache.
>...He was going to be hers, she would outmaneuver and overpower him through skill of command and force of arms.

>tfw Peggy will never abuse her authority and make you eat her out under her desk for a promotion

>You try to get out, but your captor just shushes you and caresses your head, whispering about how happy you'll be together

>Humies wanting waifurs to be protective and change a human male’s life is considered agenda driven
>Next they’ll have a movie where two humie bois are gay and don’t need a reason to get a anthro women’s to be happy

Do you think thirsty anthros obsess over fictional human husbandos? Do they get into shitposting wars about who's humando is better?

110%
Probably even more than us.

>Probably even more than us
Just imagine their forums are like during heat season.

Bovine waifurs are the master race

>He needs someone to take care of him (maybe an anthro old friend or hired help)
>The anthro falls in love with him, but isn't sure if he would accept her
>She gets more and more horny at the idea of taking him, but resists because she cares about him
>Eventually she tells him how he feels, and he says he feels the same way
>This leads to sweet sex where he tries his best to make her happy too
>He might not be as proficient as he once was, but she loves him enough not to care

>she laughs as she opens the door two cups of coffee in tow,

>you shakily rise up to your full height, hand on the armrests
>"How'd I sleep? HOW'D I FUCKING SLEEP! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME LAST NIGHT?"
>her smile vanishes before returning in a much smaller and more embarrassed form.
>"yeah... sorry about that.. it's sort of our job y'know."
>she was clearly uncomfortable judging by her sudden avoidance of eye contact.
>"Sorry isn't going to cut it! You were all kindergarten teachers and then you slipped me a fucking roofie!"
>she looks even more upset now, her ears noticeably pressed back against her head!
>"Listen I know you weren't expecting it but it was supposed to calm you down."
>You were furious, your masculine anger and rage were what kept you from those despicable mommyfags
>How dare this hippie bitch violate your mind like that!

>she gives her deepest sigh yet

>You look at her shocked, you thought that this was to break your will make you subservient.

>she continues, her head drooping with every syllable
>"within a week... wonder why right?" bitter sarcasm now tinging her normally sweet voice
>"Our job is to figure out.. how to find out how to prevent that problem. Especially more troubled ones like yourself.."
>"What we gave you last night was supposed to calm you down.. make you react less violently to us without a full lobotomy.."
>"Of course there were a few girls back home who were down with that, but me and the girls running these places don't jive with that kind of thing."
>looking back this actually made sense

>"a lot of people were hurt."
>the Cheetah looks up at you sniffling and clearly restraining tears before a weak trembling smile forms

>she was now doing full on damage control
>and from her quivering smile, you can tell she knows it
>that under all the acoustic guitar and crystal telepathy, all of them knew just how awful this was.
>you looked up at her a mix of rage and sympathy
>then you stop, you can't even muster any will to be mad any more
>the cheetah gets up panicked that you'll get closer to the thing she's working hard to prevent
>"Ohmigod I'm so sorry! I shouldn't 'ave freakin dropped this on you."
>the rage comes back but it's muted and just as directed at yourself as it was at her
>you clench your fist but your head continues to sag
>"I can't say this is ok..."
>she tries to put her paw on your hand but you gently push her away
>"but this just didn't turn out how I expected it would."
>"If it's any consolation I get it, lot of dudes come here thinking they're gonna play Hogan's Heroes. Heck I came here, thinking I was gonna be some kinda superhero."
>"course in the real world things turn out different.
>you don't talk anymore
>you are now sitting there silently for what feels like eternity
>both of you staring at the floor not daring, to look at each other just in case eye contact alone would reveal more uncomfortable truths
>she clears her throat and leans against the wall for support, her hair now covering her eyes almost completely
>"You should finish your coffee."
>you nod still reeling and a little emasculated
>you gingerly sip the warm black liquid
>"It tastes like shit.."
>she laughs this time it's geniune, "Yeah it does... come on we should get out of here, Andromeda is making waffles and I don't want

>"Oh. Then I suppose that asshole would like his drink back."
>The bird swipes the expensive drink from her and knocks it back
>You could have sworn you heard the woman complaining, but you were too surprised by the bird grabbing you and releasing the drink into your mouth
>You feel your mind becoming fuzzy as the alcohol does its work, and melt into her as she kisses you

>"He bought the drink. I was merely returning it..."
>Her tongue licks her beak

What next? That doberman trying to convince him to become a special informant? A sloth or koala trying to get him to leave the city and join their commune? A puma gently persuading him to assist in her organization's trafficking operations? A panda offering him a nice luxury apartment across the world in exchange for 'joining' the doberman for her? An exotic lioness princess offering him a big white palace with all wives he could want so long as he has many, many children? A pine martin requesting that he become a figurehead of her novel and clearly superior movement in exchange for a seat beside her after they inevitably 'win-over' everyone? A kangaroo trying to convince him that moving with her into a big and isolated bunker complex is the only way he'll be able to survive what's inevitably going to happen to the outside world?

>Getting tongue bathed for hours after sex because she likes your salty sweat and exhausted whimpers

>getting tongue bathed for hours
>rough as fuck tongue like sandpaper.
You will bleed. Humans who have been licked by big cats in captivity say it’s exactly like sandpaper and will rub the skin raw. The cats don’t know this so you have to try not to irritate them because they may get upset if you refuse them yet allowing them will eventually result in so much skin being removed you bleed.
Getting tongue bathed for hours would probably be an effective form of torture. As the skin is removed more and more nerves get exposed thus it slowly gets more painful. Ever touched a really bad deep wound and feel excruciating pain? Imagine that over a foot of skin but constant.
Anthro cats hired at Guantanamo bay confirmed.

Boys can do sports. Wrestling (with other humans), volleyball, basketball, track and field. The girls wouldn't be happy if they lost their chance to gaze at men in tight pants.

They might be faster, but we're the distance runners. By the time they manage catch up, they'll be frustrated and horny.

Now I want a story where a man is constantly being hunted by a single anthro, running for days until she finally manages to get him.

That's literally the highest rated game show on anthro tv

>occasionally watch "The Sexiest Game" on Anthro Entertainment Network
>it's secretly become my guilty pleasure
>premise of an anthro woman being given 72 hours to hunt down a human within an enclosed environment
>if the human manages to survive for the time period, he wins $10k
>if the anthro manages to catch him, she wins an all-expenses-paid wedding and honeymoon for the both of them
>though perceived as very demeaning within human circles, it's become a staple TV show within anthro society
>decide to volunteer as a contestant
>called in, meet with a few TV execs and their lawyers, sign a few waivers
>"You have 3 months to prep, good luck"
>right, totally
>brush it off, as real as they make it out to be it's hard to believe that such a ridiculous premise ISN'T scripted
>fuck around for first two months of "training", only deciding in the last month to actually start

>pushed out the heli
>black out for a split second
>nearly fucking pissed my pants

>loud speaker blares seemingly from all directions "You will be given a 30 minute grace period. After that, your Sexiest Game will begin! Good luck."
>take the first few minutes after landing to calm down from a bit of shock
>deep breaths, recollect myself before remembering: I'm on live television and being hunted for sport
>heave pack over my shoulder, shit's actually pretty heavy
>empty it onto the dirt ground
>rummage through all the stuff provided; power bars, jerky, a couple of water bottles, and a first aid kit to highlight the most important stuff
>been at least 15 minutes since the first warning, decide to take only what looks necessary
>cram food, water, and medical gear, and some other shit into backpack
>notice a sheet of paper that fell out along with the rest of my gear

>sun almost completely set, practically pitch-black
>suddenly hear a branch snap from afar, footsteps approaching, the sound of dead leaves crunching

>"Oh, that's no fun."
>She's whispering very quietly, as if we weren't the only two in this whole damn forest preserve
>Humans are distance runners, but what does it matter if she can clear 50 meters in a third of the time it takes me?
>"This wouldn't make for a very entertaining episode, don't you think hon?"
>She waits for a response but I sit still
>I can practically hear the smile on her face
>"I was asked to play this out for as long as I could. But I could take you right now and no one would blame me for claiming my prize."
>She licks my cheek with her hot tongue
>"Then again, the fun is in the hunt. You better start taking me seriously."
>I sit there for too long again, and as I get up to walk away I'm certain there's no one nearby
>legs trembling a bit, breathing slowly coming down
>and the most powerful fear-boner on this side of the earth
>can't shake the feeling that she's gonna fucking wreck me
>pull out a space blanket from my pack and call it a night

>against all odds anon, somehow, actually manages to win
>everyone is left baffled, this has never happened before in the history of the show
>wolf is heartbroken, her chance to claim a humie of her, and she somehow lost
>anon walks over to her
>she expects him to start gloating about hpopw he won
>instead jumps up into her arms and starts kissing her
>now everyone is even more confused

I wonder what demographics would watch that show.
Would it be a thing a whole family would sit down for, just lonely anthros, would it lean male or female viewership?

Majority
>Female anthros who:
>Are lonely
>Want to improve on their husband hunting skills
>Hope to eventually join the game

>Minority
>Male humans who:
>Wish to learn how to fight or escape anthros
>Cynics who want to laugh at the stupid guys who think they can win
>Survivalists
>Conspiracy theorists who are preparing for when anthro females finally abolish laws making rape illegal (which will never happen, definitely won't happen, trust us the anthro lawmakers will ensure these rules stay in place so please vote for us you cute male humans, and loneliness will be a thing of the past)

Anyone else here ever go from having no interest in anthro's to only being able to get hard to them? Not sure what the fuck is going on or why I keep doing stuff automatically without even thinking about it. Obviously, I don't need to worry about Snakelady, I can trust in her completely. And she really does have the most amazing eyes that are so easy to get lost in. Still, I kind of feel like this is moving a little fast.

I’ve found that a lotta anthros do that. At least the female ones do to human guys
Either it’s a look in the eye, or it’s the way they smell. Or even in their spit
Knew a guy, a friend really who was openly anti antro-human relationship. You know the type, scrawny, pale and just kinda angry at the state of the world and his place in it
One day he was talking about why we shouldn’t trust the anthros while we were at campus and while he was talking a tiger lady, probably about 7 foot with broad shoulders and wide hips, and a admittedly amazing rack, walked up behind him, grabbed him, and before he could say or do anything, kissed him on the mouth, like, a deep kiss, I heard him choking and saw that his throat was bulging where you could see her tongue wiggling around.
He was really fighting, but she had his arms pinned to his sides and he was only like five 10 at best. His eyes were bulging out of his head and his brow was furrowed and he was fighting like a monster...then he wasn’t. He just kinda went still, he looked relaxed and calm...and he was kinda smiling, he wasn’t even choking on her tongue anymore. I think the scariest part was that he was all of a sudden locking on to her eyes and she was looking back
Then she pulled away and put him back down, patted him on the head and walked away...and before I could ask what the hell happened, he trotted off after her.
That was the last I saw of him for a few weeks
Then he turns up again. And I swear he grew 5 inches and got like 80 pounds of pure muscle mass...and the tiger lady was with him, or I guess he was with her. And they had some other folks with them a bunny girl and a some sorta lizard, but he looked at me, talked to them and pointed at me and they both started walking my way, and I got this sudden rush of fear, and I made a bee line for the exit and my car, which I made it to, I remember when I was driving out I looked at the campus and I saw all 4 of them smiling at me.

I didn’t know tiger pheromones could give a dude a 5 inch growth spurt in a matter of weeks
Like
Dude didn’t have bad posture or anything, he was 5’ 10”. Than when he showed up again he was like 6’ 3”, 6’ 4”

No clue about your friend. I'm guessing the pheromones are what initially made him all docile and compliant like you mentioned, but as for the growth, no clue. Sometime working out can maybe add an inch as they start to actually stretch out using different muscle groups, but as for the rest of the height, not to mention the muscles, no clue.
Was his personality still intact, or was he basically just a himbo in tow?

Well
When I went back to classes a little while after that incident where he and that damn tigress tried to bushwhack me with the two anthros, I was walking around campus I heard him running his mouth, except that now he was talking about how great anthro women were great, and how we as a, and I freakin quote, “good and just people” should help them find “mates” because they don’t have many men in their species, and without us they would have huge problems.
Like some sort of evangelical for species mixing. He had that tigress hanging off of him the whole time. I would have continued to listen but that rabbit lady from earlier snuck up on me and she....its not important
But I had to break and run while I was still able to think straight so I didn’t get the chance to hear the rest of it.
But from what I heard, it was the opposite of what he was like, he always said that it was a invasion, that they were lying about what they wanted from us. That we were no better than cattle to the slaughter at best and a race of slaves at worst. And he said we were already lost because of how fast they got themselves into places of power.
He talked about self defense and humans working together to get back control and how people who dated and married anthros were traitors and the like.
It’s like he was a completely different person. But somehow the same.
But I think that he was right, about us being no better than a slave race. I didn’t used to. But after what I’ve seen the last couple of months, before and during this lockdown.

I just want to say I like that
>The Sexiest Game
is now thread canon. It doesn't even matter if the details are all over the place, it's like survivor, after a certain number of seasons they just start going crazy with the rules.

Oh God, the season/episode ideas.
>Bayou Battle: with croc ladies
>Turning the Tables: The hunted is the hunter.
>Northern Exposure: Polar bears, moose, etc
>Isolation Island: Tree snakes, jungle cats
>Austrailian Anarchy: Special episode which a collection of Aussie anthros battle one another for a human to claim while on the run. Possibly Mad Max influence.

Any good rabbit episodes? I haven't seen much of them but they'd probably be pretty good at it

The rabbit episodes aren't that great, it's always the exact same formula.
>rabbit runs around and finds where the guy is most likely to run to
>settles in to a small hole between landing zone and where he'll run and waits to ambush
>soon as he comes into range she bolts out, dropkicks him, and snaps the cuffs onto them
>the most variance their ever is is if he takes a different route or decides to run somewhere else
>if so she just moves to settle in to a different ambush spot
Rabbits have a much easier time because they're actually fairly close to humans so they can just feel their way through what they would do in that situation and it usually ends up being the same as what the human does.
I know I said the rabbit episodes weren't that great but compared to almost all of the rest of the other episodes they're pretty damn good. With most other anthros' episodes you can know who's going to win as soon as you see the human; either he's going to be completely out of breath before the grace period ends and just get rushed down immediately, which is what usually happens, or he's just gonna keep running nonstop and the anthro is gonna expend all of her energy in the first few hours and at that point they may as well forfeit. At least with the ambush anthros there's multiple times throughout the game where the anthro could win even against a fit human and where an unfit human could win as long as they're able to outwit the anthro.

>Be a human who has fallen on hard times
>Had to change your name because you're ashamed of the things you had to do to live
>Go to the Jade Palace because you felt like it was your best chance at a new life
>So you sit before Shifu, begging for him and the others to let you join
>"Please, I can't go back to living there! I'll learn, I'll cook, I'll clean! I'll do anything!"
>Shifu avoided your gaze, opting instead to look at the floor
>"I'm sorry, Anon. We already have enough students, and no human has been able to become a kung fu master in many years!"
>"Just... please. I don't know what else to do. I'll just do chores if I must, I'll work harder than anyone, just please let me stay."
>"I'm sorry, only students are allowed, and you fit no school I know of, so I can't teach you. I really wish I could help, but I just can't."
>You hang your head and you start to feel your eyes water
>You can feel the regretful gazes of the others
>But then an old voice breaks your misery
>"But there is a school."
>You look up and see an old turtle standing behind the others
>"Really? There is?!"
>Shifu looks to his master, surprised
>"But Oogway, you can't mean I teach him-"
>"Yes, human style. The way of diplomacy, and misdirection."
>Diplomacy?
>You thought this place taught martial arts, not diplomacy
>Still, you aren't going to complain
>"I'm willing to to learn the way of the diplomat, master!"
>"No, no you aren't!"
>"He seems perfectly willing to me. In all my studies, I know well about the master of the human style. He was a lot like this boy."
>"The master of the human style made it himself. To make Anon learn it to live here i-it's undignified!"
>"Undignified? The man who made this style was said to control armies with a wave of his hand, could distract the most disciplined warriors allowing for a fatal blow, and even the most fickle of people held undying loyalty to him."
>You give a deep bow
>"Please!"
>Shifu looks annoyed for a second, but soon relents
>"Fine. You may join us."
>"Yes!"
>"But! Before you agree, you need to know what you are getting into. The human style is unlike any other. It is a style that, while useful in battle, is almost useless in a fight alone."
>"I can accept that."
>"It even attracts foes who would wish to make use of you."
>"But also many more allies."
>"I'm willing to risk it."
>Shifu picks up a scroll from his robe and hands it to you
>"This style is not one I'm familiar with, but it takes a lot from the other styles, using their grace and beauty as a template. I can teach you those parts, but there are some..."
>He lets out a cough
>" Advanced techniques that requires a female partner to train. Whether they want to help you is up to them."
>You excitedly unroll the scroll and see
>"Is this porn?"
>"The human creator of this technique knew how to use the natural charms of humans to stoke the lust of many females, and even some males, that he so set his eyes upon. He could convince anyone to fight for him with even more vigor than many would fight for themselves," Oogway smiles at you
>"I'll need to know how to eat people out? This seems a little more like prostitution."
>"That's why I was uncomfortable about the idea of teaching you," Shifu shakes his head
>"Ah, but with these skills you will always find yourself in the lap of luxury wherever you may go."
>"W-well, I did say I'd do anything. I want to learn."
>"Good. Heh, I'd bet with the proper training you might even be able to get Tigress to show some emotions."
>The tiger glares at him
>"I take my practice very seriously. I shall not stray from the path."
>"Oh, no you won't. I expect you and Viper to work harder than ever in fact. Hehehe."
>What did you get yourself into?
>The next day you are standing in the training room with Shifu
>He hands you two fans which you gratefully take
>"While your uniform is being made, we shall practice. Now, this style makes heavy use of fans, but they are less weapons and more a way to help your charm. You can also see through them with the right angle."
>He does some dance moves with the fan that would probably look seductive if they weren't being done by the small, old kung fu teacher
>You can't help but let out a chuckle
>"Yes, uh, it doesn't translate well to red pandas. Now you try it."
>You make an attempt, but from the cringe coming from him you can tell it doesn't look good
>"No, turn your hips and let the motion push your arms naturally. That's too robotic."
>Again
>"The main trick is that you want to keep their attention on your body while hiding your face. Then give them a glimpse of your eyes."
>"Could I get a mirror or something? It might help a little if I could see what I am doing."
>"Hmm, yeah, might be a good idea. This is a lot more visual than the others."
>You sorely regret getting the mirror
>Now you have a good view of all your failures
>Looking 'seductively' at yourself just feels wrong
>You are at least getting better at hiding your face with the fans, because you don't want to see the shame on your face
>Still not good at the peaking come hither look
>"Anonymous, the scroll may say that a shy look is a great weapon in your arsenal, but it emphasizes switching between the two whenever useful."
>"I know, I know! I'm trying!"
>"I think you need a break, you got better, but now you're getting a bit sloppy."
>"But master!"
>"Constant work can hinder progress. You need a break."
>You slump your shoulders in disappointment
>"Do not think that doesn't mean you won't be improving still. Martial arts is a way of life, so even when the training is over you can still improve. You've got homework."
>"Really?"
>"Yes. Keep the fans and try to keep others from seeing your face with them. Even in the presence of others this elegance must be maintained, or else the illusion may be broken.
>"But first we need to wash you up a bit, you can borrow one of the bath gowns after this, those tattered things would hinder you. They also don't look very comfortable."
>You feel grateful for the practice, but at the same time you want to curse him
>"Anon, do you really need to keep those fans up at the dinner table?" Crane asks, giving a strained smile
>"It's homework."
>"Wait, you have to do that all day?" Mantis asked, raising one of her minuscule eyebrows
>"Yes. Something about not breaking the illusion. I need to be seductive"
>"Well, I think you look good," Monkey says with a wink
>You hold the fan closer to you as your face starts to burn
>"Thanks, but I'm really not good at it. I mean I've just started and I've hardly practiced. I don't think I've made enough progress to warrant compliments."
>"Maybe not, but when you definitely have the looks of a master!"
>You unconsciously pull down the fan a bit in surprise, but quickly manage to pull it back up
>"I knew you had a nice face behind all that dirt," Viper kindly smiled
>Tigress' face lights up a small bit before returning to her usual stoic self
>You continue eating in silence for a bit before Tigress speaks
>"Are you planning on learning those other techniques?"
>"Other techniques?"
>"The ones that require a partner?"
>You stare at her in surprise
>It isn't long before Monkey breaks the silence
>"If you need a partner, I wouldn't mind...?" she says, scratching the back of her head
>"I... I already know a few things."
>"Really? Of course, I'm not surprised. With a face like yours of course you spent some time with some ladies."
>"Don't be so uncouth, Monkey."
>"Hey, I'm just offering to help. You get a lot of practice?"
>You get up
>"More than I wish I ever had."
>You leave the room as the rest fall silent

You think anthros post cute humans getting fucked by old, fat bitches to piss other anthros off?
>anon's sitting on a couch
>"whats your name?"
Ano-
>two big titty/booty, polar bears come in and ICE anon.

I imagine it would piss human women off even more. Imagine being 10/10 human Stacy in the prime of your youth with a perfect movie star face and figure and seeing all the human men going out with something like pic related. Imagine the seething at knowing that the cute guy you've been crushing on is getting fucked into the mattress by some 7ft tall forty/fifty something she-beast, who likes like her diet consists of sausage and beer.

Tigress Story
>The pain in your limbs made it hard to focus
>The jumping and ducking was hard enough, but having to keep shifu from getting a clear view of your face
>You tried to cheat once by just not facing him, but then he'd just jump at you and kick you
>Worse, he said that eventually you're going to need to do fancy maneuvers while going through the obstacle course
>You've seen the others do their dodge practice, and while theirs may be a sight to behold they were also fairly simple
>You, you had to learn every single acrobatic move from each school
>'Beauty is in each style. You must flow like each of them, with speed, power, fluidity, flexibility, and become near impossible for someone to guess. You should reach any position and move with any blow at any time.'
>When you asked why the others don't do this stuff, he just said it's to make up for your lack of combat skill
>You also aren't as capable of specializing as the others, so since you can't be perfect at one of them, you'll have to be good at all of them
>At least you have more time to learn how to move, since this style has almost no attacks
>"That is enough."
>You jump out of the course, breathing heavily
>"The one thing I always found remarkable about you humans is how you can work for so long and still keep the same mien about you."
>You'd chuckle at this if you weren't so tired
>He's talking about you keeping a mien, and yet here you are gulping down air like a man who almost drowned
>You'd love to collapse on the ground if it didn't break down your image any more than it already is
>He hands you some water, which you gladly drink
>"Now, your uniform is finally done. I'd like for you to change into it."
>Having finally caught your breath and cooled down, you manage to ask speak
>"Really?"
>"Yes. I think it came out well. It's a lot like the previous master's. From now on, you'll need to wear this whenever you practice."
>With a nod, you grab the clothes and head to the changing room
>Closing the door, you take the clothes and unfold them
>Only then do you realize his words
>You saw pictures of the last master, and the clothes were a little
>Showy
>M-maybe if you put them on it won't be as bad

>Oh, it is definitely bad
>There are openings along it that shows off plenty of your more masculine features
>But at the same time, if you move just right the flaps of cloth along it hides it
>Just barely
>There's even an opening along the crotch
>It's like it's made to have people look, hoping to catch a glimpse of something more
>And you need to be careful or else someone might actually get that glimpse
>You walk around the room a bit, looking in the mirror to make sure you aren't showing anything indecent
>When you are finally find a gait that's good enough, you leave
>Shifu sees you and and quickly turns around around
>"I'm glad you've managed to get the walk down."
>"Yeah. Do I really need to wear this?"
>"I'm afraid so. It is meant to be very distracting, and you'll need to learn how to dodge in that."
>"Wait, I need to dodge in this? But what if I trip on the flappy bits, or show-"
>"That is what training is for. I assure you, I'm not happy about this either."
>At that moment, the others walk in
>"So then I caught it with-woah."
>They all gawk at you
>Even Tigress' mouth is open a bit in surprise
>"Uh, hello." you wave to them
>They wave back
>"Is this going to be your new look?" Crane asks, her face hidden behind her wing
>"Yes. This is an important part of the style, so you must get used to it."
>"Anonymous, you don't feel embarrassed in... that, are you?"
>Before you can answer, Shifu speaks
>"Yes. It is important that Anonymous not embarrass himself in public, so you I am giving you all the task to tell him if he shows anything too revealing
>They all swap to their stoic faces and give a yes sir
>That face hiding training is going to come in handy soon you feel

>After that, she's constantly having sex with you, and she's never not filled with children
>She says it's because she needs to save her species
>You're pretty sure she just has an impregnation fetish

>Shark mommies
Pfft, they aren't all cute and cuddly anon, I'll tell you that off the bat. The dolphins are rapists to the core and the sea lions are always wanting you to do weird harem shit, but at least they can't be randomly triggered like you said an MK ultra codeword. This happened to me just the other month
>Finally finished work, head on out and down the block
>Live on the coast, lots of wind off the nearby bay in the evenings
>Cool dusk comes, with my hands in my pockets, my... empty pockets
>Forgot my rape whistle, pepper spray in my locker at work
>Fuck
>Hurriedly run back home through the empty streets, water sloshing as the tide rolls in
>Two blocks out when I trip on a fucking curb and skin my knee
>Hurriedly pull up my pants leg, praying quietly
>For a moment it's just the white of scraped skin
>Then blood pools to the surface
>Sprinting now, I can see my house at the midsection of the block
>"Are you okay, baby?" A voice giggles, not too far behind me
>I bodyslam my door and thank god I switched to a fingerprint lock as I get inside
>Standing in the hall, a moment passes before I see the handle jiggle just a moment
>"I just want to make sure you're okay! C'mon, open up! I-I'm a nurse shark..."
>Silence

Sharks go into a trance-like state if you can get them belly-up in the water. it's referred to as Tonic Immobility.
And at least sharks are more wholesome than dolphins.

Yeah, the dolphins around here are just fucking hedonists. "Fuck my blowhole" "This pussy is internally muscled, humie boy" just absolute raunch 24/7. I have to say the rare sea turtle chicks who come through are the chillest, they all only eat vegetarian and get real down on you if you have a burger or something though. i'm just especially afraid because I might be going back to work soon, and if she wasn't just making a lame joke and really is a nurse shark, end of June starts her breeding season. Nurse shark litters are fucking huge! I can't afford that.

Day 48 of invasion
>Be Anthony Wallace, medical student and overworked essential worker.
>You'd been run ragged over the last few weeks dealing with an influx of refugees and resultant minor injuries.
>Despite the valiant and unusual methods the Guard and the PDF were using, they were losing ground steadily to the Tyranids.
>The saving grace of the 'nids not sending hordes of their own number at them was good.
>The fact that the Xenos were using Imperial Guard tactics and equipment in some cases was alarming.
>For the town of Gambrok, there would be no escape, they'd been encircled days ago.
>For you however, you'd been dealing with far, far worse things than putting people's guts back inside them.
>An involuntary shudder raced down you frame, as you wondered if the Tyranids were even aware of what they were doing?
>By the Emperor, you'd had the misfortune of learning how an undying erection got treated.
>And then there were the other things the Tyranids did to people.
>First, there were the victims of the paralytic quills, and while those were easy to remove, the left noticeable side effects.
>Most notably impaired movement and a flushed face, and perhaps a bit of excessive drooling.
>Thankfully, you just made sure any of the incapacitated soldiers didn't stumble to their deaths before the toxins worked their way out.
>Second was the spore victims, anyone inhaling them felt very hot, very drunk, and very horny.
>Again, you mostly monitored them and kept them from trying to wander off.
>Otherwise they might attempt to molest the medical servitors.
>Several personnel had gotten covered in bio-resin, which oddly enough dissolved upon contact with human saliva.
>In developing a solution to this, the Magos convinced you that he was outright mad.
>And finally, you had removed 96 Ripplers from the crotches of Guardsmen, PDF, and idiot teenagers.
>Fortunately, you were able to remove the little buggers without them biting off any important bits.
>Unfortunately, earlier in the morning, the lines had fallen, and Tyranids were moving from street to street.
>Now everyone was scrambling for shelter and weapons, or seeking one last moment of peace.
>The Tyranids didn't kill humans, mostly, but if one was threatening or had killed his fellow man...
>It seemed the only thing the Tyranids wanted was to...fornicate with any guy they came across.
>You ducked under a fallen beam blocking the street, gazing at the corpse of a flying Tyranid.
>It was massive, having smashed though a building on its way down, and oozed out across the street.
>All around the town, battle sounded off again and again, as the Tyranids advanced.
>The streets were empty, mostly because everyone was hiding, or flying Tyranids had picked off everyone.
>It had been tempting to wait for the inevitable back at the clinic, but you figured you could hide down in one of the old sewer pipes.
>You've done so in the past, there were few, if any mutants to speak of, and you knew an out of the way place...
>These was shouting and gunfire up ahead, and the screeching chittering of Tyranids.
>You stopped short, before ducking down an alleyway to escape the fighting, pistol raised.
>Your legs ached from all the running, and he cursed his lack of foresight by waiting for the next transport.
>There had been fighting just down the street when the men guarding the place said that you'd best run.
>Bracing yourself, you exited the far end of the alleyway, and emerged into combat zone.
"Keeps firing!"
>The red strobe and cracks of las-fire contrasted with the firing of Tyranid weaponry.
>You had to flatten yourself against a wall as the foot of a Sentinel walker stomped down before you.
>Heat from the multi-las firing cause you to shrink back, but not before one of the soldiers noticed you.
"Get down civilian!"
"Shit, I knew we lost the outer line, how far in are they?"
"Lines are collapsing backwards, you have a gas mask right?"
>You nod, pulling it out.
"Good, put it on, we;re heading to the Arbites' Headquarters, don't need another person going down ."
>Right, apparently he doesn't know you lack major medical experience, but given how bad things are...
>The multi-las is probably the only thing keeping the Guants from pouring up the street as the squad begins to withdraw
>Then something slams down into the middle of the squad, before unfurling.
"Rippler Ball!"
>At those words, several of the small toothy critters wriggle forth faster than one would think.
>The Guardsmen do their best to shoot the small things, before they can attach themselves in a very vulnerable spot.
>You stomp on the closest one, feeling its body give and crack slightly under your boot.
>Several of the Guardsmen also are successful at shooting the little buggers, a few are not.
"AGH! HELP!"
"Not Again, no."
>Something large and fleshy lands further back in the street, pouring out an immense amount of spores.
>The pink fog wasn't lethal, but it did obscure vision and gradually incapacitate anyone who breathed it too long.
"Grenades out!"
>Explosions tor up the street, and everyone pulled back, save for one man who was trying to free his junk.
>The Sentinel sprayed las-fire into the smoke, walking backwards, paying little attention.
>Massive metal feet stomp all to close to you, as you begin retreating from the makeshift barricade.
"Auspex Contact! Large Xenos specimen approaching!"
>There is a lashing sound, like heavy flesh whips, and a half dozen tendrils are wrapped about the Sentinel's raised leg.
>It tries to aim at whatever is holding it, but more suddenly strike the multi-las with enough force to bend it.
"Move!"
>With a groan, the walker falls over, legs kicking as it is dragged back into a thickening wall of fog.
>Metal squeals and screeches as you and the rest of the Guardsmen run like hell.
"Emperor's mercy, they're tearing open the hatch!"
>The doomed machine and it's crew is left behind, as your small group begins firing back.
"The frak was that?"
>You weren't sure, but hopefully you never found out.
>It was a running gun battle in low visibility while wearing a gas mask, in a fair world, the 'nid would have it just as bad.
>Life wasn't fair however
>The Tyranids were never affected by their own toxins.
>They were without number, and hey adapted to everything.
>A small flock of Gargoyles swooped down on the squad, carrying several of them off.
>Then the large thing following you though the smoke grabbed another two, yanking them back.
>At this point, you just ran, stumbling through the streets heading deeper into the city
>You could hear the thumps of whatever was perusing you, but the fog was to thick to see through
>The city was getting bombarded with spore mines, and the sounds of battle were dying down.
>Suddenly, someone collided with you, sending you both sprawling to the ground.
>The las-pistol clatters away, and you do your best to untangle yourself from the man.
"We need to run."
"More Tyranids?"
"No, the priest, he's gone mad."
"I assure you my sons, that I am most certainly sane."
>Ordinarily, that tone of voice would have been a bit too insistent for your tastes.
>Not so today, as you beheld the priest the man was running from.
>The faithful servant of the Ecclesiarchy is wearing a smile, and holding a flamer.
>Never a good combination, under any circumstances.
"Father, please, think about what you're doing."
>It's hard to read his expression through a gas mask, but you have no doubt he's cracked.
"I am saving souls from eternal damnation at the hands of the foul Xenos child, I do what must be done.
>You've gotten half the sleep you need and have been worked to the bone helping inured.
>Despite all this, you figure you can try reasoning with the man.
"Listen to me, you should be helping your fellow man in their time of need, not burning them."
>He levels the flamer at you, the pilot light stuttering in the thick fog.
"Tis the only way I can save you, may the Emperor forgive me for what I must do, and may your suffering come to an end."
*fwip*
>The flamer jerks suddenly, as a pale, fleshy tentacle wraps about it.
*fwip* *Fwip*
>The priest is lifted off the ground, struggling against whatever is holding him.
"Now now, that's not a very nice thing to do."
"Unhand me foul beast!"
>His mask is ripped off by another tentacle, his face red and eyes wide with panic.
"Oh sure, hold your breath, you'll need to breathe eventually."
>The fog has cleared enough to reveal the particular Tyranid, nearly the size of a chimera,
>It was if the 'nids had decided they didn't have something with enough tentacles.
>She had a dozen arm tentacles, twice as many around her mouth, and the biggest pair of breasts you'd ever seen.
>There's the whine of a las-pistol, followed by the unoccupied arm full of tentacles lashing at the other man.
>A second later, he's as tied up as the priest, fully immobilized and exposed to the spores.
"Seems I will need to give you both an injection to keep you calm."
>Each of her tentacles has a sharp tip, which she jabs into them for a moment.
>After a few seconds, they go limp, and are laid down on the street carefully.
"well now, with that out of the way, I have a question for you cutie."
>WHAT?
"What?"
"Ready for your massage~"
>Oh no, you do not like where this is going.
>A moment later her tentacles are all over you, the whip-like appendages wrapping about your body and limbs.
>Your struggling could best be described as pointless, each of the tentacles is steely muscle in a thin package.
>That, and there are a dozen of them, rubbing and squeezing your body pretty much everywhere.
"My my," She croons "Whatever have you been doing? You have so many knots. So tense."
>Well, not everywhere, she seems to be avoiding your crotch for the moment.
>Still, her "massage" feels good, not that you have any experience with such a luxury.
"Most of the girls wouldn't hesitate to pounce on you without so much as getting your name, let alone consent."
>You'd reply, but you were a little preoccupied with all the squeezing along your legs and feet.
>Wait, What?
>Now that you're paying attention again, she's slipped off your boots and socks with her motions.
>Your clothing is also being slowly sliced up by the little blades at the ends of her appendages.
>That, and feels like the filter's clogged on your gas mask...she's producing a cloud of those damned spores.
"Now, I think you silly little mask isn't working, if your thrashing is anything to go by...let's see that cute face."
>Before you can protest, the mask has been neatly sliced off your face, which comes under immediate assault by caressing tentacles.
"You are sooo cute~. What's your name?"
"Wallace,"
>Already a few breaths in and the spores are doing their work, you feel drunk, you feel good, you feel hot.
>There really wasn't much you could do anyhow, and the Tyranid was polite enough to not obliterate your pelvis on sight.
"Aww...that's adorable. All you need to know about me, is that I am yours. All you have to do~oo....is ask."
>Its obvious what she is referring to, she's stripped you down to your boxers
>She could physically force herself on you like the rest of the 'nids, but she doesn't have to.
>It would be as easy as injecting Tyranid brand aphrodisiac into your bloodstream and you'd be all over her.
>Your dick is so hard it hurts, everything feels hot, and she is nice....smells nice...
"Please"
"Don't try holding back, just relax. Resisting won't help you, you're already mi~ne."
>Her mouth tentacles descend on your junk, causing you to lurch.
>Every nerve in your body is played like the strings of an instrument, and she has mastered it.
>You're limp as a wet noodle, and a nap is fully in order, not like you can do anything else.
"SOMEONE HELP!"
>The frak?
>You shift and spot a Guardsman doubled over almost, hands trembling around his crotch.
"IT WON'T STOP SUCKING, IT HURTS!"
"Nurse," you slur, "I need some supplies."
"Oh don't worry, I'll handle this."
>Be Commissar Wolfe
>Be at a command meting in Hive Sydney.
>Be witness to many acts insane and heretical, and somehow actually working.
>Be nursing a cup of recaff ans General Powerstache goes over defense plans.
>Suddenly, the General lurches forward, his mustache bristling.
"What's happening."
>General Powerstache stares out into the distance for a moment while his facial hair makes alarming twitches.
"The penultimate battle approaches, may the Emperor protect us all."

>Be unlucky in love
>You're pretty sure you're cursed
>When you were in high school you went to a buddhist alter on a trip to Japan and prayed that you could get a girl
>You went out with a girl and had sex at her house on the first day
>At first you thought you were lucky
>But you soon woke up naked in a dumpster, and outside you found a laughing fox
>No, not a fox, a kitsune
>"I can't believe you actually fell for the 'sex on the first date' trick!"
>It had been an illusion
>After you realized you had been tricked you were about to chase her, but running around town naked wouldn't be a pretty picture
>After that, shit like that kept happening
>Another girl asks you out and it lasts longer, but you wake up to find that damn fox again
>Then again
>The next girl who asked you out, you ended up yelling at telling the kitsune to leave you alone
>She left in tears, and you heard cackling from behind you
>"Can't believe you let her go! You really are something, aren't you?"
>By college you decided to ask a girl out for once, because you are pretty paranoid that anyone who asks you is that kitsune
>She said yes
>The data was a disaster though
>The restaraunt was slow, something kept kicking her from under the table that you swore wasn't you, and you spilled her drink on her when you went to the bathroom even though your arm wasn't that close to the glass
>She decided against a second date
>And again this happened
>You started getting a reputation for being an awful date, and because you kept turning girls down people started wondering if you were purposefully sabotaging them
>Eventually you just started accepting the dates, and that girl is eventually replaced by a fox every time
>She tells you that no human could ever be with a fox fucker like you, and at this rate you'll either die alone or end up marrying her
>You've given up expecting someone else
>You've accepted love for you will always be a cruel prank made by that thing
>You were sent to be his wife, but you couldn't help yourself
>The first time was supposed to be a joke, a one time thing
>But that face he made when he was disappointed, you loved it
>Whenever you ran off you had to touch herself, you couldn't help but be turned on
>You just wished she could have him make that face and have him afterwards
>The date was wonderful, you loved every moment, but nothing could have topped that face
>A pure hopeful love crushed
>You could have told him that she was sent to be his wife, but she had to see it more and more
>And every time he made it the better it got
>He tried to get other girlfriends, but you fixed that, and it got even better
>Now he's running into your arms even when he should know it's you
>He thinks those kisses are just jokes but he always accepts them because he thinks they are fake
>You've tried to tell him the truth but he calls you a liar when you do
>And he makes that wonderful face
>It's easier and so fulfilling to make him think it's false
>You know it's true, every kiss, every hug, every bite along the nape of his neck, every whisper of affection
>He needs you, he clings to you like a rock in a river that would sweep him away
>His kisses are so sweet, letting out hiccups as you touch him
>You ask if he's okay but he doesn't answer, only holds on tighter
>You lick away his tears and let your hands search him like it's your first time
>But you've felt every crevice, every bump, every piece, and you know it's all yours
>He's so perfectly fragile
>His desires are so pure despite everything
>He gives and gives and you only take it away
>The truth you give to him is not something he can accept
>If he really knew the truth, what would he say?
>What would he do?
>Why are you scared?
>You can always follow him
>He would view your actions more kindly knowing you are a girl in love
>Yet you feel like he'd be angry
>It couldn't hurt him more than you already have
>So why
>Why, why, why do you keep doing it?
>It feels like it would stain him
>Helplessness turned to anger
>He loves you
>But he'd hate you
>But he already hates you
>But he doesn't show it
>But he hopes that you love him
>But he shouldn't love you
>If you loved him he'd hate you
>You're a monster
>A curse placed upon him
>To think he could love you is arrogance of the highest order
>You don't deserve it, and he shouldn't give it to you
>He clings to you in fear if what you've brought on him
>A fear of being alone
>But it's better he shake in fear than shake in fury
>That would ruin the purity
>Anger is ugly, terrible, not worthy of tainting his face
>So please/\esrow si tahW
>Stay pure and sweet/\lufituaeb si hcihw taht tniat oT

Human males are horrible for unit cohesion. We shouldn't be letting them mix with Anthro units at all, because it always results in is girls fighting over humies. Plus they're weaker, can't carry as much gear, resulting in other members of the unit having to pick up the slack, and they have to use dinky little intermediate caliber weapons that are a logistical nightmare because now you're throwing 2 to 3 completely new calibers in to the supply chain. The only role humans have is in human only units or as comfort boys.

>draft requirements are adjusted to allow for less physically capable humans
>assigned as comfort boys to anthro squads
>morale goes up, squad performance improves as they all have a tangible and immediate goal to fight for
>strict penalties and possibly dishonorable discharge for anyone that abuses or breaks the boys
it could work out

But then they become prime elimination targets for the enemy to reduce morale.

So a concept:
Anthros can only make babies with their own kind: canines with canines, felids with felids, etc. The more specialized/niche/rare the anthro breed, the harder it is for them to find a mate, and thus the harder it is to make babies and have a family and continue the species.
There is an exception to this though: humans. For whatever reason, and against all scientific laws of nature, humans can impregnate/be impregnated by any anthro species. In the case of male humans, they can impregnate any female anthro and the babies will be of the same species as the mother. Female humans can be impregnated by any anthro, and the babies will be of the same species as the father. Humans only breed true with themselves.
There'd be a lot of intrest in humans from the rare species that need to keep their numbers up in the face of overwhelming felid and canine numbers. Humans would also be encouraged to have many children of their own, in the hopes those children would eventually bear/sire some anthro offspring. Polyamourous families might be not uncommon, with multiple parents raising anthro and human siblings side by side.
Of course, there'd be haters and racists. People who say an anthro can't be "pure" if they have a human parent. Rumors and stereotypes. Could be an interesting place.

Ferret NEET Story
>Month 1
>You only missed a day of work, your two days off coming right after the one you skipped
>Because of her
>She had started calling out to you, talking through the vent
>"Hey, I have some extra buttery popcorn and put on a movie, want to stop by?"
>"I made too much Oyakodon for dinner! You can come over if you like!"
>She even started singing to you anytime she hears you shower
>"Hey, you alright man?"
>You blink and look to your coworker, a 30-something jerboa with a big set of buck-teeth
>"Yeah, sorry Gordo." You yawn and stretch. "I'm thinking I need to switch to night shift."
>He snickers. "Oh yeah? Why's that."
>"I have this neighbor, things started great, she was quiet-" You're elided by a laugh from Gordon
>"She! Oh man, lemme guess... A lemur chick! No, no." He rubs his chin, grinning. "Maybe a goat?"
>"It's not funny man, your fairer sex is absolutely demented!" With a sigh, you continue. "She's a ferret. And things were great! But then she got kind of creepy, and, uh..."
>Gordon's face fell as you continued talking
>"Gordo. What's up? You're freaking me out here."
>He won't look at you anymore
>"Uh." He finally starts. "That's no good. If she's taken a shine to you, I mean."
>It feels like there is no blood in your body
>You hear a bell ringing somewhere
>"Gordon. Spit it out." The words come out almost garbled, saliva solidifying to wallpaper paste
>"Ferrets are induced ovulators. You put her in heat." His eyes meet yours, damp, sparkling
>"If ferret women don't mate they'll die dude. Heat kills them."
>The two of you just stand there, silent but for the sound of the clock on the wall
>Month 2
>"...so we'll see what the manager says as this month ends." Gordon speaks pensively around a mouthful of cornichon
>"But they'll hold the job for me?" You sit back in your chair. "That's a relief."
>"Business is so slow I'm sure they'll be glad someone volunteered." He winks. "I'll talk to HR, make sure you get gubment dollars. Speaking of-"
>"Her? Nothing happened yet." You sigh. "I should at least talk to her."
>"You should at least learn her name." Gordon snorts, waving for the bill.
>"I know her name!" You say sharply. You can't tell who it surprised more, you coworker or yourself. "It's Dahlia. I-I heard it through the vents."
>He looks you over, concerned. "You're spying on your horny neighbor through a vent? I got this, company card."
>"Thanks. And it's not like that. She spells it out loud every time she names her player character."
>"And I suppose she yells it? No way you're actually getting up there to listen through the vent, hmmm?" Gordon chuckles, then his whiskers droop. "C'mon, let's get back home, it's getting dark."
>The low rumble of Gordon's truck disappearing into the distance, you climb the stairs to your apartment
>'Well,' you think to yourself, 'Time to finish my part in all this.'
>'Maybe I can let her down easy. There's medical treatments and other ways to end a heat.' Your brown furrows. 'I can barely afford a shitty apartment! I can't deal with kids.'
>'On top of that, now I'm unemployed, a-" Your thoughts scatter as you round the corner and come face to face with Dahlia
>Like a coiled spring she leaps, your center of balance vanishing as she wraps you in a vice grip
>A glimpse of gleaming eyes meets yours before she buries her face in your neck, moaning and taking deep whiffs of your scent
>She's impossibly strong for someone so scrawny, your heartbeat frenzied as a shaky paw struggles to undo your pants
>"Oh god, help!" Her other paw snakes up your back, grabbing your neck before she silences you with a kiss
>
>Thoughts cease to flow as her tongue explores the insides of your mouth, greedily intertwining with yours and pulling back again in a teasing dance
>The paw now in your pants deftly tears at the seams of your underwear, shredding her way through to the prize underneath
>Dahlia's breath catches in her throat as her velveteen fingers wrap their way around your cock, sliding to the base and massaging your balls with two fingers
>Her entire body trembles against you, eyes that once gleamed with predatory focus now look glassy and dazed as she brings her other hand down to play with you more
>'I won't get another chance.' The thought comes, echoes in your head
>In a surge of panic you push her off of you, Dahlia landing heavily on her side
>Your tattered underwear still in her grip, you watch as the ferret girls eyes clear and widen, before filling with tears
>Springing to her feet she takes off down the hallway, scrambling to her apartment with muffled sobs before disappearing behind the slam of a door
>"Shit!" Staggering to your feet, you hurriedly adjust your pants and run to her door, pounding on it. "Dahlia! We need to talk!"
>You can't hear a thing
>Fingerprint lock, lights on, grabbing the stepladder
>"Dahlia," you call into the vent hoarsely, "Dahlia please, I'm sorry if I hurt you. Can we talk?" No response. "Dahlia!"
>Pressing your ear to the vent, you wait for a reply
>Instead, you're greeted by whispered moans and ragged, drawn breaths, and finally
>"Say my name. Again." You gulp, the soft sound of paw pads rubbing her wet mons coming into focus
>As you hesitate, the crystallization of so many moments in life float through your mind; the rubicon, stretched before you
>Fated desire flares through your body
>Cast the die and damn the consequences
>"Dahlia." The name flows from your lips like cool water, a weight being lifted
>Again and again you call to her, Dahlia softly crying out in the throes of orgasm and together lapsing into mutual silence
Month 3
>You don't even flinch as the mail slot clatters open and letters fall to the floor, your forehead pressed to the wallpaper
>It's been over a week since you last heard from her
>Three weeks total now since the incident in the hallway
>You take a deep breath before the grate, then speak in a clear but gentle voice
>"Dahlia, I know you're in there." Your phone buzzes on the table. "Please answer me."
>The prior weeks she could at least be heard moving about furitively, pleasuring herself at all times of the day
>Sometimes strange thumping sounds next door, or soft squeaking from the vent would propel you there, pleading with Dahlia to just speak with you for a moment
>But there remained no answer, no questions, no offers for you to come over
>The roar of your shower feels deafening now without her chirping songs
>You climb down from the stepladder, now a permanent fixture in your home, and check your phone alerts
>Unemployment confirmation and subscription cancellation emails, missed calls from 800 numbers and telemarketers, and a text message from Gordo
>(still coming down to the bar? got ur usual already n its getting warm)
>Fuck, you'd forgotten completely
>How many hours had passed, staring into the void behind those metal bars?
>(omw)
>Placing an ear to the wall of the hallway, you still hear nothing on the other side
>With a pit in your stomach, you make your way out into the daylight
>
>"So that was that. Since then she's definitely been doing something though. I hear this kind of soft thudding sometimes? Maybe she's building something."
>The Jerboa sat with you at the bar, swirling the dregs of beer around his glass as you recounted the assault and sucking his teeth as you postulated on her potential schemes
>"And in the past few weeks, all kinds of packages are showing up to her house. More than usual, I mean."
>"Mmm, yes, of course! No one orders things through the mail except the criminally insane!" He levels you with a flat gaze. "I don't think the prison system is ready for her."
>"Never mind." You groan. "Just tell me what to do."
>"What?! What the fuck are you talking about?" Gordon pulls his ears down over his head, incredulous. "You make a fucking choice!"
>He swivels in his chair to face you, incensed
>"One, you can call 911, get her hospitalized and forcibly administered medicine to artificially end her heat." He's almost snarling now. "
>"Two, you can nut up and help her yourself."
>"Three, you can keep lounging around waiting for her to die." He rolls his eyes. "Hmm, a torture, a death, or accepting someone who loves you, tough call."
>"Dahlia won't die, doctors say masturbating delays mortality effectively in most cases." You receive a disgusted noise in reply. "What now?"
>"So, you're still spying on her? This girl is suffering and in danger and for months on end you won't do anything but peep on her." Gordon quickly tosses some cash on the counter
>"You're playing some kind of sick fucking game and acting like the victim the whole time, and I'm tired of it. One, two, or three." He leaves as the bartender scoops up the payment. "Walk home."
~
>You trudge up the stairs unevenly, having stayed for another two or three drinks after being scolded by your supposed best friend
>'Three options. I'm gonna figure out my own option.' You think, making your way into your apartment. 'I'll sleep on it and then call Gordon and fix all this dumb shit.'
>You hang up your jacket and take a deep breath
>Your apartment feels... stuffy
>'This building is a sty, it's always like this.' You tell yourself, inhaling deeply
>But that's not it this time
>Everything smells musty and sweet, like overripe apricots
>'No. What is that?' You walk around, sniffing the air for a moment, then freeze
>Your eyes glide to the vent, and for what feels like a small eternity you just stare at it
>Boarding the stepladder, you climb up and peer in between the slats to see the same pitch blackness as always greeting your eyes
>You also note a little tiny bit of fuzz at the bottom of one of the openings
>Pinching at it with your fingers, you pull it up to your face and inspect the papery black fibers
>"The fuck?" Jumping down, you run to the kitchen and grab a butter knife
>One softly squeaking screw at a time, you remove and place each one securely in your pocket before finally prying off the grate
>You're met with a black sheet of cardstock
>
>Baffled, you pull at its edges only for it to easily pop free as an avalanche of cloth falls to the ground in an array of colors
>Astonished, you reach into the vent and pull out a fistful of panties
>That pungent and sweet aroma suddenly becomes completely overpowering
>Your head swims as you dismount your perch, falling to your hands and knees
>The air feels even thicker at the ground level, pressure rising in your temples
>Your erection throbs to the beat of your heart, straining against your pants as your olfactory senses are completely overwhelmed
>'No. No. No.' You panic and lift up the couch cushions, trying to stuff as many pairs of underwear underneath it as possible
>"Shit!" Your expletive comes out slurred as you crawl around, your brain struggling to maintain your balance, much less concoct any kind of plan
>Unbidden, your arms falter and you go face down in a pile of the well-worn fabrics, a shuddering groan escaping your lips
>Cock oozing pre-cum like a leaky faucet, your last few vestiges of strength go towards feebly humping the floor
>Your drunken brain is swimming with endorphins, delirious
>You don't even feel sure that you're even breathing oxygen now
>'I'll sleep on it.' You decide to yourself, gathering the remaining panties under your head as a pillow. 'I'll sleep on all of this stuff.'
>As you slumber, a series of screws is removed from the other side of the vent, one last time
>Awakened by the low buzz of your cell phone ringing on vibrate, you allow yourself a satisfied sigh
>Cinching your eyes further shut, you nestle your back deeper into your mattress
>'Must have moved into bed last night.' You think with a smile, the sun already coming brightly through your white curtains
>You'll see who was calling later you decide, realizing with glee you didn't even get a hangover from the... four drinks you had?
>You stretch your legs, feeling them tingle as you try to recall the other evening
>A breeze rolls across your body, making you shiver
>An attempt to reach down and pull up the covers is foiled, your arm, both arms, stuck
>In a moment of cold fear, you take a deep breath
>Your eyes open
>It's her
>Dahlia stands at the edge of your bed, nude but for a garter belt fashioned of tattered cotton
>It's underwear that she tore from your body weeks before, you realize as your eyes focus
>Her body is lithe and athletic, you can easily see now how she was able to wrap you up with a single arm
>Her breasts are surprisingly pert, too often hidden under baggy t-shirts and hoodies they now rise and fall evenly with her breathing
>Turning to look, you see both of your arms expertly bound to the posts of your bed, nearly painless yet totally unyielding
>Two free slipknot loops hang from the fiber "handcuffs" restraining your wrists
>Wordlessly, she steps to the foot of your bed
>"Dahlia." It feels like you're underwater as she climbs onto the bed. "Whatever you're planning, it doesn't have to be like this."
>You gasp as she grabs your ankle and cranks your leg upwards, perpendicular to your body, bending your knee with the back of a paw
>She slides your foot through the loop by your wrist before tightening it, and doing the same to the other side
>Now she sits, knees-folded beneath her at the base of the bed
>You are locked in a full-nelson position, absolutely nothing hidden from her eyes as they wander across your body
>She smiles. "My gods, you're even more beautiful than I could have imagined."
>Leaning over the edge of the bed, she reaches down for a moment, then comes back up with medical tape and an egg vibrator
>Placing them to the side, she cradles your sensitive gonads with a little chirp of delight
>Dahlia leans over and places a delicate kiss on your nuts, her whiskers tickling your already throbbing member
>"Ahhhhh." Opening her mouth, the ferret girl lets a little trail of drool fall from her tongue to the base of your shaft before licking along its length like a popsicle
>Nudging her nose against your taint, she breaths hard before sucking one of your balls into her mouth, then releasing it with a lewd -Pop-
>She ends her ministrations with a single kiss to the swollen head of your cock. "Are you going to give me what I want?"
>Holding the egg vibrator in place, she deftly sticks the end of the medical tape onto it before wrapping the rest of the length around your sack
>You gasp as she sets it to low, the vibrations running through your penis, little beads of pre-cum starting to form as you whimper
>The bedsprings creak as she crawls about the mattress, turning tail and spreading her cheeks to show off as she cranes her head back to watch you
>"You like that?" Her pink pussy is drooling by this point, and she rocks her body back to rub her slit against the underside of your shaft. "You like to watch, don't you. I know. I can feel your excitement."
>Standing up, she breaks into a squat and begins to sink the very tip of your cock in, watching you over her shoulder while rocking her hips
>"Now," Dahlia's fluffy tail trails a figure eight on your chest, "I have you."
>In a single swift motion she slams her taut derriere down, enveloping your cock with a scream of animal pleasure
>She tries to lift herself into a squat, but her legs turn to jelly as her taut ass drops back down onto your folded body
>Thighs pressed aside by her ample cheeks, her moans become more insistent as she grinds her clitoris against your buzzing balls
>"F-fuck, oh yes." Dahlia's strength returns, her bucking motions fed by her desire to milk your body dry. "Isn't this better? Isn't this how it should be?"
>Her striped tail lands right across your chest and face, sopping up sticky love juices that trail their way down your folded-over abdomen
>"C'mon." Dahlia huffs, a paw drawing to her belly and rubbing her womb. "Please, make me a mommy, give me that thick cum you made for me."
>You can feel her climax approaching, the her wet walls constricting in ever quicker rhythms, her fertile body seeking to milk you for all you've got
>"W-wait." Your breathing halts with every smack of her hips as she rides you ferociously
>"I w-want yo-ou to -Ah!- look at me."
>Dahlia freezes, hilted on your mere-moments-from-climax-cock
>She falls to her hands and knees on the bed and dismounts your cock with a frustrated huff, then turns to kneel before you
>You lock eyes with Dahlia, the gleam you saw before now inspiring you to fight, not against, but for her
>"I want to watch you bear my child." You say, rocking your body to settle in better against the mattress and swinging your cock back and forth. "Please. Mount me."
>Her pupils appear to physically pulse and dilate, locked onto yours
>Unblinking, she stands on the bed and steps forward, her feet coming to place on either side of your torso
>You can't look away, her expressionless face making you question your decision to speak out at all
>Crouching down, Dahlia pushes your cock against your belly as she comes to sit on your hips
>Letting go, it springs up and strikes her pussy lips with a soft smack, a gleeful shiver passing through Dahlia's body
>"Is this true?" Gently, she begins sliding up and down, grinding herself along your length. "Or are you just trying to hurt me again."
>"Yes!" You gasp, as Dahlia turns the egg vibrator up to medium, then back down again. It almost comes out as a sob. "I do, I'm obsessed!"
>She cranks the vibe even higher, the ferret girl griping your calves so hard her claws dig in as she goes back to teasing your tip. "I don't believe you. What changed?"
>Your brain and body ache for release, for the absolution that only Dahlia can give you now
>"I missed you!" She flutters the throttle on the vibe, your voice cracking. "I missed you singing to me in the shower, your invitations.
>"Those nights, I'd listen at the vent, hear you cumming. It made me crazy." Your heart thuds like you're running a marathon. "I wanted to be there, with you."
>"I can't leave, I'd never forgive myself." You swallow hard around the lump in your throat. "I'd never be able to live with myself if I abandoned you. I was confused for so long."
>"I give in. I want to be wanted." Frozen in place, you'd swear Dahlia isn't even breathing. "I want your love. I want Dahlia."
>A paw slaps down onto your chest, Dahlia centering her weight directly over your dick before bringing her face to meet yours.
>"That's all you ever had to say." Her eyes swim with tears and yet she smiles like the sun
>Dahlia's legs muscles ripple as she squats with agonizing slowness, taking you bit by bit until your hips firmly meet
>-Slap- -Slap- -Slap-
>Again, and again and again, her motions becoming more fluid as she begins making pleasured chirps with every pump
>She grabs a fistful of your hair and leans in to kiss you, your body restless for the taste of her lips (like a drug) as you strain forward to meet her halfway
>Her mouth tastes like nectar to your foggy mind, drinking her in like wine as a hummed moan sticks in your throat
>Dahlia sucks on the end of your tongue before breaking the kiss, a string of drool connecting you then falling away
>Grinding forward and back, she lets out a tinkling laugh of delight as the mini vibe bumps and buzzes against her cute little rear
>"Hn! I'm guh-! I'm gonna cum!" Her voice has gotten breathy and high, and she suddenly grabs your bound hands in hers
>Feeling your body tense, you thrust back as much as you can and hear Dahlia's breathing go ragged as she climaxes, a low moan coming unbidden as you finally approach release
>The first thick bout of seed jolts her back into orgasm, she almost crushes your hands as she squeezes to the beat of each shot of your cum
>It almost feels unending, white jism already pooling back out of her, running down your thighs and ass
>"Mmm." Dahlia rolls her hips in a small circle before allowing your softening cock to plop free, lazily scooping your cum back into her needy snatch. "You have five minutes, then we go again."
>"Okay, just one request?" You nod at the egg vibrator. "TURN IT OFF GODS PLEASE TURN IT OFF."
>"Ah!" You kick feebly against your captor as she laps at your pecker again
>"You set the five minute breaks, at least abide by them!" You take a moment to stretch your legs, glad they were untied by attempt 3. "I'm still sensitive."
>"Tch. We've only gone four times so far, and the second and third times you were ready again in well under that." She smiles darkly. "I can always get the prostate stimulators."
>She giggles seeing your visible horror. "I'm kidding. Mostly."
>"Maybe a break is in order." She sighs
>Getting up from the bed she inspects the matted fur around her thighs and pelvis
>"Bathroom is-" "Off to the right, I know." Dahlia interrupts, the soft pad of her feet on the floor fading. "It's a mirror layout to my room."
>Scooching your way up the bed, you rotate your arms and try to soothe your shoulders before calling out. "Hey, can we lose these hand restraints next? My wrists are k-"
>-Thud thud thud-
>"Yo, it's Gordon!"
>
>-Thud thud thud-
>"Look, I felt bad, and uh, thought maybe you'd handle this whole thing better with some support? Look, I heard you in there dude."
>You look to the hallway and see Dahlia, eyes wide, body tense
>"Yeah, I'm here." You swallow hard, your eyes never straying from her. "But you're a little late. Option 2."
>"Oh. Ohhhhhhhhhhh! Hey, wuh, well great!" You hear shuffling from the other side of the door. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything, and I'll see you at work!"
>You close your eyes and sigh deeply as you hear Gordon leave, chuckling to himself as he departs
>You look back to Dahlia, just now seeing the pair of gleaming scissors clutched in her hand
>"Uh." Your mouth dries as she steps up to the bed, still clutching the implement like an ice pick. "Dahlia. My hands."
>"Who was that." She asks, flatly.
>"Gordon," you croak, "we work together, he was just checking in on me."
>"You won't need him to do that anymore." Dahlia deftly threads her fingers through the scissor loops parts the blades. "Be truthful. What terrible things did you tell him about me."
>"Nothing!" Dahlia trails her pawpads down your stomach to the base of your shaft, encouraging it to swell. "I-I kept trying to tell him you were obsessed with me and he never believed it!"
>"And why not?" Kneeling on your thighs, she leans in close, her face filling your vision. "What made you unworthy of your friend's trust?"
>"My obsession!" You roar the words, icy fear spurring you onward. "I burn for you! Spying and filling my time with your life felt so good, oh gods. It's all I need."
>"Well then," crawling up your torso, you see the flash of the scissors before your face
>-snkt- -snkt-
>You rub your wrists as Dahlia parts her legs wide and prepares to mount you again
>"Come serve your purpose."

Epilogue

I'm calling the police.

Do it.
I will!

don't bother
>you croak, as panther girl nods to you
He know's whats up
>she chuckles, then walks out in to the street, quickly jogging again as if nothing had happened at all
Hey!
>Your gf yells after her, attempting to stop her but unwilling to leave her side

i'm so sorry...
>then she starts bawling again

>the desk seargent looks bored
>his look changes somewhat, as you two walk in
> your girlfriend wants to do the talking, but there are a couple of guys in here, lounging around so you put your hand on your arm to stop her.
> you approach the desk sargeant
Good Evening. How may I help you?
I... can I talk to someone somewhere more private?
> The desk sargeant gives you a weird look.
Uh. Yeah, sure. It would help if I knew what this was about though.
I'd rather not tell in public.
>his eyes flicker between you and your gf, who stands behind you with her arms crossed. She's mildly annoyed that you wouldn't let her do this for you.
You're going to have to give me something so I can get you the right colleague to talk to.
>you swallow
I was... assaulted.
>he raises an eyebrow.
and you can't talk to me about this here because...
>you want to go home so badly. Nothing feels more emasculating than telling someone that you got raped.
>you turn to your gf, who gibes you a 'go on' look.
I can't. Please?
>He frowns, than slides his chair backwards in to the corridor on the other side of the protective glass.
I'll be right back.
>you turn to your gf, who closes the distance.
You should have told him about the -
>You stop her mid sentence. Not in a room full of guys, that would be absolutely humiliating.
I'll talk to them. Okay?
>she seems to disapprove and quietly whispers to you
All of these people here, they probably are here because, like, their bike got stolen or they lost their pet or dumb shit like that but you're here because you were fucking raped and -
>the door leading in to the station opens and blond woman looks through the door, accompanied by the desk sargeant who waves you over.
>You cut your gf off, having internally cringed as she said the r-word.
Hi. I'm detective Christensen. You had something you want to talk about?
>you nod and walk through the door she holds open.
You good?
>She smiles and responds to the desk sargeant.
Thanks, Harry. We'll be at my desk. And who might you be?
>Your gf stops, seemingly pissy that this isn't immediatly obvious.
I'm his Girlfriend.
Alright.
>Instant animosity. Great.
>the two of you follow her through the small station in to a room with just one desk in it.
You're lucky i'm working late today. Anyway. Coffee, tea?
>your gf softly prods you and quietly repeats the question.
tea?
>you nod. Tea seems nice. Internally, you're quite happy that you're not talking to a dude.
Both of you?
> your gf nods as well.
Alright, i'll get the water boiling. Both of you can sit down in front of my desk and we'll start in a minute.
>Detective Christensen starts boiling water, fixes herself another cup of coffee and sets out mugs with teabags in them, then sits down in her chair, produces a notepad and a pen and clicks it.
why don't we start with who you are.
>you answer her questions as she methodically asks for your info.
>she also takes down your gf's info
Why don't you tell me what you were doing before the assault.
it wasn't assault, it was rape.
>your gf immediatly jumps the gun
>Detective christensen comes a lot more lively almost immediately.
You were raped?
No, he was.
>that gets you a raised eye brow, as you try to disappear in to the chair you're on.
You were raped? What did he look like?
>You just let your gf do the talking at this point and focus on the pens in a cup on Christensen's desk.
It was a woman. A black panther chimera.
>Christensen's eyebrow is raised significantly, as she looks at you.
>you mumble a confirmation, as christensen starts writing while your gf tells the whole story.
>slowly but steadily, christensens enthusiasm wanes until all that is left is a frown.
So you two were fighting her off, but she still managed to do what she wanted?
Yes!
>your gf seemingly has become quite irritated and impatient.
>Christensen looks at you, while you cling on to the mug of tea that she got you earlier.
Jenna, right? Would you mind leaving me alone with anon for a second?
Wha-
Just a minute or two. You can sit outside.
>your girlfriend snaps her mouth shut. She seems severily irritated now and leaves in a huff.
>christensen shuts the door behind her and then turns to you.
Can you recount the entire thing for me, with your own words, please?
>you do, and you notice that the detective is making no notes whatsoever, instead piercing you with her gaze.
>the ask a few clarifying questions, but not many, culminating in the final one
Did you cum?
>you mumble something.
I ask again. Did you have an orgasm?
well... yes
>something seems to close in the detectives eyes.
>She exhales, then inhales loudly.
Alright, here is what I think happened: You know that girl. This was supposed to be some fetish thing after you dropped your girl outside off. Maybe this is the new way to end relationships among you kids. Whatever.
I don't care. I don't believe this was rape for one second. Know how I do? I have rape cases in here every month. The guy just overpowered the girl and yhe slumps there just like you do, telling me the story of how she got taken. Overpowered. You know how many stories to the contrary i hear, a girl overpowering a guy? very fucking few.
Know how many stories I hear of a guy and a girl getting overpowered by a single woman? zilch. Never happens. Wanna know why? Because it's impossible.
Which means you're full of shit. I'm one hundred percent certain that you could have fought your way out if you'd wanted to.
So i'm not going to do anything.
What I am going to do is I am going to set your girl straight.
>She punched the intercom.
Harry, one of my two is done, can you escort him out?
>the intercom responded
Lenny will be with you in a sec.
Thanks.
>she turned to you again.
Send your girl back in on your way out.
>Wondering how this could have gotten any worse, you leave the room and an officer waits for you.
>You motion Jenna back inside with your eyes as the officer escorts you through the station and back out, to the desk sargeant.
>It doesn't take much longer for your furious girlfriend to storm out of the station.
>She grabs you and pulls you out of the building, responding to a
good evening!
>by a guy next to the door with
Fuck you too!
>She's absolutely brimming with rage.
They don't fucking believe us. Can you imagine that? I told her all about this and she doesn't fucking believe its real. She tried to tell me that you were cheating on me. What the fuck is wrong with these people?
>A ball of fiery rage dripping tears of pure anger drags you along to her place, so easily visible that even the half naked retards usually hollering at girls try and disappear in to the streets.
>it lasts until you arrive at her place. There, she collapses and weeps like a waterfountain, clinging on to you, sobbing how sorry she was over and over again.
>you feel dirty
>there is crusty stuff all over your dick.
>You have this overwhelming need to go clean yourself
Jenna,
>as you say her name, she immediatly looks up at you
I need a shower
>she comes around a little, smiling through her tears
o-of course.
>She pushes you in to the direction of the shower, still weeping.
>You stumble your way in and slowly take your clothes off, then get hot watwr going and start slowly washing your body, then more aggressively scrubbing yourself down until jenna interrupts you.
How are you doing?
>The shower has gone cold and you've frozen with your dick in hand, red as a lobster, using one of her scrubbers on it.
>You can see her behind the shower curtain, peeking in through the slightly ajar bathroom door.
>You are struck by the sudden fear that she might see this as odd
Jenna, do you believe me?
>She walks in to the bathroom, then pulls the shower curtain aside.
>Your eyes meet and she searches yours
I do. I was there, honey.
>Her tears are flowing again.
>She shuts off the water, then stands on her toes to hug you.
>After a long time, she lets go, pushing back against your embrace of her and takes the scrubber and shampoo out of your hands, then leads you out and wraps you in a towel.
>You're feeling better, now that you're squeaky clean.
>gradually, you take Jenna in to your arms and you hold each other again for a while, during which you finally crack and tear up, not even entirely sure what about.
>after a while, you both just go to bed.
>You curl up and for the first time ever, you can feel Jenna holding you.
>Next day, you spend a few hours sulking until you realize that it won't help. Jenna asks you to see a psychiatrist, but you're not feeling like discussing the matter further, instead opting to bury it deeper.
>After breakfast, you decide to go home. >Jenna had an appointment with friends of hers and you don't see the point of being in an appartment that isn't filled with your stuff.
>On your way home, you pass a gun store and decide there and then that this was the last time that anyone got to fuck with you physically without repercussions.
>You walk in...
>... and leave without a pistol.
>But you do have an order for a CCP pistol for your noodly arms and signed up for a CCW course, and also brought an AR with you.
>You walk home, feeling a lot better, as if you finally have control again.
>Control is back. Your mancard got reissued.
>it wasn't cheap, but it was worth it. >Nothing says fuck off like a military style assault weapon.
>At night, Jenna stops by your place. While she isn't happy about your purchase, she is understanding and having her around is comforting.
>Over the next few days, your CCW course starts, you spend evenings at your local community college, making sure that you walk in groups or in brightly lit areas if you have to and you went back to work without missing a day.
>everything seems to be getting back to normal and fiddling with your guns has made you a lot more self confident.
>the next chimera to try something will get some.
>you have a random afternoon after you got off work, before you go down to your local college for your CCW class as your doorbell unexpectedly rings.
>You're not expecting anyone tonight.
>You go to answer the intercom, but there is no answer as you cautiosly say
hello?
>instead, there is a light knock on the door.
>you open the spy glass and peer through.
>you see the empty corridor and reach for your AR, quitly racking one in to the chamber.
>a black furry paw comes in to view
>you tense up, but the paw is holding something for you to see.
>its a stick with a double oval outline, off white, with a pink tip on one side and a tiny window - shwoing two lines.
>You can hear her talk through the door.
We need to talk!
>You don't feel like talking at all.
Go away!
>she shows her face in the door spy
We can talk through the door and keep your neighbours entertained, or you can let me in!
>no fucking chance.
Fuck off!
Alright, I'm suing for alimony!
>oh fuck.
>alimony? In this state?
>ohjeezohfuck
>you'd be turbofucked
>Wait, wouldn't she be admitting she raped you?
How are you going to argue in court that I have to pay for kids I did not willingly conceive?
>her hand moves away form the door spy and you can see her face for the first time. It's not even nearly as frightening as you remember it.
Can you just open your door and we can talk about this somewhat in private? Otherwise I'm just gonna drop this in your girlfriend's letter box.
>ohshitohfuggohjeez
>You really don't want to open the door, despite feeling secure with your new aqcuisitions from a few days ago.
>But maybe you can talk about this with one of them trained on her.
>you quickly think through your options. If you open the door, you can't have both of your hands on the rifle and you could be overwhelmed.
>So you have to open the door and step away quickly, out of arm's reach.
>but then, what if someone passes by?
>They'd surely do something about a chimera in a doorway with a dude in the flat aiming a rifle at them.
>So you have to be out of sight.
>your apartment is somehwat shaped like a hotel room, the the left of the front door is the bathroom, beyond which the room opens up in to the kitchenette on the right and your living room where the bed in a hotel would normally be. Your bedroom is to the far left.
>The smart move would be to unlatch the door, immediately retreat out of the hall in to the living room and move left, hiding behind the wall there, out of arms reach.
>but wait. what if she snatches one of them out of your hands and turns it against you?
>dread of loss of power flows through you again and you quickly look around for your pistol and it's holster, but they're in the living room.
Wait, please!
>You check the spyglass on more time and expect to see a frown and folded arms, instead she's looking down the corridor, seemingly at a state of total ease.
>You run back in to the living room, slide the holster in to your jeans, then the gun in to the holster.
>oh wait, load one.
>You quietly chamber a round
>then slide the gun in to the holster.
>sufficiently prepared, you return to the door and execute your plan.
>handle push, pull and jump backwards a few paces, beyoned the corner of the bathroom and a few paces more, then a quick 180 and guns up.
Helloooo?
>You hear the door being pushed open.
Just come in and walk in to the living room.
>steps are moving through the hallway as you remember rule #1 of firearms just before they reach the corner: Never point a gun at something you don't immediately intend to shoot.
>you don't relax your deathgrip one bit as you pull the muzzle from headheight down to 45 degrees, just as she walks in to the living room, looking in the direction of the kitchen.
I'm here.
>she turns around and freezes, eyes wide.
Is that a real...
>as she trails off, you nod.
ooo...kay.
>well, this is going a lot better than you expected.
Did you shut the door?
>she shakes her head very carefully.
No.
>You point to the couch, facing away from the hallway.
Sit down, if you want to talk.
>you keep your eyes on her as she moves over to the couch, allowing you to move in to the hallway walking backwards while keeping out of reach.
>as you reach the door, she sits down on the couch, hands out of sight.
>Her posture is straight as a rod, looking in your direction.
>the door shuts with a click.
I guess i got lucky that night, eh?
>She seems to be trying to break the ice.
>You walk back in to the living room
What do you mean?
I mean, wouldn't you have shot me?
>You think about it. Yeah. Absolutely.
>Given the choice, just straight up shooting her to save you all the trouble would have been better.
I guess.
>You continue moving, carefully staying out of reach until you can sit down at one end of the other couch in your living room.

Jenna story

Is that a threat?

>keeping your eyes on her, you pulled it out of your pants and saw out of the corner of your eyes that it was jenna.
Hey.
>you don't even wait for jenna to answer and cut her off midsentence
She's here.
>jenna takes a second to understand what you're saying.
She? who- WHAT?! WHERE?
>Well, here. duh.
Here. My place.
>You should have seen the explosion that followed coming, but the intensity still surprised you.
YOU LET HER IN? WHAT IN THE FUCK?
>that was uncalled for. you've got the situation somewhat under control. For now. You have all the guns.
I have her at gunpoint.
>You look at the woman in front of you. For a rapist, she makes a surprisingly sympathetic face as Jenna exploded on the phone.
I'm coming over. DON'T. MOVE.
>you put the phone down beside you as Jenna hung up the phone without even saying goodbye.
>you put the phone down next to you, gripping the handguard of your rifle again.
>You sit in silence a few seconds until she seems to have become seriously uncomfortable with it.
Does she always scream at you like that?
>As you look your former assailant in the eye, you instantly deflect.
No.
>then something occurs to you.
How do you know where I live?
>She shrugs apologetically.
We live in the same building...
>Wait, she was stalking you?
... I saw you coming home yesterday.
>well, that doesn't mean she isn't a stalker.
Are you stalking me as well?
>she looks you directly in the eyes.
No.
>she still seems uncomfortable with the subject.
>Wait, she lives in the same building? Above or below? How the fuck are you supposed to get out of the building from now on?
>what if you stand in an elevator and she comes in?
>Your CCL is still a few days off, you can't carry your CCP yet
>You could just walk the stairs instead
>but no one uses the stairs
>And if she were to find out you were using the stairs, behind those heavy fire proof doors, no one would hear what goes on in there
>She could literally just wait for you there.
>Well, you could always... abseil form the balcony? Climb down the fire escape?
What's your name?
>Her question drags you out of your reverie.
You... don't know my name?
>she folds her hands, playing with her thumbs, giving the impression of needing to occupy her fingers somehow.
No, I mean, I know your last name because of the plate at the door, but what's your first name? I mean, you're gonna be a dad one way or another and I'd like to be able to give the kids your name, you know?
>That's an awfully long explanation. Which you would have noticed, if it weren't for the fact that she just brought another issue back to the forefront of your mind:
>You're gonna be a babydaddy.
>jeez,rick.morty
>What's her name, anyway?
I'm anon. What's your name?
My name is Megan. Megan Riley. Nice to meet you...
>She extends her hand over the coffee table, but you just raise your eyebrow, stalling her efforts to cheer up the mood immediatly with no chance for recovery.
Uh. Yeah. So, have you talked to anyone about anything and ...what's with the guns?
>Her hand falls back in to her lap and she seems a tad nervous.
>You figure you can let her suffer a little.
Yeah, i've talked to a detective.
>she starts fiddling with her hands again, then furrows her eyebrows and leans back in to the couch.
Bu-u-u-ut they didn't actually care. I mean, I'm sitting here, free.
>It doesn't feel like you should stop pressing the advantage here.
Until now, I didn't know where you lived, nor your name.
>She's still leaning back in to the couch, but her eyes open as if she realized she had just dun goofed.
>Then they narrow again as she comes to another conclusion.
But you aren't even calling the police about me being here. You know, to get me arrested.
>Fuck. That didn't last long.
>you fumble some answer about pregnancy, but she doesn't even believe you for a second, hell, in retrospect, you wouldn't have either.
So did they not believe you or did they just not care?
>You feel like an offensive player on a defense play. Absolutely not comfortable and wanting to be anywhere but here.
What does it matter to you?
>She attempts to push herself out of the couch.
So if i were to do it again...
>Your raise your rifle at lightning speed, clicking off the safety, pointing it directly between her eyes.
You'd die.
>You feel like a fucking action star as she freezes mid motion, absolutely still, eyes widening. The rifle slid in to your should like it was made to be there, pointing unwavering, solid like a rock staright in to her face.
>She swallows.
>apparently it came across as sincere as it was meant.
That's what the guns are for, by the way. Sit back down, please.
>With that, you feel secure again. You have control over this situation. Your mancard was resissued, remember? What the fuck do you need cops for right now?
>This actually feels really fucking good. You should have listened to your crazy guntoting uncle with those machine guns much earlier. The weirdo with the "kommando" patch. Can't even write properly, but he is a good guy.
>Now then, as the host of this meeting, you feel your hospitality lacking. Something somewhere deep within you tells you that this is overdoing it, but you've got the upper hand back and you don't feel like giving it back.
I could do with a cup of tea. How about you.
>She nods as she slowly sinks back in to the couch.
That would be nice.
>You lower your rifle and click it back to safe.
Kitchen is over there, tea is in the left upper cupboard, mugs are in the one next to that one.
>Megan gets up, gingerly, taking the long way around the couch to stay as far away from you as possible as you watch her with hawk eyes until she get sot the kitchenette.
>she opens the cupoards, sets water to heat up and takes two mugs out of the cupboard.
>You remember that Jenna is about to show up and think that it would probably be a good idea to have another cup ready.
Make that three, one for Jenna.
>She takes another one out of the cupboard.
Jenna - is that the girl you were with?
>You fold your legs in front of you, sitting in the lotus position on the couch, still rifle butt in the shoulder, pointing it at the floor.
Girlfriend.
>She turns around, leaning against the work surfaces behind her, arms on the edge.
How long have you two been an item?
>What is it with this probing?
Why do you care?
>She leans back in to the counter a little more and folds her arms under her decidedly not exactly small bosom. Arms of taught steel wire, as big as Pop Eye's. Somewhat similar proprtions too, her lower arms definitely seem a lot bigger from where you're sitting. Her wrists are the size of your biceps. Natural panther and the obvious fitness training that her clearly visible abs with their defined six muscle bundles and lack of any gut whatsoever clearly show below the hemline of her spaghetti halter top.
>No wonder you had no chance whatsoever against her, even the two of you. That woman could probably lift both you and your gf with one arm repeatedly.
>Her current stance seems to be a reflection of your hostility, not a show of force.
Just curious, is all. If you don't want to alk about it, that's alright.
>the water boils for a bit as you both mind your own business. You check the time on your phone, guesstimating it will take a few more minutes for Jenna to arrive while Megan unfurls her arms again and stares absentmindedly at the kettle or out the window, before she tries to strike up a conversation again.
side note: brb, shower.
Did you always have guns?
>You look up from your phone.
No. Got them recently.
>That answer doesn't seem to be what she wanted to hear.
Oh.
>the water continues to boil, until she tries again.
That's a pretty big computer set up. Do you play games a lot?
>Seriously? While being in control here has considerably lengthened your fuse, that still seems like a weird as question.
>but before you can tell her to shut up and get to the point of why she is here, she continues
I'm sorry, that must have sounded really dumb. I play a lot and I was just wondering what you have in your rig.
>Bullshit. She looks like she spends exactly 20 minutes a day with computers - 5 for photos and 15 getting them placed on instagram with captions like "Working those glutes biceps-curl-emoji x3".
>no, maybe she is scoping out your place, to add insult to injury?
>she can't be that retarded.
>She tentatively tries to smile at you.
>It's not very effective
>but it makes you take stock of the entire situation and you can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation.
You, i mean YOU, are standing here, in my kitchen, and you're seriously asking me about what videogames I play after blackmailing your way in?
>She averts her eyes and looks at the floor for a second, then back at you.
When you put it like that, it sounds pretty bad.
>she stops, then starts again, a little more spirited this time.
I just feel really uncomfortable in the silence.
>You snort in disbelief.
You feel uncomfortable.
>then you have to chuckle.
You think you're the one who is entitled to feel uncomfortable here.
>She searches for a place to hide on the floor with her eyes.
Just, new place, new people and all that, awkward silence and so on
>she mumbles, looking anywhere but in your direction.
>the kettle announces it's done.
>Megan picks up the kettle, pours three of the cups full of water and puts a teabag in each.
What tea did you pick?
>She reaches up and checks the box.
Roo-ib-os?
>Rooibos was the only tea mom would never sweeten, instead, she always added milk. You've had it often enough where it doesn't instantly give you a flashback of sitting at the dinner table at home with a glass of tea in front of you, but it isn't difficult to conjure up a false memory of a generic evening of dinner with your family when you were about ten.
Pour some milk in mine. Fridge is to your right. Oh, and in Jenna's too.
>Megan opens the fridge and pulls a jug of milk out after a short search, then drips a little in to your mug, same for jenna's, then turns to you, jug at the ready.
Mind if I take some too?
> Why would you mind?
Go ahead.
>She pours milk in to her mug as well, which results in all mugs being full nearly to the brim.
>Megan returns the milk to the fridge and takes both of your mugs and carefully balances the liquid inside of them as she carries them over.
>she sets down both of them on her side of the couch table, then pushes yours across carefully as you tense up.
I'm gonna go get another mug for the tea bags once they are done.
>She gets back up, fetches another mug and comes back.
>You watch her look curious at the tea, but then she leans back in to the couch.
How long until it's done?
>Technically speaking, Rooibos isn't a tea and doesn't have a due time.
About 6 minutes.
>There are, however, diminishing returns.
>She nods, then takes a deep breath.
I... Well. I tested positive. It's only been a couple of days but these tests don't really go wrong that often.
>it seems that she is finally getting to it, then.
I wasn't really expecting this. I mean, sure, season and everything, but one go? Without preparing? I... What are the odds, you know?
>Preparation?
Do Chimera's need preparation to get pregnant?
>she cringes.
Please don't call us that. You wouldn't call a black guy a nigger, would you? Just call us anthros.
>You shrug.
So do anthro need to prepare?
>She doesn't seem too willing to talk about it.
Some, like me.
>You motion with your hand to keep going.
Want to explain why what happened is so unlikely?
>she sighs.
I have... I don't get periods. No ovaries either. My kind... we have to scratch ourselves for a chance to get pregnant. Internally. Hard. It's not very comfortable.
>You furrow your eyebrows.
Then how did I get you pregnant?
>She shrugs.
I don't know. I've never heard of it happening before.
>That still doesn't explain why she's here.
Where are you going with this?
>She swallows.
I...
>but before she can go on, the doorbell rings and this time, you unfold your legs and get up.
You circle around her, rifle now much more at ease after Megan has proven that while she is clearly not always normal as far as social rules and norms are concerned, she doesn't appear to be a crazed rape fiend.
>You still check to see where she is and meet her gaze as she turns on the couch, followign you with her eyes as far as she can without getting up.
>Then you answer the intercom.
Yeah?
>Jenna's voice.
Guess who.
>You push the door opener and the appratus buzzes, and after you've heard the door click open through the intercom, you hang up the phone, then crack the door to the appartment open.
>You turn around, but wait by the door.
>It doesn't take jenna too long to reach your floor, she must have gotten lucky with the elevators, but before she gets to the door, Megan drops her last bombshell.
I want to keep them.
>You take a moment to digest that statement and her sincerity makes you not even for a second consider that this is some kind of joke. You hadn't taken the alimony thing fully serious, but that sounded different.
>But before you can muster up an answer, the door opens and a ball of rage practically flies in to your flat.
>Jenna blows right past you.
WHERE IS SHE?
>She doesn't walk in to the living room, she pushes through your hallway like a military formation.
YOU.
>you shut the door behind her, then follow as Jenna unleashes her emotions.
HOW DARE YOU EVEN COME HERE.
>As Megan turns to check what you're doing, Jenna takes the few remaining steps and slaps her across the face.
I AM TALKING TO YOU, BITCH.
>Megans head flings around, then Jenna turns to you.
Why are you just standing there? Where are the cops? Hmm?! She's sitting right here?
>You have dealt with this before. If things don't go the way Jenna wants them to, this happens.
>Her head shifts from you to Megan a couple of times, then she freezes and her expression shifts to an "I can't believe what the fuck i'm seeing".
Anon...
>Oh no.
>She points at the tea mugs on your couch table.
What the fuck are those?
>she turns to you again.
Is that godfucking damn tea? Did you really make her a FUCKING CUP OF TEA?
>This is probably a bad time to mention that her mug is still in the kitchen.
Change of situation.
>Jenna stems her arms in to her sides.
And what the fuck could change the situation so much, that she deserves even the slightest bit of hospitality?
>Before you can answer, Megan interrupts.
I'm pregnant. And I'm keeping them.
>She holds the pregnacy test out for Jenna to see, who slaps it out of her hand.
>You notice that Megan, who seemed fairly relaxed around you if not afraid of the guns you were carrying, definitely seems angry now.
I can get on of those for five bucks on ebay.
>She turns to you.
You weren't seriously retarded enough to believe her, were you?
>You shrug, but as Jenna is about to snarl something in your direction, Megan takes the intiative.
It's not like I can't make more of these.
>Jenna turns her head around.
Bitch, I don't give a fucking shit. You're gonna abort them, you're not doing this to me.
>Doing this to her?
Anon, she confessed to us. Call 911.

Jenna story
>you dial 911 and start talking to the operator while watching jenna and megan.
>Megan stands up, her arms folded.
I confessed nothing.
>Jenna turns around.
Yeah, you fucking did. You said you were pregnant, from him.
>Jenna points at you, but Megan still isn't having it. She waves a hand through the air, as if this is some minor detail that doesn't really matter.
Yeah, we fucked downtown in a club on the toilet. But I'm actually here because Anon bumped in to my car.
>That's... really... what?
>Before you can ask her what she means by this, Megan explains
I saw him the other day from my balcony, scraping my bumper. Very lightly, but you know. So I asked the landlord where Anon lives so we could settle this amicably and that's why I'm here.
>Jenna fumes. If this was a cartoon, her head would be the size of a weatherbaloon and steam would be billowing out of her ears.
>You tell the operator that it would be nice if they could hurry up, the situation here seems to be escalating.
>In that classic 911 dispatcher voice, she asks who and why and you tell her that your gf is here too.
>The dispatcher answers friendly and tells you to stay on the phone.
>You reach out and try to deescalate by squeezing Jenna's shoulder, but she just brushes you off and practically lunges at Megan.
>Jenna attacks the taller and stronger woman like a banshee, screaming bitch over and over again.
>You put the phone on the kitchen counter top and drop your rifle as you follow to try and keep her off Meggan, but Jenna is going full ham.
>Punching, slapping, biting, pulling Megan's hair when she gets the chance to, she doesn't pull any punches whatsoever.
>while megan was seemingly fine with fending off a few slaps, Jenna's teeth in her arm are something she seems to be unwilling to ignore.
>Megan does her best to throw Jenna away from her, but Jenna is surprisinly clingy and amid increasing growls of pain everytime jenna chomps down somewhere new
>you try to seperate the two of them. Your rifle is somwhere behind you on the floor as you start to pull Jenna away from Megan, which nets you a couple of new bruises as elbows or knees intended for the other land on you.
>You manage to pull Jenna away from Megan by inserting yourself between the two and pushing their chest away from each other.
STOP!
>Both women actually stop fighting each other, but Megan immediatly pours oil in to the fire.
She started it.
>And Jenna immediatly goes for the bait.
I started it?! Look at you, you whore!
>Megan opens her mouth and you get a glimpse of those long, long incosprs in a face that isn't being civil at all right now but looks very willing to prove that those teeth aren't for show.
Big words from an ugly flat lanky bitch.
>Jenna loses coherence again and after fumbling for a reply tries to duck under and around your palm, reaching for Megan, but you let go of megan and focus on keeping Jenna from digging her own grave.
>Only that Jenna doesn't seem to see it that way.
>after a few quick tries to get around you, her anger shifts focus.
Stop getting in my fucking way!
>You try and calm her down.
I'm not letting you get yourself killed or jailed.
>Jenna continues struggling against you after looking past you for a second.
COME HERE; YOU SLUT!
>Megan behind you seems to be perfectly willing to take her up on round two.
Make me, bitch.
>Jenna gives you a mighty push as you're trying to get Megan to deescalate - catching you unaware. Your balacning step comes naturally as a reflex - but your leg is stopped halfway by the coffe table.
>Uh oh...
>Your brain immediatly knows that you had to take that evasive step. ANd that this isn't enough. It does this, while you'r consciousness is still not entirely sure what is happening, but gravtiy relentlessly pulls you toward that coffetable, facing backwards.
>If you had bought tempered glass - you'd have fallen on to it and that would have been it.
>But no.
>This wasn't a glass table you had bought.
>This had been a gift.
>Sadly, the giver hadn't known too muvh about durability of glass, and the result is you falling on to the table, the glass shattering under the impact and you falling through the glass.
>While Jenna goes for another attack, catching unaware Megan off balance.
>You in turn hit your head on the metal frame of the table, and while you land on your back amid the shower of glass, dull throbbing pain explodes in the back of your head.
>it did make a nice and audible thwack noise.
>you her a loud growl which is muffled by the pain, because holy shit, your head hurts like a motherfucker already.
instinctively, your hands reach for the spot you hit your head on on the way down, pulling your shoulders through a field of broken glass bits and still warm tea.
>Pinpricks and more pain all over your arms and shoulders, your hear something else hitting something quite hard.
You open your eyes to see two fuzzy panther faces framed by long hair hovering not quite above you, looking concerned.
You okay?
>Your head feels like it's about to split open
naawrgh...
>A high pitched sound of rage comes from outside your vision from the direction of the panthers' heads, sounding like jenna's voice.
>The two Megans move with a speed and elegance that belies their bulk.
>They grab hold of two Jennas and pull them up, then smack them back down on top of a couch, pinning them with their body weight. Then they open their mouthes right in front of her and fixate her head so she has to look at the open maw.
>You feel the need to do something.
>The Megans growl at the Jennas.
STOP, or I'll -
>You push yourself up with your elbows, distantly registering more cutting and pricking sensations to them.
>The Jenna's struggle and get another knee in as the Megans turn and look at you with an expression you can't make out.
>The Megans cringe for a second, allowing the Jennas to land another punch.
>as a wave of pain and sickness hits you, you clothe your eyes so you won't have to puke and hear a dull thud.
>The struggling sounds end and a moment later, a furry hand pulls you out of the remains of your couch table.
>Your open your eyes and two fuzzy megans become one. She looks very concerned for someone who was willing to drag you into an alley and pin you against a wall.
Are you okay?
>No, definitely not. You feel really, really sick.
>But what happened to Jenna?
How's Jenna?
>Your mouth isn't really doing what it should be doing and Megan's concern is growing.
She's okay, you're not.
>As if on cue, Jenna starts to moan behind you, just as one Megan becomes two.
>You close your eyes again, fighting against the need to throw up as it becomes overbearing.
>You try to sit down, and Megan makes you move a few steps and then gingerly lowers you down until you're sitting on the floor, back against a couch.
>You throw up in your mouth as you hear Jenna behind you get up.
>You swallow the acidic concotion in your mouth back down and open your eyes as you feel something touching the back of your head.
>Two megans look past you.
You're bleeding.
>Broken glass rustles as Jenna walks through it and the Megans look in her direction, but before something stupid can happen, the doorbell rings.
>The other two freeze, but you can't hold it back anymore and puke your guts out.
>The pain in your head is insane.
>glass gets crushed again, then quick unsteady taps across the floor and you open your eyes two see two, no, one Megan looking down her puke soaked shirt, then reaching out to gently steady your head.
>Your hearing is fine, but it's hard to concentrate as another wave of nausea hits you and you heave again.
Thank god you've arrived.
>Megan's hand leaves your side shortly thereafter as she gets up to face the new arrivals.
That's her. You need to arrest her.
>Another, unfamiliar male voice cuts in, talking to Megan amd Jenna in the back.
>as they get down to talking, a female voice talks to you.
Sir, I'm calling an ambulance for you, alright?
>You nod.
Good.
>the voice turns away, and you open your eyes two see a black LocalPD uniform
Car 243 to base, over?
>Her eyes dart from her radio to you while she waits for reply.
Car 243, go ahead.
>Her eyes flick back in the general direction of her radio.
This is Car243, I need an Ambulance at West Sourdough 2444, male with a bleeding headwound and multiple cuts, over?
>base takes another second during which you dry heave again.
>the officer quickly scoots out of the way, but you manage to force it back down.
Car 243, ambulance dispatched, over.
>the officer leaves the microphone on her shoulder and focuses on you.
Sir, can you talk?
>You nod, forcing down the last bit of bile.
I'm Officer Norton, my colleague over there is Officer Barbrady.
>really.
Can you tell me your name?
>You try, but just at that moment, another mouthful comes up your esophagus.
>it is followed by a little more and you have to spill.
>You throw your head to the side and let it all out.
>Officer Norton makes a concerned face and you close your eyes, then lean your head back.
Anon.
>Norton seems to scribble that down and during that brief silence, you her something about rapist from the others.
>Then Norton demands your full concentration again.
Alright, and how old are you?
>you tell her, she scribbles, another tidbit from the others. Glass table.
Is this your place of residence?
Yes.
>This time, she is too quick to note it down for you to hear what the others are talking about.
Can you tell me what happened?
>You heave again, then start.
I was at home. Then Megan showed up.
>Norton interrupts you.
The anthro?
>You shut your eyes again. Its much easier to keep the sickness at bay like this.
Yeah. Then my girlfriend showed up. They got in a fight.
>You swallow, but the disgusting taste in your mouth won't leave.
I tried to stop them.
But then I fell through my couch table.
>Norton scribbles a bit and the pulsating pain in your head warbles what you can hear from the conversation the others are having. You can make out that it's fairly heated.
Alright. Tell me, whose rifle is that on the floor?
>you open your eyes to look at officer norton. Is that gun going to be trouble?
Mine. Why?
>Nausea and pain flare back up, this wasn't the best of ideas.
Are there any other firearms here?
>Well, there is the rifle and...
In my pants.
>The scribbling stops.
Okay. Would you mind if I secured that?
>Anything, if she makes the pain go away.
No.
I'm going to have to touch you.
>Anything.
Yeah.
>your shirt gets lifted and Norton unholsters your firearm, then a few mechanical noises are heard and she puts the gun in to a plastic bag, by the sound of it.
You can get it back at our station as soon as you're better, alright?
>Better, yes please.
Okay.
>Norton softly touches your leg.
Tell me if you're feeling worse, alright?
>You muble approval, then the conversation between the others can be heard, but the officer is being so quiet its hard to hear what he's saying. Only Jenna is clear and easy to hear, as she still hasn't really quietened down.
But She's-
>the quiet voice of the officer cuts her off and continues.
No, this is bullshit. She's-
>another interruption by the officer.
No, fuck that, you need to arrest her.
>the officer asks a question.
I already told you. She raped him.
>This time, Norton interrupts.
Ma'am, my colleague has already explained why this doesn't work.
>Barbrady falls in, quietly talking to Jenna again, but your head tunes out until the noise level picks up again.
>Norton taps you slightly.
Are you still with me?
Yeah.
>She seems to shift elsewhere.
Okay, I'm going to have to go over there, make some noise if you're feeling funky, alright?
>She gets up, then calls out to Megan.
Miss? Could you come over here, please?
>A common misconception about cats is that they move quietly everywhere. Truth is, they don't - they actually have fairly heavy foortfalls for their weight on solid surfaces. Megan was no exception here.
Hi. I'm Officer Norton. Got any ID on you?
>Megan's voice is calm, unlike Jenna's was earlier.
No. I live here, though, two floors up. My name is Megan Riley.
>Scribbling again, then a stop.
Alright. And what exactly happened here?
>Megan starts off with a direct accuation.
Well, I only had to knock her out because she had pushed him in to his couch table.
>Norton stops her with a bit more of an edge in her tone.
Look. From beginning to end.
>Megan takes a deep breath, then begins.
Well, me and him, had, you know, a bit of a thing. Once. Nothing major. But she caught us and I wanted to talk to him about it. Well, she barges in, tells him to call the police for some reason and then attacks me. I defend myself and then he tries to get her off me, but she just pushes him in to this glass table and charges me. I had to knock her out so I could render first aid and before I got to that, you arrived.
>Norton scribbles for a bit, then stops. Apparently, Megan decided to ignore her cover story she'd given the two of you earlier.
Where is the blood on your fingers from?
The back of his head. He's bleeding there. How's he doing right now?
>Norton sounds like she is concentrating on her scribbling.
You can ask him yourself.
>You hear Megan moving a bit closer to you, then she tocuhes your arm very gently.
Hey. You still okay?
>No.
Nauseus.
>Sympathy and warmth is practically dripping from her voice.
That su-
>Jenna's voice interrupts her.
HEY! WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE DOING?
>Norton immediately fires back.
Ma'am! Please stay where you are!
>Clearly, Jenna ignores this, as Norton has to repeat it again, a lot more steel in her voice.
>Meanwhile, Jenna keeps talking.
I TOLD YOU PEOPLE TO GET HER AWAY FROM HIM.
MA'AM, STOP!
>Megan lets go of you and you hear plasticky noises.
MA'AM, STOP RIGHT NOW!
>Jenna continues to ignore this and comes yet closer.
>FUCK YOU CHIM -
>There is a weird bang sound. Not like a gun, more like a cracker, and then clackering, followed by a heavy thud.
>Barbrady immediatly goes for the radio, loud and clear this time.
Car 243, taser taser taser.
>Then they both move and you hear handcuffs being ratcheted shut.
woah.
>Megan exclaims quietly.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
>Norton seems to have a weird sense of humor.
>Barbrady reads Jenna her rights, then shuffles around.
That was a good shot, Judy.
>Norton accepts the praise happily.
Thanks. Want me to bring her down to the car?
>Babrady sounds surprisingly relaxed for a cop that just went through a tense situation.
Nah, I think the taser will have calmed her enough so that we can have her sit here for a little while longer.
>He turns to Megan.
Miss, I think it would be a good idea if you could accompany us down to the station too.
>Megan sounds slightly more shaky than earlier.
Sure.
>Megan's hand returns to your arm, but Norton almost immediatly stops her.
Miss, If you could, please stay away from Anon for a bit. I don't want to taze her again.
>Her hand vanishes from your arm once more and she steps away from you.
Okay.
>At that moment, there is a knock at the door and two more voices enter the room.
Hi, we're here for a couple of nasty cuts?
>Barbrady answers them and you can hear the sound of heavy synthetic fabric rubbing against itself as they come in.
Hi guys. That's your guy over there. Fell through the glass couch table, hurt his head pretty bad.
>As Barbrady finsihes, Norton picks up where he left.
Bleeding at the back of the head, puked at least twice.
>The EMT's remain jovial.
Oh boy, you got really unlucky, didn't you. Alright, we've got him from here.
>One of them sits down next to you.
Hello there, son. How are you doing?
>Awesome.
Shitty.
Do you think he's gonna be okay?
>Another male voice you haven't heard before attempts to answer Megan, but gets cut off.
>Jenna apparently still has some fight in her, even after she got knocked out and tazed.
Why do you care?
>Barbrady immediately intervenes and multiple voices babble in the background as the EMT asks you to open your eyes.
>You comply, and he immediately holds two of his left hands out with a few fingers on them.
How many fingers?
>maybe... 5?
Tweleven.
>The other EMT behind him chuckles.
Okay, for real now.
I can't tell.
>The first EMT pulls out a black tube the size of a pen.
I'm gonna ask you a few questions while my colleague here will shine alight in to your eyes.
>In the background, multiple pens are scribbling, then Barbrady announces to Norton that he'll take Jenna down to their car.
Shoot.
>The tech shines a light in to one of your eyes, then takes it away, looking straight at it, but not really looking in to your eyes.
>You feel yourself relaxing, despite copious amounts of pain.
What's your name?
>That's easy.
Anon.
>The guy nods, then his colleague examines the other eye and you feel your nausea rising again.
And what day is it?
>It's...
>Wait. What day is it?
Uh. Monday?
>Megan interrupts you conversation from the background.
Is that bad?
>The second EMT puts the tube light away, then gives his colleague some medical mumbo jumbo before he adresses Megan.
Just relax, madam, we do our best when we can concentrate on our work. He'll be fine, just stick with the officer over there, alright?
>It is monday, isn't it?
Alright, now my colleague is going to measure your blood pressure and that little clip on your finger will measure you r blood oxygen, okay?
>The guy has a voice that is so buttery and smooth and reassuring that it feels like you're back at your mom's house after you got roadrash from falling off your bicycle.
>The clip on your finger feels cool.
>The loud sound of the blood pressure monitor ripped open as the velcro comes apart drives another spike of nausea in to you.
>You close your eyes.
Hey, bud, eyes open, look at me.
>You really don't want to puke all over these guys.
Can't.
What's wrong?
>You'd like to avoid painting their gear a new color.
I'll puke.
>The EMT loses it's mom quality and sounds more like a dad now.
That's okay, just keep looking at us. Count my fingers.
>as you open your eyes you heave again, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot left down there.
That's okay, Harry, go get the stretcher.
>Officer Norton interrupts him.
Need help?
>He looks at her
Yeah, help Harry get the stretcher up here.
>Then he looks at you.
Come on bud, fingers.
>You try to count them, and they phase in to one hand.
Three.
>then they phase out again.
No, five.
>It doesn't take very long for Harry and Norton to return with the stretcher, and they carefully load you on to it, pulling glass out of you as they go after fitting a weird plastic stretcher around your neck, immobilising your head.
>Every movement makes your head feel worse.
It'll be alright once we get to the hospital, okay? Hang in there.
>You feel a furry hand touch your arm as two concerned Megan faces briefly show up in your vision, but then both disappear as the stretcher moves out of your flat.
>THe ride to the hospital is absolutely the worst thing you have ever gone through in your life.
>You've seen videos of Trophy Trucks and you're sure that the ambulance is following a part of the Baja 1000.
>You're...
>You're feeling strangely.. sleepy.
Hey, bud, you're still with us?
Yeah...
>The EMT gives your arm a few gentle prods.
Bud? Count to ten, alright?
>Suuure.
One, Two... Three... ...

Should I be concerned about my son's new school friend? I don't mean to be speciecist, but she's an anthro and well, I've heard things. She's also a bit of a delinquent, rides a motorcycle, wears ripped up clothes and a leather jacket, and though I've never seen her smoke, I swear she smells like an ash tray. She also seems to be very...handsy with my son. She's always hugging and picking him up and putting her arm around him. Again, I'm swear I'm not a bigot, just a very concerned mother. I just don't know if she's the kind of crowd I want my son hanging around.

I want to get to know a big cobra anthro (or many) who will allow me to rub and massage her/their neck(s) As well as those lovely, thicc cobra hoods. I’d be totally ok with them being dominant and playing like they’re going to bite/eat me if I don’t comply with what they want but I really do want them to be sweet and want to snuggle and love/be loved. Oh to be a hooman male in an anthro snek den...

>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Advent Officers, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on X-COM, and I have over 300 confirmed captured humans. I am trained in hydraulic coiling and I'm the top binder in the entire Advent armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will fuck you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this galaxy, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Earth and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your virginity. You're fucking fucked, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can rape you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my tongue. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Advent Officer Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable virginity off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking belt. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will cum fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking bound, kiddo.

Jenna Story
>white.
>coarse fabric all over you.
>a feeling of being encased.
>You close your eyes again. It's really bright here.
>Well, maybe you should see where you are.
>You squint and see ceiling tiles.
>It's also a bit warmer than you'd like it to be.
>Except your head, your head is wet and luke warm.
>You try and move your head but can't.
>So almost automatically, you reach for your head.
>You feel something wet and cool on it, grab it and hold it up for you to see - it's a soggy icepack.
>You drop it somewhere aside and hear it drop to the ground with a loud thwack.
> Then you feel the pressure on your jaw and your brain finishes booting.
>Why do you feel encased?
>A quick look at an arm stretched above you and you see that your arm is wrapped in bandages, from shoulder to finger tips.
>Whats with not being able to move your head?
>You feel around for something on your neck and immediatly find a plastic thing that encases your neck.
>Could you take that off?
>Wait, where are you?
>You... You fell. right.
>Oh, EMTs - so this is probably a hospital.
>You search for latches on that thing on your neck but can't find any, when it occurs to you that maybe, just maybe, it's there for a good reason.
Hello?
>No one answers you.
Hello?!
>More silence.
>Are you just supposed to sit around and do noting until someone comes - no, hospital beds always have that call a nurse button.
>right, you feel around on the bed.
>Nada.
>Hmm. Maybe it's hanging off the side?
>Wait, there is a wire here and - oh. It was right on top of you.
>You press and wait.
>Nothing happens for a bit, then the door opens.
I'll be right with you, just a moment!
>It's actually a bit longer, but now the feeling of being in a dead room is dead as you can hear the hustle and bustle of a hospital station outside.
>eh, they must be busy then.
>It doesn't take too long until a nurse shows her face.
>She's human and judging by how close she is to your face, she's 5' none and her long braid makes her look like a disney princess.
>Righ tafter that, a blond male shows his face, looking a little more clinically at you.
Hi, my name Is Dr. Dubian and this is nurse Sharon. Good to see you've woken up. How are you feeling?
>Uh. actually, pretty good, albeit you feel like you haven't moved in a while. And itchy. Oh god, itchy as fuck, all over your body.
Itchy. All over.
>The doc nods.
You were pretty cut up. We'll see about getting something done about that after dinner.
>He looks at his wristwatch, then stares off in to space as sharon waits for input from him, clearly far more happy to rest her eyes on him than on you.
Sharon, if you could, change Mr. Anon's bandages, I'm thinking Betaisodona? Mr. Anon, I'll get back to you after you've had dinner, if you feel alright with eating.
>He leaves, so you look at sharon instead.
Can I take this off?
> You motion to the thing keeping yoyur neck encased.
>Sharon, who had started to unwrap your arms, stops.
I'll be right back.
>She vanishes again from sight and your headache returns, albeit a fairly normal one, not the blinding nausea kind.
>Moments later, Sharon returns, smiling.
Doc gives his okay.
>You return her smile.
Great.
>She leans over you and rips open some velcro.
>It's loud, but you're not really getting a spike of pain that lances through your skull.
Okay, now lift your head off the pillow for me.
>As you do, she unwraps something around your neck. As she pulls it away, you turn your neck and see a large yellow polycarbonate .. cast, for lack of a better word.
>She puts it aside, then starts unwrapping your bandages again, quickly moving down your arms.
So for dinner, I'm afraid you'll have to be okay with some bread, cheese and jell-o. We couldn't exactly ask you for what you'd like, you know?
>Bread is fine with you, as is cheese.
That's alright.
>She nods, then keeps going
Would you like some soda with that or tea?
>Tea. Tea sounds absolutely excellent right now.
Definitely tea, please.
>She nods again, having unwrapped both of your arms.
>Your bed begins to move as she gets your upper body moved upright.
Alright, lean a bit forward, would you, i need to get this off of your back.
>Unlike your arms, your torso isn't bandaged up, it has a huge piece of dressing taped to your back.
>Sharon quickly rips it off, then starts applying a cool brown ointment to your back.
>She does the same to your arms, then applies new dressings wherever she slathered on ointment and wraps your arms in bandages again.
Alright! I'll go and get you your dinner.
>Now that you have had your body upright, circulation has begun and while the headache has inreased a bit, it still isn't terrible.
>But, you're also a lot quicker in the head.
Hey, how long was I under?
>She opens a folder on a table next to your bed and looks through it.
Uhhh... 3 days. But Dr. Dubian is your guy for questions like that, i'll go get him once you've had dinner, alright?
>You nod while your stomach audibly sings you the song of it's people.
>It doesn't take her long to come back at all, which isn't very surprising considering the dinner tray holds a few slices of stale untoasted bread and a small bowl of cloeslaw.
All I can do at the moment. Don't expect it to get much better, though. Tea is on it's way, i'll get it to you when it's done.
>She pulls a small dresser on wheels to your bed, then unfolds a table big enough to hold your tray.
Thanks.
>She smiles, then gestures to a small cup with pills in it.
In case you have headaches.
>You take the pills, throw them down, then dig in to the bread and cheese.
Do you need anything else?
>Well, yeah, can you get up? But then again, she said that the Doc is the guy to ask those questions, so you leave it be. Instead, you shake your head and give her a thumbs up as you wolf down the admittedly stale food.
>By the time she comes back with a cup of tea, you're halfway done and between slices of bread, so you ask her for a glass or two of water, which she gets to you as you start with the coleslaw as a stand in for dessert.
>You ask for a refill, but she returns to you with a large bottle of water instead, placing it on your dresser and filling one of your glasses.
>After that it doesn't take much longer for Dr. Dubian to reappear.
>Now somewhat sated and slightly woozy from the meds, you watch as Sharon shuffles around in the room for a while, cleaning up somewhat, fetching another ice pack for your head after confirming with the doctor and taking her time to leave the two of you alone.
>In the meantime, you get all the boring things out of the way. What you're doing, how you're doing (okay), you're allowed to get out of bed, but take it careful, and so on and so forth.
...So what you have is a skull dome fracture. No breach of skin, which is good, but not a simple clean fracture either, as part of your skull broke lose and got pushed in, here.
>He shows you a section of your skull on an X-Ray. Without him pointing it out, you would have missed it.
Compounded with that, your brain experienced significant trauma, which is why we kept you under for the last three days. Significant, and i mean significant swelling. But you should be okay for now, but we're gonna keep you here for a few more days so we can monitor how things develop, although I'm optimistic that you'll recover without any permanent damage. Do keep an eye on those headaches though, some are prefectly normal, but if they get worse, tell us. Take it slow, no stress, no sports.
So now that you know what's going on with your head, why don't you tell me a bit about how this happened?
>As he explained that you have a fracture at the back of your skull, you're suddenly worried about putting pressure on it.
>He seems to read your thoughts.
Go on, lean back, it's been immobilized.
>You lean back and start to talk.
>or at least you try to, but you stop as soon as you realize that everything is very fuzzy and ther are only some individual sounds and pictures available.
>It starts with.. what's her name again?
>the panther girl.
uuhh...
>Megan!
>Megan was at your place because...
>Alimony?
>No, that can't be.
>But...
>So she was at your place. She definitely was.
>You can see her in your kitchen, making tea.
>And then you can see her defending herself against Jenna.
>You have memory of a vague feeling of losing balance.
>And then there was police.
>And EMT's, as well as an ambulance ride.
I.. think I fell. I must have fallen on something. I think... My girlfriend was there and someone else.
>You don't feel particularly well with saying my rapist.
And they were fighting? I think.
>Dubian watches you closely.
That's all I remember.
>He nods.
A bit of amnesia is normal in these cases. Those memories probably will not come back.
>You swallow. Somehow the feeling of losing some of your lifetime, something that was probably important as Jenna attacked someone so much bigger than her, doesn't sit well with you.
>Come to think of it, why was Megan there?
>You get somewhat more uncomfortable. She didn't take you again, right?
>right?
>You absentmindedly nod as the doc explains a few more things about your injuries to you, mentions that the police, a neurological specialist and a few others would visit you tomorrow over the course of the day, then finishes up.
>Before he leaves, you have on final question:
Do you happen to know where my phone is?
>Does your boss know where you are?
>Probably not. Maybe check in there as well, it occurs to you as Dubian promises to send someone with your personal belongings so you can call your girlfriend.
> It doesn't take much longer for the door to open again and for Sharon to come in with a plastic bag. In it are keys, a dead phone and your wallet.
Nurse Sharon, right? Do you happen to have a phone charger I could borrow?
>She scratches her head.
I'm not sure, I can see whether someone left one, but don't count on it.
>She disappears and you're left with a dead phone in your hand, waiting.
>It doesn't take too long for her to come back, but the charger is for a pear phone, while you're on the robot side of the force.
THanks, though.
>She smiles apologetically.
Were you trying to call someone? You can use our hospital phone line if you want to.
>That occured to you as well, but it still wouldn't work.
I don't know her number by heart.
>Her smile changes to a smirk.
Ah, I think I have the solution to that.
> She turns to walk away, but she is still in the door as you hear her again.
Mr. Anon, I think your problem just solved itself. I'll leave you two alone.
>You turn, expecting Jenna...
>...but to your horror, it's actually Megan. She's standing in the door, trying to smile at you, but she casts her eyes down fairly quickly as she sees your reaction, or at least your momentary loss of control of your facial features.
>No stress your ass.
Can I come in? I'll leave the door open.
>That second sentence seems like something meant to comfort you, and it does, until you realize that Dubian is a lanky twig and Sharon probably weighs 95 lbs soaking wet.
I brought you dinner, I've spent enough time in hospitals to know how horrible the food is.
>She pulls something large wrapped in paper out of the bag she is carrying.
>That does look enticing, but you're still not sure whether you want her in here.
>Then she pulls out two phone chargers.
I'm not sure what phone you're using, but I figured the battery would be empty by now.
>The ability to call Jenna wins out. Plus, afte rthe inital shock, you really do want to know why on earth she wa sin your kitchen.
>Her entire stance also seems deferential, head bowed, as if to say 'I am no threat to you'.
Robot charger?
>She nods, the fumbles for a bit until she holds the right one up.
Come on in.
>Megan walks in, leaving the door open as she had promised and hands you the charger.
>You immediatly plug your phone in, then, after giving her another long look, carefully unwrap whatever food she brought you.
Thanks, I guess.
>You're not particularly comfortable with eating while she is here, as it would only drag this out longer.
So why are you here?
>She fidgets, then catches herself after a deep breath. Her gaze steadies, she looks you in the eyes.
I wanted to see ho wyou were doing and figured you could need a few things.
>She takes a few more things out of her bag. A book, some chocolate, a toothbrush, a clear bag with toothpaste, deodorant and shampoo as well as a razor and shaving cream.
As I said, I've been in hospitals often enough to have a pretty good idea of what they usually won't have and i figured you could use these.
>That's it? That can't be it. There has to be something else. But why bring this stuff?
I... Uhh. Thank you?
>You do feel unwashed.
>But why is she here?
So you're here because...
>You trail off, but she gets the hint and ends the sentence.
I wanted to see how you're doing.
>Simple questions get simple answers.
Better, I guess.
>She nods.
That's good to hear.
>You raise your eyebrows.
>She gets the hint again.
And... I wanted to continue our conversation where we left off.
>ah, there it is. So you two had a chat. Why on earth would you have chatted with her? Alimony? For her? Why?
>but before you can ask her any questions, your phone vibrates as it turns on.
>You take it form the dresser and watch it cycle through boot, but Megan seems to be getting increasingly nervous the longer you hold it.
Are you going to call someone?
>You nod.
My girlfriend.
Maybe you shouldn't, not right now.
>She quickly follows up with an explanation, while she waves her arms as if trying to say 'YOu're getting the wrong idea.
I don't want another fight and I'm pretty sure she'll start another one.
>Wait, so Jenna had started the fight?
>She could be lying.
>after a second of trying to judge her intentions, you slowly put the phone down.
Thanks. I know you probably don't want me here right now.
>You silently nod, and she casts her eyes down.
I ... Mind if I sit down?
>You were expecting her to gesture towards the bed, but she actually gestures at the wall on the floor as there are no chairs in this room, despite there being a table that seems to be part of a set.
>She slides down on the wall, knees bent in front of her as she settles.
>Megan's eyes search your's and she makes a pause to emphasize what she has to say.
I never figured you'd take this so heavily.
>Was that what you'd been talking about?
I mean, that night wasn't the first time I'd done that, you know?
>Apparently not.
All the others... They enjoyed it.
>She snorts.
I mean, I met most of these guys more than once, you know. That was just the first time.
>She looks at you again.
But I never figured you'd take it that hard. I mean, no one ever pointed a gun at me, you know?
>Her voice is not exactly a whisper, but it's definitely to quiet to hear outside of this room.
>Gun, right, you had bought a gun.
At least until you did.
>Ah. Well. That's what you'd bought them for.
I didn't really take you seriously, I thought you were acting, drawing this entire thing out a bit because you liked it, which really confused me, but then you said you'd kill me if I tried anything after I figured maybe I should play along.
>That's... wait. No. huh?
And I mean, I was so confused already, I mean, what were the odds of you getting me pregnant like that in the first place?
>Oh nooooo. No no no no no. The word pregnant is a red flag so big that it tilts your brain and you spring in to action. Which is stupid.
You're pregnant?
>And the moment you say that, you realize that you're now at her mercy.
>Her inredulous look, the raised eyebrow after that - she realized that you don't know.
You don't remember?
>She can tell you whatever she wants now, and as long as it fits those key frames in your head, you can't know whether she is lying or telling you the truth.
>Who knows?
>She could tell you that you had tea during your chat or after she'd taken you again... no. She said you pointed a gun at her. How would she have overpowered you when you were armed without getting a scratch?
How much do you remember?
>Ah. Not a question you'd want to answer.
Enough.
>She shakes her head.
No.
>Fuck.
You fought with Jenna.
>She nods.
But why were... Why...
> You shut your mouth.
Why did I come to your place?
>Your turn to nod.
I wanted to tell you that I was pregnant. And that you're the father.
>You sigh.
For real?
>She nods.
>You fall back in to the pillow.
Fuck. That's why you and Jenna fought, isn't it.
>You turn your head to see her face.
Kind of. I said I'd keep them and then it escalated.
>Wait, what? She was going to keep them?
Stop. You're going to keep them?
>She nods.
why?
>She seems fairly desperate now.
Not like I have a whole lot of choice, you know?
>You don't know.
>So you raise an eyebrow.
>Megan drops her head almost to between her knees and explains.
I... I've got the choice between having them or getting an abortion. And getting an abortion...
>She looks you dead in the eyes.
They're not that good. That...
>She looks somewhere else.
I probably will never have the chance of having babies ever again if I...
>Her voice cracks, but she swallows and keeps going. Her arms are now tightly wrapped around her knees.
... If I get them taken out.
>This tower of a woman that seemed so menacing not that long ago, now sits in your hospital room, small as a mouse, tail and arms wrapped around herself, holding herself as tears flow from her eyes and she tries to fight them.
I know I fucked up. I fucked up so badly.

>Kid in last year of High School ( european, if age doesn't work out in american schools for this to be legal)
>There is a group of anthros that bully a lot of kids as their anthro bfs run the sports teams
>one of them is a gideon-level endowed mare, both in muscles and tits ( except for the dick. Fuck that)
>She picks him as her favourite subject of torment
>Constantly gets on him to the point that one of the others feels bad for him
>Mostly because as his science partner, she gets to see him transform from a genuinely nice but shy guy to a callous, angry cynic
>But he has a plan
>He watches the mare's house through a webcam
>and when he knows that she will be alone for an entire night, he strikes
>He procured a nerve agent that immobilizes her limbs completely, but lets her feel everything and doesn't attack her parasympathic nerve system, so she keeps breathing and her heart goes on.
>He hits her with it, timing his doses so that he has 6 hours with her, 6 hours during which he initially wanted to torture her
>But before he went there, his older cousin had mentioned as a side not that no girl ever was not turned on by the concept of being forcibly taken
>So he plans a far sweeter revenge, he's read up all he could, watched everything he could find and is now absolutely certain that he can make that mare dance to his fingers and dick within those 6 hours.
>His plan is to mindbreak her so hard that she will be begging for him to do it again with her
>So this isn't the usual forcible rape, as his intention is to make her cum as often and as hard as possible
>As a cover in case his plan fails, he wears a venetian mask and tells her to wear a specific black ribbon on her clothing if she felt like having him return
>Which will save him later on ( idk why yet)
>and it works.

Day 69 of Invasion
>To say the planet of Australias hung on the edge...well...that would be lie.
>The Tyranids had control of most of the planet, almost all resistance had been subdued.
>Now, only the Hive of Haarlock's wager(Joseph Haarlock sucks at cards) was putting up any decent fight
>Other population centers were being ignored at this point, having little to no strategic value.
>Given that General Powerstache was defending it, well, it was in good hands as any.
>Though his plans were about as complex as his extended family tree, they worked.
>In these circumstances, it was only a matter of time before the defenses began to fail, and the 'nids swarmed inside.
>At this point, it was all a matter of spite, the planet wasn't really worth much, just a penal colony.
>With the Fall of Cadia, and the rampant incompetence of the sub-sector Governor, help would not be coming.
>The Astropathic Choir reported full warp shadow, so they couldn't get a message out if they tried.
>Given that the Hive city was under siege for over 2 weeks by Tyranids, it would be an impressive feat.
>That is, if the 'nids weren't handicapping themselves, they weren't spamming the defenses like normal 'nids.
>They bombarded the city constantly with a variety of biological munitions, destroyed defense emplacements.
>However, they dare not repeat their initial assault on the hive walls, lest they enter range of a very heretical measure.
>A good number of captured Tyranid synapse creatures were spaced out along the inner portion of the Curtain walls.
>Upon approach, the power dildos the 'nids were hooked up to wen into overdrive, incapacitating any approaching 'nids.
>The general lead several offensive thrusts to keep the 'nids from overwhelming the remaining defenses.
>Today was no different, as a wedge of Leman Russ tanks and Hellhounds moved along the outer trenches.
>Near the front of the formation was Rupert's Slammer, his upper body sticking out of the hatch.
>A few Tyranid groups were scattered about the various craters in No-man's-land, but nothing major.
>Rupert's facial hair suddenly bristled, a viscous grin forming below it.
"Seize the moment, a Hive Tyrant is nearby"
>The Vanquisher tank rumbled forwards, Wolfe scanning the area with the storm bolter and augmentic eye.
>The 'nids were crawling all over the place, the probing assaults on the edges of the hive city had ended yesterday.
>There wasn't a giant leader among them however, a few warriors moving forward in cover of trenches, sure.
>Idly, he gunned down one that had exposed itself a moment too long.
>Which begged the question of where the Hive Tyrant really was?
>Then the ground 200 meters out burst open and caved inwards, three Trygons roaring in triumph.
>They were backed by a Ravener brood and a small swarm of 'nids, right before the armored spearhead.
>Defensive batteries and spotter on the curtain wall of the Hive quickly zeroed in the location.
>Through the could of dust and spores marched several Tyrant Guards, and a Hive Tyrant.
"A magnificent specimen, Don't you agree Wolfe?"
>The Commissar for his part didn't bat an eye, he was a little too used to the insanity now.
>That should have worried him, but instead, he sized up the distant target, before making a query.
"You admire the...horror General?
"Indeed, her head will go nicely in my Trophy Collection...Aim low."
>Wolfe smirked slightly, glad that his General still has his sensibilities...even if he was...eccentric.
"Load Turbo Penetrator men...target the Hive Tyrant...aim low.
>The gunner grinned, bringing the Vanquisher cannon to bear as requested, before firing.
>A rocket boosted shell tore from the barrel, cutting across the gap in an instant it seemed.
>For a moment, it seemed the Xenos' psychic barrier would remain intact, before it shattered.
>Commissar Wolfe snorted, hammering away at targets with the storm bolter.
"Not that low Gunner, target the Tyranofex on the right, high explosive!"
>Be Lt. Darius Rupert, distant cousin of General Powerstache
>Be guarding one of the few open gates leading into the hive.
>Battlefield casualties are high, but deaths are almost non-existent, for the first time in ever.
>The 'nids really wanted the D apparently, and more than a few men didn't seem to mind this.
>The Hive gangers who volunteered to help guard the gates seemed a little eager to face the Tyranids.
>Apparently, a shortage of Commissars made people speak their minds a touch too much.
"Oi, Bossman, this is tower."
"Go ahead tower."
"Since when did the Ultramarines get here?"
>There were Ultramarines here? Surely word would have gotten out about the Angels of Death.
"Tower, Elaborate."
"Well, looks like a bunch of Rhinos with Ultramarine colors and symbols on 'em."
"Hail them."
>Standard procedure was to inspect every incoming vehicle in the prepared kill-zone of the gates
>This prevented the 'nids from sneaking inside with the help of collaborators or Genestealer hybrids.
>The "defense" grid that the General ha assembled from captured synapse creatures was fairly short range.
>Did not stop the Tyranids from firing long range weaponry at the remaining defenses.
"Boss, I couldn't get anything out of the Smurfs, but I was able to get word from the cargo trucks behind them."
"What did they say?"
"Said that the Marines cleared the path, and that they're carrying refugees."
>Something didn't add up, the Astartes' arrival would be a momentous occasion, not a secret.
>That, and they would have arrived at the Hive's star-port if they had armor...not the Tyranid Zones.
>You give orders to prepare to stop the oncoming transports for inspection.
>Sadly, the first Rhino decides to start hosing your position with bolt rounds.
"Close the gate."
>At that moment, a krak missile flies forth and hits the control tower, leaving it a blazing wreck.
>The Rhinos come to a stop when they smash into the barricades, plowing the road open.
>Then the "Marines" pile out. screaming about their Spiritual Liege.
"Hostile Ogryn at the gatehouse, somebody close the bloody doors."
>As you duck behind cover from the wild spray of heavy weapons fire, you curse under your breath,
>Apparently, Baron Matthias Ward the 13th wasn't just content with sicking an Eversor on you.
>The doors slowly began to close, as the growling of engines came closer.
>Suddenly, the convoy of cargo trucks had arrived, and were speeding through the gate.
"Someone track those trucks down, and alert all forces inside the Hive, perimeter has been breached!"
>You managed to plink a few las-bolts into the back of the vehicles, but too little too late.
>By the time anyone found the trucks, they would be empty of whatever was in them.
>In the mean time, you had more pressing issues to attend.
>The Tyranids had managed to surprise the Armored spearhead, and a fearsome battle ensued.
>Rupert for his part faced another Hive Tyrant and her Guards, all of them leering at him.
"Xenos filth! Come to me now!"
"Oh, trust me General, it will be you who cums to me."
>Rupert's face went pinkish and his mustache gave a violent spasm.
>HE closed the distance rapidly, cutting down several Guants, hamstringing a Guard.
>His backup power dildo was jammed firmly into the folds of the Second Guard, putting it out of commission.
>It was only then that he began his duel with the Tyrant.
"Take a good look men, this is how I deal with Xenos...as well as traitors...and cowards....all much the same to me really."
>The Hive Tyrant chuckled.
"How? Jamming a metal phallus into them?"
>He opened his mouth, paused, sidestepped a thrust from her bone-sword and jabbed at her wrist.
"Must you make everything perverted Xenos? Do you derive a sick pleasure in doing so?"
>The two leader continued their duel as both sides did battle around them
>As it began to drag into the five minute mark with no signs of stopping, the Hive Tyrant gound her teeth in frustration.
>This was an old man she was fighting, admittedly one that had stolen her heart, but by the Norn Queen!
>How did he have his much energy and mobility? This much stamina?
>She was going to be testing that latter attribute out in great detail later...
>Her focus slipped, and she put a bit too much force behind her next strike.
>With a whistle, the bone-sword thrust forward with tremendous speed, sinking into the ground.
>The Generals' head jerked and he staggered, as though he'd been struck.
>For a moment, the Hive tyrant froze, thinking she'd injured her future mate.
>General Cornelius Rupert felt at his upper lip with a trembling hand, feeling nothing but smooth skin.
>A few meters away, a very familiar chunk of facial hair lay in the mud.
>She all but fell to her knees in relief, before becoming confused at a rapidly darkening sky.
>A growl from her beloved opponent(and soon to be mate), sent chills running down her rather lengthy spine.
>His expression was one of absolute fury, and his eyes glowed with a crimson light.
"I have underestimated you! No more. I will end the blasphemy of your existence here and now!"
>Huffing, the Hive Tyrant swung a bone-sword, intending to knock the man off his feet and end his rant
*clang*
>Ruppert declined dodging, halting the force of the blade entirely, before forcing it in the direction from which it came.
>He then lunged, forcing the Hive Tyrant to backpedal, taken off guard by his sudden strength.
>The power-sword became a blur, parrying and blocking the four organic blades repeatedly
>Soon, the Hive Tyrant found herself on the defensive, having to devote considerable focus on her opponent.
>Perhaps, she'd made a rather serious error in her plan to seduce him.
>The Astropathic Choir was resting inside their tower deep within the hive.
>They were tired, having gotten little sleep due to the influence of the Hive-Mind
>The constant sensation of chittering voices and numerous claws touched their minds.
>That, and a ravenous sexual hunger that never quite seemed to abate, and worse, began affecting them.
>Being a Astropath, and thereby a psyker by extension, made relationships a little difficult.
>This resulted in a room full of pent up, sleep deprived individuals who desperately wanted some alone time.
>Unfortunately, they were to be kept under heavy guard in the Psychically shielded room until...whenever.
"Ahg, I can't take this anymore! When will this end?"
"Calm down, we either drive off the 'nids or we get out minds fraked out of us."
>One of their number was close to the door, which is why he paid attention to it rather than the ensuing argument.
>There was a series of muffled thumps and cries, and then silence, followed by the clanking of locking mechanisms.
>The doors opened, and everyone in the chamber felt their hair stand on end, and a crawling sensation run up their spines.
>Several Tyranid Zoanthropes filed int the chamber, grinning madly
{{Allow us to introduce ourselves}}
>Several floors up, arcane mechanisms activated, as the "Bonding" commenced.

>After half an hour of sustained fighting, the Hive Tyrant fell to the ground panting.
Innumerable, but slowly regenerating wounds criss-crossed her body and limbs.
>General Cornelius Rupert stood over her, his greatcoat reduced to tatters.
"You were strong, but strength is no match for intelligence and resolve."
>For a moment, there was silence, then she began to laugh.
"Oh
>Everyone within 10km felt a sudden surge of heat in their loins.
>There was a sudden surge of pleasure, and everyone went over the peak
>Rupert spammed as his loins erupted, his eyes rolling back up into his head.
>He collapsed not far from a panting, and very satisfied Hive Tyrant.
"Ahhhggg, How can this be the end? I've commanded men for a century, Achieved so much glory...not like this."
"Oh please," She huffed, "Don't be....so...dramatic."
"I cannot live with this shame."
"Oh...you'll survive..."
>She presented her sizable ass to him, a hand reaching back and spreading her cheeks.
"Tell you what, best two out of three, whoever cums first loses."
"I shall...claim victory...in the name...of...The EMPEROR!"
>Be Lt Darius Rupert of the Imperial guard.
>Mere moments ago you were fighting for your life against a squad of Ogryn.
>Then some manner of warp fuckery happened, and you came so hard your vision went white for a moment.
>Fortunately, it would seem that your attackers were also not immune to whatever happened.
>Unfortunately, it seemed that every Tyranid on the damned planet was heading to your location.
>That, and several confused Ogryn were now looking at you.
>You barely manage to duck back into cover as high caliber rounds and insults.
>There is then the sound of numerous weapons running dry, and something large stomping in your direction.
"Oi, Waz Dat?"
>You peer over your cover and spot a Hive Tyrant barreling down on the Ogryn's position.
>A group of Ultramarines that size would have wiped the floor with her.
>She turns them into mincemeat.
>You then have her full and complete, undivided attention.
"Well now," She croons, "Just the man I was looking for."
"Me?"
>With a flourish she planted all four blades into the ground,before spreading her arms wide.
>Clear fluid is leaking from her lower lips in copious amounts.
>You can barely keep the Las-gun level, your body shaking from...well, everything.
"Aww, your defiance is just adorable, but we both know how this ends."
>She had a valid point, and the las-gun drops to your side.
"Is it too much to take me out for dinner first?"
>At this, she turns into a stuttering nervous wreck for all of ten seconds before you laugh.
>She scoops you up a moment later, glaring at you as hr boobs spill around your shoulders.
"Oh trust me Lieutenant, I'll be educating you on how to respect a superior for a week."
"Can't," You mumble, "Emperor know's there's going to be meetings."
>The glare holds for a second before she gives you a kiss with lots of tongue.
{{Oh that won't save you. You're mine now, and I intend to savor you tonight}}
{{Willing or not...I want to feel you struggle.}}

>He finds it hilarious for some reason
>You thank them and go to the kitchen to familiarize yourself with the surroundings
>Gorgeous double basin sink with a deep side for pots and pans, marble island with gas burners
>You open the double fridge and smile to find it stocked already with an assortment of fresh produce and a startling amount of fresh meat
>Closing it, you stare at the door a moment before reaching out a hand and pulling the photo from under its magnet
>"Anthro-Athlete Sporting Games 2019: Track and Field Champions" is emblazoned across the top
>Underneath that is a collection of grinning, flexing anthropomorphic ladies
>A bear leaning on a javelin spear wraps an arm around a lithe puma with a runner's body
>On the other side of the photo twin Rottweilers adopt a mirror pose, their tails intertwined
>Holding a shot put like a baseball, a liger sticks her tongue out at the camera between gleaming teeth in the center of it all
>The photo trembles in your hand as your hear the slam of the front door and the sound of duffel bags hitting the ground
>Taking a deep breath you round the corner and see only two, the bear and the liger
>Both are physically imposing, but the crossbreed predator is sheerly enormous
>"Ahh, our new chef!" The bear begins towards you. "I was wondering what smelled so good."
>"Heh." You reach out a hand to shake hers. "Well, I actually haven't even started cooking yet..."
>She grabs your wrist and brings it to her nose, taking a deep breath. "I know."
>The liger laughs heartily watching you stammer and sweat. "Don't worry about it, Cassie is pushy with all men."
>"Hey!" The bear swats at her with a club-like arm, which the big cat doges quick as a whip
>"Ooh bitch! Come get some!" Laughing and flexing her claws, she dodges the next few swings as well. "Hah!"
>Springing forward, she tackles the bear to the floor, shaking the furniture around you
>You watch with your jaw open for a bit as they tussle, fighting to get on top
>Finally clearing your throat, you timidly start. "Ah, so will there be just you two this evening, or-"
>"PIN!" The liger yells, triumphant as she holds Cassie's wrists to the floor
>"No fair!" Chests heaving, the ursine pouts up at you both. "Demi you're like a full weight-class above me and you know I don't wrestle."
>They help each other up, Cassie grinning ruefully. "Sorry. Yeah, it's just us tonight."
>"The beanpoles have a race to run tomorrow, so they're traveling there." Demi stretches before you, her sports bra straining tight. "Just the three of us."
>"Ah, well then my first meal will be easier then I thought!" You smile and rub your hands together. "Salmon with fingerling potatoes and asparagus?"
>Cassie fakes a swoon. "A man after my own heart."
>You leave before seeing Demi narrow her eyes into a hunters glare and turn to face Cassie
>Silently, they begin a furious game of rock, paper, scissors as you bang around in the pantry for heavy duty foil

Jenna Story
>Nothing is as uncomfortable as sitting in a room with someone else crying for reasons you understand all too well - but you're unwilling to reach out to them for reasons rooted in principle.
>It's difficult to feel afraid of her.
>Megan wipes the tears from her eyes.
I...
>She sniffs, then looks aside and snorts through her tears.
You know, my dad left when I was 6 and my mom brought home a new guy every two years or so and I just hated it. And I promised myself I'd wait with kids until I found the right guy, you know?
>She stops looking anywhere else but at you and focuses on you.
I made fun of all the girls that got pregnant at 16 and the baby mama thing and all of that because I knew how horrible it was for the kids and...
>sniff
... here I am, with a choice of never having kids or kids with a guy that never wanted them and who hates my guts.
> her voice cracks and she hits octaves a man couldn't even hit if he dreamt to as her voice fails her.
Fuck...
>She stops bothering with her tears and just lets everything out, her shoulders heaving, face buried in her knees.
>You feel the conflicting forces of social pressure demanding that you comfort the crying woman and the unwillingness to comfort a being that caused you so much misery.
>Why is she even telling you this?
>But she is hitting a nerve. You saw your dad maybe once a year for a week or so during the holidays.
>Visiting him and his new family was always like being superfluous. Interrupting.
>And you promised yourself - you would never leave your kids behind.
>Never ever.
>Which puts you between a rock and a hard place.
>But ultimately - what do you want? You'd like to stay with Jenna, but you also don't feel comfortable with forcing Megan to get rid of her chance to ever conceive again.
>Then, maybe, you should take the kids - but they also wouldn't be Jenna's kids and she would always stay a stepmom. Moms love uniquely.
>Then again, if you were to live close enough that the kids could always go from one parent to the other on their own...
>But that still wouldn't allow you to see them take their first steps or speak their first words if they were with Megan at the time.
>Her assessment of 'everything is clusterfuck' seems more and more accurate.
>single parents suck. But this constellation also sucks. Everything about this is garbage.
>Why the fuck did she have to pick you when she decided to go for a random guy on the street?
>If only...
>Well, if only won't really get you anywhere here, you realize.
>No, it's probably time for you to finally make some decisions. Take back agency.
>For better or worse.
>So you turn to Megan and say
Megan, I want you to keep them.
>Megan lifts her head and you get to see a puffy face from the teras she had spilled.
huh?
>Sniff
I want you to keep them.
Why? Why would you?
>Because you don't see them at fault for her actions.
It's not exactly their fault for being here.
>She wipes her wet cheeks with her paws, despite a continuing flow of tears.
I.. You...
>She struggles for words, her flow of tears increasing.
I have to go.
>Abruptly, she jumps to her feet, then runs from the room.
>You call after her, but she is already gone.
>Why do women have to be like this.
>Now for the difficult part - selling this to Jenna.
>You have no idea how she is going to react. Well, maybe you did before. But you can't remember.
>Your phone is up and you unlock it, then navigate to your phone app.
>Jenna is in your recent calls lists and you take a deep breath...
>...then you hit the call icon.
>the phone rings a few times.
Hello, you've reached Jenna McMahon's mailbox. Leave a message after the beep.
>Right.
Hey honey, I'm awake. Call me back.
>You hang up, then decide to try sending her a message too.
'I'm up, call me.'
>You wait until lights out, but Jenna doesn't call you back that night until you go to sleep.

>The next morning starts early. The nurse, kicks yout out of bed at 7:00, as punctual as WWI german artillery fire.
>Well, 'kicking' is a bit of an overstatement, but it isn't exactly being woken up by mom as a kid on your birthday either.
>As you work through your morning routine, Jenna calls.
>But the bathroom door is fairly soundproof and you see 3 missed calls as you return to your bed for breakfast.
>But Jenna also sent you a message:
'Couldn't reach you, I'm coming over tonight. Work now, I'll call you.'
>The nurse comes in and delivers your tablet with breakfast to you.
Would you like some tea?
>Tea for breakfast? You like tea, but you're not british.
No, but thank you.
>She looks confused.
Oh, I thought that... nevermind. Would you like some soda?
>What?
Uhm, yeah, soda sounds good. Thank you.
>She nods, then returns promptly with a bottle of soda.
>You try to talk to her about the tea thing, but before you can bring it up, your phone rings.
>It isn't Jenna, it's an unknown number.
>You pick up the phone.
Hello?
>A male voice answers.
This is Detective Ron Mully with the Anoncity PD. Am I speaking to Anon?
>Where the hell is he coming from?
I ... yeah, that's me.
>THe voice suddenly becomes surprisingly warm for a cop.
How are you doing? I heard you got knocked around pretty badly.
>You take stock of the situation. Headaches, a crusty feeling head, lots of itching scabs.
Okay, I guess.
>The cop keeps going.
You got pretty lucky there, If I may say so. Listen, we've got a couple more questions and I'd like to come around to the hospital , I think that's where you are, right? I'd like to come over and we can talk for a bit.

The human's biggest complaint about being on a mixed-species campus is that the lockers are all too big, not the horny animal people.
The wild dog keeps getting mistaken for a hyena, and keeps having to point out her large friend who is an actual hyena.
The hyena doesn't really care for that, so she's made it a mission of hers to make sure everybody knows what a hyena looks like, which hasn't helped her reputation as a bully.
The cheetah is just tired of people assuming she's on the track team.

Cook Anon Story
>Seconds for all and then thirds for Demi clears the plates, and you all sit in sated silence for a moment
>"Tch." Cassie stands, her expression sour. "Time to clear the dishes."
>"Oh, please, it's my job. I'll take-" She silences you with a raised hand.
>"Nope, I lost fair and square." Collecting the plates and platters, she turns to the kitchen in a huff. "Fucking scissors."
>"Scissors?" You turn to look at Demi, whose eyes twinkle with fierce instinct. "Am I missing something here?"
>She stands, strips her t-shirt off, and strides over to your seat at the table before sliding it and you away with a deft movement
>You stare agape as she lift off her athletic bra, a set of colossal breasts popping free with a satisfied sigh from the ligeress
>Towering in front of you for a moment, she pops a deep squat to meet you at eye level and trails a claw along your cheek. "I got first dibs."
>Her paws slide down to your lap, undoing your button and slipping your zipper down with ease
>You try to cover the bulge growing in your underwear with your hands, and she responds with an amused purr before grabbing back belt loop of your pants
>"Up you come." Demi's other hand grasps your chest and she tosses your over her shoulder like a sack of potatos
>"Mmm, now for the unwrapping." Reaching beyond the belt loop in her hand, she tugs at your pants and underwear and you feel your bare ass exposed inch by inch to the open air
>Your erection digs into the soft fur of her breast, the pillowy softness of which belies the steely muscle underneath
>Reflexively thrusting your hips against her, Demi swats your ass and carries you to the bedroom. "Stop that. If you cum on my fur I'll be annoyed."
>You go limp and allow yourself to be stripped below the waist and taken back to her California King bed, burying your face in her plush pelt
>She tenses
>Demi tilts her head and plants a soft kiss on your rear, before whispering; "Clench your teeth."
>Next thing you know, you're airborn
>You land with a soft thud on the matress, your breath leaving your body in a soft gasp
>A paw wraps its way around one of your ankles and drags you over to the edge of the bed, wrenching your legs apart as Demi gets on her knees
>A cool nose nestles its way against your balls, her whiskers tickling your thighs as she lets out a low moan. "Damn you really do smell good."
>Like grooming a mate, she plants her tongue flat down on your nuts befor dragging it up your shaft
>Staring with wide eyes, your uneven breath rattles from your body in a mix of shock and pleasure as the hybrid gal toys with your cockhead
>"Hmph." She lays her heavy head on your thigh. "Thought it'd be all barbs and sandpaper? No baby, anthro lighers just have soft little bumps."
>Sinking her shoulders, she crawls her way up on top of you, looking every part the predatory beast her lines descended from
>Sometime in all this she'd lost the hip-hugging compression shorts she was wearing and you hungrily eye the small tuft of pubic fur between her legs
>Gripping your cock in her hand, you worry for a moment just how small you look in her grasp but she shows no such compunction
>"Yum, smooth and silky." She nuzzles your member against her nether lips, her other paw splayed on your chest easily pinning you down. "Let's ride."
>Demi slides her way down onto you with agonizing slowness, shifting her weight to her hand on your robs and pressing the breath from your body as her hips meet yours
>Rolling her hips in a circle, she grinds your cock against her walls and you feel her shiver when she bottoms out
>You gasp for air as she moves her paws to either side of your head, her arms like blinders cutting off your vision from anything that isn't her
>Tail swishing, she starts pumping her body up and down, working your dick with gradually longer and more forceful strokes
>It's bad you're already close now as she rocks up and down, sides to side, and then...
>"I never said you could cum." Lifting herself just high enough to free your cock from her warm internal trappings your let out a frustrated whimper as she stands up.
>"At least, not yet." Turning around, her toned buttocks loom above you. "Now eat."
>Firmly planting her cunny on your face, she holds you down under her sheer bulk, motionless until the moment she feels your tongue rasp across her waiting cunt
>With an arched back she bounces, rising up to let you catch a quick breath before lowering down again and pressing back into your tender licks
>Her salty, tangy taste eggs you onn, your erection throbbing painfully as she teases the base of your shaft with nibbles and kisses
>The lashing of her whip-like tail becomes more and more frantic, until finally she stands again, her legs amost giving out and making you flinch
>Stepping forward, she looks over her shoulder at you while again guiding your ready member in
>Wordless, growling, she takes it all with an earsplitting roar
>You cum instantly, Demi pinning your shaking legs in place as she bucks and grinds mercilessly onto you
>Each crashing wave of her orgasm causes her body to tense, milking you for every drop of seed you can give
>Panting in unison, you feel your calf muscles aching under the ligresses's steely grip as you start to chuckle to yourself
>"Wow. That was really something." She looks over her shoulder at you again, her eyes blank. "Oh. Was that not good for you t-"
>"Again." She starts rolling her hips in those tiny circles once more as you hiss in pleasured agony
>She absolutely won't take no for an answer

>"Ah, yes, all according to plan. With the destruction of the human sector of the city, the cute little things will have to go into the anthro districts for shelter and work. With my economic strength, humans will get the worst jobs with the most pitiful of pay. They'll hardly be able to even pay for property. Then, those men will rejoice when I tell them of a new job opportunity. They'll be so desperate, they'll take any job. Then I can make the largest human brothel the world has ever seen! It will be one massive step to a golden age of sensual delight, and I will go down in anthro history as its queen."

Hearing that his brother killed such an important figure who has done nothing but aid them? I can't promise what they would do. He'd be lucky if they left you absolutely destitute."

>"Hmhmhm, that rusty thing? She's in the center of the blast. Don't worry about your brother, Alex. I'll open a school, the first of its kind, and give him a free education. Anthros around the world will want a taste of him, he'll live like royalty, one of the crown jewels to my empire. Forgive me for giving him second place though. I'm reserving the diamond collar for a handsome fellow who caught my eye a long time ago. I do hope he isn't crying himself hoarse, his voice is one of his best qualities.

Jenna Story
>You wonder whether you should call your mom - she'd probably make a fuss about it. Do you want to stress her out? hmm. There is not really a point in calling your dad, he'd pretend to care, talk to you a little bit about how you're doing in general, but wouldn't be interested in details and then next time you'd hear from him would be a christmas card.
>Call your sister?
>Might as well call your mother if you do that.
>You sigh. It's too early to deal with your fussy mother, but the longer you wait, the more pouting there will be.
>You bite the bullet.
>It dials, then she picks up.
Hey Anon, its so nice of you to call, but I'm really in a rush right now.
>You decide to carefully hint at your injuries, playing what happened down as far as you can.
Just calling to let you know I'm alright. Gonna be alright too.
>What happens next is best described as 'the music stops.jpg and everything freezes.'
What do you mean, you're going to be alright?
>It's not nice to do this kind of thing to your mother, but it's nice to hear that someone is so concerned. You feel warm and fuzzy on the inside.
I got knocked around the head a little bit, I fell on that glass couch table and broke it. Hurt my head a little bit. But the doc says i'm going to be alright.
>You hear her breathe in in shock.
Oh my god, there must have been glass everywhere! Are you sure you're alright? Honey, falling in to glass shards isn't funny!
>For the rest of the call, you try and let on as little as possible as to why you fell through the glass, waiting for mother to calm down.
>It doesn't take much longer for your sister to message you, but before you can get a got read at it, there is a knock at the door.
Come in!
>The door opens and a surprinsingly slackish guy steps in.
Hi!
>He shakes your hand.
I'm Ron Mully.
>He shows you a wallet with a badge in it from your local PD.
How are you doing?
>You'd previously been fairly tense, expecting a gruff, authoritative guy.
>But this guy is super relaxed.
>His smile is infectious.
Well, headaches, but that's expected, I believe.
>He nods sympathetically, then looks over your stuff on the dresser.
Aw man, last time I was in a hospital, I must have picked the wrong one.
>He nods to the as of yet untouched novel, the chocolate and the other assorted things Megan left with you.
>You smile.
Oh, those were dropped off by -
>a friend? Well.. not really.
- a neighbor of mine.
>He gives you a knowing look.
Food's still terrible then?
>You nod.
Food's still terrible.
>He chuckles.
That neighbor, does that happen to have been... Megan?
>You nod.
>He looks around, searching for something.
Mind if I sit - hmm. Mind if I get a chair from somewhere nearby?
>You shrug.
No, go ahead.
>Mully disappears, then comes back with that wide smile again.
Alright, so I don't want to bother you too long. Would you mind telling me a little about how you got here?
>Unlike anything you expected, there is no tape recorder and no pencil scratching on paper while you give a short run down on what you remember.
>Mully looks at you the entire time, asks a few questions, but there really isn't too much to talk about as your memory is practically a few flashes and mostly guesswork, which he doesn't really want to know too much about.
>He asks you about the reasons why Megan would have been there, but you just say you really have no idea.
>finally, with his smile having been replaced by a contemplative frown, he shuts up for a few seconds.
hrmm.
>He stares at the ground for a few seconds.
hrmm?
>You try to prompt him, but he just keeps his eyes on a spot somewhere below your bed.
hrmm.
>And before you know it, you've asked a very dumb question.
Detective, what's the usual punishment for rape? Purely hypothetically.
>That gets him out of his mind.
You wanna be a bit more precise there?
>There is a certain edge in his voice. Not a lot, but a noticeable hint to come clean.
Well, hypothetically. I've just been curious, I saw something on the internet earlier.
>He looks at you, judging you it seems, as if he hadn't really seen you before.
Depends, really. I'm no lawyer, but usually the guy ends up doing time, and prison for rapists is hell.
>Oh, so that's why he seemed so hostile all of a sudden. He was suspecting you.
No, I mean if a woman were to rape someone.
>Now you've actually got him puzzled.
What, like a kid? Like, taking advantage of a minor?
>He looks up to his right, trying to remember something.
I think that's ten years average.
>Not really what you were looking for.
No, I mean, what if a woman were to force herself on a man, both of legal age?
>He seems absolutely without a clue and scratches the back of his head.
Uhhh... phew. Those aren't really covered by law in this state. Rape is defined as forced penetration without consent from the penetrated. So unless hypothetically she stuck something up his butt, it's not really rape.
>What.
Oh.
>Oh shit, you have to keep this hypothetically thing up.
I feel really sorry for that dude now.
>Mully raises a questioning eyebrow.
Which dude?
>You shake your head dismissively while you tell a quick story.
I saw this post by a guy on seddit who was asking for advice on how to handle his marriage. He talked about being gay but his wife and her family was devoutly christian, as were his parents and it was all just going downhill, really and she had started choke him so he could do his marital duties and it was all just a really really sad story.
>Mully nods emphatically.
That sounds really, really rough. Did he say anything about getting out?
>You shake your head.
No, he wanted to stay for the kids, althoguh they only had one on the way. He liked her just fine, but as a friend, you know?
>Mully looks you dead in the eye.
Life is hard like that sometimes, but you can always get help.
And, if he were to press charges here, he'd get the kids, I'd wager. She'd look at a battery charge, The way that story sounds, multiple times, which makes a suspended term impossible. If she's blackmailing him, it's coercion. Either way, I know these things are hard to admit, but ultimately, living like that for the rest of your life sounds miserable. The sooner he gets out, the more life he will ahve left to live, you know?
>You nod.
I told him I wish him all the best, as he was adamant about somehow keeping everything going.
>It doesn't feel like Mully is buying your made up sob story. He looks you dead in the eyes, until you flinch from his gaze, then keeps them on you for a little while longer.
Alright. I've talked to a few guys with issues like these, you know? Sons visited by either parent at night, guys in dorms getting visitors, I've had big strong bodybuilders getting beaten up by 5 foot 90 pound girls. everything stays inside my head. No notes, nothing, just my head, so if you have something to tell me...
>You could talk about Megan right now.
>Battery and assault. No way she's getting out of that if Jenna backs you up.
>But then he makes you reconsider.
We all deserve someone who brings us chocolate when we're down, eh?
>And that's when you remember that call with your mum.
>How worried she was.
>How she'd wake you up not just on birthdays, but on every day.
>How she kept axing guys that turned out to not really accept you and your sister as part of the family.
>All the love and compassion a mother could give your kids.
>He was right, Megan had turned up with chocolate and books and food and everything last night.
>He interrupts you train of thought.
Anon, I'm guessing you want to think about some of this on your own, yeah?
>You nod, slowly, lost in your thoughts.
If you want to talk to me about something, I'll leave you my card, alright?
>He pulls a card out of his shirt and drops it on your dresser.
>You just nod, overcome by sentimentality.
>If you cry now, your ruse is so definitely up.
>Mully puts a hand on your bed, making sure you look in his direction.
>This man spreads empathy like a lamp spreads light, and he is a 3000W search light, but then he pretends to be a bit more gruff. Gunnery Sargeant-gruff.
Get well soon, ya hear?
>You nod, then mock salute with two fingers. It immediately takes the edge off your emotions.
Yes, sir!
>You both chuckle as he leaves.
>As soon as you hear the door behind him click, you google battery charges.
>The amount of time Megan would spend in jail for double battery would make her miss almost all of primary school, never mind kindergarten.
>You think back on your childhood and realize how much you would have missed your mother if she had been in prison all that time.
>Jesus fuck.
>Could you do that to your own kids?
>Out of all the things you could do, singlehandedly robbing them of their mother for something that, if you're really being honest with yourself, didn't really physically hurt?
>A mom that seems to perfectly down with bring them chocolate and books?
>...
>Things really are a clusterfuck.
>Maybe you should have some chocolate.
>You should definitely have some chocolate.
>it's not exactly a hershey's bar, this is expensive stuff.
>and it tastes really sweet.
>You could think things through, but your head is buzzing and you've never made a single good decision in the past when you've been emotionally charged.
>So you have a look at the book instead.
>The Helium Sonata.
>hmm.
>A welcome distraction.
>But it's not exactly a long lasting distraction, as it doesn't take particularly long until your phone buzzes you out of the first few pages.
>It's your sister.
'HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, DINKLEBUTT!'
>You open your phone.
>It's a series of increasingly pissy messages asking you how you are.
'Sorry, talked to an officer just now. Doing okay. Head kinda hurts.'
'Oh look, his majesty graces this peasant with his presence.'
>What is up with her?
'Alright, fuck off then.'
'What?! first, you let mom tell me that you're in hospital for days, then you won't even tell your only sister who's worried about her little bro what's going on and now you're angry at me? You fuck off. '
>She follows up with an emoji stretching her tongue out and that's when you realize that she is just pulling your leg.
'You little brat.'
'I'm not a brat, I'm horrible.'
'You're a horrible little sister. Fine?'
'Thank you.'
'Mind telling me what the difference is?'
'No one likes a brat, but everyone loves a horrible little sister, and both get away with almost anything.'
>You chuckle. As you type your reply, it escalates in to a laugh, mostly fueled by relief that some parts of this world are still in order.
'That's really fucking dumb.'
'Fuck you too.'
>You wait for a second too long and she has sent you another message.
'So how are you doing, little big bro?'
'Since when am I little and big at the same time? Last time I checked, I was older and taller than you.'
'Ever since I turned horrible.'
>You start typing 'You always were horrible', but that would be playing right in to her game.
'You brat.'
>She sends you series of crying emoji.
'Why do you hate me so much?What did I do to deserve this?'
>ah, fuck it.
'You turned in to a horrible little brat of a sister.'
>a not really impressed emoji returns, followed by another message from her.
'meh. so what's happening to your noggin. Did you get all of your little sister love knocked out or what.'
'Fractured skull, had a part of it pressed in to my brain and apparently that was really swollen? Induced coma for three days, and lots of cuts all over the place. Headaches, but nothing permanent.
'Holy shit bro, don't just kill yourself out of nowhere, alright? That's uncool.'
'It wasn't me. I think. I don't know.'
'wdym'
'Can't remember.'
'jeez dude. Talk about nothing permanent.'
'well, yeah. But nothing permanently damaged.'
'except your memories.'
'Yeah.'
'You know I'm gonna hurt whoever did that to you, right?'
'Kinda illegal. Just looked up battery, you'd probably be in jail for like 5 years.'
'Oh yeah? Maybe i'd just have to kill 'em and bury the body then. No one hurts my brother.'
>You're at a bit of a loss for words. Is she serious? She can't be.
'except for me, when he thinks its perfectly fine to not talk to me for like a month.'
>Ah. She absolutely isn't.
'Hey, I was out for like three days, okay?'
'and 3 days = 1 month?!'
'well, it wouldn't have been a month if i called you two days ago.'
'semantics.'
'true.'
'how's jenna?'
'okay, i guess.'
'You guess?'
>You start typing up an answer, but before you can finish, your phone rings.
>Your sister calls and you pick up.
Hey.
>there is a lot of noise on her end, but she is easy to make out.
Lecture is over. Might as well talk. SInce you barely ever talk to me anyway, what's up with that? I'm your cute little sister and you're all like.
>She's silent for a second.
You know bro, that's just not cool.
>you forgot what's she's like sometimes.
I know, I should call you more often. But I don't want to interrupt your lectures.
>she snorts.
Weak, bro, weak. You know lectures aren't in the evening.
>Well, she didn't get all the wit your dad's genes had to give.
Yeah, but you might be kissing a guy or something. And then I'd pop in to your head because I called. Imagine you'd have to think of my face while you were doing the horizontal tango -
>you hear a loud snort, then coughing on the other end, followed by laughter.
No fair!
>What?
The horizontal tango? How old are you, 56?
>more laughter.
You dick, you made me spill all my coffee!
>You smile.
Hah, you deserve it.
>You hear someone trying to pout on the other end while laughing.
You're horrible.
>well, she deserves this for cheering you up.
You too.
>She sounds really heartwarmed now.
Awww.
>The noise in the background dies down to almost nothing as you hear a car door shut.
Alright bro. Go on, tell me about Jenna.
>you sigh.
We're having some trouble right now.
>You can guess what's going to come next.
Look bro, I know I made some bad calls on your relationships before -
>Yeah. Like her bff Raquel back in High School.
- but I honeslty think you should dump her.
>Well... You're not really at a point in time where you know what will happen next.
>And you haven't thought about it at all yet.
>Your sister immediatly senses your hesitation.
You're thinking about it already, aren't you?
>well, no, but you also can't really see a way of having kids with Megan while Jenna is around.
I... look, things are complicated right now. Like really really complicated.
>She sounds a little dejected.
You know you can talk with me about stuff like that, right?
>You wonder how much of this will end up with your mother. Your sister has a habit of leaking to your mother things that you might not necessarily tell her on your own, albeit she isn't that much of a blabbermouth really.
I know, it's just... I don't really know.
>You take a deep breath.
I bought a gun recently. Two, actually.
>Her reply is angry and a lot dejected.
That's the big deal? You know I hate those.
>It's a tiny spill. But it's enough to break the dam.
No, it's... Someone's pregnant. And it's not Jenna.
>The answer comes back after a second.
You're kidding, right? This is a joke.
>You wish. You think.
No.
>You hear her breathe in.
OH MY FUCKING GOD AND YOU HAVEN'T TOLD MOM YET?
>Well no, of course you haven't.
It's really fucking complicated, okay?
> and you launch in to the story.
Holy shit, bro, you weren't kidding.
>The missing part from Megan being in your appartment is still nagging at you, and you told her everything as you remember it and then Megan's version.
Yeah. I mean, I don't wanna be like dad, you know?
>she seems to be walking now.
Yeah. Look, I'd leave, honestly. I can't see myself living with a rapist. But if you're gonna pick one, I'd stay with Megan and the babies.
>Megan's remarks from yesterday seemed... different. Not exaclty like she was a stone cold rapist.
I honestly think she meant that in a way of she just kinda does this forcible thing for the first time, and then she always met the other guys again, you know. Like, a hardcore version of "lets have sex on the first date".
>She snorts
That doesn't make her any less sane, dude. That's fuckin' cray cray.
>You can hear her giggle at the other end.
I mean... I can't even imagine. That's just wild. I don't even want to know how many STD's that girl has. You better get checked yourself too.
>Shit. That never even occured to you.
Yeha, that's... I really should do that.
>She snorts.
Bro, you're so out of whack, it went from not being funny at all to being funny again. I'm coming down. You're gonna need me.
>Wait what? No, you really don't need your sister taking matters in her hands as well.
I'm fine. Trust me.
>that has her laughing.
Dude, I trusted you to be able to do live on your own and you find the most horrible woman on the planet to get along with, call her your girlfriend and then manage to get another girl pregnant without anyone being able to blame you for it within reason and then knock yourself out on a table so hard that it and you break. That is the definition of not fine.
>feeble excuses? Of course you have one.
I don't want to you to miss any courses.
>Well, there is this issue of you being a bit out of the loop on dates.
Dude, it's friday and monday is a holiday.
>One last try.
Jenna is going to come over tonight.
>That doesn't really work at all.
Good. Can I tell the cunt the good news that she can fuck off and die?
>YOu don't really want her to fuck off and die. You want her to stay with you, but you have to face the facts.
Please don't. I would have never ended your relationships and I wouldn't want you to end mine.
>You'd still rather tell her what's going to happen and see how she takes it instead of just giving her the boot.
>Your sister's answer is hard to hear, her phone seems to slide over something. You seem to make out 'maybe you should have'?
What was that?
>Her voice clarity suddenly picks up a lot, as if she had picked up her phone.
Nothing.
>Screw that, you've just told her some really in depth things about your life.
Hey, no fair.
>She sighs.
Can we talk about this later?
>oh well.
Alright. got an idea of when you'll be here?
>she taps on her phone.
i----n six hours. Ish. Traffic looks horrifying.
>Eugh. six hours? That's... that's a lot of fuel, actually. Fuel she shouldn't be paying for.
You know I'm paying for your gas, right?
>And the warmth is back in her voice.
Thanks, bro.
>you answer in kind.
Thanks for making the trip.
>a car door slams shut on her end.
anything for you bro, see you soon. Bye!
>Sometimes you wonder whether she calls you bro because you told her that it's just dumb and silly to spite you or whether she forgot and just does it because she's an idiot.
Bye.
>with that, you hang up and only then do you notice how much your stress level has decreased.
>it will be nice to see your sister again. It's been a while, and while she does get on your nerves, she's someone you trust implicitly.
>Which is something you really could do with about now.
>Her perspective on these issues should help a lot with finding a way out of this mess.
>You hang on to your thoughts for a while, then take another bite of chocolate.
>lunch comes around. Nurse sharon brings in mediocre food, you eat it, take another cup of pills agains the headaches, then go back to reading your book.
>It's afternoon when someone else interrupts the Helium Sonata, which is a surprisingly well written Sci-fi-book.
Hey, is Anon here?
>Stage, right: goddess.
>Tilly pokes her head in to the room. Well, her gray ears first, and then the rest of her bunny head.
Hi Miss Hopps.
>You smile, and she smiles back.
We're out of office, you can call me Tilly.
>Uh... alright.
Sure. I'm Anon.
>This feels weird. What exactly is she doing?
How are you doing today?
>Well, pretty nice actually.
Got a nice buzz going with these pills, someone is making my food, could be worse.
>She laughs.
Except for that hole in your head, right?
>you pretend to remember that just now.
Oh, yeah, that. That still hurts.
>you shrug.
Can't have it all, eh?
>She seems fairly conspiratorily.
Guess you can't.
>She takes the seat next to your bed.
I have a little something from us at the office.
>Its a lot of clear wrapping around a gift basket with some small sweets and a few assorted fruits.
>Nothing fancy, but there is a gift card on it with your name and you definitely weren't expecting it.
Thank you!
>She smiles.
oh, it's not much.
>You examine it, then open the tie.
>The carrot sticks out like a sore thumb.
>You pull it out and give it a try.
>It's a carrot. A really good one, but still just a carrot.
It's nice.
>She nods.
I know, they are really great aren't they? I found a farmer that grows them on a rooftop near my home. You can really tast ethe sun on them.
>okay, this is getting really weird.
Hey, you know, I gotta ask. Is Vince okay with me being out? I expected him to be a bit more... displeased.
>She leans back in to the chair and folds her legs over each other.
Oh yeah, I mean, I had to do a little digging to find you. He was pretty angry the day before yesterday, but then insurance called us about an ambulance ride. We didn't know a thing about what was going on and from there on out it was just a question of driving to the hospital and asking for your name. Dr. Dubian was kind enough to let me know that you were in a coma and Vince does take health seriously.
>That... actually explains everything.
Ah.
Thanks for that, I really didn't want to get fired. Can I interest you in some chocolate?
>Tilly looks at the chocolate you offer her and then waves her hand.
No, thank you. I don't really have a sweet tooth, you know.
>You break the carrot you've nibbled on in half, then hand her the part that's untouched.
>She wants to decline, but you insist.
Oh well, then don't mind if I do.
>She happily munches away on it, while you complain a little about hospital food and finally, she looks at her wristwatch and declares its time to go for her.
>You say your goodbyes and she leaves.

Human men are hard wired to find strong anthro women attractive. When they see a true ALPHA FEMALE their knees go weak and thir dicks get hard and start dripping. All they can think about is how badly they want this ALPHA FEMALE to mate press them and take their seed. How can human women possibly compete with this?

>the last thing you hear as the aliens toss you into the light is, "this one is special put him aside".
>then you feel cold bitter bone breaking cold as you consciousness fades.
>your next memories are vague almost dream like.
>everything is foggy, but your under a bright light and you here people talking.
>"inject him with serum number one and two"
>you try and reach out struggling against what feels like restraints
>"this one is mentally strong give him another dose of relaxacian"
>you suddenly notice a figure bending over
and you try and stop it brushing your hand against...hair?
> you feel sharp pains in both your leg arm, and chest.
>everything becomes more and more vague, and you can no longer move and understand what is being said.
>you feel more dull pains all across your body for what seems like hours.
>then the bitter cold returns and you lose consciousness.
>you awake to intense heat so hot that it feels like your burning alive.
> something opens and you fall flat on what feels like a hard cold floor.
>everything is blurry, and you feel weak, but somehow you struggle to your knees.
>while your sitting there, you hear a voice
>"My lady, this specimen was captured from the former continent known as north america", said another gruff but feminine voice.
>the voice continued," just shortly after the colonization, he put up a great fight during the sorting process even under what would have been a heavy dose relaxacian, and had to be incapacitated."
>slowly your vision starts to return and you can barely see what looks like stained glass, and stone?
> "during the optimization process they had to give him what would normally be a lethal dose to keep him from trying to break free."
Another voice chimed in, "marvelous, knight, what about physical strength?
>you start to finally get up slowly as your legs are barely able to stand.
>the voice continued,Your Highness nothing to much out of the ordinary, since the serum used is old it won't take affect until after the ritual, and even then it might only increase his strength 10%."
>you are finally able to stand on your feet as your vision is nearly clear you look around and see two white figures seated in front of you one on a higher chair in the center and one on the lower chair on right.
> the voice from before seemed to be coming from the center said, "I don't know my daughter are you sure you want someone who won't be as strong as the other specimens?
>the figure on the right chimed replied with what seemed like a younger voice ," mother I could care less about a brute with no will power or intelligence."
>"knight what is his intelligence level measured at?"
>At this point your eyes are open clearly, and it looks like your in a throne room, with what appears to b...b ..be two white nude wolfesses siting on both thrones.
>The voice from behind continues and out of the corner of your eye you see a spear, still weak you wait until the right moment.
>"seven out of eight my lady one of the better ones of his kind the voice" replied.
>Before another reply could be said you, went for the spear tripping the alien, or was it wolfess?
>grabbing the spear you hold it to the throat ,of what looks like a tan wolfess in weird silver and gold looking armor.
>Then shout, MOVE ONE INCH AND WOLFY HERE GETS IT!
>Now the middle wolfess gets up of her throne and looks angry, HOW DARE YOU TOUCH AND INSULT A ROYAL NIGHT HUMAN!
> You reply, Why should I care, if you like her so much let me go and she lives if not...you inch the spear closer to her throat.
> The wolfess calls your bluff, GUARDS SEIZE HIM!
>Your about to plunge the spear into the wolfs throat, but a guard out of no where pins and restrains you.
>your able to somehow break free of their grip and turn to run, causing three more guards to pin you.
>the middle wolfess speaks again with supreme authority in her voice, "this specimen is not worth the time send him to the labour camps for the soldiers to sort out."
>The wolfess on the right speaks up "mother I chose this one.
>"Aurora why this one he just attacked a guard,think about what he might do to you given the chance, said the middle wolfess.
>Mother I don't want a human who will break easily, I want it to be struggle, and this one will do just fine. I will enjoy breaking him down.
>"Its your choice daughter one you can't go back on, we both know what happens if you do," said the middle wolfess.
>"Your right and I chose him," says Aurora.
>TO HELL WITH THIS I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN SUBMIT TO WHATEVR-, you shout before you get cut off as a guard gags you.
>"Aurora go take your serum, and prepare the ritual room, drag this one there ", as the middle wolfess points to you, "kicking and screaming if you have to ".
>two guards lift you up as you struggle to break free again.
>Both seem to chuckle at your attempts to break free, and one even says, humans never learn do they.
>before entering chamber they inject you with a syringe full of purple liquid.
>then they cut your bonds and throw you into the chamber closing and locking the door behind you.
>the dark room is sparse with little to no furniture there are claw marks on the wall and a small bed with sheets and pillows.
>thisdoesnotbodewell.jpg
>Knowing you might not get another chance you search the room looking for a way out,or a weapon to defend yourself.
>nothing
>fuck.jpg
>well the next best thing you hide in the darkest part of the room and become as still as possible.
>suddenly you hear the door open and something walk through.
>you can see bright blue eyes on the other side of the room.
> I know your here human, you can't hide from me, said the younger voice from earlier , which had to be Aurora?
>yeah so what, you say as you charge her .
>you try to knock her off her feet knowing she probably has the key.
>she simply holds out her arm and knocks the wind out of you.
>"nice one" you say sarcastically as you catch your breath.
>"You know your lucky human", says Aurora, "not many of your kind will ever get this privilege".
>"like hell", you say coughing still trying get back to breathing regularly.
>with your eyes slowly adjusting you notice the wolfess is holding a syringe in her hand which she injects.
>"you wanna know what is going on you have five minutes before this kicks in", she says tossing the syringe aside.
>the first question comes to mind
>"Where am I?",you ask
>"you would call it earth", but we call it lupus major now.
> why am I here are you going to torture me?
> No you have been chosen by me for the bonding ritual,Aurora replies causally as if its the most natural thing.
>The presence bed and pillows finally hit.
>fuck no you think
>"yeah I don't think so", say.
>"You have no choice", she replies with what looks like a smirk
>you start to notice a strange smell and the wolfess slowly advances.
>"you will thank me later for saving you from a fate worse than death,"She says only a few feet away from you.
>The smell intensifies
> "Times up "she says
> you try to run but she is on top of you faster than you think possible.
>she drags you to the bed pinning you
>"Oh gods", she moans, "I did not think it would be this strong, I will ex-plane everything to you after, but for now your MINE," ending in almost a snarl.
>She plunges on you sticking her muzzle in you mouth where gaging you swallow some of her saliva.
>suddenly an overwhelming since of eroticism washes over you
>that weird smell becomes incredibly fragrant and addicting.
>your member becomes fully erect, and as you try to resist the scent becomes stronger and stronger.
>eventually you give in letting her put her full muzzle around your mouth and tongue kissing you.
>"MMMMMM",she says "that was better than I thought it would be, lets move on to the next step shall we.
>In you mind you screaming that this is wrong , that you should try to resist but unable to as a sense of want falls over you.
>she then moves away from your mouth ,and begins to lick your exposed member.
>"MMMMMore", you say feeling her soft fur rub on you.
>the scent is overpowering at this point, and finally after what seems like hours she finally goes down on your member.
>the moment its inside you feel an intense heat, and your dick seems to swell beginning to fit her perfectly .
>Her pussy seems to fit perfectly around every part of your dick.
>she then begins kissing you again as you now thrust with her.
>This seems right it is right keeps playing in your head over and over.
>Finally after what seems like years you release your load which does not seem to end,and she climaxes covering you in her fluids.
>the scent even more addicting now you lay with her as she continues to milk you dry with you orgasming over and over again.
>you then fall asleep next to your mate as its the only way your brain wants to put it.
>you awake with the wolfess on top of you.
>her soft fur feeling perfect against your skin
>you seem to be able to smell her scent with greater detail, and its addictive.
>slowly the details of last night reach your mind
>you had to get out of here
>thinking she might have the key you slowly rub her down trying to find it\
>her fur is glorious why not stay here says your mind
>"NO NO NO NO !", you shout to yourself
>Suddenly as if she reading your mind, Aurora says," your not getting out of here until I say so my love"
>I AM NO-,you begin to reply as she kisses you again.
>almost immediately you give up and that addictive feeling of wanting more washes over you.
>what have you done to me? , you ask not sure if its a good thing or a bad thing your mind torn between feeling and logic .
>We have completed the bounding ritual she says nonchalantly.
>could you actually ex-plane what that is, or am I just supposed to accept you raping me last night , you say annoyed
>I keep forgetting your one of the original humans, she says, and if I remember correctly you enjoyed last night my love.
>You blush remembering how you went along with it.
>"anyone would have , especially under the influence of the bonding serum", she continues
>"The bounding ritual is meant for royal blood only and consists of a wolfess and human man being injected with serum , and mating. during that mating their bodies are optimized for each other. There is an added bonus of each other becoming addicted to their individual scents. To make it permanent both the man and the wolfess produce a chemical that can only be transferred during sex , and is fatal without a dose once a week.
"That means I am stuck with you for the rest of my life ?," I ask realizing what just happened .
"Yes you are my love" , she says snuggling against you.
"W .. w...well then I will just not let you have me , a..a..and I will die", you say.
>"Are you sure about that", she says with what vaguely looks like a smirk.
>"well then try and stop me "she says kissing you and once again going down on you exposed memeber.
>"MORE!", you shout surprised at what came out of your mouth .
> you put your hand on her boobs and feel them they are so soft.
>you realize its impossible to fight the urges much longer as her addictive sent grows more and more.
>giving in you thrust into your mate feeling the soft fur rubbing against you, and both of you climax.
>"see I told you" she says panting.
>"could you at least tell me what happened to my kind,?" you ask panting as well.
>"All in good time my love", she replies," the walls have ears here, but I chose you for a reason"
>" I don't care I want to know now!", you say defiantly
> as if she did not hear you she continues, "whats your name I forgot to ask last night ".
>"It's Anon" you reply.
>"Aurora" she says pointing to her self, 'But I am guessing you already knew that.
>you both sit there lying as she falls asleep on you again.
>You don't know if you can trust her, but if what she said was true about this bonding ritual, trying to escape at this point at this point would be suicide.
>You decide your best bet is to play along and get more information before you act.
>her huge form cuddles you and the feel of her warm furry body becomes more and more addictive.
>I will resist you tell yourself , but a part of you wants this, and that part is growing rapidly.
>You awake to pounding and a gruff voice on the room door.
>"Princess Aurora , her Highness Vlyria the third requests you and your mate to attend the breakfast banquet."
>Princess?
>then Aurora's words flood back to you
>"The bounding ritual is meant for royal blood only"
>suddenrealization.jpg
>She wakes up,"Please tell her highness, that we will be attending shortly Sir Triant.
>"I know you probably don't trust me still ,but follow my lead or we both will die", She says sounding serious.
>"what do you mean, and are you seriously gonna take me out of here without cloth-"you say getting cut off as the gag is replaced.
>"Guards open the door " she commands
>light floods in , as the door is opened blinding you temporarily
>Then she barks,"Get up human, before I make you get up!"
>once your up she shoves you through the door right into the hallway.
>you trip falling on the floor
>the guards from earlier laugh and pick you up
>stupid human, they laugh
> Once Aurora leaves the room you finally get a completely clear view of her.
>Her Body is completely white, with the tips of her tail and ears being a greenish at the bottom fading to pale blue at the top.
>You get a sense for how truly large she standing nearly two and a half feet taller than you, making her at least 8 and a half feet tall , as you know your six feet three.
>The other wolfess guards are a head smaller around seven and a half to eight feet tall
>Let me take care of him says Aurora picking you up roughly
> You arrive in the banquet hall where a decadent table is filled an assortment of meat raw and cooked.
>your stomach grumbles hungry after not having any meals the previous day.
>you realize that you have no idea how long its been since you have eaten...
>the older white wolfess from before starts to speak" Good morning my daughter , I assume the bonding went well"
>Unlike Aurora ,Vlyria if you remembered correctly, was white from head to foot with what looked like yellow eyes.
>Aurora replied almost snarling, It did I got opportunity to put this human in his place , as she roughly pushed you little.
>Good , I noticed you still have a gag around him," said Vlyria
>Yes we still have some dominance issues to work out, said Aurora casually .
>"well I hope he will be able to eat, it would not do to have a dead mate before you have children, says Vlyria.
>Trust me he knows how to stay QUIET, says Aurora emphasizing the last word while dragging her claw across your cheek cutting you sligtly.
>she removes the gag," you know what happens if you don't speak only when I tell you to."
>you nod getting the coded message
>Aurora sits on a chair table next to her mother her tail hanging out the back.
>One moment your standing next to her, another your sitting on her lap while she starts eating.
>Vlyria, sniffing chimes in, "good I can already smell that you have claimed him properly".
>Aurora hands you a smaller bowl of cooked chicken,and says, eat which you do slowly and calmly as possible as your nerves are going crazy.
>Aurora then replies with what sounds like a grimace, "I learned from the best mother"
>Vlyria then replies," well I would urge you to get over this part of your life as fast as possible, and produce a successful heir, so you can ascend to the throne and be rid of any pathetic human, Goodness knows how many times I had to try to have one with the right temperament and looks."
>Aurora looks as though this comment affected her on some level, she clenches her muzzle and her ears pull back slightly.
>she pauses takes a drink from her cup, and replies, Quite right mother I know how hard it must have been for you, having to sort through so many un-successful heirs.
>You slowly look around for any vegetables or fruit on the table finding none you continue to eat your chicken finding it tastes way better than you remember.
>"do remember that your attachment to this human only lasts as long as you have no children, it would be a shame to tied to a species so weak for to long, also give him some of the raw stuff its better for them," says Vlyria.
>I don't like what she is implying you think to yourself.
> Aurora clenching her muzzle again hands you some raw beef cubes ,urging you to eat it.
>Reluctantly you take a bite and some blood squirts out, instead of it being nasty they taste great almost as if the blood adds to the flavor.\
>continuing to eat slowly you find that Aurora has put her arm around you squeezing you closer to her fur.
>its scent addicting you wrap your right around he feeling she is extremely tense , however she relaxes a little when you do so.
>After some time you stop eating feeling full, and Aurora breaks the silence quivering a little ,"Mother may I go and take my mate to my room we have some more dominance exercises to practice.
> "Certainly", Vlyria replies.
>suddenly you are lifted up and being carried out of the room.
>the moment Aurora leaves the room she starts running carrying you in a different direction than the chamber from last night.
>"Slow down you" say afraid she might drop you.
>at the end of the corridor she starts climbing up stairs into a tower.
>She makes quick work of them reaching a large wooden door at the top and opening it.
>setting you on the floor she closes the door with a slam
Looking around you notice the room which has a large window off to the left and a bathroom directly ahead
>the room seems to be colored according to her tail and ears with pale greens and blues .
"THAT FUCKING BITCH!", says Aurora suddenly as you notice her standing in front of you quivering with rage and a hint of sorrow.
>"sorry my love" she says sitting down on the bed, "you shouldn't have to hear that"
>you still don't know how to feel about her referring to you as "my love".
>"You can call me Anon, you say
>"Ok Anon", she replies
>"lets get down to business" she continues " I am sure you have so many questions"
>"yes please no more staling",you say sitting down next to her feeling as if your drawn to .
>"first off what is the last date you remember", she asks.
>searching your memory you come up with >"May 30th, 2020 that was the day when I got knocked out by this green gas stuff"
>she replies, the date now is April 10th, 2630 by your calenda.
>Your first though is this can't be true, then as you look into her eyes the realization hist you she isn't liying.
>B..B...But how , why ? What happened?
>Its a long story she replies sighing and here is what I could gather from royal records.
> you have noticed we are all female, and you have not seen a single male ?
>"Yeah what does that have to do with it? you reply.
>Its the reason we invaded your planet in the first place
>long ago My great grand father, was in war with a sub species on our planet.
>we wanted to wipe them out, so while not being technologically advanced we were extremely advanced in the field of biology, genetics. We created a biological weapon that would kill any of this sub species. It worked, but mutated and infected everyone of my species. We were able to cure it rather fast but the damage was done, it mutated several more times infecting everything on the planet destroying the ecosystem. On top of that we could no longer produce males of our race, and we ran out of mates. the destruction of our environment was slow and unnoticeable.
Knowing the disease would mutate and rebound on us we went into what you would call cryosleep, hoping our ecosystem would rebound, when we woke up nothing was left except a barren wasteland. luckily we had a plan B and found a similar planet that was 300 light years away where we knew semi compatible lifeforms existed.Once again we entered cryosleep and woke upon entering the orbit of your planet. We never expected such resistance from your kind, and we were on the point of losing everything. At this point my grandfather already old died as well leaving my mother in charge at the early age of thirty. We were taking heavy casualties-
>interrupting you say"but wouldn't that make her over-
"yes" she replied annoyed you interrupted her, "over 640 years old. We became desperate turning again to biological weapons, that green gas was a weapon designed to knock you out until we supplied the antidote. We made another even worse error ,only basing it off two of your subspecies, when the gas was released all but these two died. You would think that our pride would have been wrecked
almost killing yet another race of people, but no my mother declared victory and enslaved everyone . We again turned to our strengths and changed all of your females into that of our race, also messing with yours and our DNA making it possible to produce females in our race and males in yours and greatly extending your lifetimes and increasing your strength . To my mother you human males were a shame, as she views you as weak dumb and inferior in every manner, and was enraged over how close to defeat you made us, and that we must mate with you to survive. She banned anyone from exploring in the technological regions your race dominated, and turned what was left of your race into simply nothing more than breeder slaves. She had her armies set aside what she considered "prime stock" in cryosleep for the nobles and herself.
>finally the last words, you heard started to make sense
>" the next thing she did was terraform your planet with the remaining technology we had. then we come to my part of the story, my mother when she turned 500 knew she was getting to the end of when she would be able to produce an heir, and knew that she must do so soon. This is when my father a man by the name of Tom was bonded to her, but my mother wanted a wolf heir and all he seemed to produce was male, then finally after 115 years she finally conceived me. My mother was busy for the next ten years running her empire trying to quell a rebellion, my father and several other siblings were very close to me and practically raised me. He taught me all the knowledge of your species that he could remember,and never once cared that I was the product of an abusive relationship, or that I looked similar to my mother. My mother was so grateful she slaughtered both my father and siblings the moment she had time, she did it right in font of me, she starts tearing up, She was able to do it since the bounding only works on us females as long as we have not had kids.
> she starts crying , and suddenly you wrap your arms around her to comfort her.
>"you know what she said to me, after she killed them, "your better off without those weaklings, your superior to any human". What she does not realize is that I am a product of the human race as much as hers.
>You push into her fur trying to calm her down, which seems to be working.
"that why is why your here, I can't change what my race has done to yours, but I can protect yours from further damage, my mother has been pushing that I get a mate for 6 years since I was nineteen,and I decided that while I couldn't say no I would get one that helps me right the wrongs of my ancestors. Your display of will power back in the throne room convinced me that your the one. So I ask of you something that I have no right asking since I have already taken your freedom, will you help me overthrow my mother ?"
>you pull away thinking, about what she just told you, was she truthful? Just from her body language alone you can tell she is not lying . >Noticing the time, as it looks like the sun is about to set as you look out the window.
>what could she gain from lying to you?
> you make your decision, "Yes I will," and an urge to kiss her overwhelms you.
> giving her a kiss on the side of her cheek your mind completely accepts her as your mate.
>suddenly you realize how dirty you feel
>"Aurora is there any place I can wash off,?"you ask.
>"Yes of course my love she" replied, "I will have the servants draw up a bath for us"
> "us" You reply inquisitively
>"I can't just let my mate have a bath all alone", she replies.
>she pulls the bell next her bed and two servants arrive one wolfess, and another human , both nude.
>"servants I would like to take a bath could you draw up some water for the big tub?
>they bow and hurry off to find hot water.
>you will make it a point to ask later if they have any clothes at all in the castle.
>Moments later your in the bathroom you saw adjacent to Aurora's bedroom, and a huge tub full of steaming water and soap is waiting for you and Aurora

"Aurora, wake up "you say gently shaking her.
>Bigmistake.jpg.
>"WHAT DO YOU WANT ANON!," she says jolting awake snarling sounding about ready to bite your head off.
> "nothing", you say silently letting her nuzzle back up to you.
>rule number 1 she wakes up first
>After a few minutes she stirs, "Good morning Anon" she says joyfully apparently forgetting about the outburst. She rolls over and plants a wet kiss on your face.
>How did you sleep last night Anon?, she asks
>"Best sleep of my life", you say as its your turn to kiss her
> She gets out of bed, and stretches
>then a thought comes to mind, "Hey Aurora do you have any clothing I can wear?"
>she gives you a look of confusion ," why would you need that?"
>"so I can cover my body, I don't like running around naked like this all the time", you reply.
>Aurora looks even more confused , why would you want to cover your body, its one of the parts I like about you Anon.
>while charming , you still want some form of clothing to keep you warm, as a castle is downright drafty most of the time.
>"well also to keep me warm",you say exasperated.
>"well I can keep you warm Anon" she says getting on top of you.
>"Just please Aurora , as much as I like your touch and fur...could I please have some clothing ?",You plead with her .
>"fine" she said slightly annoyed , then she smirked, "but you will have to pay me back later ".
>"deal" I said having no idea what that could mean.
>"so do you happen to have my old clothing lying around somewhere," You ask sarcastically?
>as if expecting this she pulls large bright white chest box from under her bed
>As she opens it steam pours out
>Inside it are... "My old clothing!", you exclaim.
Overjoyed you scramble to put them on
> you put on the underwear orange shirt ,and khaki shorts moderately worn from trying to survive the invasion.
>you also find your shoes almost brand new and socks.
>as your slipping on your shoes you aren't paying attention to Aurora who is rummaging around in the box.
>B A N G
> you turn around and see her holding your fucking gun thunderstruck .
>first you check to see if she is hurt(thank god she isn't), she throws the gun down and quickly hearing voices, coming up the stairs you shove it back into the white box .
>guards enter the room with their swords and spears drawn
>"Princess we heard a loud noise, is this human trying to hurt you, "says the guard suspiciously.
>at first she seems unsure what to say then says" I just accidentally droped something".
"are you sure ?" the guard asks eyeing you still
>"ARE YOU QUESTIONING ME"?, she shouts.
>"no, says the guard exasperated , "but we are her-"
>"THEN LEAVE "she shouts again.
>The guard then leaves the room obviously exasperated.
>as soon as your alone Aurora freaks out, what the hell was that!
>"calm down please are you ok?" you say looking more closely for injuries , I thought they would have destroyed stuff like that"
>"Anon please tell what the hell was that it almost killed me "
>you take the weapon out, and Aurora backs away in fear.
>you immediately remove the magazine and switch the safety on.
>"its okay Aurora its not able to do that again",you say calmly.
>Anon wha-,she starts
>"have you ever heard of a fire arm, or gun, did your father ever tell you about them?"You .ask
>"you mean the myth of a creature that shoots white hot metal" she says" My father always said they were myths ".
>probably because he never though he would see them again you think.
>"this is one of them Aurora, how the hell did they not destroy it when they took it from me?" You say amazed.
"aren't they supposed to be like long black sticks that are alive?, she asks, This one looks almost like a black rectangle.
>that might explain it you think to yourself
"let me guess they keep all the "artifacts" found on special humans, with the "prime stock"?, You ask.
>"Yeah with the exception of things they could identify as some sort of technological device," She replies.
>ha to think that the weirdest looking gun could pass as a non technological artifact.
Aurora cautiously sits next to you with her ears back and tail deathly still.
>You reach into the box and find three more full box magazines still amazed that they somehow survived.
>"This particular model is called a P90, it was weird even back in my time", you say informing her. "Its safe to hold it now don't point the round circle at anyone".
>you hand her the weapon making sure it is on safety You the reach into the box and find a bullet proof vest, with four more magazines.
>as your digging through the box Aurora looks cautiously at the gun. she puts it down and her ears perk up.
Aurora says, " so is it true Anon that this "gun" can punch through any metal armour "
"A knights yeah , thicker than that not really with this gun, and I would wast a lot of bullets trying to do it." you reply
>digging further you find a note written on top in a strange language it looks like two different peoples handwriting
>"Hey Aurora can you read this"
>"yeah its a little illegible something along the lines of"
>"we need to check these items"
>We don't have time, what is the possibility that their will be anything needing to be destroyed leave it be .
>"some one didn't do their job " you chuckle to yourself.
>digging further you find no fucking way, your smart phone perfectly preserved.
>you try and remember if you had it off.
>you press the button its dead.
>then you remember you search through the crate some more, old fucking food, water,then...
"AHAH" you exclaim finding what you were looking for.
"What is it Anon " asks Aurora interested.
You place your solar charger and phone on the window.
>come on, come on
>The light blinks green.
"Yes" , you exclaim.
>"ANON what is it" says exited now as her tail is wagging.
>"its a smart phone, and this gonna make our goal so much easier."
>"Really Anon a shiny black stone is gonna help us? , says Aurora.
>"I thought your father would have told you about things like this , you reply surprised
"it looks like he kept somethings from me to protect me, if my mother knew what I know now she would kill me I had to hide that I was searching through royal records as well.," she replies.
>"so we have to wait a few hours before we do anything else. You know what I think is a good Idea how would you like to learn how to use this?, you say as you hold up the gun, and two pairs of earplugs."
> "Sure Anon but I would like to have breakfast and show you the castle first."
>"what about Vlyria,?" you ask .
>" she is at the capitol at the moment, she is there most of the time. she only comes back about once every month or so to see how I am "doing", of course I will have to keep up appearances while I am in the castle if one word gets back to Vlyria that I am not treating you the way you "deserve" she will get suspicious. sorry Anon lift up your shirt and hold still," she says with a depressed voice.
>Before you can ask what is going on you feel her scratch your back.
>"One more thing Anon", as she cuts your cheek enough to leave blood.
>"OW", you say "a little warning first"?
>"sorry you know the drill" as she gags you again.
>She pushes you out the door past the guard, "come on you pathetic little human, and one more word and it will be your tongue I scratch of next ".
>Down in the banquet hall there is yet again more meat and not much else .
>Aurora un gags you with vague threats loud enough for the staff to hear.
>your unable to speak but, still enjoy sitting on her lap eating, while she pushes you into her fur
>after the meal she re gags you and takes you on a walk around the castle to "rid those pathetic human ideas of escaping"
>you walk down the long corridors
>you hold Aurora's hand under the guise she does not want you to "get any ideas"
>You see long corridors, and many un-used rooms for guests
> You eventually enter a large courtyard in the middle of the castle where a blacksmith and armory is off to the right , and a large fountain is in the center .
>you sit there for a while with Aurora just sitting next to you.
>eventually Aurora says she is hungry and you head back to the banquet for lunch
>surprise surprise, its just meat again
>After eating you head back up to her bedroom, on the way she gives you several good pushes, and insults you a couple of times for good measure.
>once in her bedroom she un-gags you
>"I think that was convincing Anon", she says
>A little too convincing if you ask me do you have to be so hard pushing me?",you say rubbing your knees where bruises have started to form.
>"Sorry it has to be this way for a couple of months, long enough that I can say I have "broken" you " she says depressed" I hate hurting you my love."
>"I love you to Aurora", you say kissing her,"could you be a little softer that is all I ask"
>you reach into the white box grab your old backpack, two magazines, and the gun shoving them inside.
>"You ready ?"she asks
>"Sure we have to go pretty far away from the castle so no one hears anything"
>She re gags you and you both leave
>She leads you down corridors, and to giant spruce door.
>Just as your about to follow her out, the knight in silver and gold Armour from earlier stops her

What's your preferred setting?
Dystopian- all humans are either slaves or second class citizens and anthros controlling every aspect of their lives is the norm across the world
Third world- dystopian but constrained to either one or a few nations or territories so escape is a possibility
Gangs- in an otherwise normal world groups of anthros control certain humans either through outright slavery or unpayable debts but the humans still live fairly normal lives most of the time when they aren't 'working'
Transaction- a human has exchanged his rights and/or chastity to an anthro or group of anthros in return for something
Unique- far from the norm, an anthro and her human have a very special, though not necessarily healthy, relationship

It would be kind of funny if female hyneas, in a corporate environment, were like the stereotypical corporate raider. Super in charge type A personality to work for, aggressively goes after competition, mergers, hostile takeovers, everything. Gordon Gecko on steroids and everyone is kind of aware that they get off on it, but no one says anything about it.

Aurora Story
>"Princess why are you leaving the castle, especially with this human", says the knight muffled from underneath her armor.
>"Why should it matter to you Sir Triant", she says sounding annoyed .
>"Just the other day this human tried killing me, I shudder to think what he might do to you princess given the chance", Triant says concerned.
>Suddenly a part of you realizes what an opportunity this is. How can you really be sure that everything Aurora has said is the truth?Leaving the castle is a weapon no less providing even more opportunity."
>"I go where I want Triant and what does it matter where I take this pathetic human he may have gotten the drop on you but I assure I won't fall for such tricks", she snarls droping the "sir"
>"Should I inform her Highness, she has ordered me to watch you, we both know how much you care for humans..."Triant says with an icy cold voice. "Why are you letting him wear clothing no less, seems awfully kind of you, I wonder what is in that bag?
>Triant starts moving toward you
>crap.jpg
>before you know what happened Aurora knocks you face first on the floor
>OW!, you shout muffled against the gag
"SILENCE DID I SAY YOU COULD TALK!, raising her hand Aurora slaps you hard
>its all you can do not to hurl an insult or yell out again, all you can do is look angrily at her until you realize what she is doing.
>"do you think I actually care about how this human feels, I don't want to be reminded that we are forced to mate with those pathetic creatures, she says in what almost sounds like a growl ,"and as for that pack I thought I might go mushroom hunting if I have to watch the pathetic creature I might as well make him somewhat useful"
>getting up off the floor you follow Aurora as she motions for you
>Sir Triant stands aside letting you and Aurora pass by a sound of disgust in her voice she says, "Like mother, like daughter"
> You notice Aurora's muzzle immediately clamps down and her ears are all the way back.
>she starts walking a little faster
> she leads you down the main path from the castle.
>now leaving it you get a sense for how large it is
>she travels down the large cobbled path heading from the castle
>All around you are huge spruce trees where you can hear birds and squirrels chattering.
>after walking for a while she leads you off the path along a severely overgrown dirt path where after another what seems like 30 minutes she unties your gag.
>"Aurora what was that all about" you ask "Immediately, "what did 'we both know how much you care for humans' mean?"
>Aurora does not answer and keeps walking
>You keep trying to get her attention, but she will not answer, giving up you walk behind her quietly
>after what is a long long time she stops, after you enter a clearing next to a stream.
>For the first time since she was shouting at the castle entrance, she talks, "Ok Anon this is roughly Six of your miles away from the castle, will it do?
>"yeah it will", you say reaching for your pack
>as you pull out the gun you realize that this might be a chance to escape or hold her hostage long enough to get some sort of antidote to the bonding ritual.
>loading the gun your mind is in a battle, you promised you would help, but how do you know that she hasn't been lying to you and is only gonna keep you around long enough to produce an heir and kill you?
>she is sitting in front of you one quick pull of the trigger and your free.
>but what if she was telling the truth about the ritual, would you kill her only to simply die next week?
>Why would she lead you out here with no weapon of here own?
>You had only knew her for at most two days
>Do you have feelings for her or is it only the ritual making you feel this way?
>If you were going to do this at least you can give her the honor of seeing your face.
>as you walk in front of her she looks straight in your eyes , her eyes look red , and she is visibly crying.
>"I know what your thinking Anon, she says
>taken a back she continues, "how could you trust me after such little time , kill me now and be done with it everyone I have trusted has been hurt or betrayed me. I no longer want to live in a world where such cruel things can happen to nice people. Just do it Anon I know what a firearm is , what a smartphone is
my father told me everything he could remember, everyone I am completely honest with either hurts me or get hurt, how could a person I have known for only two days keep a promise so big especially after I forced myself on you, she starts crying even harder and looks down "Just do it Anon from what my father told me dying by a gun is quick and painless in the right place, everything is my fault .
>She knew what you could do given the chance,she felt horrible about everything , and felt responsible for everything she had done to even to prevent you from becoming a slave.
>"were you lying to me about your mother, and the ritual you told me," a little anger in your voice "if you weren't how could all of it be your fault?"
Sobbing even more now "the history and the ritual no" she said shaking her head." But I as good as killed my father, he saw the writing on the wall and left before my mother came back , he let me know where he would be spending his last week with my siblings who would disappear afterward, but my mother who I assumed was just as caring as my father tricked me into thinking he was sick and needed her to help." How could you trust anyone who betrayed their own father? I know you were lying about helping overthrow my mother I could see that part of you just waiting for an opportunity."
>she was right even though consciously you were saying yes, subconsciously you had done the same thing she had lied to protect yourself and escape from your situation.
>You sit down next to her,she flinches ,Just do it quick Anon don't torture me.
>You turn her head towards you and stare into her blue-green eyes
>"your right,I never fully committed and I have been battling with myself constantly , but look at me now and read my lips I will help you"
>she looks suprised
>"one caveat you lie to me me one more time, and I will not help you any further , you can do what you want to me if you ever find I am lying
>"If we are going to make our goal work, we must be completely honest with each other deal?
>"deal" she replies still sobbing a little
>"just know its not your fault your mother took advantage of your trust something a parent should never do"
>"inside you head you gain a little more respect for her honesty, as it would have been very easy for her to continue lying to you and it was in an effort to protect you"
>she bends over to kiss you, she has more natural feeling than you do you think to yourself.
>"later"you say fighting off the urge of the ritual" we are gonna take it slower from now on".
>"lets get down to business", you find 5 logs and set one on a old stump
>"I am gonna teach you how to shoot, but I must warn you I am not the best instructor nor do I have a particularly good shot, we each get five shots per shooting lesson when I run out I am out I will save one full magazine for emergencies, each time you hit five out of five the logs it will get moved further back.
>you then teach her how to aim down sights by demonstrating with your five shots.
>at close range you hit all of them
>BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
>its her turn
>BANG BANG
>Both shots miss as she is holding it wrong, you signal for her to stop and correct how she is holding it.
>BANG
missing again you see she was not expecting the recoil
>BANG BANG
Both are hits, your eyes watch her breasts jiggle with each shot its hard to resist the urge to run over tell her to dominate you .
>it must be real feelings you think , you must never betray her trust as she must never betray yours again.
"very good "you say "we will try again tomorrow"
" I never knew guns would stink so much and be so hard to use", She says despondently
"trust me you will get better" you reply, "if it stinks so much to you we should probably cover it up so the guards don't smell it.
"Oh how about those mushrooms? ", she asks
"Great Idea", you reply.
>so you start gathering them
"I never told anybody this, but mushrooms are my favorite food,my mother thinks meat is the only "proper" food for our kind. I only eat them when no one is around.
"how do you eat them" , you ask as you recognize the mushrooms as portabela
"raw how else would you eat them", she replies
"seriously, you have never had them cooked?", you reply shocked half wondering if she is lying again.
>"why would you cook them? she asks.
>you notice some asparagus nearby as well.
>you gather a whole bunch.
>"Why would you Anon, and what are those
smelly green twigs your picking up", she says annoyed you ignored her.
>this is gonna make her day
>you whisper instructions for her to tell the chef for dinner .
>"You want me to what?!?!," she asks looking you dead in the eyes, "Is this another plot of some kind?"
"just trust me" , you say.
>she asks several more times before sighing and saying "ok".
>You spend the next two hours gathering mushrooms and asparagus.
>you end up talking and getting to know her better
>You find out that her birthday is on may 5th , and tell her yours is on July 3rd
>you become so lost in talking you forget what time it is
>Suddenly Aurora looks up "its getting dark Anon we should head back.
>Your bag full of mushrooms and asparagus.
>just before the main road she ties the gag around your face, and warning you this time puts several thin cuts on your neck and face.
>It hurts , but its necessary you tell yourself
>entering the castle Trian is no longer standing by the entrance, and is replaced by a more bulky looking guard wolfess who bows as Aurora enters.
>Aurora walks to the kitchens, where a plump wolfess is making soup.
she bows low, "what can I do for you today my lady?"
>she pulls a generous amount of mushrooms and asparagus out of your pack.
>she repeats your instructions to the chef who looks flabbergasted
>"your meat stew is almost ready why would would you have me do something crazy as that ?!.
>Aurora gives the chef a glare, "your Lady is asking something of you I thought you would be wise enough to respect that "
>she looks nervous"but if the Queen finds out...."
>"what my mother does not know won't affect you ", She says" I would also like you to attend so fix enough for you as well, its about time we had one of our little chats."
>the chef nods and begins work on the mushrooms, and asparagus.
>returning to her bed room you place the gun and ammunition into the box after striping and cleaning it.
>you again take a bath its hard to resist kissing her again as she rubs you down and you rub her down
>once you are both
>she does not let you slip your clothing back on, "sorry Anon having them on too long is just gonna cause suspicion".
>"is that the only reason?",you ask annoyed.
>she looks at you dead on "Yes Anon", before tying the gag across your face.
>as your being lead to the banquet hall you and Aurora come across Trian with her helmet off and she seems to take one look at your cuts and walks off with a look of disgust on her muzzel.
>as soon as you enter the hall Aurora forces all the guards, and servants out of the room and into the main hall out of ear shot
>she then takes off your gag and has you sit on her lap yet again.
>"Monkshod! ", she shouts and the plump black wolfess enters from the kitchen door carrying three plates.
>"please sit down, we can talk freely I have sent the servants and guards out of earshot,she says in her normal happy tone"
>You look at her suprised.
"In the effort of being completely honest Anon their is one other person who knows my real goal", as she points the the plump wolf.
"Anon is it" ,as she offers a paw.
>"where did you learn that its such a human expression,"You say shaking her paw.
>"from my father" Monkshod replies
>"our father", corrects Aurora
>you open your mouth in shock
>"well technically adopted" she replies snickering.
> " around the time I was three my father found her one day while roaming the castle forest, after an exhaustive search for any sign of her parents my then father adopted her under the guise of a royal servant. Being a servant gave her much more freedom as guards, and people pay much less attention to her. This has allowed her to explore the castle with little to no attention. When my mother killed my father and other siblings, we were both horrified, and wanted revenge so we made a blood oath to deliver. She discovered the royal records through a secret passage way in the kitchen.
The only other one is in her room. These are records that not even most nobles get to see and document my mothers crimes, and our peoples history. I was able to convince my mother to keep her on as head chef which allowed me and her to access records my mother would kill me over if she knew I was aware of the extent of her crimes." she says, "after our conversation Anon I wanted to be sure that you knew everything as a part of our agreement".
>your not angry just surprised,its not like she tried to continue to hide it from you.
"stop it "says Monkshod embarrassed, "all I did was allow you to view unaltered history"
>"Aurora, "continues you are to modest sister its what allowed me to truly see what my mother did. Now moving on I want to discuss our plans going forward-
>you chime in, "why don't I just wait until the queen comes back and I just shoot her?"
>Monkshod looks confused.
>Aurora gives you a glare , "for the same reason that is stopping Monkshod from simply poisoning her, its not just my mother we have to worry about there are several nobles, and powerful people who are just as involved as my mother, who would dethrone me the moment after.
>"Shoot her ?,Monkshod asks inquisitively
>"We got our hands on a gun",Says Aurora even more annoyed
>Monkshod gives an expression of understanding.
>"MOVING on "she says giving glares at both you and Monkshod. " I feel we must form a group to rival that of these nobles in both numbers and powers, and we must do it with both humans and wolfesses to make the new monarchy balanced. I found in the records that six other nobles collaborated, with my mother that makes seven people we must eliminate and replace in total. Meaning we should have at least eleven other people involved for this to work.
Monkshod, chimes in saying "yes I agree."
>feeling like its your turn, "How can we really trust them as that is a lot of lose ends, if even one betrays us its all over.
>Aurora replies" a fair point same way I tried with you a, bonding ritual, but I would like to add some more serums to really secure loyalty and to administer it in a different way than what I forced on you.
>" how different?", a little annoyed as it didn't feel right to be her test subject.
>"if I was able to I would have given you a choice , had my mother not "accelerated" the time table by starting to kill those who I did not chose"Aurora said with a hint of anger, "we bring in people who show they are trustworthy either by actions, or have a history of being honest. They, will be given the choice to either join or walk away, Then one man and one wolfess will be chosen to bond ensuring loyalty to each other they must be compatible before bonding , then afterwards they are injected with a serum that creates intense instinctual protection and loyalty to the "pack", and "pack leaders" as I am going to call it. which is another reason why I brought Monkshod. Do you have the two syringes?"
>you see her pull out two neon blue syringes.
Aurora continues" unlike last time I am going to give you a choice this will cement the deal we made earlier,its either a yes or no, there is no in between.
>you think for a while.
>"I am guessing it also makes it impossible to lie to another member of this "pack" ? , You ask, "and is it permanent"?.
"Yes on both of those Anon and it also would affect me the same way"
"before I commit, I want to know you a lot more , and I am sure you want to know me as well," you say "it would suck to be stuck without truly knowing the extent of our feelings and loyalty to each other before you add a another layer that you can't distinguish .
>taken a back at your honesty Aurora looks shocked
"how long would you wait Anon?
>"six months and I will gladly take it if what you said is true about humans having life spans along the same lines as yours, it would be rather short and I am guessing you would rather have more partners as well so we are able to develop a process of growing this "pack".
>Aurora seems to be thinking intently
"very well Anon six months, and no more remember our deal"
"I will" you reply.
>"monkshod puts the syringes"
>"we should probably finish our meals before they get cold", Aurora says changing the subject, she nibbles the cooked mushroom and steak and asparagus.
>a surprised look falls over her face and she begins to inhale the food.
>watching her sister Monkshod takes a bite and immediately looks impressed
>You slowly eat yours still noticing the enhanced meat taste of your almost bloody raw steak .
>After the meal Aurora hugs you very tight, and whispers"thank you Anon".
>Monkshod seemingly hearing Aurora , politely asks you to please share any more tips you have with her.
>after the meal she re gags you and allows the servants to come in and clean up the food.
>you then are lead up to her bedroom where once again she curls around you for the best night sleep you have ever had .
I can do one more part before I have shit to do, ANY feedback is welcome.
>you wake up again feeling her muzzel against you neck
>The sun has just risen, and its casting its bright glow all around the room
>you try to move away,but again she has you pinned with her arms wrapped around you .
>remembering the mistake you made yesterday in trying to wake her up you just sit there thinking
>your so deep in thought you don't notice her licking your neck.
>then "ow!," you say as she nibbles your ear
>"Aurora were you just pretending to sleep?", you say annoyed .
>"why does that matter Anon?", she says mischievously and before you can stop her she kisses you .
>getting up Aurora allows you to slip on some clothing.If she had her way she would have you nude all the time.
>Waking up you notice the phone since it has been charging since yesterday is fully charged
>You turn it on
>As it boots up watches Aurora closely with interest
>as you expect no bars it has been over 600 years all the normal satellites will have either fallen out of orbit or are sitting above broken unreachable
>You open the lock screen and check the apps things you have downloaded
>damn, nothing useful just a few games and a graphing calculator app.
>Then an Idea comes to mind.
>you break open the back and search for a small button on the back.
>pressing it the phone goes black leaving only a keypad and black screen.
>Aurora notices and asks, "What are you doing Anon"?
>"so how much do you know about smartphones?" you ask.
>"from what my father told me you can talk to people from great distances, look up any thing you wanted to know, take a memory, and know exactly where you are."
"I don't know about 'taking a memory', but you can take pictures," You say. You are right about everything else though, but in ts current state it can't do any of those things".
"why not"? she asks
>you struggle finding a way to ex-plane it to her .
>finding a way you ask "How, do you get information or news from a different place?"
>"well a rider or courier bird delivers it in a letter from whoever has that news or information.",She replies.
>"well this smartphone functions like a courier It it receives hundreds of "letters" a second when I ask for something."
>a look of understanding appears then quickly disappears, "well why can't you do that Anon?"
>"well the letters have to come from somewhere right? They have to be supplied from someone who knows the information, before the invasion we had "creatures" who's job was to "store" this information and transmit messages. We had couriers who sat very high above us. However these "creatures" were delicate needing to be replaced or fixed every 5-10 years at the most, and a great majority were already damaged from the invasion. Not only do the creatures that "store" this information no longer exist, the creatures that "send" the information are broken and out of reach.
>She looks like she gets the idea she continues by asking again "so what are you doing?"
>"I am trying to give this smartphone more direct instructions," You reply typing a simple command, "right now I am trying to access the "courier" part of it. While there is no chance that any of the "citizen" creatures are still working there is a small chance that simple "government" creatures are still working as they were designed to last far longer."
>you press enter
>the screen pops up with "ERROR:INPUT NOT FOUND"
>figures it would suck if civilians could hop on your "top secret networks"
>doing more digging you find the code that is preventing military sources from being discovered.
>You remember an illegal hack that had been discovered on a "fringe" website filled with trolls hackers,and outcast just days prior to the invasion.
>It worked but had the downside of being highly traceable, the person who discovered it was arrested within a day.
>of course no one had taken advantage of it ,and the person who discovered it had been called "fake and gay".
>you type in the command from memory as best you can, Aurora watching with rapt attention
>It takes a good ten minutes to remember and several tries , finally you enter the command.
>"WARNING IP TRACE INITIATED" flashes on the screen you almost close the window out of shock
>Aurora seeing you jump pulls back a little as well
>then you remember how unlikely it is for anything to come of it.
>you re-enter the network search command
>"1/1 NETWORKS FOUND SIGNAL STRENGTH:LOW JOIN? (Y/N), flashes on the screen.
>"Yes!", you yell startling Aurora .
>"I..Is that good Anon?," She asks unsure
>you nod "it looks like I found one "creature" group, if it is usable is a completely different story.
>you type the command to connect
>"CONNECTED TO HOST" flashes on the screen.
>you type the command for diagnostics
>MAIN SERVER:NON RESPONSIVE
>CONNECTIONS 4/30000

>GEOSAT 13, OPERATIONAL,SIGNAL:NONE
>GEOSAT 100, OPERATIONAL, SIGNAL: NONE
>SPYSAT 90. LIMITED OPERATIONS, SIGNAL:NONE.
>"So looks like a few geezers are kicking around," you say surprised any showed up.
>your about to to connect directly to geo sat 40, when "DISCONNECTING IN 60 SECONDS, NEXT CONNECTION WINDOW 120 HOURS:6 MINUTES: 5 SECONDS FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES". appears and you are disconnected.
>"what did it say?" asks Aurora
>"connection timed out these "couriers" that are alive still aren't stationary and I have to wait for them to be in range.", You say somewhat annoyed.
"so we have to wait 5 days", says Aurora doing the mental math.
>"Sadly yes and while they are alive I have no idea to what extent.", You reply.
>"well we have other things to do Anon, you still have not given me my lesson for the day", she says.
>everything is similar to yesterday, the gag, scratches, and rough behavior, except Monkshod giving you and Aurora a wink leaving your food.
>after breakfast you again make your way to the clearing and again teach her shooting mechanics.
>She hits 5/5 shots
>moving the log back you hit all five shots again.
> you then scour the forest for mushrooms, and asparagus to cover up the scent of the gun.
>while talking and getting to know each other in greater detail.
>You find a wild huckleberry bush getting ready to bloom, along with a couple or wild cherries , and an apple tree making a mental note for later you continue to walk and talk.
>you again have steak mushrooms and asparagus for dinner this time without Monkshod.
>making a mental note to try and find something else to eat you are at least happy you don't have to survive on just meat.
>the next two days go much the same walking and talking, and getting to know each other better. You get a sense to how sheltered Aurora truly is in some ways , and how much trauma she has experienced in others.
>every time something happens that you are hurt or someone around her is hurt she blames herself. Even if you trip and fall while walking she views it as her fault
>She can have a mask of either emotional distance, or naivety which you quickly learn is an attempt to protect herself from perceived emotional harm.
>This makes it hard to tell if she truly does not know what your talking about when you talk of things of the world and from before the invasion.
>Around the the third day the only difference is Sir Triant who seems to pop up everywhere you go , on your way to the shooting range as you have dubbed it now Aurora takes a weirdly winding route with several double crosses and a river crossing.
> "Sir Triant,?" you ask
>"yes" she replies, "she has been following me all day I can hear and smell her , but I think we lost her finally".
>After shooting practice your amazed at how accurate she has become , able to hit 5/5 shots from a range of what you guesstimate to be 1500 meters. While your still stuck at 500 missing all but one shot.
>on the fourth day you wake up and immediately smell an overpowering addictive smell.
>waking up she is already on top of you.
>ohshit.jpg
>"remember our deal Anon if I let you wear clothing you have to pay me back , she says mischievously , and you still are in significant DEBT."
>She immediately forces herself on you kissing you deeply you can barely breathe.
>The part of you that the ritual is affecting makes it seem right and unavoidable, but subconsciously a part of you untouched by it is growing to enjoy her soft touch and fur.
>She kisses you for hours all while going down on your dick, but not letting you cum stopping just before you release your load.
>"OHHHHH FUCK,!" you yell.
>"how could I not let my mate feel the full pleasures of my body", She replies
>she moves this way and that tempting your dick to release never quite letting it.
>eventually she goes all in you feel the heat in her loins and after what feels like years she finally lets you cum while biting your ear gently and licking your face.
>She does this several times, and you are surprised at your growth in stamina.
>All day you are fucked, and the part of your mine the ritual has changed grows with the desire to be dominated, and your subconscious can't help but slowly start to agree.
>falling asleep again next to her you wake up early on the fifth day finding she is already made a bath, which you gladly take with her.
>you then notice how hungry you are and you and Aurora head down to the kitchen.
Monkshod prepares a meaty breakfast that has leftover asparagus, you eat it but you are seriously getting tired of constant meat.
while your eating Monkshod sniffs the air and smirks at Aurora , knowing full well what happened yesterday.
>you are able to talk freely, and once again Monkshod begs you to pass on any more cooking tips
>you get the sense she does not like eating the same thing over and over and the steak and mushrooms were a welcome break.
as you go back to Auroras room you quickly turn on your cellphone ,connecting to the network.
>Aurora sits behind watching
> this time its Geosat 100 your able to connect to .
> CONNECTION IN PROGRESS
>then
>CONNECTION SUCCESSFULL
>SATUS
>CAMERA: OPERATIONAL
>GUIDANCE AND LOCATION SYSTEMS: OPERATIONAL
>DATABASE: CORRUPTED.
>well its better than you expected
> you type the "find location" command and have it pinpoint your location laying previous maps over the live picture
>What it shows you is shocking gone are the large oceans replaced by GIGANTIC spruce and redwood forests with massive lakes dotted around, many of the previous environments you are familiar with are still there they are surrounded by these massive forests.
>Aurora looks at it amazed, "Is this our planet?"
>"It is you" say shocked
>your location appears to be right above where
the state of Montana used to be.
>Immediately you start looking up directions to places of interest, and downloading them
>Cheyenne mountain
>library of congress
>and several nuclear fallout shelters and military bases that you know off.
>all to soon the giant words ,DISCONNECTED NEXT WINDOW 2 MONTHS 30 HOURS, 9 MINUTES, 16 SECONDS, FOR APPROXIMATELY 23 HOURS 19 MINUTES 3 SECONDS.
>Aurora curious to why you suddenly seem so happy ask,"why are these locations so
important?"
>"these are the keys to defeating your mother", You say Triumphantly.
"we should go know and try to get in there is one right nearby not more than thirty miles", You say enthusiastically.
Aurora shakes her head, "that would take too long and my absence would be noticed especially with how Triant has been following me around lately My mother might trust me more once she feels I have "broken" you but until then no."
>seeing her point you agree realizing how difficult it will be to find the entrance let alone get in, maybe you can find schematics, but this will have to wait at least two months you think despondently.
>suddenly you feel warped in warmth and fur as Aurora seemed to know you were feeling down, she had started reading your feelings with disturbing accuracy lately.
>"come on Anon we still have practice today," she says nuzzling you and in spite of yourself you start to feel better.
>soon a schedule began to develop as days turned to weeks, each day you would wake up have breakfast and go to target practice, talk getting to know each other better, come home sometimes having private meals with Monkshod in attendance sometimes not. Every week the ritual also forced you to mate with Aurora, something you were becoming accustomed with as it seemed more and more a part of your life. As the season changed to summer things became a lot hotter Aurora and the other wolves started to shed their winter coats so hair and fur was everywhere, often times you would even find it in your food. Aurora hot herself insisted that you not wear any clothing, otherwise she would constantly worry about you getting over heated. As much as you protested, you finally had to given as you could see the worried looks she gave you every time you wore them. She had become so much more open to you about her worries and problems when you were around, and strangely so had you. The first two weeks of walking nude in the woods hurt like hell until calluses started developing on your feet.
>You had stopped having gun practices as you were low on ammo,
> Now you and Aurora were mainly walking in the woods talking ,and finding new things for Monkshod to try in her recipes which had become increasingly experimental as of late.
>Everything was going perfectly until a surprise arrival by Vlyria in early june who felt that her daughter had finally broken you and that she wanted to give her a "final test " to see if her daughter had what it took "rule". You and Aurora had rehearsed before both of you hating every moment. The rehearsal constituted mainly Aurora making you act almost like a pet doing chores tricks and reciting replies to questions.
>that next day she walked you out with the same roughness that you were used .
>after reciting and doing all of the things you had rehearsed the night before Aurora stood in front of her mother," See mother I have broken as I have promised, he will surely provide an heir to the throne."
Vlyria seemed pleased," Very good my daughter one final test is all I ask.
>Aurora gives you the briefest eye contact, for as good as she is at acting distant being with her for the last two months allows you to see through it. she is worried.
Vlyria continues, "I want you to dominate him a good human mate is ready to please you at any hour, and at any time."
Aurora hesitates for the briefest moment of time you have ever seen, and replies," Certainly mother "
>she is on you in a moment pinning you, as you look into her eyes you see the pain and fear. She hits you and forces you to lick her snatch. She is berating you fiercely asking things like "I THIS YOUR IDEA OF MATING" she makes you cum several times, and covers you with as much her scent as possible. She treats you so rough that your left with scratches, and bruises,.
>Vlyria pleased, says "you pass with flying colors now on to more important things", as she has the guards take you back to Aurora's room.
>Aurora, comes back into the room at sunset she does not even look at you and is ignoring every question.
>she is looking away and won't let you see her face
>you move towards her and she looks in the opposite direction
>you put your hand on her face knowing that she is blaming her self moving her face to look in yours
>she is crying profusely
>"did I say that this your fault you care it was either convince your mother or death., You say looking directly at her.
>"B-B-But Anon", she says
>"SHUT UP ITS NOT YOUR FAULT "you yell,and before she can say anything you kiss her .
"I don't blame you and I am the only who has a say in that. You have respected my wishes and have taken it slow I know who you are. you are caring, loving, and loyal don't let that BITCH who is your mother define you any more.,"For the first time in your life you have been never so sure of anything "Take me I am yours"
>she gets on you again and fully accepting she kisses you pushing her body against you.
> she turns around licking your member, and you in turn lick her snatch taking in its scent and taste.
She is on you plunging her snatch on your fully erect member, this feels right you tell yourself, and start thrusting along with her. She bites your neck growling , and it just seems right.
HARDER!,you moan and you feel greater pressure,and after hours of thrusting you release your load.
>you fall asleep connected by more than skin
>waking up sore and bruised you find that Aurora is already up sitting on the edge of the bed
>she simply states "my mother wants a send off before she goes back to the capital"
>you can already see her facade breaking
>"what if she forces me to do something that truly hurts you Anon how could I live with myself?", she says sobbing
>"you won't that is not who you are, and you can't keep letting your mother make you feel that way, whatever happens know I will NEVER blame you."you say"its her fault that the world ended up this way."
>Aurora turns and sobs into your shoulder, "I don't deserve you Anon"
>You embrace her slowly rubbing her back, not quite sure what else to do
>After ten minutes she pulls back
>"we should get going Anon", She says becoming distant again
>After Vlyria leaves a great weight seems to leave Aurora
>She is treating you more like a servant while in public, and not being as rough and no longer are gagged constantly
>guards look at you with less suspicion now and you can travel freely with in the castle under the guise of running "errands"
>Later that week you decide that both of you need to release some tension, so you suggest using your second to last mag for some "anger management"
>Aurora agrees, she finally lets you put your clothing on seemingly less worried about you overheating and it seems you have come to an agreement. while in the castle you agree to not wear clothing, but in turn she must let you wear it if you are outside
>after so long with out wearing clothing it feels weird to put it back on
>weirdly Triant had stopped following both of you around as of late, and it was a welcome change not to have to backtrack on your way to the "gun range"
>when you reach the clearing you set up the logs a decent distance away.
>You both take out your frustrations taking turns shooting a log you aptly named "Vlyria"
>Aurora seemed to be taking full advantage shouting things at the log but you were unable to understand due to the gun
"TAKE THAT YOU - BANG BANG,- FOR-BANG BANG -YOU BANG BANG BANG" she was yelling.
By your count she had already fired half the magazine while you had only fired a few
>you were about to try and get her to let you have a turn when all of a sudden you feel cold steel on your neck.
>"one word and I cut your throat" ,says a voice you instantly recognize as Triant.
>You are about to shout to Aurora, but a sharp pain on your throat causes to stop.
> feeling a trickle of blood coming from your throat
>Aurora stops shooting to ask you something with her tail wagging and turns around.
> She sees Triant and her ears go back and her tail instantly stops wagging.
"Well well well", says Triant with an air of smugness "it looks as though this human is not as tame as mommy dearest thought. I wonder what she will say when I tell her ,and I wonder how interested she will be in that thing your holding."
>Triant..." Aurora begins with her fangs bared snarling.
>"A bit Ironic is it? That I am the one holding a secret that could be the death of someone you like", Triant says and you can hear the rage in her voice.
"Triant PUT him down", says Aurora giving a look that would surely kill if possble.
"No I don't think I will. I hold all the cards, and I think its time that I show you how it feels to be betrayed.", Triant continues not realizing how dangerous a situation he is.
"Betrayal?", Aurora snarls "You don't know the meaning of the word. I give you one lest chance to let Anon go."
>this seems to enrage Triant further, Anon is it? So you are on a first name basis with this human more wood for the furnace I guess. On second thought why don't I just kill him here and now?"
>Triant pushes the sword harder againts your neck a fresh trickle of blood runs down your neck. You start motioning your eyes to Triant's leg hoping Aurora get the message.
>She raises the gun.
>Triant laughs,"whats that going to do make a loud noise?"
>Not one second later you hear a BANG a howl of pain
open for some constructive criticism, also if any art anons feel like making art by all means go ahead.
>the sword drops from your neck with a dull thud
>Aurora rushes over to Triant who's helmet had fallen off an swiftly knocks her out with the but of the gun.
>She then rushes over to you
"Anon are you ok?", she says looking concerned and pulling you close to her.
"I am fine Aurora, what-",you start.
>"are you sure Anon ? she says starting to lick your wound.
"YES Aurora," you say annoyed at getting treated like a fragile object . what is the deal between you and Triant. He said some things that implied you have history.
"She said some things that implied you have history."(edit spelling and grammar should be better as I am using a grammar checker now)
>Aurora seems to remember what is going on around her, and what she did.
>"DID I kill her? she asks shocked.
>relizing that answers are the least important thing right now you turn your attention to Triant
>"where did you hit her Aurora?" you ask concerned.
>"OH MY GODS DID I KILL HER?!? ", says Aurora whining becoming clearly more agitated by the second.
>"CALM DOWN", you say loudly to get her attention and again asking "where did you hit her Aurora?".
>she calms down some.
"The leg like you said, please tell me I did not kill her, said Aurora still somewhat anxious.
>you walk over to where Triant is laying you can see she is still breathing
>"You didn't Aurora it's fine she is just out cold, you start pulling off her armour which is very heavy.
>Aurora comes over to help you take off the armour.
>You see where the bullet penetrated near the middle of her thigh.
>Pulling off that bit of armour you start feeling her thigh for the wound.
>Aurora suddenly pushes you aside," I shot her Anon I should be the one to find the wound."
>was that jealousy you detected in her voice.
>"Aurora, I know what to look for you," say annoyed.
>she gives you the "try me glare" saying " I am touching her not you and that is final."
>she finds the wound on the outer part of her thigh, but she can't turn her over so you can get a closer look.
"We should probably remove the rest of her armour Aurora," You say moving to help.
"let me do that Anon you stay right there", she says glaring at you.
"But she is knocked out-" You start
"I am not letting my mate near someone who just tried to kill them, by the Gods if I have to knock you out too I will, She says exasperated.
>you realise again just how protective she is of you.
>after all the armour is off you realise that Triant is more brown cream colour than the tan remember seeing in the throne room
>she seems to be about eight-foot tall slightly shorter than Aurora.
>Aurora turns her over, and you see red blood staining her fur.
>you have to get closer and be able to see how deep the wound is
>"you are going to have to let me touch her Aurora, I need to see how deep that gunshot wound is.
>seeing no other way to move forward Aurora lets you touch Triant Saying" FINE!, but you will have to pay me back later and only touch her for as long as you need to."
>Ignoring the implications you bend over and look for the wound it's a graze the bullet is not in there as you run your fingers through to make sure, while Triant shudders.
>you rip the sleeves of your shirt and place them over the wound tying it tight to add compression
>"She is fine for now but we need to get her to someone with actual medical experience, and we need to get her some real bandages as well," You say concern dropping from your voice.
"well, what do we do Anon I don't want to kill her, but we might have no choice.",She says obviously pondering the situation
>you grab her sword and hand it to Aurora
>she continues, "well I can't carry her to the castle even if you helped especially, and if she wakes up we have nothing to restrain her with."
>"well we have to wait until she wakes up then we either convince her to not tell on us or we walk her deep into the woods and..., You can't finish the words kill her as you have never hurt someone let alone kill them in cold blood.
>changing the subject you continue, again asking" what's the deal between you and her Aurora?"
She sighs as if she expected this but had been trying to delay your asking, It's a long story one that started around the time I was 16...
"I met Triant while both of us were training for combat. Triant to be a knight, and me for my duties as the heir to the throne. I found that she was a peasant who had saved up to become a royal knight. Like me, she was raised by her father, as her mother had died during childbirth. We became fast friends training together and spending a lot of our free time together. Again like me, she detested the way humans were being treated as her father was abused constantly by other wolfess peasants, and it was all she could do to keep him from being taken and sold to slavers. This was one of the main reasons she had to become a royal knight as relatives of royal knights were protected from slavers and treated better in the communities they lived in."
>you think you hear a sound of movement coming from where Triant is laying, but when you look at her nothing seems out of place.
>She continues as you detect sorrow in her voice, "there happened to be a slave camp nearby where they were working on a road, and as we were eager to make a change we decided to try and free one of the slaves. We ignorantly thought that we would never be caught. We were able to free the slave, and we even more ignorantly decided to hide him in Triant's father's house where slavers were exempt from searching. "
>she starts sobbing a little and then regains she composure after a little, "My mother had spies watching our every move, and had known exactly what we had done. She confronted me and informed me that both Triant and her father were to be killed. Triant being one of my only friends I begged for her to spare them. She would only do so if I agreed to some consequences and to learn the "proper way " to handle humans. She then sent me to a slave camp where I was forced to work as a taskmaster and forced to severely abuse humans. I was only able to cope with the trauma by the thought I had saved my friend and her father from harm something I was unable to do for my father and siblings".
"I-I was wrong", she says trying to hold back the tears."M-My mother w-wasn't l-lying, when s-she s-said, that t-they w-would be s-spared.
But s-she t-took Triant a-and e-executed the s-slave a-a-and t-took h-her f-fathers ha-hand r-right i-in front o-of h-her.
>for the second time this week she bawls into your shoulder. After holding her for a while she coughs as if this was a and goes back to her distant voice from earlier.
"When I came back I tried talking to her and explaining where I had been and trying to see what had happened. She ignored and dodged me for a great while then after months of me trying to talk to her I was able to finally do so. all she would say is that "I never talk to traitors and those who abuse.". After doing some digging I found out what happened, but she would not talk to other than out of the formality that is required of a royal knight. So to protect her from any more harm I kept pretending that I no longer cared about humans as I did before. This seemed to make her all the more angry and bitter towards me."
>you remember the look of disgust on her face when she saw the "scars", and "abuse" Aurora was giving you. You are about to say something when
>"I know Anon you are going to say it's not my fault", she says eyeing you " and you are right
but I can't help but feel guilty that a stupid decision resulted in this way."
>trying to lighten the mood you say sarcastically "Nah I was going to say it is totally your fault".
>she snickers seeing that your joking, "Oh Anon", she says hugging you.
>you hear more noise and Triant seems to be waking up. Aurora immediately gets up and puts the sword to her throat.
> you pick up the gun off the ground where Aurora dropped it after hugging you, and point it at Triant.
>Aurora speaks first snarling, "I don't wanna kill you but I will if I have to you have two choices either listen to what I have to say or try to run. Make your choice NOW!"
>Triant looks like she is weighing her options and soon replies with the most bitter voice you have ever heard, "Well I don't have a choice, do I? "
Aurora continues"I know you fully blame me for your father getting hurt, but that isn't the case I never once told my mother about what we did.
>Triant interrupts her yelling,"LIKE HELL IT IS YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN SHE WOULD FIND OUT !!".
>Aurora yells back in rage and sorrow, WE BOTH CAUSED WHAT HAPPENED WE BOTH AGREED TO DO WHAT WE DID, I AM NOT ASHAMED OF TRYING TO SAVE A LIFE. YOU ARE RIGHT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BUT I DIDN'T. I CAN'T CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED I CAN ONLY TRY TO PREVENT MORE EVILS. SO IF YOU WANT TO BLAME ME GO AHEAD, BUT I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS CONTINUED TO TRY AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!
>Triant just sits there and sobs for what seems like a long time
>Traint finally tries standing up still sobbing and you can see her wince from the injury on her leg.

Aurora Story
>Triant eyes both you and Aurora It's obvious she is wary about what might happen.
>Aurora takes a deep breath then continues quite a bit calmer, "so I am gonna give you a final choice either you do something by helping me overthrow my mother or continue to pursue this pointless revenge against me, and I will gladly end it right here and now.
>Triant sniffles a little then speaks, "I will help you my lady... my friend ...I knew it was not your fault I even knew that you had begged for me and my father's life. It was easier to blame someone then accept my own part in being responsible for a death and my father losing his hand. Please forgive my un knightly actions and if you see fit I await your dismissal."
>she tries bowing low , but stops just shortly after before losing her balance.
>Aurora drops the sword and runs over giving her a brief hug
>Triant looks scandalized
> Aurora then releases her chuckling, "No need Triant all I need is your word that you won't breathe a word of what you have just seen and we have talked about to my mother"
>Triant tries bowing again almost falling and compromises doing a half bow, "I give my word as a knight of the Lupine Kingdom, those with no honor deserve none in return".
>Aurora chuckles some more saying," always the knight, let me help you get back to the castle so we can tend to that wound".
>Triant replies wincing, "No Need my lady, its nothing but a scratch".
>She then promptly falls down.
>Aurora then picks her up it takes the two of you to carry Triant protests for a while then gives up after Aurora commands her to accept the help.
>Aurora does not seem happy about you touching Triant and gives concerned looks every once in a while.
>After having put the gun back in your bag you start back to the castle
>It takes a long time to get back to the castle nearly being dark when you get back
>The guards seeing Triant injured Immediately raise the alarm until Aurora gets them to calm down.
>The physician takes Triant away, and Aurora "explains" what happened
>"we were out mushroom hunting, and some bandits jumped us Triant defended and ended up getting injured by a weird knife. We had to take his armor off and carry her"
>The head guard suggests setting up a search party to find and execute these bandits. Aurora probably thinking quickly shakes her head and replies, " No need the two that attacked us are dead "
>the guards insist on raising more watches, and tighter security having two guards following Aurora around constantly.
>Unable to talk completely freely you eat a late meal and then head back to Aurora's room.
>You undress on the bed and Aurora pins you the moment you are undressed.
>" What the hell Aurora!," you yell.
> "I want you who to remember who you belong to Anon", she replies getting very close to your face.
>You can feel and smell her breath still heavy with an intoxicating meat smell from dinner.
>You mischievously grin, "Oh yeah am I? why don't you show me?"
>she pins you even harder and forces a kiss
>she teases your dick with her pussy.
>"bet I last longer than you", you say in response.
>With that, she goes down on your member now fully erect.
>Fuck its hotter than you could have expected.
>She is thrusting in a way that feels so good trying her hardest to make you burst.
>"Submit !" she shouts.
>"Never!",You reply barely hanging on almost at your breaking point.
>Fuck you can't let her win so easily, going all-in you thrust against her going as hard as you possibly can.
>she shudders you can almost feel her pussy getting wet.
>"OHHH no you don't Anon", she says moaning. "time for my secret weapon".
>she buries your face in her boobs.
>smothered and suppressed by her heavily fragrant scent she thrusts ever harder
>you barely hear her say, "who do you belong to Anon?
"you" you moan weakly.
>she thrusts even harder somehow, and her scent becomes unbearably erotic. "I can't hear you Anon, she says.
"YOU! I BELONG TO YOU! " You yell.
>Bigmistake.jpg
>You cum for what seems like forever as never-ending waves of pleasure wash over you, as she orgasms leaving you covered in her saliva and fem cum.
>She then stops smothering you, and you instantly pass out.
>you wake up sore and a little bruised from last nights ordeal
>Aurora is already awake and is still holding you as close as possible.
>You turn around and bury your face in her fur smelling its intoxicating scent.
>She is nuzzling your neck, and playfully biting your ear.
>is she your girlfriend or something more? You think to yourself. She obviously has feelings for you considering yesterday, and last night clearly shows you have feelings for her outside those caused by the ritual.
>you sit there thinking about how close you have gotten to her recently, that can't be all a byproduct of the ritual.
>again she kisses you and says," Well we should probably get up and check to see how Triant is doing.
>She has the servants draw up the bath, and she is even more handsy than the last couple of times touching you in more intimate places
>You don't know whether to pull away or continue to let it happen as you actually like her touching you now more than ever.
>before you decide she gets out of the bath and starts drying herself.
>you do as well and decide to return the favor.
>as you are helping her dry off you make it a point to touch her all over, at first she is surprised but seems to melt in your hands not too soon after.
>Once you both are dry you head to the physicians chamber. It's a large room with several beds, with shelves filled with dead creatures some recognizable some not.
>Aurora talks to the physician.
>The physician tells her that everything is fine and that Triant was not seriously injured, however, she wants to know how Triant was hurt as she has never seen a "wound" like that.
Aurora sternly replies "I told the guards go ask them, I would like some privacy anyway to talk to Sir Triant alone."
Bu- The physician starts
"I SAID GO!, she yells
>the physician leaves with exasperation and annoyance.
>Triant is sitting up on the bed eating what looks like raw beef.
>she stops eating the moment she can see Aurora.
> you and Aurora walks over to the bed where Triant is laying
>"My Lady," she half bows, and surprisingly she bows to you "My Lord," she says.
>taken aback you realize that technically in most monarchies you would be considered an elite, but most people have treated you like a servant bordering slave. Triant being the odd one out.
>"Just call me Anon I am not special or anything", You say sticking out your hand.
>Triant looks at your outstretched hand confused not knowing what to do.
>You retract it noticing Aurora's slight glare making a mental note to try and bring back the handshake if you can.
"Ok, Anon," Triant replies.
>Aurora does not like that and seems to be slightly annoyed, saying "and for that matter, Triant call me Aurora we are friends.
>She sits down on a chair near the bed, you start looking for your own only to be picked up by her and forced to sit on her lap.
>Aurora continues, "so Triant how is that wound healing from the "bandit" attack?
>"fine m-Aurora, "she says catching herself, "the physician says I should be able to leave in a day or two. By the way, she was very nosy about what caused my injury."
>"what did you say?" Aurora asks suspiciously.
>"Nothing Aurora, only that you had "ordered" me not to," Triant says squirming a little.
"Good", she says suspicion falling away from her voice."
"I would like to know my self, how exactly I was injured I was wearing armor tested against the sharpest arrow, and that black box penetrated it like it was nothing ", She says not giving Aurora time to say anything else.
>"Anon could you explain this you are better at it than I am", she slightly annoyed.
>put on the spot you try and find a way to explain a gun
>well...um that "black box" was what we humans used to call a gun, "You say finally finding the words " it fires an "arrow" of pure metal extremely fast so fast it can penetrate your armor
>Triant listens then bursts out laughing, "HA
HA HA HA HA, you've trained this one well Aurora a "weapon that fires an arrow of pure metal" HA HAHAHA. As much as I don't like how humans are treated, none of them could have ever created such a thing the Gods made them the same time as us, nice joke though
>After a little Triant stops laughing when she sees that Aurora is not laughing with her
"I am not Joking Triant," you say
"But that is not possible like I said-"Triant starts
>" he is telling you the truth Triant, ", Aurora says
>"But the histories they say that humans were created by the Gods for us as we were all alone", says Triant even more insistent
>"All lies," says Aurora shaking her head
>"Your serious aren't you?", she says ears dropping
>Aurora then tells the same story she told you, and Triant at first is skeptical of her, but when she sees Aurora is being honest she seems to get more enraged by the second
>when Aurora finishes Triant seems even angrier than yesterday
>She just sits there
>You think you even hear her mumble, "un honorable bastards"
>Triant speaks up seaming to lose anger in place of shock, "So everything I have been taught is false. Why?"
>Aurora scoffs, "my mother is a tyrant plain and simple, she could care less what happens to either humans or wolfesses as long as she maintains control"
>Triant then starts talking nearly shouting, "ON MY Honor as a KNIGHT I WILL RiGht tHeSE wRoNgS, I wIlL...
>"Quiet Triant I get you wanna help, but do you want this to get back to my mother?",Aurora says interrupting her
>you quietly chuckle to yourself
Triant seems to calm down
>"we will discuss this further later, says Aurora getting up to leave

>"My shampoo is scentless."
>"Oh, really?"
>Sniff sniff

>"Shhh, I need to concentrate."

I just like the idea of femdom being more a surprise
>office boss is a sweet older lady
>but likes to target the more submissive men
>sees that you're very willing to do extra work and obey her orders
>gets more and more demanding while acting deceptively sweet
>rewards you by ordering you to have sex with her

imagine how much media would be affected in the settings this general have
>horror movies/games where little humans are being attacked
>the anthros feel bad and want to protect the characters and humans basically hate how relatable the human character's circumstances are
>MMOs where humans are regulated to less physical classes or support classes
>human male clothing in the games being different types of lewd outfits
>kid's cartoons enforcing to stick close to anthros for safety/comfort
etc

I'd imagine that the world of sports would be completely different. Humans would be outclassed in every sport and every event at the Olympics.
Primetime television would belong to anthros on sports channels. You could still watch human sports, but why would wanna watch humies jog around on a field for a couple hours when there's a far more entertaining option. Obviously the species of anthros would vary from sport to sport, but for the most part anthro girls run faster, jump higher, and can perform for longer than humies.
The real question what new sports would be invented, and played exclusively by anthros?

>anthro high school gym teacher
>gets to act smug to the other anthro teachers about her job being able to watch cute boys around around in light clothing and get sweaty
>gets to help them with their stretching exercises to keep them limber and flexible
>gets the fun of pairing up anthros with humans for partner stretching exercises that have suspiciously sexual looking positions
>is probably the cause of several anthro girls deciding to pursue the boy they were partnered with afterwards
>gets to get in the pool with them and watch them swim around
>also gets to be in charge of boys sports team if the school has them
>etc

>be young anon

>part of their forest is right in your backyard
>sometimes see them walking or stalking through the edge of the woods
>dad helps the tribe with stuff and trades with them in return for being allowed to hunt in the forest too
>get brought along often enough since your parents want you to socialize with the "neighbors"
>always end up feeling nervous, awkward, and anxious every time you go
>the females are so big and voluptuous and wear next to little clothing/coverings
>since they're all predator species they tickle some part of your brain that says they're dangerous
>it's even worse since your height puts you at crotch/ass level with them
>and to make matters worse they seem so drawn to you
>can't stand in one place for too long or you'll get one or more coming up to you and they have no sense of personal space at all
>patting your head and rubbing your neck
>them bending way over to sniff you all over
>can't sit anywhere without one coming over to get behind you and force you into her lap for forced cuddling and grooming
>have to remember to walk slowly and not turn your back or else they'll start moving after you faster
>the worst are the ones who just pick you up and cradle you in their arms pressing you right into their cleavage
>they'll even try to offer you some milk straight from the source if they're lactating still
>scariest are the ones that look like they want to chase you and have lewd looks when watching you
>afraid to walk around outside your house in case they're out there since you'd be out in the open by yourself
>you swear some even lift their tails on purpose when walking by you to show off their assets
>your room is full of the gifts they keep giving you
>they keep trying to invite your family over for their festivals
>don't know how much more your hormone riddled brain can handle the mix of fear, arousal, and anxiety

>Middle of night
>Incredibly horny
>Notice an anthro impatiently stalking around the edge of the forest, stopping now and again to stare at the window leading to your room
>Get an idea
>Strip naked
>Open window
>Lay down in bed with boner in the air
>Wait

>You are Anon.
>At least, that's what your name is now...
>You are currently in a pet store, looking around at all the animals.
>Nothing out of the ordinary, right?
>Wrong.
>You're in a cage, completely naked, and being shown off to a plethora of bipedal animals.
>Dogs, cats, lions, tigers, bears, oh my.
>The natural order of things has done a complete 180.
>All these animals, these Furries, they're the dominant species in this world you're now in. All of them.
>The only species that does not possess their level of intelligence, as far as you know, are humans.
...
>The hen reaches down to you and takes off your leash.
>"Okay, Anon! Go potty!"
>You stifle a groan.
>'Potty'
>You hate that word.
>But, you do have to pee, so you turn around and crawl out onto the field.

>A but of fuzzy here, a snort there.
>The room stank of sweat and... sex?
>Even in your druggy, half-lucid state, something snapped together.
>You'd been raped.
>And it hurt.
>You struggle to coordinate your nerves to feel what hurt, until you finally locate the source: a crying, bleeding asshole.
>Well, not all of it was blood. Some of it was spooge.
>The fuzzy shifts a bit.
>"Hey there lover boy. Sleep well?" the fuzz rasped.
>Oh no.
>A hand slaps your behind, causing you to yelp involuntarily.
>"You were a good fuck last night, lover boy. I conked out so fast after I pulled out of your fat ass..." the fuzz trailed off.
>You struggle to remember anything about this woman.
>It was a yeen - er, hyena - named Pow.
>That's what she told you to call her after you fucked up the pronunciation of her name six times in a row.
>She was a tall, muscular, punky girl who shaved half of her head and grew out the other.
>Her sheer stature belied her tender, affectionate
>You remember she challenged you to a game of poker at the bar.
>She offered you a drink after a couple of losing hands.
>And now you're here.
>With her gigantic penis having erected to its terrible glory between your thick thighs.
>"Aw, look! Chucky is excited to see you, too!," Pow said.
>Sweat began to pour from your body as you attempted to pull away from her.
>Pow simply caressed your lower cheek open and pushed in, the blood and spooge of the previous night aiding her entry.
>Ouch.
>Oh god.
>It... felt good?
>Oh god it felt amazing.
>For all fourteen inches of Pow's absolutely massive pecker, she proved to be surprisingly ginger and gentle with you.
>"Heehee, that's better, don't you think? It don't ever hurt as much the second time. Just relax and let me fuck you 'till my momma's done with breakfast."
>The first plap of balls against ass jiggled your entire body and sent shockwaves through you, her explosive force almost causing you to black out.
>The second plap actually did cause you to black out.
>You don't remember many of the others.
>A whimper of painful exhaustion escapes your lips.
>"Poor baby, wanna stop?" Pow asked.
>You nod weakly.
>"Sure, I'll stop when I give you triplets."
>The pace immediately picks up.
>Pow's massive dick presses against parts of you that you didn't even realize were there.
>The plaps were deafening.
>Tears begin to vacate your eyes as you moan and grunt with pain and humiliating pleasure alike.
>You feel the hyena's paws begin to grip and molest your backside roughly.
>Her penis begins to tighten and tense, an orgasm close behind.
>"No, please-," you try to say.
>Pow's response was simply to hilt herself deep within you and groan.
>Spooge began to flood every crevice of your body.
>There was so much of jt, and she wouldn't. Stop. Cumming.
>You vomit heavily, your bloated stomach unable to hold it all in
>After an eternity, Pow had emptied her balls.
>You cough up a little more of her cum.
>"Ew. That's gross, dude. Learn to hold your lunch."
>You respond by burping up another mouthful of cum
>Pow nuzzles against you for a moment before getting up, leaving you to flop against the bed.
>"I'm gonna take a shower. There's another bathroom down the hall, unless you want to have another session with me."
>The mere thought made you puke cum all over yourself.
>"Aw, that's so cute. I'll see you at breakfast, lover boy."
>The door to the Hyena's bathroom closed, leaving you alone to marinate in her semen.

 In fact I'm looking to cook up an /adhg/ cougar story.
Here's a rough narrative.
>Katherine is a Cougar. she is financially independent and very driven, not to mention beautiful. Kat has always found herself caught up in her busy life, she is passionate for her career, and she is successful.
However, this all has come at the cost of settling down for good, and she is yet to meet a man adequate to her standards.
Maybe she is too dominant. Sometimes Kat thinks she'll end up always being the lonely aunt in her family.
>Her colleague, Zara, a human, has recently begun talking about how great her son Alex has turned out to be. How passionate and driven he is, not only in University, but also in his side projects that earn him money.
Unfortunately for Alex, his mentality and increasing prosperity, have come at the cost of a healthy social life. Everyone is disingenuous and always wants something from him.
And to make matters worse, he's beggining to think none of the girls around him, can give him what he wants.
>Kat's curiosity is piqued to say the least. This is the first time she has the prospect of meeting someone she can truly relate to, and perhaps the same can be said for Alex. She asks Zara to introduce her to Alex.
Friends are in short supply these days, and it's no surprise Kat and Alex hit it off quickly when they meet, even if Kat is older by a decade and is a bit larger than Alex.
And besides, Kat is knowledgeable and has similar interests to Alex, all the more reason for him to befriend her.
And that's the foundation for the story more or less, I still need to figure some stuff out.
>What should Kat's profession be?
(Her profession will help her bond with alex, who is studying in the same field she's in)
>What similar interests should they have?
>What aggressive courtship methods should Kat use on Alex? (No memeshit)
Any additional suggestions or ideas are welcome.

>Profession
If you want a feeling of her having a lot more power over him, I'd suggest some kind of business related profession like marketing. If you want something maybe more hands on while possibly showing the age gap, a science field with him as her assistant. It would definitely give a more teaching environment. Psychology if you want a darker tone with her using it to take advantage of him.
>Similar interests
You could do something related to the job. Environmental biologist might lead to hiking for instance. She's older so it probably wouldn't be anything computer related. Food and restaurants sound fun, but that may just be because I'm into that too. Art? If you want more sexual, bondage.
>Courtship
As mentioned for the psychiatrist, if you want to make it a little darker you could do some light gas lighting. A chemist or biologist might make drugs that turn you on or keep you going. Business, you could do expensive stuff like take him to a wine tasting, and maybe when he's tipsy take him to a romantic place to spend the night together.

Aurora Story
>only able to post one to two continuations today
>Triant speaks up as you start to leave with Aurora
"Anon could you teach me how to use that gun thing as you call it", she says "as a knight, I would be remiss if I did not learn how to use any new weapon especially as powerful as that one seems."
>you try and think of a way to tell her that you have no ammo left for training.
"sure once you are healed," you say not finding one and hoping she forgets.
>Aurora gives you another glare then takes you out of the room.
>when you leave the room, she speaks quietly, "why did you promise that?"
>"I had no way of explaining I couldn't because the concept of ammo would be lost on her she already had a hard time understanding the "weapon". ", You say exasperated.
>"well you will have to train her now she won't forget.", Says Aurora annoyed with a hint of jealousy.
>ohfuck.jpg
>it being almost afternoon Aurora leads you to the kitchens for a private lunch with Monkshod explaining everything that happened.
>"You should not have told Triant anything other than what was necessary," Monkshod says annoyed
>"well I did not tell her everything, and she would have betrayed us already," says Aurora dejected.
> finishing you head back to Aurora's room unable to leave the castle because the guards weren't letting Aurora leave.
>many off the guards were worried about bandits, and outside general privacy were following Aurora around constantly.
>Given the events since yesterday it's hard to say if its suspicion or out of fear of another "bandit" attack.
>That next couple of days Aurora has you running "errands" back and forth to the kitchens and infirmary.
>these errands are little more than messages and information gathering under the guise of small chores
>Triant still seems to be healing but is battling a slight infection, You are surprised that with such little of the medical technology you are used to it has not developed into full-blown gangrene, but considering that the wollfesses manipulated genetic code and had created bioweapons to an extent that was impossible based on human technology it makes sense.
>Monkshod and Aurora were arguing back and forth on what to do about Triant. Aurora just wanted to trust her with all the info we had, which was unusual given how guarded she usually is. Monkshod was the opposite wanting to slip poison in Triant's food to make sure she did not have a slip of the tongue. At the very least you agreed with Monkshod in not trusting Triant. She had attempted to kill you and seemed to change her mind too fast.
>After arguing back and forth and several nights of Aurora not sleeping next to you, a consensus seemed to be found with everyone agreeing to at least test Triant further before including her in the group.
>Aurora and Monkshod were still arguing on what exactly the test would be until you suggested using the bunker as the test.
>It would force Triant to either betray or prove Aurora's trust valid. Triant would have to convince the guards to let Aurora leave for an extended period of time, and if you let "slip" that there were "powerful" weapons if she was lying she would inform Vlyria soon after.
>at which point Aurora could play it off as a "camping" trip and as a way to "test" Triant's loyalty to the empire and Monkshod would poison her soon after to prevent any more info leaking.
>The guards had relaxed a little it being several weeks since the "incident", but still, one or two would follow Aurora around constantly and would not let her leave the grounds without them.
>Triant was mostly healed but still had a slight limp in her right leg and still did not have her armor.
>Having spent those last few weeks stuck even closer together had allowed you to get to know her even more. She started talking about her brothers and father something she had always was closed off about when you asked
>You had opened up about your parents as well, both of whom were while not horrible had little time for interactions with you, with your mother being in a high military command position and father who was an electrical engineer too busy with his projects.
>Though it had been fun the first week or two. Aurora started going stir crazy not being allowed to leave the castle grounds and had snapped at several of the guards, and once at you for no reason.
>Aurora had also taken it upon herself to preform a mating press about every single night, as she kept going into heat by being constantly near you.
>Suprisingly you had started to enjoy it more or less outside of the influence of the ritual, it felt good as you had never been this close to someone and most girls before the invasion were good for nothing gold diggers who only cared how much stuff you bought them.
>this had prompted some odd thoughts
>Aurora as a Girlfriend? Hmph I guess she is.
>Your only worry is with how much you had been mating with her that she might get pregnant.
>again more odd thoughts
>Being a father that sounds go- No,no no you can't be thinking that its the ritual talking, and its not the right time.
>Luckly by this time Triant seemed to be fully healed and walking about.
>You were also able to connect with the satellites again and you were hoping to connect to spysat 90 to see if you could access any of the archeived database information to make breaking into that bunker easier. Instead, you got Geosat 13 while functional everything was corrupted,and the most you could do was look at live camera feeds.
>The next window was 3 years away for one hour as it looks like the satlites were gonna hangout on the other side of the planet for a while
>just great how exactly were you gonna get in?
>Aurora finally Approached the guards with the idea of a "camping" trip
>at first it was a no.
>as expected
>they would not budge until Triant "spoke up" and offered to join as a security
>The guards seemed to be more willing to let Aurora Go after that.
>they wanted to send more guards along with her, but Triant talked them out of it.
>Aurora got a large wagon and two Clydesdale horses to pull it.
>she had servants put some wine and basic supplies on it leaving the rest mostly empty.
>You had also gotten your backpack with the gun, cellphone, and the last magazine.
>Triant had been pestering you constantly about training the last two days and when she saw the backpack immediately kept trying to open it.
>It had taken Aurora to not only command her to leave it alone but also her having to wear it herself, as Triant had taken to trying to slowly unzip it when you were not paying attention.
>You left the caste on the south road, which quickly turned into a rough dirt track a few miles away.
>Now being safely out of earshot and prying eyes you bring out your smartphone and look up the directions to the bunker.
>29 miles
>Triant then speaks up tail wagging, "Where are we going?"
> You are about to reply
>Aurora replies first, " we are going to an old human site to try and find more weapons and supplies"
>annoyed that you were the one supposed to let that bit of info slip you remain silent.
>"Will I get any training Anon?" Triant continues tail still wagging.
>Aurora seems annoyed at the suggestion of training with Triant, and her ears fall back a little.
>"sure Triant after I get more supplies, I don't have enough to start your training and continue Aurora's, "You say touching Aurora softly.
> she does not seem so annoyed anymore
"But you said you would train me, it would be dishonorable to lie especially to a knight" Triant continues slightly disappointed.
>"I am not I just don't have the supplies right now, could you stop asking I will .",You say exasperated
>Triant seems disappointed and says "ok anon" dropping the subject
>The next couple of hours go by pretty slowly as you are jostled by the rough terrain, and the hot temperatures made you constantly thirsty
>there were several times you were afraid the wagon would break during the strain
>You end up getting to know Triant better she seems to really enjoy being a knight even though she originally got into the job to protect her father from slavers.
>She started talking about the various battles she had been in and showed of some of her scars much to the chagrin of Aurora.
>Aurora chimed in with some of their training stories.
>It made the hours go by a lot faster on what otherwise would be an uncomfortable and hot trip
>just before it got dark you quietly checked your phone.
>5 miles, but it looked like you would have to get off the trail to reach the bunker
