Day 42 of invasion
>Be Lt. Darius Rupert of the PDF
>Be evacuating another supply depot as Feminids advance across the planet
>Suffer surprise attack from Genestealers , hybrid infiltrators, but they were dealt with swiftly.
>Now you're trying to get as much ammunition loaded onto the cargo shuttles as possible asap.
>And to top it all of, a local noble was trying to get someone to evacuate him and his valuables.
>Matthias Ward the 13th was inbred as they came and resembled a squig in a suit.
>He was rumored bedfellow to the late Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge
>You had no desire to find out. All you wanted to do was escape to a fortified position.
>Marching over to the mostly intact Salamander, you asked your subordinates for a sit-rep.
"Sir, major enemy force twenty minutes away."
"How did this get so close?"
"Trygons and Raveners have been digging tunnels all over the place sir."
"Additional reports of traitorous elements and Genestealer cults providing mechanized transport."
>Wonderful...how long had the Genestealers been here to begin with, and how did they aviod detection for so long?
"Sir, Baron Ward wants an ETA on transport of himself and his collection."
>Looking at the Comms officer, you decided to indulge the slightly heretical and sensible part of your brain.
"Inform the Baron that due to misfiled paperwork from the Administratum, authorization cannot granted for...6 months and nine days."
>The Comms officer does, while you grab a dataslate containing inventory, trying to find the most valuable items to load.
"We might last about five minutes against this assault..."
"Sir, Baron Ward states that is unacceptable-"
"Then tell the ft bastard to pack a suitcase an get over here, we leave in twenty four minutes."
>You begin barking orders for the withdrawal, desperate to deny the Xenos anything of value
"HE SAID WHAT! HE DARES!"
>The ostentatious Ward Estate trembled under duress, mostly because of the upcoming attack.
>The other portion was provided by the spherical wobbling mass of angry nobility screaming in his quarters.
>His servants did their best not to flinch, enduring a storm of swears and spittle.
>The baron would be loading up his private shuttle, bu a cultist had made off with it.
>His collection of 1/6 scale Astartes models, his life's work, were stuck here with him.
>After a few more minutes of swearing, he stopped abruptly and stood, going to where his techpriest was working on a special project.
>Administratum misfiled paperwork, he was about to misplace a monstrous misplacement of his own.
>The Lt. would rue the day he defied Matthias Ward the Thirteenth!
>Entering the sidechamber, he looked at the pod that had come in on a bulk freighter a few years back.
>Upon it were emblazoned two very noticeable things, the first being the Officio Assasinourm's Seal.
>The other thing was the words, "Eversor XXX"
>Someone, somewhere, had well and truly fucked up.
"Tech-priest, tell the assassin to target Lt. Anon, and eliminate any Tyranids in the area!"
"As you wish, so shall it be done."
>The Tech-priest would do his best, but the nature of the subject within the stasis capsule made things tricky.
>Said Tech-priest had a bit to much confidence in his own skills, doubly so to those who knew what he was messing with.
>After a moment, the Tech-priest had finished uploading the commands, and de-activated containment.
>90 seconds later, the room was thoroughly coated in gore, oil, and scraps of armor and weapons.
>XXX heaved great gulps of air, twitching as drugs pumped into his bloodstream.
>He'd eliminated the people who dared to co-opt an Officio Asset, and thought themselves of higher standing than the Office.
>They had been successful in implanting their target however, PDF Lieutenant Darius Rupert, his location, and what was to be done.
>Grunting, XXX tore the over-sized syringe from his arm, cursing the ultramarine cosplay Ogryn.
>Grox Breeding Hormone...a full fifty cc's...explained why he felt so hot, and his synth-skin suit so tight in the crotch.
>Gripping his bolt pistol, the Assassin streaked down the halls of the mansion, gutting any unfortunate between him and the exit.
>XXX didn't bother with doors, he created new ones in walls as he sped toward his target.
>The HIve Tyrant snarled under her breath as yet another probing strike was thwarted
>She'd been sent to lead an attack on this supply depot, preventing the defenders escape, taking as many as possible.
>Her infiltrators had been identified by a Lt. before they could do any major damage to the guardsmen.
>Their Captain was out of commission, sure, but the Lt. had rallied his men and set up a line of defense.
>He'd even thwarted the efforts of a Ravener brood and several Lictors...impressive for a human.
>Still, this would make taking the humans alive a touch more difficult, they were organized.
>Worse, her scouts, living or otherwise, found the defenses to be well manned and planned.
>Removing that lieutenant took priority...and she had just the...individual...in mind.
{{Prepare the Dimachaeron}}
>The Hive Tyrant rumbled as she marched toward the human positions, her forces moving as she directed.
>Biovores expelled spore mines toward their target to soften it up and provided cover for the advance.
>Inside a dedicated transport creature, the Dimachaeron began to stir from bio-stasis.
>Things, for once, are going well, which means that everything is going to go sideways any second now.
>The Tyranids had run into prepared kill-zones and small minefields, though the bulk of their formation hadn't arrived.
>Another spore mine slammed into the ground, releasing a pink haze that Guard and PDF came to dread.
>Anyone who inhaled it would start moving as though heavily drunk, and reported a surge in libido.
>Thankfully, the supply depot had plenty of masks, heavy weapons, and explosives in stock.
That and a few of the power dildos had been shipped to your unit, and led to a surprising tactic.
>Tyranid Synapse creatures were isolated and pinned down, before/during/after inserting one.
>While probably heretical, any Tyranid in a short radius felt it too, preventing them from fighting.
>There was a roar as another pair of craft left ground, a Valkyrie and a supply shuttle.
>Casualties were starting to mount, those who could were being moved to the evac point.
>Other had been taken by the Tyranids, dragged into the hordes kicking and screaming.
>And the last fallback action had gone well, in another five minutes, all aircraft would be off the ground.
"What the frak is that!"
"Shoot it! Shoot it!"
"It's tearing through us!"
>Ah, the other boot just dropped, now you just needed to figure out what in the name of the Emperor had hit the line.
"West flank, start pulling back, I don't want those Tyranids to overrun the landing pads."
"Not Tyranids, some skull faced fraker is ripping apart everything in his path!"
>Not Tyranids...well, that's not good.
"Sir, what are your orders?"
"Begin final fallback maneuvers and board the shuttles, try and cover the west flank."
>You give a short salute, grab your bolt pistol and saber, before heading to the west flank.
>Your about halfway there when Tyranid fire starts peppering your position.
>A pack of Gaunts seems to have broken the line, and they look all to happy to see you.
>You hadn't been slacking off in your weapons drills, and you put three of the things down.
>Problem was, there were nine of them left and they were starting to try flanking you.
>Something human-shaped, black, and incredibly angry slams into them from the left.
>Bowlingpins.wav
>Seconds later, all but one of the Guants is dead, and is being violently violated by the thing.
>There's no small feeling of dread when you recognize just what hit the West Flank
>An Eversor Assassin, and it looks a little too happy to see you.
>Dropping the now catatonic Guant, it points at you, before making a slitting throat motion.
>Somehow, you can hear that blubbering Baron Laughing from here.
"WRYYYYY!"
>Yo back up while firing your bolt pistol, mentally writing up your will and testament.
>Suddenly, you trip on the edge of a drainage trench, falling backwards as the Assassin leaps at you.
"SKREEEEE!"
>Something thunders up, casting a shadow over you, before the Eversor is yanked from overhead.
>Landing in the water unharmed, you stand upright and turn to see what the frak that was.
>There was a very large Tyranid, slightly larger than a Carnifex, and with what looks like doubled up Lictor arms.
>You waste no time in scrambling out of the trench, grabbing the creature's attention.
>Suddenly, Its ribcage opens up, as the Eversor forces its way out in a grotesque parody of birth.
>Tearing your eyes from the damned thing, you run between a pair of containers, back towards the landing pads.
>The Eversor starts screaming, and the sound drops off rapidly, the 'nid probably having thrown him.
>Already you can hear the thing stomping towards you, smashing containers aside.
>Weapons-fire and Tyranid screeching are the backdrop to snarling and sundering metal.
>Glancing at your wrist chrono, you see you have 90 seconds to get to a Valkyrie.
>Your foot slips in a random patch of oil, just a pair of massive talons strike a few meters away.
>The 'nid is perched on the tops of the containers, claws snapping at you like a pair of tongs.
>You put two bolts in it, before it yanks the gun from your hands, tossing it aside.
>It grips your boot, hoisting you several feet off the ground, chest maw flexing open as it laughs.
"WRYYYYY!"
>The Eversor landed on the claws, slime-coated and a little battered, but no less murderous.
>You manage to free yourself from your boot with panic induced kicking, landing hard on your shoulder.
>There is a lot of screaming, but you just focus on running as though a daemon is on your heels.
>The Assasin is flung into the side of a container with enough force to dent it, but is up in seconds
>The Tyranid is assailed with toxin and brutal slashes, but it isn't even phased.
>Somehow, the dueling killing machines are always one step behind you, and you manage to reach the landing pads.
>Craft are already starting to take off, and the gateway slams shut behind you cutting off most of the screaming.
>You sprint with everything you have left to the nearest Valkyrie

>The Dimachaeron had had enough of her latest, and by far most persistent and stubborn, Assailant.
>Her target had escaped, and would likely be airborne in moments.
>The skull faced creature, for no human could take that level of punishment, seemed equal parts irate and erect.
>Well, if the wannabe wanted to fuck with her, she Would FUCK HIM!
>Her lengthy upper limbs slammed the feisty little shit to the ground, pinning his arms to the solid surface below.
>Drooling lower lips engulf his throbbing dick, before she slammed down.
>Every time he started thrashing, she'd apply just a little more force, he was sturdy enough to take it.
>He might have been unmatched in terms of ferocity, but he;d been merely modified.
>SHE, on the other hand, had been designed with DNA filtered through numerous battles.
>It would only be a matter of time before he succumbed to her relentless mating instincts.
>The roaring of numerous engines barely drowned out his cry as he exploded within her.
>His thrashing lessened, and she knew for certain a few more ought to teach him where he belonged.
>The Valkaery was lifting skywards when the gates at the far end of the pads were smashed open.
"Lt. Hive Tyrant!"
>You looked out the rear door of the drop-ship to behold a monstrous intelligence.
>Tyranids poured through the gap, but towering above them were a pair of Tyrant Guards, and the Tyrant herself.
"Orders sir?"
>On the one hand, killing her would devastate the local 'nids, but a warrior brood with venom cannons...
"Do not engage, just get us out of here. We can't risk it."
"Aye sir."
>Before the ramp closes, you could swear she was looking at you with a hungry grin.
>Adrenaline wears off, and you begin to laugh and cry at the same time.
>You're alive, and your plevis isn't beign ground into paste.
"Praise the Emperor."
>An hour later...
>The Hive Tyrant looked at the scene before her, utterly amazed as how one little thing could do so much damage.
>The discovery of Servitors had been shocking enough, but this thing was in a league of its own.
>Currently, it was immobilized by bio-resin and sporting a cracked pelvis at best, and a very flaccid member.
>A Venomthrope and Zoanthrope attended it, keeping it sedated and calm respectively.
>Not far from them was the slightly emaciated, very exhausted, and very satisfied Dimachaeron.
>Another Venomthrope attending her to neutralize toxins, and a Tyrant Guard permitting the normal violent organism to suckle.
>Shaking her massive head, the Tyrant reached into the Hive-Mind, alerting the others to the threat the Lt. posed.
>Moments later, she was given some inserting information, the good Lt. was related to General Powerstache.
>...He was going to be hers, she would outmaneuver and overpower him through skill of command and force of arms.

>tfw Peggy will never abuse her authority and make you eat her out under her desk for a promotion

>You try to get out, but your captor just shushes you and caresses your head, whispering about how happy you'll be together

>Humies wanting waifurs to be protective and change a human male’s life is considered agenda driven
>Next they’ll have a movie where two humie bois are gay and don’t need a reason to get a anthro women’s to be happy

Do you think thirsty anthros obsess over fictional human husbandos? Do they get into shitposting wars about who's humando is better?

110%
Probably even more than us.

>Probably even more than us
Just imagine their forums are like during heat season.

Bovine waifurs are the master race

>He needs someone to take care of him (maybe an anthro old friend or hired help)
>The anthro falls in love with him, but isn't sure if he would accept her
>She gets more and more horny at the idea of taking him, but resists because she cares about him
>Eventually she tells him how he feels, and he says he feels the same way
>This leads to sweet sex where he tries his best to make her happy too
>He might not be as proficient as he once was, but she loves him enough not to care

>she laughs as she opens the door two cups of coffee in tow,

>you shakily rise up to your full height, hand on the armrests
>"How'd I sleep? HOW'D I FUCKING SLEEP! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME LAST NIGHT?"
>her smile vanishes before returning in a much smaller and more embarrassed form.
>"yeah... sorry about that.. it's sort of our job y'know."
>she was clearly uncomfortable judging by her sudden avoidance of eye contact.
>"Sorry isn't going to cut it! You were all kindergarten teachers and then you slipped me a fucking roofie!"
>she looks even more upset now, her ears noticeably pressed back against her head!
>"Listen I know you weren't expecting it but it was supposed to calm you down."
>You were furious, your masculine anger and rage were what kept you from those despicable mommyfags
>How dare this hippie bitch violate your mind like that!

>she gives her deepest sigh yet

>You look at her shocked, you thought that this was to break your will make you subservient.

>she continues, her head drooping with every syllable
>"within a week... wonder why right?" bitter sarcasm now tinging her normally sweet voice
>"Our job is to figure out.. how to find out how to prevent that problem. Especially more troubled ones like yourself.."
>"What we gave you last night was supposed to calm you down.. make you react less violently to us without a full lobotomy.."
>"Of course there were a few girls back home who were down with that, but me and the girls running these places don't jive with that kind of thing."
>looking back this actually made sense

>"a lot of people were hurt."
>the Cheetah looks up at you sniffling and clearly restraining tears before a weak trembling smile forms

>she was now doing full on damage control
>and from her quivering smile, you can tell she knows it
>that under all the acoustic guitar and crystal telepathy, all of them knew just how awful this was.
>you looked up at her a mix of rage and sympathy
>then you stop, you can't even muster any will to be mad any more
>the cheetah gets up panicked that you'll get closer to the thing she's working hard to prevent
>"Ohmigod I'm so sorry! I shouldn't 'ave freakin dropped this on you."
>the rage comes back but it's muted and just as directed at yourself as it was at her
>you clench your fist but your head continues to sag
>"I can't say this is ok..."
>she tries to put her paw on your hand but you gently push her away
>"but this just didn't turn out how I expected it would."
>"If it's any consolation I get it, lot of dudes come here thinking they're gonna play Hogan's Heroes. Heck I came here, thinking I was gonna be some kinda superhero."
>"course in the real world things turn out different.
>you don't talk anymore
>you are now sitting there silently for what feels like eternity
>both of you staring at the floor not daring, to look at each other just in case eye contact alone would reveal more uncomfortable truths
>she clears her throat and leans against the wall for support, her hair now covering her eyes almost completely
>"You should finish your coffee."
>you nod still reeling and a little emasculated
>you gingerly sip the warm black liquid
>"It tastes like shit.."
>she laughs this time it's geniune, "Yeah it does... come on we should get out of here, Andromeda is making waffles and I don't want

>"Oh. Then I suppose that asshole would like his drink back."
>The bird swipes the expensive drink from her and knocks it back
>You could have sworn you heard the woman complaining, but you were too surprised by the bird grabbing you and releasing the drink into your mouth
>You feel your mind becoming fuzzy as the alcohol does its work, and melt into her as she kisses you

>"He bought the drink. I was merely returning it..."
>Her tongue licks her beak

What next? That doberman trying to convince him to become a special informant? A sloth or koala trying to get him to leave the city and join their commune? A puma gently persuading him to assist in her organization's trafficking operations? A panda offering him a nice luxury apartment across the world in exchange for 'joining' the doberman for her? An exotic lioness princess offering him a big white palace with all wives he could want so long as he has many, many children? A pine martin requesting that he become a figurehead of her novel and clearly superior movement in exchange for a seat beside her after they inevitably 'win-over' everyone? A kangaroo trying to convince him that moving with her into a big and isolated bunker complex is the only way he'll be able to survive what's inevitably going to happen to the outside world?

>Getting tongue bathed for hours after sex because she likes your salty sweat and exhausted whimpers

>getting tongue bathed for hours
>rough as fuck tongue like sandpaper.
You will bleed. Humans who have been licked by big cats in captivity say it’s exactly like sandpaper and will rub the skin raw. The cats don’t know this so you have to try not to irritate them because they may get upset if you refuse them yet allowing them will eventually result in so much skin being removed you bleed.
Getting tongue bathed for hours would probably be an effective form of torture. As the skin is removed more and more nerves get exposed thus it slowly gets more painful. Ever touched a really bad deep wound and feel excruciating pain? Imagine that over a foot of skin but constant.
Anthro cats hired at Guantanamo bay confirmed.

Boys can do sports. Wrestling (with other humans), volleyball, basketball, track and field. The girls wouldn't be happy if they lost their chance to gaze at men in tight pants.

They might be faster, but we're the distance runners. By the time they manage catch up, they'll be frustrated and horny.

Now I want a story where a man is constantly being hunted by a single anthro, running for days until she finally manages to get him.

That's literally the highest rated game show on anthro tv

>occasionally watch "The Sexiest Game" on Anthro Entertainment Network
>it's secretly become my guilty pleasure
>premise of an anthro woman being given 72 hours to hunt down a human within an enclosed environment
>if the human manages to survive for the time period, he wins $10k
>if the anthro manages to catch him, she wins an all-expenses-paid wedding and honeymoon for the both of them
>though perceived as very demeaning within human circles, it's become a staple TV show within anthro society
>decide to volunteer as a contestant
>called in, meet with a few TV execs and their lawyers, sign a few waivers
>"You have 3 months to prep, good luck"
>right, totally
>brush it off, as real as they make it out to be it's hard to believe that such a ridiculous premise ISN'T scripted
>fuck around for first two months of "training", only deciding in the last month to actually start

>pushed out the heli
>black out for a split second
>nearly fucking pissed my pants

>loud speaker blares seemingly from all directions "You will be given a 30 minute grace period. After that, your Sexiest Game will begin! Good luck."
>take the first few minutes after landing to calm down from a bit of shock
>deep breaths, recollect myself before remembering: I'm on live television and being hunted for sport
>heave pack over my shoulder, shit's actually pretty heavy
>empty it onto the dirt ground
>rummage through all the stuff provided; power bars, jerky, a couple of water bottles, and a first aid kit to highlight the most important stuff
>been at least 15 minutes since the first warning, decide to take only what looks necessary
>cram food, water, and medical gear, and some other shit into backpack
>notice a sheet of paper that fell out along with the rest of my gear

>sun almost completely set, practically pitch-black
>suddenly hear a branch snap from afar, footsteps approaching, the sound of dead leaves crunching

>"Oh, that's no fun."
>She's whispering very quietly, as if we weren't the only two in this whole damn forest preserve
>Humans are distance runners, but what does it matter if she can clear 50 meters in a third of the time it takes me?
>"This wouldn't make for a very entertaining episode, don't you think hon?"
>She waits for a response but I sit still
>I can practically hear the smile on her face
>"I was asked to play this out for as long as I could. But I could take you right now and no one would blame me for claiming my prize."
>She licks my cheek with her hot tongue
>"Then again, the fun is in the hunt. You better start taking me seriously."
>I sit there for too long again, and as I get up to walk away I'm certain there's no one nearby
>legs trembling a bit, breathing slowly coming down
>and the most powerful fear-boner on this side of the earth
>can't shake the feeling that she's gonna fucking wreck me
>pull out a space blanket from my pack and call it a night

>against all odds anon, somehow, actually manages to win
>everyone is left baffled, this has never happened before in the history of the show
>wolf is heartbroken, her chance to claim a humie of her, and she somehow lost
>anon walks over to her
>she expects him to start gloating about hpopw he won
>instead jumps up into her arms and starts kissing her
>now everyone is even more confused

I wonder what demographics would watch that show.
Would it be a thing a whole family would sit down for, just lonely anthros, would it lean male or female viewership?

Majority
>Female anthros who:
>Are lonely
>Want to improve on their husband hunting skills
>Hope to eventually join the game

>Minority
>Male humans who:
>Wish to learn how to fight or escape anthros
>Cynics who want to laugh at the stupid guys who think they can win
>Survivalists
>Conspiracy theorists who are preparing for when anthro females finally abolish laws making rape illegal (which will never happen, definitely won't happen, trust us the anthro lawmakers will ensure these rules stay in place so please vote for us you cute male humans, and loneliness will be a thing of the past)

Anyone else here ever go from having no interest in anthro's to only being able to get hard to them? Not sure what the fuck is going on or why I keep doing stuff automatically without even thinking about it. Obviously, I don't need to worry about Snakelady, I can trust in her completely. And she really does have the most amazing eyes that are so easy to get lost in. Still, I kind of feel like this is moving a little fast.

I’ve found that a lotta anthros do that. At least the female ones do to human guys
Either it’s a look in the eye, or it’s the way they smell. Or even in their spit
Knew a guy, a friend really who was openly anti antro-human relationship. You know the type, scrawny, pale and just kinda angry at the state of the world and his place in it
One day he was talking about why we shouldn’t trust the anthros while we were at campus and while he was talking a tiger lady, probably about 7 foot with broad shoulders and wide hips, and a admittedly amazing rack, walked up behind him, grabbed him, and before he could say or do anything, kissed him on the mouth, like, a deep kiss, I heard him choking and saw that his throat was bulging where you could see her tongue wiggling around.
He was really fighting, but she had his arms pinned to his sides and he was only like five 10 at best. His eyes were bulging out of his head and his brow was furrowed and he was fighting like a monster...then he wasn’t. He just kinda went still, he looked relaxed and calm...and he was kinda smiling, he wasn’t even choking on her tongue anymore. I think the scariest part was that he was all of a sudden locking on to her eyes and she was looking back
Then she pulled away and put him back down, patted him on the head and walked away...and before I could ask what the hell happened, he trotted off after her.
That was the last I saw of him for a few weeks
Then he turns up again. And I swear he grew 5 inches and got like 80 pounds of pure muscle mass...and the tiger lady was with him, or I guess he was with her. And they had some other folks with them a bunny girl and a some sorta lizard, but he looked at me, talked to them and pointed at me and they both started walking my way, and I got this sudden rush of fear, and I made a bee line for the exit and my car, which I made it to, I remember when I was driving out I looked at the campus and I saw all 4 of them smiling at me.

I didn’t know tiger pheromones could give a dude a 5 inch growth spurt in a matter of weeks
Like
Dude didn’t have bad posture or anything, he was 5’ 10”. Than when he showed up again he was like 6’ 3”, 6’ 4”

No clue about your friend. I'm guessing the pheromones are what initially made him all docile and compliant like you mentioned, but as for the growth, no clue. Sometime working out can maybe add an inch as they start to actually stretch out using different muscle groups, but as for the rest of the height, not to mention the muscles, no clue.
Was his personality still intact, or was he basically just a himbo in tow?

Well
When I went back to classes a little while after that incident where he and that damn tigress tried to bushwhack me with the two anthros, I was walking around campus I heard him running his mouth, except that now he was talking about how great anthro women were great, and how we as a, and I freakin quote, “good and just people” should help them find “mates” because they don’t have many men in their species, and without us they would have huge problems.
Like some sort of evangelical for species mixing. He had that tigress hanging off of him the whole time. I would have continued to listen but that rabbit lady from earlier snuck up on me and she....its not important
But I had to break and run while I was still able to think straight so I didn’t get the chance to hear the rest of it.
But from what I heard, it was the opposite of what he was like, he always said that it was a invasion, that they were lying about what they wanted from us. That we were no better than cattle to the slaughter at best and a race of slaves at worst. And he said we were already lost because of how fast they got themselves into places of power.
He talked about self defense and humans working together to get back control and how people who dated and married anthros were traitors and the like.
It’s like he was a completely different person. But somehow the same.
But I think that he was right, about us being no better than a slave race. I didn’t used to. But after what I’ve seen the last couple of months, before and during this lockdown.

I just want to say I like that
>The Sexiest Game
is now thread canon. It doesn't even matter if the details are all over the place, it's like survivor, after a certain number of seasons they just start going crazy with the rules.

Oh God, the season/episode ideas.
>Bayou Battle: with croc ladies
>Turning the Tables: The hunted is the hunter.
>Northern Exposure: Polar bears, moose, etc
>Isolation Island: Tree snakes, jungle cats
>Austrailian Anarchy: Special episode which a collection of Aussie anthros battle one another for a human to claim while on the run. Possibly Mad Max influence.

Any good rabbit episodes? I haven't seen much of them but they'd probably be pretty good at it

The rabbit episodes aren't that great, it's always the exact same formula.
>rabbit runs around and finds where the guy is most likely to run to
>settles in to a small hole between landing zone and where he'll run and waits to ambush
>soon as he comes into range she bolts out, dropkicks him, and snaps the cuffs onto them
>the most variance their ever is is if he takes a different route or decides to run somewhere else
>if so she just moves to settle in to a different ambush spot
Rabbits have a much easier time because they're actually fairly close to humans so they can just feel their way through what they would do in that situation and it usually ends up being the same as what the human does.
I know I said the rabbit episodes weren't that great but compared to almost all of the rest of the other episodes they're pretty damn good. With most other anthros' episodes you can know who's going to win as soon as you see the human; either he's going to be completely out of breath before the grace period ends and just get rushed down immediately, which is what usually happens, or he's just gonna keep running nonstop and the anthro is gonna expend all of her energy in the first few hours and at that point they may as well forfeit. At least with the ambush anthros there's multiple times throughout the game where the anthro could win even against a fit human and where an unfit human could win as long as they're able to outwit the anthro.

>Be a human who has fallen on hard times
>Had to change your name because you're ashamed of the things you had to do to live
>Go to the Jade Palace because you felt like it was your best chance at a new life
>So you sit before Shifu, begging for him and the others to let you join
>"Please, I can't go back to living there! I'll learn, I'll cook, I'll clean! I'll do anything!"
>Shifu avoided your gaze, opting instead to look at the floor
>"I'm sorry, Anon. We already have enough students, and no human has been able to become a kung fu master in many years!"
>"Just... please. I don't know what else to do. I'll just do chores if I must, I'll work harder than anyone, just please let me stay."
>"I'm sorry, only students are allowed, and you fit no school I know of, so I can't teach you. I really wish I could help, but I just can't."
>You hang your head and you start to feel your eyes water
>You can feel the regretful gazes of the others
>But then an old voice breaks your misery
>"But there is a school."
>You look up and see an old turtle standing behind the others
>"Really? There is?!"
>Shifu looks to his master, surprised
>"But Oogway, you can't mean I teach him-"
>"Yes, human style. The way of diplomacy, and misdirection."
>Diplomacy?
>You thought this place taught martial arts, not diplomacy
>Still, you aren't going to complain
>"I'm willing to to learn the way of the diplomat, master!"
>"No, no you aren't!"
>"He seems perfectly willing to me. In all my studies, I know well about the master of the human style. He was a lot like this boy."
>"The master of the human style made it himself. To make Anon learn it to live here i-it's undignified!"
>"Undignified? The man who made this style was said to control armies with a wave of his hand, could distract the most disciplined warriors allowing for a fatal blow, and even the most fickle of people held undying loyalty to him."
>You give a deep bow
>"Please!"
>Shifu looks annoyed for a second, but soon relents
>"Fine. You may join us."
>"Yes!"
>"But! Before you agree, you need to know what you are getting into. The human style is unlike any other. It is a style that, while useful in battle, is almost useless in a fight alone."
>"I can accept that."
>"It even attracts foes who would wish to make use of you."
>"But also many more allies."
>"I'm willing to risk it."
>Shifu picks up a scroll from his robe and hands it to you
>"This style is not one I'm familiar with, but it takes a lot from the other styles, using their grace and beauty as a template. I can teach you those parts, but there are some..."
>He lets out a cough
>" Advanced techniques that requires a female partner to train. Whether they want to help you is up to them."
>You excitedly unroll the scroll and see
>"Is this porn?"
>"The human creator of this technique knew how to use the natural charms of humans to stoke the lust of many females, and even some males, that he so set his eyes upon. He could convince anyone to fight for him with even more vigor than many would fight for themselves," Oogway smiles at you
>"I'll need to know how to eat people out? This seems a little more like prostitution."
>"That's why I was uncomfortable about the idea of teaching you," Shifu shakes his head
>"Ah, but with these skills you will always find yourself in the lap of luxury wherever you may go."
>"W-well, I did say I'd do anything. I want to learn."
>"Good. Heh, I'd bet with the proper training you might even be able to get Tigress to show some emotions."
>The tiger glares at him
>"I take my practice very seriously. I shall not stray from the path."
>"Oh, no you won't. I expect you and Viper to work harder than ever in fact. Hehehe."
>What did you get yourself into?
>The next day you are standing in the training room with Shifu
>He hands you two fans which you gratefully take
>"While your uniform is being made, we shall practice. Now, this style makes heavy use of fans, but they are less weapons and more a way to help your charm. You can also see through them with the right angle."
>He does some dance moves with the fan that would probably look seductive if they weren't being done by the small, old kung fu teacher
>You can't help but let out a chuckle
>"Yes, uh, it doesn't translate well to red pandas. Now you try it."
>You make an attempt, but from the cringe coming from him you can tell it doesn't look good
>"No, turn your hips and let the motion push your arms naturally. That's too robotic."
>Again
>"The main trick is that you want to keep their attention on your body while hiding your face. Then give them a glimpse of your eyes."
>"Could I get a mirror or something? It might help a little if I could see what I am doing."
>"Hmm, yeah, might be a good idea. This is a lot more visual than the others."
>You sorely regret getting the mirror
>Now you have a good view of all your failures
>Looking 'seductively' at yourself just feels wrong
>You are at least getting better at hiding your face with the fans, because you don't want to see the shame on your face
>Still not good at the peaking come hither look
>"Anonymous, the scroll may say that a shy look is a great weapon in your arsenal, but it emphasizes switching between the two whenever useful."
>"I know, I know! I'm trying!"
>"I think you need a break, you got better, but now you're getting a bit sloppy."
>"But master!"
>"Constant work can hinder progress. You need a break."
>You slump your shoulders in disappointment
>"Do not think that doesn't mean you won't be improving still. Martial arts is a way of life, so even when the training is over you can still improve. You've got homework."
>"Really?"
>"Yes. Keep the fans and try to keep others from seeing your face with them. Even in the presence of others this elegance must be maintained, or else the illusion may be broken.
>"But first we need to wash you up a bit, you can borrow one of the bath gowns after this, those tattered things would hinder you. They also don't look very comfortable."
>You feel grateful for the practice, but at the same time you want to curse him
>"Anon, do you really need to keep those fans up at the dinner table?" Crane asks, giving a strained smile
>"It's homework."
>"Wait, you have to do that all day?" Mantis asked, raising one of her minuscule eyebrows
>"Yes. Something about not breaking the illusion. I need to be seductive"
>"Well, I think you look good," Monkey says with a wink
>You hold the fan closer to you as your face starts to burn
>"Thanks, but I'm really not good at it. I mean I've just started and I've hardly practiced. I don't think I've made enough progress to warrant compliments."
>"Maybe not, but when you definitely have the looks of a master!"
>You unconsciously pull down the fan a bit in surprise, but quickly manage to pull it back up
>"I knew you had a nice face behind all that dirt," Viper kindly smiled
>Tigress' face lights up a small bit before returning to her usual stoic self
>You continue eating in silence for a bit before Tigress speaks
>"Are you planning on learning those other techniques?"
>"Other techniques?"
>"The ones that require a partner?"
>You stare at her in surprise
>It isn't long before Monkey breaks the silence
>"If you need a partner, I wouldn't mind...?" she says, scratching the back of her head
>"I... I already know a few things."
>"Really? Of course, I'm not surprised. With a face like yours of course you spent some time with some ladies."
>"Don't be so uncouth, Monkey."
>"Hey, I'm just offering to help. You get a lot of practice?"
>You get up
>"More than I wish I ever had."
>You leave the room as the rest fall silent

You think anthros post cute humans getting fucked by old, fat bitches to piss other anthros off?
>anon's sitting on a couch
>"whats your name?"
Ano-
>two big titty/booty, polar bears come in and ICE anon.

I imagine it would piss human women off even more. Imagine being 10/10 human Stacy in the prime of your youth with a perfect movie star face and figure and seeing all the human men going out with something like pic related. Imagine the seething at knowing that the cute guy you've been crushing on is getting fucked into the mattress by some 7ft tall forty/fifty something she-beast, who likes like her diet consists of sausage and beer.

Tigress Story
>The pain in your limbs made it hard to focus
>The jumping and ducking was hard enough, but having to keep shifu from getting a clear view of your face
>You tried to cheat once by just not facing him, but then he'd just jump at you and kick you
>Worse, he said that eventually you're going to need to do fancy maneuvers while going through the obstacle course
>You've seen the others do their dodge practice, and while theirs may be a sight to behold they were also fairly simple
>You, you had to learn every single acrobatic move from each school
>'Beauty is in each style. You must flow like each of them, with speed, power, fluidity, flexibility, and become near impossible for someone to guess. You should reach any position and move with any blow at any time.'
>When you asked why the others don't do this stuff, he just said it's to make up for your lack of combat skill
>You also aren't as capable of specializing as the others, so since you can't be perfect at one of them, you'll have to be good at all of them
>At least you have more time to learn how to move, since this style has almost no attacks
>"That is enough."
>You jump out of the course, breathing heavily
>"The one thing I always found remarkable about you humans is how you can work for so long and still keep the same mien about you."
>You'd chuckle at this if you weren't so tired
>He's talking about you keeping a mien, and yet here you are gulping down air like a man who almost drowned
>You'd love to collapse on the ground if it didn't break down your image any more than it already is
>He hands you some water, which you gladly drink
>"Now, your uniform is finally done. I'd like for you to change into it."
>Having finally caught your breath and cooled down, you manage to ask speak
>"Really?"
>"Yes. I think it came out well. It's a lot like the previous master's. From now on, you'll need to wear this whenever you practice."
>With a nod, you grab the clothes and head to the changing room
>Closing the door, you take the clothes and unfold them
>Only then do you realize his words
>You saw pictures of the last master, and the clothes were a little
>Showy
>M-maybe if you put them on it won't be as bad

>Oh, it is definitely bad
>There are openings along it that shows off plenty of your more masculine features
>But at the same time, if you move just right the flaps of cloth along it hides it
>Just barely
>There's even an opening along the crotch
>It's like it's made to have people look, hoping to catch a glimpse of something more
>And you need to be careful or else someone might actually get that glimpse
>You walk around the room a bit, looking in the mirror to make sure you aren't showing anything indecent
>When you are finally find a gait that's good enough, you leave
>Shifu sees you and and quickly turns around around
>"I'm glad you've managed to get the walk down."
>"Yeah. Do I really need to wear this?"
>"I'm afraid so. It is meant to be very distracting, and you'll need to learn how to dodge in that."
>"Wait, I need to dodge in this? But what if I trip on the flappy bits, or show-"
>"That is what training is for. I assure you, I'm not happy about this either."
>At that moment, the others walk in
>"So then I caught it with-woah."
>They all gawk at you
>Even Tigress' mouth is open a bit in surprise
>"Uh, hello." you wave to them
>They wave back
>"Is this going to be your new look?" Crane asks, her face hidden behind her wing
>"Yes. This is an important part of the style, so you must get used to it."
>"Anonymous, you don't feel embarrassed in... that, are you?"
>Before you can answer, Shifu speaks
>"Yes. It is important that Anonymous not embarrass himself in public, so you I am giving you all the task to tell him if he shows anything too revealing
>They all swap to their stoic faces and give a yes sir
>That face hiding training is going to come in handy soon you feel

>After that, she's constantly having sex with you, and she's never not filled with children
>She says it's because she needs to save her species
>You're pretty sure she just has an impregnation fetish

>Shark mommies
Pfft, they aren't all cute and cuddly anon, I'll tell you that off the bat. The dolphins are rapists to the core and the sea lions are always wanting you to do weird harem shit, but at least they can't be randomly triggered like you said an MK ultra codeword. This happened to me just the other month
>Finally finished work, head on out and down the block
>Live on the coast, lots of wind off the nearby bay in the evenings
>Cool dusk comes, with my hands in my pockets, my... empty pockets
>Forgot my rape whistle, pepper spray in my locker at work
>Fuck
>Hurriedly run back home through the empty streets, water sloshing as the tide rolls in
>Two blocks out when I trip on a fucking curb and skin my knee
>Hurriedly pull up my pants leg, praying quietly
>For a moment it's just the white of scraped skin
>Then blood pools to the surface
>Sprinting now, I can see my house at the midsection of the block
>"Are you okay, baby?" A voice giggles, not too far behind me
>I bodyslam my door and thank god I switched to a fingerprint lock as I get inside
>Standing in the hall, a moment passes before I see the handle jiggle just a moment
>"I just want to make sure you're okay! C'mon, open up! I-I'm a nurse shark..."
>Silence

Sharks go into a trance-like state if you can get them belly-up in the water. it's referred to as Tonic Immobility.
And at least sharks are more wholesome than dolphins.

Yeah, the dolphins around here are just fucking hedonists. "Fuck my blowhole" "This pussy is internally muscled, humie boy" just absolute raunch 24/7. I have to say the rare sea turtle chicks who come through are the chillest, they all only eat vegetarian and get real down on you if you have a burger or something though. i'm just especially afraid because I might be going back to work soon, and if she wasn't just making a lame joke and really is a nurse shark, end of June starts her breeding season. Nurse shark litters are fucking huge! I can't afford that.

Day 48 of invasion
>Be Anthony Wallace, medical student and overworked essential worker.
>You'd been run ragged over the last few weeks dealing with an influx of refugees and resultant minor injuries.
>Despite the valiant and unusual methods the Guard and the PDF were using, they were losing ground steadily to the Tyranids.
>The saving grace of the 'nids not sending hordes of their own number at them was good.
>The fact that the Xenos were using Imperial Guard tactics and equipment in some cases was alarming.
>For the town of Gambrok, there would be no escape, they'd been encircled days ago.
>For you however, you'd been dealing with far, far worse things than putting people's guts back inside them.
>An involuntary shudder raced down you frame, as you wondered if the Tyranids were even aware of what they were doing?
>By the Emperor, you'd had the misfortune of learning how an undying erection got treated.
>And then there were the other things the Tyranids did to people.
>First, there were the victims of the paralytic quills, and while those were easy to remove, the left noticeable side effects.
>Most notably impaired movement and a flushed face, and perhaps a bit of excessive drooling.
>Thankfully, you just made sure any of the incapacitated soldiers didn't stumble to their deaths before the toxins worked their way out.
>Second was the spore victims, anyone inhaling them felt very hot, very drunk, and very horny.
>Again, you mostly monitored them and kept them from trying to wander off.
>Otherwise they might attempt to molest the medical servitors.
>Several personnel had gotten covered in bio-resin, which oddly enough dissolved upon contact with human saliva.
>In developing a solution to this, the Magos convinced you that he was outright mad.
>And finally, you had removed 96 Ripplers from the crotches of Guardsmen, PDF, and idiot teenagers.
>Fortunately, you were able to remove the little buggers without them biting off any important bits.
>Unfortunately, earlier in the morning, the lines had fallen, and Tyranids were moving from street to street.
>Now everyone was scrambling for shelter and weapons, or seeking one last moment of peace.
>The Tyranids didn't kill humans, mostly, but if one was threatening or had killed his fellow man...
>It seemed the only thing the Tyranids wanted was to...fornicate with any guy they came across.
>You ducked under a fallen beam blocking the street, gazing at the corpse of a flying Tyranid.
>It was massive, having smashed though a building on its way down, and oozed out across the street.
>All around the town, battle sounded off again and again, as the Tyranids advanced.
>The streets were empty, mostly because everyone was hiding, or flying Tyranids had picked off everyone.
>It had been tempting to wait for the inevitable back at the clinic, but you figured you could hide down in one of the old sewer pipes.
>You've done so in the past, there were few, if any mutants to speak of, and you knew an out of the way place...
>These was shouting and gunfire up ahead, and the screeching chittering of Tyranids.
>You stopped short, before ducking down an alleyway to escape the fighting, pistol raised.
>Your legs ached from all the running, and he cursed his lack of foresight by waiting for the next transport.
>There had been fighting just down the street when the men guarding the place said that you'd best run.
>Bracing yourself, you exited the far end of the alleyway, and emerged into combat zone.
"Keeps firing!"
>The red strobe and cracks of las-fire contrasted with the firing of Tyranid weaponry.
>You had to flatten yourself against a wall as the foot of a Sentinel walker stomped down before you.
>Heat from the multi-las firing cause you to shrink back, but not before one of the soldiers noticed you.
"Get down civilian!"
"Shit, I knew we lost the outer line, how far in are they?"
"Lines are collapsing backwards, you have a gas mask right?"
>You nod, pulling it out.
"Good, put it on, we;re heading to the Arbites' Headquarters, don't need another person going down ."
>Right, apparently he doesn't know you lack major medical experience, but given how bad things are...
>The multi-las is probably the only thing keeping the Guants from pouring up the street as the squad begins to withdraw
>Then something slams down into the middle of the squad, before unfurling.
"Rippler Ball!"
>At those words, several of the small toothy critters wriggle forth faster than one would think.
>The Guardsmen do their best to shoot the small things, before they can attach themselves in a very vulnerable spot.
>You stomp on the closest one, feeling its body give and crack slightly under your boot.
>Several of the Guardsmen also are successful at shooting the little buggers, a few are not.
"AGH! HELP!"
"Not Again, no."
>Something large and fleshy lands further back in the street, pouring out an immense amount of spores.
>The pink fog wasn't lethal, but it did obscure vision and gradually incapacitate anyone who breathed it too long.
"Grenades out!"
>Explosions tor up the street, and everyone pulled back, save for one man who was trying to free his junk.
>The Sentinel sprayed las-fire into the smoke, walking backwards, paying little attention.
>Massive metal feet stomp all to close to you, as you begin retreating from the makeshift barricade.
"Auspex Contact! Large Xenos specimen approaching!"
>There is a lashing sound, like heavy flesh whips, and a half dozen tendrils are wrapped about the Sentinel's raised leg.
>It tries to aim at whatever is holding it, but more suddenly strike the multi-las with enough force to bend it.
"Move!"
>With a groan, the walker falls over, legs kicking as it is dragged back into a thickening wall of fog.
>Metal squeals and screeches as you and the rest of the Guardsmen run like hell.
"Emperor's mercy, they're tearing open the hatch!"
>The doomed machine and it's crew is left behind, as your small group begins firing back.
"The frak was that?"
>You weren't sure, but hopefully you never found out.
>It was a running gun battle in low visibility while wearing a gas mask, in a fair world, the 'nid would have it just as bad.
>Life wasn't fair however
>The Tyranids were never affected by their own toxins.
>They were without number, and hey adapted to everything.
>A small flock of Gargoyles swooped down on the squad, carrying several of them off.
>Then the large thing following you though the smoke grabbed another two, yanking them back.
>At this point, you just ran, stumbling through the streets heading deeper into the city
>You could hear the thumps of whatever was perusing you, but the fog was to thick to see through
>The city was getting bombarded with spore mines, and the sounds of battle were dying down.
>Suddenly, someone collided with you, sending you both sprawling to the ground.
>The las-pistol clatters away, and you do your best to untangle yourself from the man.
"We need to run."
"More Tyranids?"
"No, the priest, he's gone mad."
"I assure you my sons, that I am most certainly sane."
>Ordinarily, that tone of voice would have been a bit too insistent for your tastes.
>Not so today, as you beheld the priest the man was running from.
>The faithful servant of the Ecclesiarchy is wearing a smile, and holding a flamer.
>Never a good combination, under any circumstances.
"Father, please, think about what you're doing."
>It's hard to read his expression through a gas mask, but you have no doubt he's cracked.
"I am saving souls from eternal damnation at the hands of the foul Xenos child, I do what must be done.
>You've gotten half the sleep you need and have been worked to the bone helping inured.
>Despite all this, you figure you can try reasoning with the man.
"Listen to me, you should be helping your fellow man in their time of need, not burning them."
>He levels the flamer at you, the pilot light stuttering in the thick fog.
"Tis the only way I can save you, may the Emperor forgive me for what I must do, and may your suffering come to an end."
*fwip*
>The flamer jerks suddenly, as a pale, fleshy tentacle wraps about it.
*fwip* *Fwip*
>The priest is lifted off the ground, struggling against whatever is holding him.
"Now now, that's not a very nice thing to do."
"Unhand me foul beast!"
>His mask is ripped off by another tentacle, his face red and eyes wide with panic.
"Oh sure, hold your breath, you'll need to breathe eventually."
>The fog has cleared enough to reveal the particular Tyranid, nearly the size of a chimera,
>It was if the 'nids had decided they didn't have something with enough tentacles.
>She had a dozen arm tentacles, twice as many around her mouth, and the biggest pair of breasts you'd ever seen.
>There's the whine of a las-pistol, followed by the unoccupied arm full of tentacles lashing at the other man.
>A second later, he's as tied up as the priest, fully immobilized and exposed to the spores.
"Seems I will need to give you both an injection to keep you calm."
>Each of her tentacles has a sharp tip, which she jabs into them for a moment.
>After a few seconds, they go limp, and are laid down on the street carefully.
"well now, with that out of the way, I have a question for you cutie."
>WHAT?
"What?"
"Ready for your massage~"
>Oh no, you do not like where this is going.
>A moment later her tentacles are all over you, the whip-like appendages wrapping about your body and limbs.
>Your struggling could best be described as pointless, each of the tentacles is steely muscle in a thin package.
>That, and there are a dozen of them, rubbing and squeezing your body pretty much everywhere.
"My my," She croons "Whatever have you been doing? You have so many knots. So tense."
>Well, not everywhere, she seems to be avoiding your crotch for the moment.
>Still, her "massage" feels good, not that you have any experience with such a luxury.
"Most of the girls wouldn't hesitate to pounce on you without so much as getting your name, let alone consent."
>You'd reply, but you were a little preoccupied with all the squeezing along your legs and feet.
>Wait, What?
>Now that you're paying attention again, she's slipped off your boots and socks with her motions.
>Your clothing is also being slowly sliced up by the little blades at the ends of her appendages.
>That, and feels like the filter's clogged on your gas mask...she's producing a cloud of those damned spores.
"Now, I think you silly little mask isn't working, if your thrashing is anything to go by...let's see that cute face."
>Before you can protest, the mask has been neatly sliced off your face, which comes under immediate assault by caressing tentacles.
"You are sooo cute~. What's your name?"
"Wallace,"
>Already a few breaths in and the spores are doing their work, you feel drunk, you feel good, you feel hot.
>There really wasn't much you could do anyhow, and the Tyranid was polite enough to not obliterate your pelvis on sight.
"Aww...that's adorable. All you need to know about me, is that I am yours. All you have to do~oo....is ask."
>Its obvious what she is referring to, she's stripped you down to your boxers
>She could physically force herself on you like the rest of the 'nids, but she doesn't have to.
>It would be as easy as injecting Tyranid brand aphrodisiac into your bloodstream and you'd be all over her.
>Your dick is so hard it hurts, everything feels hot, and she is nice....smells nice...
"Please"
"Don't try holding back, just relax. Resisting won't help you, you're already mi~ne."
>Her mouth tentacles descend on your junk, causing you to lurch.
>Every nerve in your body is played like the strings of an instrument, and she has mastered it.
>You're limp as a wet noodle, and a nap is fully in order, not like you can do anything else.
"SOMEONE HELP!"
>The frak?
>You shift and spot a Guardsman doubled over almost, hands trembling around his crotch.
"IT WON'T STOP SUCKING, IT HURTS!"
"Nurse," you slur, "I need some supplies."
"Oh don't worry, I'll handle this."
>Be Commissar Wolfe
>Be at a command meting in Hive Sydney.
>Be witness to many acts insane and heretical, and somehow actually working.
>Be nursing a cup of recaff ans General Powerstache goes over defense plans.
>Suddenly, the General lurches forward, his mustache bristling.
"What's happening."
>General Powerstache stares out into the distance for a moment while his facial hair makes alarming twitches.
"The penultimate battle approaches, may the Emperor protect us all."

>Be unlucky in love
>You're pretty sure you're cursed
>When you were in high school you went to a buddhist alter on a trip to Japan and prayed that you could get a girl
>You went out with a girl and had sex at her house on the first day
>At first you thought you were lucky
>But you soon woke up naked in a dumpster, and outside you found a laughing fox
>No, not a fox, a kitsune
>"I can't believe you actually fell for the 'sex on the first date' trick!"
>It had been an illusion
>After you realized you had been tricked you were about to chase her, but running around town naked wouldn't be a pretty picture
>After that, shit like that kept happening
>Another girl asks you out and it lasts longer, but you wake up to find that damn fox again
>Then again
>The next girl who asked you out, you ended up yelling at telling the kitsune to leave you alone
>She left in tears, and you heard cackling from behind you
>"Can't believe you let her go! You really are something, aren't you?"
>By college you decided to ask a girl out for once, because you are pretty paranoid that anyone who asks you is that kitsune
>She said yes
>The data was a disaster though
>The restaraunt was slow, something kept kicking her from under the table that you swore wasn't you, and you spilled her drink on her when you went to the bathroom even though your arm wasn't that close to the glass
>She decided against a second date
>And again this happened
>You started getting a reputation for being an awful date, and because you kept turning girls down people started wondering if you were purposefully sabotaging them
>Eventually you just started accepting the dates, and that girl is eventually replaced by a fox every time
>She tells you that no human could ever be with a fox fucker like you, and at this rate you'll either die alone or end up marrying her
>You've given up expecting someone else
>You've accepted love for you will always be a cruel prank made by that thing
>You were sent to be his wife, but you couldn't help yourself
>The first time was supposed to be a joke, a one time thing
>But that face he made when he was disappointed, you loved it
>Whenever you ran off you had to touch herself, you couldn't help but be turned on
>You just wished she could have him make that face and have him afterwards
>The date was wonderful, you loved every moment, but nothing could have topped that face
>A pure hopeful love crushed
>You could have told him that she was sent to be his wife, but she had to see it more and more
>And every time he made it the better it got
>He tried to get other girlfriends, but you fixed that, and it got even better
>Now he's running into your arms even when he should know it's you
>He thinks those kisses are just jokes but he always accepts them because he thinks they are fake
>You've tried to tell him the truth but he calls you a liar when you do
>And he makes that wonderful face
>It's easier and so fulfilling to make him think it's false
>You know it's true, every kiss, every hug, every bite along the nape of his neck, every whisper of affection
>He needs you, he clings to you like a rock in a river that would sweep him away
>His kisses are so sweet, letting out hiccups as you touch him
>You ask if he's okay but he doesn't answer, only holds on tighter
>You lick away his tears and let your hands search him like it's your first time
>But you've felt every crevice, every bump, every piece, and you know it's all yours
>He's so perfectly fragile
>His desires are so pure despite everything
>He gives and gives and you only take it away
>The truth you give to him is not something he can accept
>If he really knew the truth, what would he say?
>What would he do?
>Why are you scared?
>You can always follow him
>He would view your actions more kindly knowing you are a girl in love
>Yet you feel like he'd be angry
>It couldn't hurt him more than you already have
>So why
>Why, why, why do you keep doing it?
>It feels like it would stain him
>Helplessness turned to anger
>He loves you
>But he'd hate you
>But he already hates you
>But he doesn't show it
>But he hopes that you love him
>But he shouldn't love you
>If you loved him he'd hate you
>You're a monster
>A curse placed upon him
>To think he could love you is arrogance of the highest order
>You don't deserve it, and he shouldn't give it to you
>He clings to you in fear if what you've brought on him
>A fear of being alone
>But it's better he shake in fear than shake in fury
>That would ruin the purity
>Anger is ugly, terrible, not worthy of tainting his face
>So please/\esrow si tahW
>Stay pure and sweet/\lufituaeb si hcihw taht tniat oT

Human males are horrible for unit cohesion. We shouldn't be letting them mix with Anthro units at all, because it always results in is girls fighting over humies. Plus they're weaker, can't carry as much gear, resulting in other members of the unit having to pick up the slack, and they have to use dinky little intermediate caliber weapons that are a logistical nightmare because now you're throwing 2 to 3 completely new calibers in to the supply chain. The only role humans have is in human only units or as comfort boys.

>draft requirements are adjusted to allow for less physically capable humans
>assigned as comfort boys to anthro squads
>morale goes up, squad performance improves as they all have a tangible and immediate goal to fight for
>strict penalties and possibly dishonorable discharge for anyone that abuses or breaks the boys
it could work out

But then they become prime elimination targets for the enemy to reduce morale.

So a concept:
Anthros can only make babies with their own kind: canines with canines, felids with felids, etc. The more specialized/niche/rare the anthro breed, the harder it is for them to find a mate, and thus the harder it is to make babies and have a family and continue the species.
There is an exception to this though: humans. For whatever reason, and against all scientific laws of nature, humans can impregnate/be impregnated by any anthro species. In the case of male humans, they can impregnate any female anthro and the babies will be of the same species as the mother. Female humans can be impregnated by any anthro, and the babies will be of the same species as the father. Humans only breed true with themselves.
There'd be a lot of intrest in humans from the rare species that need to keep their numbers up in the face of overwhelming felid and canine numbers. Humans would also be encouraged to have many children of their own, in the hopes those children would eventually bear/sire some anthro offspring. Polyamourous families might be not uncommon, with multiple parents raising anthro and human siblings side by side.
Of course, there'd be haters and racists. People who say an anthro can't be "pure" if they have a human parent. Rumors and stereotypes. Could be an interesting place.

Ferret NEET Story
>Month 1
>You only missed a day of work, your two days off coming right after the one you skipped
>Because of her
>She had started calling out to you, talking through the vent
>"Hey, I have some extra buttery popcorn and put on a movie, want to stop by?"
>"I made too much Oyakodon for dinner! You can come over if you like!"
>She even started singing to you anytime she hears you shower
>"Hey, you alright man?"
>You blink and look to your coworker, a 30-something jerboa with a big set of buck-teeth
>"Yeah, sorry Gordo." You yawn and stretch. "I'm thinking I need to switch to night shift."
>He snickers. "Oh yeah? Why's that."
>"I have this neighbor, things started great, she was quiet-" You're elided by a laugh from Gordon
>"She! Oh man, lemme guess... A lemur chick! No, no." He rubs his chin, grinning. "Maybe a goat?"
>"It's not funny man, your fairer sex is absolutely demented!" With a sigh, you continue. "She's a ferret. And things were great! But then she got kind of creepy, and, uh..."
>Gordon's face fell as you continued talking
>"Gordo. What's up? You're freaking me out here."
>He won't look at you anymore
>"Uh." He finally starts. "That's no good. If she's taken a shine to you, I mean."
>It feels like there is no blood in your body
>You hear a bell ringing somewhere
>"Gordon. Spit it out." The words come out almost garbled, saliva solidifying to wallpaper paste
>"Ferrets are induced ovulators. You put her in heat." His eyes meet yours, damp, sparkling
>"If ferret women don't mate they'll die dude. Heat kills them."
>The two of you just stand there, silent but for the sound of the clock on the wall
>Month 2
>"...so we'll see what the manager says as this month ends." Gordon speaks pensively around a mouthful of cornichon
>"But they'll hold the job for me?" You sit back in your chair. "That's a relief."
>"Business is so slow I'm sure they'll be glad someone volunteered." He winks. "I'll talk to HR, make sure you get gubment dollars. Speaking of-"
>"Her? Nothing happened yet." You sigh. "I should at least talk to her."
>"You should at least learn her name." Gordon snorts, waving for the bill.
>"I know her name!" You say sharply. You can't tell who it surprised more, you coworker or yourself. "It's Dahlia. I-I heard it through the vents."
>He looks you over, concerned. "You're spying on your horny neighbor through a vent? I got this, company card."
>"Thanks. And it's not like that. She spells it out loud every time she names her player character."
>"And I suppose she yells it? No way you're actually getting up there to listen through the vent, hmmm?" Gordon chuckles, then his whiskers droop. "C'mon, let's get back home, it's getting dark."
>The low rumble of Gordon's truck disappearing into the distance, you climb the stairs to your apartment
>'Well,' you think to yourself, 'Time to finish my part in all this.'
>'Maybe I can let her down easy. There's medical treatments and other ways to end a heat.' Your brown furrows. 'I can barely afford a shitty apartment! I can't deal with kids.'
>'On top of that, now I'm unemployed, a-" Your thoughts scatter as you round the corner and come face to face with Dahlia
>Like a coiled spring she leaps, your center of balance vanishing as she wraps you in a vice grip
>A glimpse of gleaming eyes meets yours before she buries her face in your neck, moaning and taking deep whiffs of your scent
>She's impossibly strong for someone so scrawny, your heartbeat frenzied as a shaky paw struggles to undo your pants
>"Oh god, help!" Her other paw snakes up your back, grabbing your neck before she silences you with a kiss
>
>Thoughts cease to flow as her tongue explores the insides of your mouth, greedily intertwining with yours and pulling back again in a teasing dance
>The paw now in your pants deftly tears at the seams of your underwear, shredding her way through to the prize underneath
>Dahlia's breath catches in her throat as her velveteen fingers wrap their way around your cock, sliding to the base and massaging your balls with two fingers
>Her entire body trembles against you, eyes that once gleamed with predatory focus now look glassy and dazed as she brings her other hand down to play with you more
>'I won't get another chance.' The thought comes, echoes in your head
>In a surge of panic you push her off of you, Dahlia landing heavily on her side
>Your tattered underwear still in her grip, you watch as the ferret girls eyes clear and widen, before filling with tears
>Springing to her feet she takes off down the hallway, scrambling to her apartment with muffled sobs before disappearing behind the slam of a door
>"Shit!" Staggering to your feet, you hurriedly adjust your pants and run to her door, pounding on it. "Dahlia! We need to talk!"
>You can't hear a thing
>Fingerprint lock, lights on, grabbing the stepladder
>"Dahlia," you call into the vent hoarsely, "Dahlia please, I'm sorry if I hurt you. Can we talk?" No response. "Dahlia!"
>Pressing your ear to the vent, you wait for a reply
>Instead, you're greeted by whispered moans and ragged, drawn breaths, and finally
>"Say my name. Again." You gulp, the soft sound of paw pads rubbing her wet mons coming into focus
>As you hesitate, the crystallization of so many moments in life float through your mind; the rubicon, stretched before you
>Fated desire flares through your body
>Cast the die and damn the consequences
>"Dahlia." The name flows from your lips like cool water, a weight being lifted
>Again and again you call to her, Dahlia softly crying out in the throes of orgasm and together lapsing into mutual silence
Month 3
>You don't even flinch as the mail slot clatters open and letters fall to the floor, your forehead pressed to the wallpaper
>It's been over a week since you last heard from her
>Three weeks total now since the incident in the hallway
>You take a deep breath before the grate, then speak in a clear but gentle voice
>"Dahlia, I know you're in there." Your phone buzzes on the table. "Please answer me."
>The prior weeks she could at least be heard moving about furitively, pleasuring herself at all times of the day
>Sometimes strange thumping sounds next door, or soft squeaking from the vent would propel you there, pleading with Dahlia to just speak with you for a moment
>But there remained no answer, no questions, no offers for you to come over
>The roar of your shower feels deafening now without her chirping songs
>You climb down from the stepladder, now a permanent fixture in your home, and check your phone alerts
>Unemployment confirmation and subscription cancellation emails, missed calls from 800 numbers and telemarketers, and a text message from Gordo
>(still coming down to the bar? got ur usual already n its getting warm)
>Fuck, you'd forgotten completely
>How many hours had passed, staring into the void behind those metal bars?
>(omw)
>Placing an ear to the wall of the hallway, you still hear nothing on the other side
>With a pit in your stomach, you make your way out into the daylight
>
>"So that was that. Since then she's definitely been doing something though. I hear this kind of soft thudding sometimes? Maybe she's building something."
>The Jerboa sat with you at the bar, swirling the dregs of beer around his glass as you recounted the assault and sucking his teeth as you postulated on her potential schemes
>"And in the past few weeks, all kinds of packages are showing up to her house. More than usual, I mean."
>"Mmm, yes, of course! No one orders things through the mail except the criminally insane!" He levels you with a flat gaze. "I don't think the prison system is ready for her."
>"Never mind." You groan. "Just tell me what to do."
>"What?! What the fuck are you talking about?" Gordon pulls his ears down over his head, incredulous. "You make a fucking choice!"
>He swivels in his chair to face you, incensed
>"One, you can call 911, get her hospitalized and forcibly administered medicine to artificially end her heat." He's almost snarling now. "
>"Two, you can nut up and help her yourself."
>"Three, you can keep lounging around waiting for her to die." He rolls his eyes. "Hmm, a torture, a death, or accepting someone who loves you, tough call."
>"Dahlia won't die, doctors say masturbating delays mortality effectively in most cases." You receive a disgusted noise in reply. "What now?"
>"So, you're still spying on her? This girl is suffering and in danger and for months on end you won't do anything but peep on her." Gordon quickly tosses some cash on the counter
>"You're playing some kind of sick fucking game and acting like the victim the whole time, and I'm tired of it. One, two, or three." He leaves as the bartender scoops up the payment. "Walk home."
~
>You trudge up the stairs unevenly, having stayed for another two or three drinks after being scolded by your supposed best friend
>'Three options. I'm gonna figure out my own option.' You think, making your way into your apartment. 'I'll sleep on it and then call Gordon and fix all this dumb shit.'
>You hang up your jacket and take a deep breath
>Your apartment feels... stuffy
>'This building is a sty, it's always like this.' You tell yourself, inhaling deeply
>But that's not it this time
>Everything smells musty and sweet, like overripe apricots
>'No. What is that?' You walk around, sniffing the air for a moment, then freeze
>Your eyes glide to the vent, and for what feels like a small eternity you just stare at it
>Boarding the stepladder, you climb up and peer in between the slats to see the same pitch blackness as always greeting your eyes
>You also note a little tiny bit of fuzz at the bottom of one of the openings
>Pinching at it with your fingers, you pull it up to your face and inspect the papery black fibers
>"The fuck?" Jumping down, you run to the kitchen and grab a butter knife
>One softly squeaking screw at a time, you remove and place each one securely in your pocket before finally prying off the grate
>You're met with a black sheet of cardstock
>
>Baffled, you pull at its edges only for it to easily pop free as an avalanche of cloth falls to the ground in an array of colors
>Astonished, you reach into the vent and pull out a fistful of panties
>That pungent and sweet aroma suddenly becomes completely overpowering
>Your head swims as you dismount your perch, falling to your hands and knees
>The air feels even thicker at the ground level, pressure rising in your temples
>Your erection throbs to the beat of your heart, straining against your pants as your olfactory senses are completely overwhelmed
>'No. No. No.' You panic and lift up the couch cushions, trying to stuff as many pairs of underwear underneath it as possible
>"Shit!" Your expletive comes out slurred as you crawl around, your brain struggling to maintain your balance, much less concoct any kind of plan
>Unbidden, your arms falter and you go face down in a pile of the well-worn fabrics, a shuddering groan escaping your lips
>Cock oozing pre-cum like a leaky faucet, your last few vestiges of strength go towards feebly humping the floor
>Your drunken brain is swimming with endorphins, delirious
>You don't even feel sure that you're even breathing oxygen now
>'I'll sleep on it.' You decide to yourself, gathering the remaining panties under your head as a pillow. 'I'll sleep on all of this stuff.'
>As you slumber, a series of screws is removed from the other side of the vent, one last time
>Awakened by the low buzz of your cell phone ringing on vibrate, you allow yourself a satisfied sigh
>Cinching your eyes further shut, you nestle your back deeper into your mattress
>'Must have moved into bed last night.' You think with a smile, the sun already coming brightly through your white curtains
>You'll see who was calling later you decide, realizing with glee you didn't even get a hangover from the... four drinks you had?
>You stretch your legs, feeling them tingle as you try to recall the other evening
>A breeze rolls across your body, making you shiver
>An attempt to reach down and pull up the covers is foiled, your arm, both arms, stuck
>In a moment of cold fear, you take a deep breath
>Your eyes open
>It's her
>Dahlia stands at the edge of your bed, nude but for a garter belt fashioned of tattered cotton
>It's underwear that she tore from your body weeks before, you realize as your eyes focus
>Her body is lithe and athletic, you can easily see now how she was able to wrap you up with a single arm
>Her breasts are surprisingly pert, too often hidden under baggy t-shirts and hoodies they now rise and fall evenly with her breathing
>Turning to look, you see both of your arms expertly bound to the posts of your bed, nearly painless yet totally unyielding
>Two free slipknot loops hang from the fiber "handcuffs" restraining your wrists
>Wordlessly, she steps to the foot of your bed
>"Dahlia." It feels like you're underwater as she climbs onto the bed. "Whatever you're planning, it doesn't have to be like this."
>You gasp as she grabs your ankle and cranks your leg upwards, perpendicular to your body, bending your knee with the back of a paw
>She slides your foot through the loop by your wrist before tightening it, and doing the same to the other side
>Now she sits, knees-folded beneath her at the base of the bed
>You are locked in a full-nelson position, absolutely nothing hidden from her eyes as they wander across your body
>She smiles. "My gods, you're even more beautiful than I could have imagined."
>Leaning over the edge of the bed, she reaches down for a moment, then comes back up with medical tape and an egg vibrator
>Placing them to the side, she cradles your sensitive gonads with a little chirp of delight
>Dahlia leans over and places a delicate kiss on your nuts, her whiskers tickling your already throbbing member
>"Ahhhhh." Opening her mouth, the ferret girl lets a little trail of drool fall from her tongue to the base of your shaft before licking along its length like a popsicle
>Nudging her nose against your taint, she breaths hard before sucking one of your balls into her mouth, then releasing it with a lewd -Pop-
>She ends her ministrations with a single kiss to the swollen head of your cock. "Are you going to give me what I want?"
>Holding the egg vibrator in place, she deftly sticks the end of the medical tape onto it before wrapping the rest of the length around your sack
>You gasp as she sets it to low, the vibrations running through your penis, little beads of pre-cum starting to form as you whimper
>The bedsprings creak as she crawls about the mattress, turning tail and spreading her cheeks to show off as she cranes her head back to watch you
>"You like that?" Her pink pussy is drooling by this point, and she rocks her body back to rub her slit against the underside of your shaft. "You like to watch, don't you. I know. I can feel your excitement."
>Standing up, she breaks into a squat and begins to sink the very tip of your cock in, watching you over her shoulder while rocking her hips
>"Now," Dahlia's fluffy tail trails a figure eight on your chest, "I have you."
>In a single swift motion she slams her taut derriere down, enveloping your cock with a scream of animal pleasure
>She tries to lift herself into a squat, but her legs turn to jelly as her taut ass drops back down onto your folded body
>Thighs pressed aside by her ample cheeks, her moans become more insistent as she grinds her clitoris against your buzzing balls
>"F-fuck, oh yes." Dahlia's strength returns, her bucking motions fed by her desire to milk your body dry. "Isn't this better? Isn't this how it should be?"
>Her striped tail lands right across your chest and face, sopping up sticky love juices that trail their way down your folded-over abdomen
>"C'mon." Dahlia huffs, a paw drawing to her belly and rubbing her womb. "Please, make me a mommy, give me that thick cum you made for me."
>You can feel her climax approaching, the her wet walls constricting in ever quicker rhythms, her fertile body seeking to milk you for all you've got
>"W-wait." Your breathing halts with every smack of her hips as she rides you ferociously
>"I w-want yo-ou to -Ah!- look at me."
>Dahlia freezes, hilted on your mere-moments-from-climax-cock
>She falls to her hands and knees on the bed and dismounts your cock with a frustrated huff, then turns to kneel before you
>You lock eyes with Dahlia, the gleam you saw before now inspiring you to fight, not against, but for her
>"I want to watch you bear my child." You say, rocking your body to settle in better against the mattress and swinging your cock back and forth. "Please. Mount me."
>Her pupils appear to physically pulse and dilate, locked onto yours
>Unblinking, she stands on the bed and steps forward, her feet coming to place on either side of your torso
>You can't look away, her expressionless face making you question your decision to speak out at all
>Crouching down, Dahlia pushes your cock against your belly as she comes to sit on your hips
>Letting go, it springs up and strikes her pussy lips with a soft smack, a gleeful shiver passing through Dahlia's body
>"Is this true?" Gently, she begins sliding up and down, grinding herself along your length. "Or are you just trying to hurt me again."
>"Yes!" You gasp, as Dahlia turns the egg vibrator up to medium, then back down again. It almost comes out as a sob. "I do, I'm obsessed!"
>She cranks the vibe even higher, the ferret girl griping your calves so hard her claws dig in as she goes back to teasing your tip. "I don't believe you. What changed?"
>Your brain and body ache for release, for the absolution that only Dahlia can give you now
>"I missed you!" She flutters the throttle on the vibe, your voice cracking. "I missed you singing to me in the shower, your invitations.
>"Those nights, I'd listen at the vent, hear you cumming. It made me crazy." Your heart thuds like you're running a marathon. "I wanted to be there, with you."
>"I can't leave, I'd never forgive myself." You swallow hard around the lump in your throat. "I'd never be able to live with myself if I abandoned you. I was confused for so long."
>"I give in. I want to be wanted." Frozen in place, you'd swear Dahlia isn't even breathing. "I want your love. I want Dahlia."
>A paw slaps down onto your chest, Dahlia centering her weight directly over your dick before bringing her face to meet yours.
>"That's all you ever had to say." Her eyes swim with tears and yet she smiles like the sun
>Dahlia's legs muscles ripple as she squats with agonizing slowness, taking you bit by bit until your hips firmly meet
>-Slap- -Slap- -Slap-
>Again, and again and again, her motions becoming more fluid as she begins making pleasured chirps with every pump
>She grabs a fistful of your hair and leans in to kiss you, your body restless for the taste of her lips (like a drug) as you strain forward to meet her halfway
>Her mouth tastes like nectar to your foggy mind, drinking her in like wine as a hummed moan sticks in your throat
>Dahlia sucks on the end of your tongue before breaking the kiss, a string of drool connecting you then falling away
>Grinding forward and back, she lets out a tinkling laugh of delight as the mini vibe bumps and buzzes against her cute little rear
>"Hn! I'm guh-! I'm gonna cum!" Her voice has gotten breathy and high, and she suddenly grabs your bound hands in hers
>Feeling your body tense, you thrust back as much as you can and hear Dahlia's breathing go ragged as she climaxes, a low moan coming unbidden as you finally approach release
>The first thick bout of seed jolts her back into orgasm, she almost crushes your hands as she squeezes to the beat of each shot of your cum
>It almost feels unending, white jism already pooling back out of her, running down your thighs and ass
>"Mmm." Dahlia rolls her hips in a small circle before allowing your softening cock to plop free, lazily scooping your cum back into her needy snatch. "You have five minutes, then we go again."
>"Okay, just one request?" You nod at the egg vibrator. "TURN IT OFF GODS PLEASE TURN IT OFF."
>"Ah!" You kick feebly against your captor as she laps at your pecker again
>"You set the five minute breaks, at least abide by them!" You take a moment to stretch your legs, glad they were untied by attempt 3. "I'm still sensitive."
>"Tch. We've only gone four times so far, and the second and third times you were ready again in well under that." She smiles darkly. "I can always get the prostate stimulators."
>She giggles seeing your visible horror. "I'm kidding. Mostly."
>"Maybe a break is in order." She sighs
>Getting up from the bed she inspects the matted fur around her thighs and pelvis
>"Bathroom is-" "Off to the right, I know." Dahlia interrupts, the soft pad of her feet on the floor fading. "It's a mirror layout to my room."
>Scooching your way up the bed, you rotate your arms and try to soothe your shoulders before calling out. "Hey, can we lose these hand restraints next? My wrists are k-"
>-Thud thud thud-
>"Yo, it's Gordon!"
>
>-Thud thud thud-
>"Look, I felt bad, and uh, thought maybe you'd handle this whole thing better with some support? Look, I heard you in there dude."
>You look to the hallway and see Dahlia, eyes wide, body tense
>"Yeah, I'm here." You swallow hard, your eyes never straying from her. "But you're a little late. Option 2."
>"Oh. Ohhhhhhhhhhh! Hey, wuh, well great!" You hear shuffling from the other side of the door. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything, and I'll see you at work!"
>You close your eyes and sigh deeply as you hear Gordon leave, chuckling to himself as he departs
>You look back to Dahlia, just now seeing the pair of gleaming scissors clutched in her hand
>"Uh." Your mouth dries as she steps up to the bed, still clutching the implement like an ice pick. "Dahlia. My hands."
>"Who was that." She asks, flatly.
>"Gordon," you croak, "we work together, he was just checking in on me."
>"You won't need him to do that anymore." Dahlia deftly threads her fingers through the scissor loops parts the blades. "Be truthful. What terrible things did you tell him about me."
>"Nothing!" Dahlia trails her pawpads down your stomach to the base of your shaft, encouraging it to swell. "I-I kept trying to tell him you were obsessed with me and he never believed it!"
>"And why not?" Kneeling on your thighs, she leans in close, her face filling your vision. "What made you unworthy of your friend's trust?"
>"My obsession!" You roar the words, icy fear spurring you onward. "I burn for you! Spying and filling my time with your life felt so good, oh gods. It's all I need."
>"Well then," crawling up your torso, you see the flash of the scissors before your face
>-snkt- -snkt-
>You rub your wrists as Dahlia parts her legs wide and prepares to mount you again
>"Come serve your purpose."

Epilogue

I'm calling the police.

Do it.
I will!

don't bother
>you croak, as panther girl nods to you
He know's whats up
>she chuckles, then walks out in to the street, quickly jogging again as if nothing had happened at all
Hey!
>Your gf yells after her, attempting to stop her but unwilling to leave her side

i'm so sorry...
>then she starts bawling again

>the desk seargent looks bored
>his look changes somewhat, as you two walk in
> your girlfriend wants to do the talking, but there are a couple of guys in here, lounging around so you put your hand on your arm to stop her.
> you approach the desk sargeant
Good Evening. How may I help you?
I... can I talk to someone somewhere more private?
> The desk sargeant gives you a weird look.
Uh. Yeah, sure. It would help if I knew what this was about though.
I'd rather not tell in public.
>his eyes flicker between you and your gf, who stands behind you with her arms crossed. She's mildly annoyed that you wouldn't let her do this for you.
You're going to have to give me something so I can get you the right colleague to talk to.
>you swallow
I was... assaulted.
>he raises an eyebrow.
and you can't talk to me about this here because...
>you want to go home so badly. Nothing feels more emasculating than telling someone that you got raped.
>you turn to your gf, who gibes you a 'go on' look.
I can't. Please?
>He frowns, than slides his chair backwards in to the corridor on the other side of the protective glass.
I'll be right back.
>you turn to your gf, who closes the distance.
You should have told him about the -
>You stop her mid sentence. Not in a room full of guys, that would be absolutely humiliating.
I'll talk to them. Okay?
>she seems to disapprove and quietly whispers to you
All of these people here, they probably are here because, like, their bike got stolen or they lost their pet or dumb shit like that but you're here because you were fucking raped and -
>the door leading in to the station opens and blond woman looks through the door, accompanied by the desk sargeant who waves you over.
>You cut your gf off, having internally cringed as she said the r-word.
Hi. I'm detective Christensen. You had something you want to talk about?
>you nod and walk through the door she holds open.
You good?
>She smiles and responds to the desk sargeant.
Thanks, Harry. We'll be at my desk. And who might you be?
>Your gf stops, seemingly pissy that this isn't immediatly obvious.
I'm his Girlfriend.
Alright.
>Instant animosity. Great.
>the two of you follow her through the small station in to a room with just one desk in it.
You're lucky i'm working late today. Anyway. Coffee, tea?
>your gf softly prods you and quietly repeats the question.
tea?
>you nod. Tea seems nice. Internally, you're quite happy that you're not talking to a dude.
Both of you?
> your gf nods as well.
Alright, i'll get the water boiling. Both of you can sit down in front of my desk and we'll start in a minute.
>Detective Christensen starts boiling water, fixes herself another cup of coffee and sets out mugs with teabags in them, then sits down in her chair, produces a notepad and a pen and clicks it.
why don't we start with who you are.
>you answer her questions as she methodically asks for your info.
>she also takes down your gf's info
Why don't you tell me what you were doing before the assault.
it wasn't assault, it was rape.
>your gf immediatly jumps the gun
>Detective christensen comes a lot more lively almost immediately.
You were raped?
No, he was.
>that gets you a raised eye brow, as you try to disappear in to the chair you're on.
You were raped? What did he look like?
>You just let your gf do the talking at this point and focus on the pens in a cup on Christensen's desk.
It was a woman. A black panther chimera.
>Christensen's eyebrow is raised significantly, as she looks at you.
>you mumble a confirmation, as christensen starts writing while your gf tells the whole story.
>slowly but steadily, christensens enthusiasm wanes until all that is left is a frown.
So you two were fighting her off, but she still managed to do what she wanted?
Yes!
>your gf seemingly has become quite irritated and impatient.
>Christensen looks at you, while you cling on to the mug of tea that she got you earlier.
Jenna, right? Would you mind leaving me alone with anon for a second?
Wha-
Just a minute or two. You can sit outside.
>your girlfriend snaps her mouth shut. She seems severily irritated now and leaves in a huff.
>christensen shuts the door behind her and then turns to you.
Can you recount the entire thing for me, with your own words, please?
>you do, and you notice that the detective is making no notes whatsoever, instead piercing you with her gaze.
>the ask a few clarifying questions, but not many, culminating in the final one
Did you cum?
>you mumble something.
I ask again. Did you have an orgasm?
well... yes
>something seems to close in the detectives eyes.
>She exhales, then inhales loudly.
Alright, here is what I think happened: You know that girl. This was supposed to be some fetish thing after you dropped your girl outside off. Maybe this is the new way to end relationships among you kids. Whatever.
I don't care. I don't believe this was rape for one second. Know how I do? I have rape cases in here every month. The guy just overpowered the girl and yhe slumps there just like you do, telling me the story of how she got taken. Overpowered. You know how many stories to the contrary i hear, a girl overpowering a guy? very fucking few.
Know how many stories I hear of a guy and a girl getting overpowered by a single woman? zilch. Never happens. Wanna know why? Because it's impossible.
Which means you're full of shit. I'm one hundred percent certain that you could have fought your way out if you'd wanted to.
So i'm not going to do anything.
What I am going to do is I am going to set your girl straight.
>She punched the intercom.
Harry, one of my two is done, can you escort him out?
>the intercom responded
Lenny will be with you in a sec.
Thanks.
>she turned to you again.
Send your girl back in on your way out.
>Wondering how this could have gotten any worse, you leave the room and an officer waits for you.
>You motion Jenna back inside with your eyes as the officer escorts you through the station and back out, to the desk sargeant.
>It doesn't take much longer for your furious girlfriend to storm out of the station.
>She grabs you and pulls you out of the building, responding to a
good evening!
>by a guy next to the door with
Fuck you too!
>She's absolutely brimming with rage.
They don't fucking believe us. Can you imagine that? I told her all about this and she doesn't fucking believe its real. She tried to tell me that you were cheating on me. What the fuck is wrong with these people?
>A ball of fiery rage dripping tears of pure anger drags you along to her place, so easily visible that even the half naked retards usually hollering at girls try and disappear in to the streets.
>it lasts until you arrive at her place. There, she collapses and weeps like a waterfountain, clinging on to you, sobbing how sorry she was over and over again.
>you feel dirty
>there is crusty stuff all over your dick.
>You have this overwhelming need to go clean yourself
Jenna,
>as you say her name, she immediatly looks up at you
I need a shower
>she comes around a little, smiling through her tears
o-of course.
>She pushes you in to the direction of the shower, still weeping.
>You stumble your way in and slowly take your clothes off, then get hot watwr going and start slowly washing your body, then more aggressively scrubbing yourself down until jenna interrupts you.
How are you doing?
>The shower has gone cold and you've frozen with your dick in hand, red as a lobster, using one of her scrubbers on it.
>You can see her behind the shower curtain, peeking in through the slightly ajar bathroom door.
>You are struck by the sudden fear that she might see this as odd
Jenna, do you believe me?
>She walks in to the bathroom, then pulls the shower curtain aside.
>Your eyes meet and she searches yours
I do. I was there, honey.
>Her tears are flowing again.
>She shuts off the water, then stands on her toes to hug you.
>After a long time, she lets go, pushing back against your embrace of her and takes the scrubber and shampoo out of your hands, then leads you out and wraps you in a towel.
>You're feeling better, now that you're squeaky clean.
>gradually, you take Jenna in to your arms and you hold each other again for a while, during which you finally crack and tear up, not even entirely sure what about.
>after a while, you both just go to bed.
>You curl up and for the first time ever, you can feel Jenna holding you.
>Next day, you spend a few hours sulking until you realize that it won't help. Jenna asks you to see a psychiatrist, but you're not feeling like discussing the matter further, instead opting to bury it deeper.
>After breakfast, you decide to go home. >Jenna had an appointment with friends of hers and you don't see the point of being in an appartment that isn't filled with your stuff.
>On your way home, you pass a gun store and decide there and then that this was the last time that anyone got to fuck with you physically without repercussions.
>You walk in...
>... and leave without a pistol.
>But you do have an order for a CCP pistol for your noodly arms and signed up for a CCW course, and also brought an AR with you.
>You walk home, feeling a lot better, as if you finally have control again.
>Control is back. Your mancard got reissued.
>it wasn't cheap, but it was worth it. >Nothing says fuck off like a military style assault weapon.
>At night, Jenna stops by your place. While she isn't happy about your purchase, she is understanding and having her around is comforting.
>Over the next few days, your CCW course starts, you spend evenings at your local community college, making sure that you walk in groups or in brightly lit areas if you have to and you went back to work without missing a day.
>everything seems to be getting back to normal and fiddling with your guns has made you a lot more self confident.
>the next chimera to try something will get some.
>you have a random afternoon after you got off work, before you go down to your local college for your CCW class as your doorbell unexpectedly rings.
>You're not expecting anyone tonight.
>You go to answer the intercom, but there is no answer as you cautiosly say
hello?
>instead, there is a light knock on the door.
>you open the spy glass and peer through.
>you see the empty corridor and reach for your AR, quitly racking one in to the chamber.
>a black furry paw comes in to view
>you tense up, but the paw is holding something for you to see.
>its a stick with a double oval outline, off white, with a pink tip on one side and a tiny window - shwoing two lines.
>You can hear her talk through the door.
We need to talk!
>You don't feel like talking at all.
Go away!
>she shows her face in the door spy
We can talk through the door and keep your neighbours entertained, or you can let me in!
>no fucking chance.
Fuck off!
Alright, I'm suing for alimony!
>oh fuck.
>alimony? In this state?
>ohjeezohfuck
>you'd be turbofucked
>Wait, wouldn't she be admitting she raped you?
How are you going to argue in court that I have to pay for kids I did not willingly conceive?
>her hand moves away form the door spy and you can see her face for the first time. It's not even nearly as frightening as you remember it.
Can you just open your door and we can talk about this somewhat in private? Otherwise I'm just gonna drop this in your girlfriend's letter box.
>ohshitohfuggohjeez
>You really don't want to open the door, despite feeling secure with your new aqcuisitions from a few days ago.
>But maybe you can talk about this with one of them trained on her.
>you quickly think through your options. If you open the door, you can't have both of your hands on the rifle and you could be overwhelmed.
>So you have to open the door and step away quickly, out of arm's reach.
>but then, what if someone passes by?
>They'd surely do something about a chimera in a doorway with a dude in the flat aiming a rifle at them.
>So you have to be out of sight.
>your apartment is somehwat shaped like a hotel room, the the left of the front door is the bathroom, beyond which the room opens up in to the kitchenette on the right and your living room where the bed in a hotel would normally be. Your bedroom is to the far left.
>The smart move would be to unlatch the door, immediately retreat out of the hall in to the living room and move left, hiding behind the wall there, out of arms reach.
>but wait. what if she snatches one of them out of your hands and turns it against you?
>dread of loss of power flows through you again and you quickly look around for your pistol and it's holster, but they're in the living room.
Wait, please!
>You check the spyglass on more time and expect to see a frown and folded arms, instead she's looking down the corridor, seemingly at a state of total ease.
>You run back in to the living room, slide the holster in to your jeans, then the gun in to the holster.
>oh wait, load one.
>You quietly chamber a round
>then slide the gun in to the holster.
>sufficiently prepared, you return to the door and execute your plan.
>handle push, pull and jump backwards a few paces, beyoned the corner of the bathroom and a few paces more, then a quick 180 and guns up.
Helloooo?
>You hear the door being pushed open.
Just come in and walk in to the living room.
>steps are moving through the hallway as you remember rule #1 of firearms just before they reach the corner: Never point a gun at something you don't immediately intend to shoot.
>you don't relax your deathgrip one bit as you pull the muzzle from headheight down to 45 degrees, just as she walks in to the living room, looking in the direction of the kitchen.
I'm here.
>she turns around and freezes, eyes wide.
Is that a real...
>as she trails off, you nod.
ooo...kay.
>well, this is going a lot better than you expected.
Did you shut the door?
>she shakes her head very carefully.
No.
>You point to the couch, facing away from the hallway.
Sit down, if you want to talk.
>you keep your eyes on her as she moves over to the couch, allowing you to move in to the hallway walking backwards while keeping out of reach.
>as you reach the door, she sits down on the couch, hands out of sight.
>Her posture is straight as a rod, looking in your direction.
>the door shuts with a click.
I guess i got lucky that night, eh?
>She seems to be trying to break the ice.
>You walk back in to the living room
What do you mean?
I mean, wouldn't you have shot me?
>You think about it. Yeah. Absolutely.
>Given the choice, just straight up shooting her to save you all the trouble would have been better.
I guess.
>You continue moving, carefully staying out of reach until you can sit down at one end of the other couch in your living room.

Jenna story

Is that a threat?

>keeping your eyes on her, you pulled it out of your pants and saw out of the corner of your eyes that it was jenna.
Hey.
>you don't even wait for jenna to answer and cut her off midsentence
She's here.
>jenna takes a second to understand what you're saying.
She? who- WHAT?! WHERE?
>Well, here. duh.
Here. My place.
>You should have seen the explosion that followed coming, but the intensity still surprised you.
YOU LET HER IN? WHAT IN THE FUCK?
>that was uncalled for. you've got the situation somewhat under control. For now. You have all the guns.
I have her at gunpoint.
>You look at the woman in front of you. For a rapist, she makes a surprisingly sympathetic face as Jenna exploded on the phone.
I'm coming over. DON'T. MOVE.
>you put the phone down beside you as Jenna hung up the phone without even saying goodbye.
>you put the phone down next to you, gripping the handguard of your rifle again.
>You sit in silence a few seconds until she seems to have become seriously uncomfortable with it.
Does she always scream at you like that?
>As you look your former assailant in the eye, you instantly deflect.
No.
>then something occurs to you.
How do you know where I live?
>She shrugs apologetically.
We live in the same building...
>Wait, she was stalking you?
... I saw you coming home yesterday.
>well, that doesn't mean she isn't a stalker.
Are you stalking me as well?
>she looks you directly in the eyes.
No.
>she still seems uncomfortable with the subject.
>Wait, she lives in the same building? Above or below? How the fuck are you supposed to get out of the building from now on?
>what if you stand in an elevator and she comes in?
>Your CCL is still a few days off, you can't carry your CCP yet
>You could just walk the stairs instead
>but no one uses the stairs
>And if she were to find out you were using the stairs, behind those heavy fire proof doors, no one would hear what goes on in there
>She could literally just wait for you there.
>Well, you could always... abseil form the balcony? Climb down the fire escape?
What's your name?
>Her question drags you out of your reverie.
You... don't know my name?
>she folds her hands, playing with her thumbs, giving the impression of needing to occupy her fingers somehow.
No, I mean, I know your last name because of the plate at the door, but what's your first name? I mean, you're gonna be a dad one way or another and I'd like to be able to give the kids your name, you know?
>That's an awfully long explanation. Which you would have noticed, if it weren't for the fact that she just brought another issue back to the forefront of your mind:
>You're gonna be a babydaddy.
>jeez,rick.morty
>What's her name, anyway?
I'm anon. What's your name?
My name is Megan. Megan Riley. Nice to meet you...
>She extends her hand over the coffee table, but you just raise your eyebrow, stalling her efforts to cheer up the mood immediatly with no chance for recovery.
Uh. Yeah. So, have you talked to anyone about anything and ...what's with the guns?
>Her hand falls back in to her lap and she seems a tad nervous.
>You figure you can let her suffer a little.
Yeah, i've talked to a detective.
>she starts fiddling with her hands again, then furrows her eyebrows and leans back in to the couch.
Bu-u-u-ut they didn't actually care. I mean, I'm sitting here, free.
>It doesn't feel like you should stop pressing the advantage here.
Until now, I didn't know where you lived, nor your name.
>She's still leaning back in to the couch, but her eyes open as if she realized she had just dun goofed.
>Then they narrow again as she comes to another conclusion.
But you aren't even calling the police about me being here. You know, to get me arrested.
>Fuck. That didn't last long.
>you fumble some answer about pregnancy, but she doesn't even believe you for a second, hell, in retrospect, you wouldn't have either.
So did they not believe you or did they just not care?
>You feel like an offensive player on a defense play. Absolutely not comfortable and wanting to be anywhere but here.
What does it matter to you?
>She attempts to push herself out of the couch.
So if i were to do it again...
>Your raise your rifle at lightning speed, clicking off the safety, pointing it directly between her eyes.
You'd die.
>You feel like a fucking action star as she freezes mid motion, absolutely still, eyes widening. The rifle slid in to your should like it was made to be there, pointing unwavering, solid like a rock staright in to her face.
>She swallows.
>apparently it came across as sincere as it was meant.
That's what the guns are for, by the way. Sit back down, please.
>With that, you feel secure again. You have control over this situation. Your mancard was resissued, remember? What the fuck do you need cops for right now?
>This actually feels really fucking good. You should have listened to your crazy guntoting uncle with those machine guns much earlier. The weirdo with the "kommando" patch. Can't even write properly, but he is a good guy.
>Now then, as the host of this meeting, you feel your hospitality lacking. Something somewhere deep within you tells you that this is overdoing it, but you've got the upper hand back and you don't feel like giving it back.
I could do with a cup of tea. How about you.
>She nods as she slowly sinks back in to the couch.
That would be nice.
>You lower your rifle and click it back to safe.
Kitchen is over there, tea is in the left upper cupboard, mugs are in the one next to that one.
>Megan gets up, gingerly, taking the long way around the couch to stay as far away from you as possible as you watch her with hawk eyes until she get sot the kitchenette.
>she opens the cupoards, sets water to heat up and takes two mugs out of the cupboard.
>You remember that Jenna is about to show up and think that it would probably be a good idea to have another cup ready.
Make that three, one for Jenna.
>She takes another one out of the cupboard.
Jenna - is that the girl you were with?
>You fold your legs in front of you, sitting in the lotus position on the couch, still rifle butt in the shoulder, pointing it at the floor.
Girlfriend.
>She turns around, leaning against the work surfaces behind her, arms on the edge.
How long have you two been an item?
>What is it with this probing?
Why do you care?
>She leans back in to the counter a little more and folds her arms under her decidedly not exactly small bosom. Arms of taught steel wire, as big as Pop Eye's. Somewhat similar proprtions too, her lower arms definitely seem a lot bigger from where you're sitting. Her wrists are the size of your biceps. Natural panther and the obvious fitness training that her clearly visible abs with their defined six muscle bundles and lack of any gut whatsoever clearly show below the hemline of her spaghetti halter top.
>No wonder you had no chance whatsoever against her, even the two of you. That woman could probably lift both you and your gf with one arm repeatedly.
>Her current stance seems to be a reflection of your hostility, not a show of force.
Just curious, is all. If you don't want to alk about it, that's alright.
>the water boils for a bit as you both mind your own business. You check the time on your phone, guesstimating it will take a few more minutes for Jenna to arrive while Megan unfurls her arms again and stares absentmindedly at the kettle or out the window, before she tries to strike up a conversation again.
side note: brb, shower.
Did you always have guns?
>You look up from your phone.
No. Got them recently.
>That answer doesn't seem to be what she wanted to hear.
Oh.
>the water continues to boil, until she tries again.
That's a pretty big computer set up. Do you play games a lot?
>Seriously? While being in control here has considerably lengthened your fuse, that still seems like a weird as question.
>but before you can tell her to shut up and get to the point of why she is here, she continues
I'm sorry, that must have sounded really dumb. I play a lot and I was just wondering what you have in your rig.
>Bullshit. She looks like she spends exactly 20 minutes a day with computers - 5 for photos and 15 getting them placed on instagram with captions like "Working those glutes biceps-curl-emoji x3".
>no, maybe she is scoping out your place, to add insult to injury?
>she can't be that retarded.
>She tentatively tries to smile at you.
>It's not very effective
>but it makes you take stock of the entire situation and you can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation.
You, i mean YOU, are standing here, in my kitchen, and you're seriously asking me about what videogames I play after blackmailing your way in?
>She averts her eyes and looks at the floor for a second, then back at you.
When you put it like that, it sounds pretty bad.
>she stops, then starts again, a little more spirited this time.
I just feel really uncomfortable in the silence.
>You snort in disbelief.
You feel uncomfortable.
>then you have to chuckle.
You think you're the one who is entitled to feel uncomfortable here.
>She searches for a place to hide on the floor with her eyes.
Just, new place, new people and all that, awkward silence and so on
>she mumbles, looking anywhere but in your direction.
>the kettle announces it's done.
>Megan picks up the kettle, pours three of the cups full of water and puts a teabag in each.
What tea did you pick?
>She reaches up and checks the box.
Roo-ib-os?
>Rooibos was the only tea mom would never sweeten, instead, she always added milk. You've had it often enough where it doesn't instantly give you a flashback of sitting at the dinner table at home with a glass of tea in front of you, but it isn't difficult to conjure up a false memory of a generic evening of dinner with your family when you were about ten.
Pour some milk in mine. Fridge is to your right. Oh, and in Jenna's too.
>Megan opens the fridge and pulls a jug of milk out after a short search, then drips a little in to your mug, same for jenna's, then turns to you, jug at the ready.
Mind if I take some too?
> Why would you mind?
Go ahead.
>She pours milk in to her mug as well, which results in all mugs being full nearly to the brim.
>Megan returns the milk to the fridge and takes both of your mugs and carefully balances the liquid inside of them as she carries them over.
>she sets down both of them on her side of the couch table, then pushes yours across carefully as you tense up.
I'm gonna go get another mug for the tea bags once they are done.
>She gets back up, fetches another mug and comes back.
>You watch her look curious at the tea, but then she leans back in to the couch.
How long until it's done?
>Technically speaking, Rooibos isn't a tea and doesn't have a due time.
About 6 minutes.
>There are, however, diminishing returns.
>She nods, then takes a deep breath.
I... Well. I tested positive. It's only been a couple of days but these tests don't really go wrong that often.
>it seems that she is finally getting to it, then.
I wasn't really expecting this. I mean, sure, season and everything, but one go? Without preparing? I... What are the odds, you know?
>Preparation?
Do Chimera's need preparation to get pregnant?
>she cringes.
Please don't call us that. You wouldn't call a black guy a nigger, would you? Just call us anthros.
>You shrug.
So do anthro need to prepare?
>She doesn't seem too willing to talk about it.
Some, like me.
>You motion with your hand to keep going.
Want to explain why what happened is so unlikely?
>she sighs.
I have... I don't get periods. No ovaries either. My kind... we have to scratch ourselves for a chance to get pregnant. Internally. Hard. It's not very comfortable.
>You furrow your eyebrows.
Then how did I get you pregnant?
>She shrugs.
I don't know. I've never heard of it happening before.
>That still doesn't explain why she's here.
Where are you going with this?
>She swallows.
I...
>but before she can go on, the doorbell rings and this time, you unfold your legs and get up.
You circle around her, rifle now much more at ease after Megan has proven that while she is clearly not always normal as far as social rules and norms are concerned, she doesn't appear to be a crazed rape fiend.
>You still check to see where she is and meet her gaze as she turns on the couch, followign you with her eyes as far as she can without getting up.
>Then you answer the intercom.
Yeah?
>Jenna's voice.
Guess who.
>You push the door opener and the appratus buzzes, and after you've heard the door click open through the intercom, you hang up the phone, then crack the door to the appartment open.
>You turn around, but wait by the door.
>It doesn't take jenna too long to reach your floor, she must have gotten lucky with the elevators, but before she gets to the door, Megan drops her last bombshell.
I want to keep them.
>You take a moment to digest that statement and her sincerity makes you not even for a second consider that this is some kind of joke. You hadn't taken the alimony thing fully serious, but that sounded different.
>But before you can muster up an answer, the door opens and a ball of rage practically flies in to your flat.
>Jenna blows right past you.
WHERE IS SHE?
>She doesn't walk in to the living room, she pushes through your hallway like a military formation.
YOU.
>you shut the door behind her, then follow as Jenna unleashes her emotions.
HOW DARE YOU EVEN COME HERE.
>As Megan turns to check what you're doing, Jenna takes the few remaining steps and slaps her across the face.
I AM TALKING TO YOU, BITCH.
>Megans head flings around, then Jenna turns to you.
Why are you just standing there? Where are the cops? Hmm?! She's sitting right here?
>You have dealt with this before. If things don't go the way Jenna wants them to, this happens.
>Her head shifts from you to Megan a couple of times, then she freezes and her expression shifts to an "I can't believe what the fuck i'm seeing".
Anon...
>Oh no.
>She points at the tea mugs on your couch table.
What the fuck are those?
>she turns to you again.
Is that godfucking damn tea? Did you really make her a FUCKING CUP OF TEA?
>This is probably a bad time to mention that her mug is still in the kitchen.
Change of situation.
>Jenna stems her arms in to her sides.
And what the fuck could change the situation so much, that she deserves even the slightest bit of hospitality?
>Before you can answer, Megan interrupts.
I'm pregnant. And I'm keeping them.
>She holds the pregnacy test out for Jenna to see, who slaps it out of her hand.
>You notice that Megan, who seemed fairly relaxed around you if not afraid of the guns you were carrying, definitely seems angry now.
I can get on of those for five bucks on ebay.
>She turns to you.
You weren't seriously retarded enough to believe her, were you?
>You shrug, but as Jenna is about to snarl something in your direction, Megan takes the intiative.
It's not like I can't make more of these.
>Jenna turns her head around.
Bitch, I don't give a fucking shit. You're gonna abort them, you're not doing this to me.
>Doing this to her?
Anon, she confessed to us. Call 911.

Jenna story
>you dial 911 and start talking to the operator while watching jenna and megan.
>Megan stands up, her arms folded.
I confessed nothing.
>Jenna turns around.
Yeah, you fucking did. You said you were pregnant, from him.
>Jenna points at you, but Megan still isn't having it. She waves a hand through the air, as if this is some minor detail that doesn't really matter.
Yeah, we fucked downtown in a club on the toilet. But I'm actually here because Anon bumped in to my car.
>That's... really... what?
>Before you can ask her what she means by this, Megan explains
I saw him the other day from my balcony, scraping my bumper. Very lightly, but you know. So I asked the landlord where Anon lives so we could settle this amicably and that's why I'm here.
>Jenna fumes. If this was a cartoon, her head would be the size of a weatherbaloon and steam would be billowing out of her ears.
>You tell the operator that it would be nice if they could hurry up, the situation here seems to be escalating.
>In that classic 911 dispatcher voice, she asks who and why and you tell her that your gf is here too.
>The dispatcher answers friendly and tells you to stay on the phone.
>You reach out and try to deescalate by squeezing Jenna's shoulder, but she just brushes you off and practically lunges at Megan.
>Jenna attacks the taller and stronger woman like a banshee, screaming bitch over and over again.
>You put the phone on the kitchen counter top and drop your rifle as you follow to try and keep her off Meggan, but Jenna is going full ham.
>Punching, slapping, biting, pulling Megan's hair when she gets the chance to, she doesn't pull any punches whatsoever.
>while megan was seemingly fine with fending off a few slaps, Jenna's teeth in her arm are something she seems to be unwilling to ignore.
>Megan does her best to throw Jenna away from her, but Jenna is surprisinly clingy and amid increasing growls of pain everytime jenna chomps down somewhere new
>you try to seperate the two of them. Your rifle is somwhere behind you on the floor as you start to pull Jenna away from Megan, which nets you a couple of new bruises as elbows or knees intended for the other land on you.
>You manage to pull Jenna away from Megan by inserting yourself between the two and pushing their chest away from each other.
STOP!
>Both women actually stop fighting each other, but Megan immediatly pours oil in to the fire.
She started it.
>And Jenna immediatly goes for the bait.
I started it?! Look at you, you whore!
>Megan opens her mouth and you get a glimpse of those long, long incosprs in a face that isn't being civil at all right now but looks very willing to prove that those teeth aren't for show.
Big words from an ugly flat lanky bitch.
>Jenna loses coherence again and after fumbling for a reply tries to duck under and around your palm, reaching for Megan, but you let go of megan and focus on keeping Jenna from digging her own grave.
>Only that Jenna doesn't seem to see it that way.
>after a few quick tries to get around you, her anger shifts focus.
Stop getting in my fucking way!
>You try and calm her down.
I'm not letting you get yourself killed or jailed.
>Jenna continues struggling against you after looking past you for a second.
COME HERE; YOU SLUT!
>Megan behind you seems to be perfectly willing to take her up on round two.
Make me, bitch.
>Jenna gives you a mighty push as you're trying to get Megan to deescalate - catching you unaware. Your balacning step comes naturally as a reflex - but your leg is stopped halfway by the coffe table.
>Uh oh...
>Your brain immediatly knows that you had to take that evasive step. ANd that this isn't enough. It does this, while you'r consciousness is still not entirely sure what is happening, but gravtiy relentlessly pulls you toward that coffetable, facing backwards.
>If you had bought tempered glass - you'd have fallen on to it and that would have been it.
>But no.
>This wasn't a glass table you had bought.
>This had been a gift.
>Sadly, the giver hadn't known too muvh about durability of glass, and the result is you falling on to the table, the glass shattering under the impact and you falling through the glass.
>While Jenna goes for another attack, catching unaware Megan off balance.
>You in turn hit your head on the metal frame of the table, and while you land on your back amid the shower of glass, dull throbbing pain explodes in the back of your head.
>it did make a nice and audible thwack noise.
>you her a loud growl which is muffled by the pain, because holy shit, your head hurts like a motherfucker already.
instinctively, your hands reach for the spot you hit your head on on the way down, pulling your shoulders through a field of broken glass bits and still warm tea.
>Pinpricks and more pain all over your arms and shoulders, your hear something else hitting something quite hard.
You open your eyes to see two fuzzy panther faces framed by long hair hovering not quite above you, looking concerned.
You okay?
>Your head feels like it's about to split open
naawrgh...
>A high pitched sound of rage comes from outside your vision from the direction of the panthers' heads, sounding like jenna's voice.
>The two Megans move with a speed and elegance that belies their bulk.
>They grab hold of two Jennas and pull them up, then smack them back down on top of a couch, pinning them with their body weight. Then they open their mouthes right in front of her and fixate her head so she has to look at the open maw.
>You feel the need to do something.
>The Megans growl at the Jennas.
STOP, or I'll -
>You push yourself up with your elbows, distantly registering more cutting and pricking sensations to them.
>The Jenna's struggle and get another knee in as the Megans turn and look at you with an expression you can't make out.
>The Megans cringe for a second, allowing the Jennas to land another punch.
>as a wave of pain and sickness hits you, you clothe your eyes so you won't have to puke and hear a dull thud.
>The struggling sounds end and a moment later, a furry hand pulls you out of the remains of your couch table.
>Your open your eyes and two fuzzy megans become one. She looks very concerned for someone who was willing to drag you into an alley and pin you against a wall.
Are you okay?
>No, definitely not. You feel really, really sick.
>But what happened to Jenna?
How's Jenna?
>Your mouth isn't really doing what it should be doing and Megan's concern is growing.
She's okay, you're not.
>As if on cue, Jenna starts to moan behind you, just as one Megan becomes two.
>You close your eyes again, fighting against the need to throw up as it becomes overbearing.
>You try to sit down, and Megan makes you move a few steps and then gingerly lowers you down until you're sitting on the floor, back against a couch.
>You throw up in your mouth as you hear Jenna behind you get up.
>You swallow the acidic concotion in your mouth back down and open your eyes as you feel something touching the back of your head.
>Two megans look past you.
You're bleeding.
>Broken glass rustles as Jenna walks through it and the Megans look in her direction, but before something stupid can happen, the doorbell rings.
>The other two freeze, but you can't hold it back anymore and puke your guts out.
>The pain in your head is insane.
>glass gets crushed again, then quick unsteady taps across the floor and you open your eyes two see two, no, one Megan looking down her puke soaked shirt, then reaching out to gently steady your head.
>Your hearing is fine, but it's hard to concentrate as another wave of nausea hits you and you heave again.
Thank god you've arrived.
>Megan's hand leaves your side shortly thereafter as she gets up to face the new arrivals.
That's her. You need to arrest her.
>Another, unfamiliar male voice cuts in, talking to Megan amd Jenna in the back.
>as they get down to talking, a female voice talks to you.
Sir, I'm calling an ambulance for you, alright?
>You nod.
Good.
>the voice turns away, and you open your eyes two see a black LocalPD uniform
Car 243 to base, over?
>Her eyes dart from her radio to you while she waits for reply.
Car 243, go ahead.
>Her eyes flick back in the general direction of her radio.
This is Car243, I need an Ambulance at West Sourdough 2444, male with a bleeding headwound and multiple cuts, over?
>base takes another second during which you dry heave again.
>the officer quickly scoots out of the way, but you manage to force it back down.
Car 243, ambulance dispatched, over.
>the officer leaves the microphone on her shoulder and focuses on you.
Sir, can you talk?
>You nod, forcing down the last bit of bile.
I'm Officer Norton, my colleague over there is Officer Barbrady.
>really.
Can you tell me your name?
>You try, but just at that moment, another mouthful comes up your esophagus.
>it is followed by a little more and you have to spill.
>You throw your head to the side and let it all out.
>Officer Norton makes a concerned face and you close your eyes, then lean your head back.
Anon.
>Norton seems to scribble that down and during that brief silence, you her something about rapist from the others.
>Then Norton demands your full concentration again.
Alright, and how old are you?
>you tell her, she scribbles, another tidbit from the others. Glass table.
Is this your place of residence?
Yes.
>This time, she is too quick to note it down for you to hear what the others are talking about.
Can you tell me what happened?
>You heave again, then start.
I was at home. Then Megan showed up.
>Norton interrupts you.
The anthro?
>You shut your eyes again. Its much easier to keep the sickness at bay like this.
Yeah. Then my girlfriend showed up. They got in a fight.
>You swallow, but the disgusting taste in your mouth won't leave.
I tried to stop them.
But then I fell through my couch table.
>Norton scribbles a bit and the pulsating pain in your head warbles what you can hear from the conversation the others are having. You can make out that it's fairly heated.
Alright. Tell me, whose rifle is that on the floor?
>you open your eyes to look at officer norton. Is that gun going to be trouble?
Mine. Why?
>Nausea and pain flare back up, this wasn't the best of ideas.
Are there any other firearms here?
>Well, there is the rifle and...
In my pants.
>The scribbling stops.
Okay. Would you mind if I secured that?
>Anything, if she makes the pain go away.
No.
I'm going to have to touch you.
>Anything.
Yeah.
>your shirt gets lifted and Norton unholsters your firearm, then a few mechanical noises are heard and she puts the gun in to a plastic bag, by the sound of it.
You can get it back at our station as soon as you're better, alright?
>Better, yes please.
Okay.
>Norton softly touches your leg.
Tell me if you're feeling worse, alright?
>You muble approval, then the conversation between the others can be heard, but the officer is being so quiet its hard to hear what he's saying. Only Jenna is clear and easy to hear, as she still hasn't really quietened down.
But She's-
>the quiet voice of the officer cuts her off and continues.
No, this is bullshit. She's-
>another interruption by the officer.
No, fuck that, you need to arrest her.
>the officer asks a question.
I already told you. She raped him.
>This time, Norton interrupts.
Ma'am, my colleague has already explained why this doesn't work.
>Barbrady falls in, quietly talking to Jenna again, but your head tunes out until the noise level picks up again.
>Norton taps you slightly.
Are you still with me?
Yeah.
>She seems to shift elsewhere.
Okay, I'm going to have to go over there, make some noise if you're feeling funky, alright?
>She gets up, then calls out to Megan.
Miss? Could you come over here, please?
>A common misconception about cats is that they move quietly everywhere. Truth is, they don't - they actually have fairly heavy foortfalls for their weight on solid surfaces. Megan was no exception here.
Hi. I'm Officer Norton. Got any ID on you?
>Megan's voice is calm, unlike Jenna's was earlier.
No. I live here, though, two floors up. My name is Megan Riley.
>Scribbling again, then a stop.
Alright. And what exactly happened here?
>Megan starts off with a direct accuation.
Well, I only had to knock her out because she had pushed him in to his couch table.
>Norton stops her with a bit more of an edge in her tone.
Look. From beginning to end.
>Megan takes a deep breath, then begins.
Well, me and him, had, you know, a bit of a thing. Once. Nothing major. But she caught us and I wanted to talk to him about it. Well, she barges in, tells him to call the police for some reason and then attacks me. I defend myself and then he tries to get her off me, but she just pushes him in to this glass table and charges me. I had to knock her out so I could render first aid and before I got to that, you arrived.
>Norton scribbles for a bit, then stops. Apparently, Megan decided to ignore her cover story she'd given the two of you earlier.
Where is the blood on your fingers from?
The back of his head. He's bleeding there. How's he doing right now?
>Norton sounds like she is concentrating on her scribbling.
You can ask him yourself.
>You hear Megan moving a bit closer to you, then she tocuhes your arm very gently.
Hey. You still okay?
>No.
Nauseus.
>Sympathy and warmth is practically dripping from her voice.
That su-
>Jenna's voice interrupts her.
HEY! WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE DOING?
>Norton immediately fires back.
Ma'am! Please stay where you are!
>Clearly, Jenna ignores this, as Norton has to repeat it again, a lot more steel in her voice.
>Meanwhile, Jenna keeps talking.
I TOLD YOU PEOPLE TO GET HER AWAY FROM HIM.
MA'AM, STOP!
>Megan lets go of you and you hear plasticky noises.
MA'AM, STOP RIGHT NOW!
>Jenna continues to ignore this and comes yet closer.
>FUCK YOU CHIM -
>There is a weird bang sound. Not like a gun, more like a cracker, and then clackering, followed by a heavy thud.
>Barbrady immediatly goes for the radio, loud and clear this time.
Car 243, taser taser taser.
>Then they both move and you hear handcuffs being ratcheted shut.
woah.
>Megan exclaims quietly.
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
>Norton seems to have a weird sense of humor.
>Barbrady reads Jenna her rights, then shuffles around.
That was a good shot, Judy.
>Norton accepts the praise happily.
Thanks. Want me to bring her down to the car?
>Babrady sounds surprisingly relaxed for a cop that just went through a tense situation.
Nah, I think the taser will have calmed her enough so that we can have her sit here for a little while longer.
>He turns to Megan.
Miss, I think it would be a good idea if you could accompany us down to the station too.
>Megan sounds slightly more shaky than earlier.
Sure.
>Megan's hand returns to your arm, but Norton almost immediatly stops her.
Miss, If you could, please stay away from Anon for a bit. I don't want to taze her again.
>Her hand vanishes from your arm once more and she steps away from you.
Okay.
>At that moment, there is a knock at the door and two more voices enter the room.
Hi, we're here for a couple of nasty cuts?
>Barbrady answers them and you can hear the sound of heavy synthetic fabric rubbing against itself as they come in.
Hi guys. That's your guy over there. Fell through the glass couch table, hurt his head pretty bad.
>As Barbrady finsihes, Norton picks up where he left.
Bleeding at the back of the head, puked at least twice.
>The EMT's remain jovial.
Oh boy, you got really unlucky, didn't you. Alright, we've got him from here.
>One of them sits down next to you.
Hello there, son. How are you doing?
>Awesome.
Shitty.
Do you think he's gonna be okay?
>Another male voice you haven't heard before attempts to answer Megan, but gets cut off.
>Jenna apparently still has some fight in her, even after she got knocked out and tazed.
Why do you care?
>Barbrady immediately intervenes and multiple voices babble in the background as the EMT asks you to open your eyes.
>You comply, and he immediately holds two of his left hands out with a few fingers on them.
How many fingers?
>maybe... 5?
Tweleven.
>The other EMT behind him chuckles.
Okay, for real now.
I can't tell.
>The first EMT pulls out a black tube the size of a pen.
I'm gonna ask you a few questions while my colleague here will shine alight in to your eyes.
>In the background, multiple pens are scribbling, then Barbrady announces to Norton that he'll take Jenna down to their car.
Shoot.
>The tech shines a light in to one of your eyes, then takes it away, looking straight at it, but not really looking in to your eyes.
>You feel yourself relaxing, despite copious amounts of pain.
What's your name?
>That's easy.
Anon.
>The guy nods, then his colleague examines the other eye and you feel your nausea rising again.
And what day is it?
>It's...
>Wait. What day is it?
Uh. Monday?
>Megan interrupts you conversation from the background.
Is that bad?
>The second EMT puts the tube light away, then gives his colleague some medical mumbo jumbo before he adresses Megan.
Just relax, madam, we do our best when we can concentrate on our work. He'll be fine, just stick with the officer over there, alright?
>It is monday, isn't it?
Alright, now my colleague is going to measure your blood pressure and that little clip on your finger will measure you r blood oxygen, okay?
>The guy has a voice that is so buttery and smooth and reassuring that it feels like you're back at your mom's house after you got roadrash from falling off your bicycle.
>The clip on your finger feels cool.
>The loud sound of the blood pressure monitor ripped open as the velcro comes apart drives another spike of nausea in to you.
>You close your eyes.
Hey, bud, eyes open, look at me.
>You really don't want to puke all over these guys.
Can't.
What's wrong?
>You'd like to avoid painting their gear a new color.
I'll puke.
>The EMT loses it's mom quality and sounds more like a dad now.
That's okay, just keep looking at us. Count my fingers.
>as you open your eyes you heave again, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot left down there.
That's okay, Harry, go get the stretcher.
>Officer Norton interrupts him.
Need help?
>He looks at her
Yeah, help Harry get the stretcher up here.
>Then he looks at you.
Come on bud, fingers.
>You try to count them, and they phase in to one hand.
Three.
>then they phase out again.
No, five.
>It doesn't take very long for Harry and Norton to return with the stretcher, and they carefully load you on to it, pulling glass out of you as they go after fitting a weird plastic stretcher around your neck, immobilising your head.
>Every movement makes your head feel worse.
It'll be alright once we get to the hospital, okay? Hang in there.
>You feel a furry hand touch your arm as two concerned Megan faces briefly show up in your vision, but then both disappear as the stretcher moves out of your flat.
>THe ride to the hospital is absolutely the worst thing you have ever gone through in your life.
>You've seen videos of Trophy Trucks and you're sure that the ambulance is following a part of the Baja 1000.
>You're...
>You're feeling strangely.. sleepy.
Hey, bud, you're still with us?
Yeah...
>The EMT gives your arm a few gentle prods.
Bud? Count to ten, alright?
>Suuure.
One, Two... Three... ...

Should I be concerned about my son's new school friend? I don't mean to be speciecist, but she's an anthro and well, I've heard things. She's also a bit of a delinquent, rides a motorcycle, wears ripped up clothes and a leather jacket, and though I've never seen her smoke, I swear she smells like an ash tray. She also seems to be very...handsy with my son. She's always hugging and picking him up and putting her arm around him. Again, I'm swear I'm not a bigot, just a very concerned mother. I just don't know if she's the kind of crowd I want my son hanging around.

I want to get to know a big cobra anthro (or many) who will allow me to rub and massage her/their neck(s) As well as those lovely, thicc cobra hoods. I’d be totally ok with them being dominant and playing like they’re going to bite/eat me if I don’t comply with what they want but I really do want them to be sweet and want to snuggle and love/be loved. Oh to be a hooman male in an anthro snek den...

>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Advent Officers, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on X-COM, and I have over 300 confirmed captured humans. I am trained in hydraulic coiling and I'm the top binder in the entire Advent armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will fuck you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this galaxy, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the Earth and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your virginity. You're fucking fucked, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can rape you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my tongue. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Advent Officer Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable virginity off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking belt. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will cum fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking bound, kiddo.

Jenna Story
>white.
>coarse fabric all over you.
>a feeling of being encased.
>You close your eyes again. It's really bright here.
>Well, maybe you should see where you are.
>You squint and see ceiling tiles.
>It's also a bit warmer than you'd like it to be.
>Except your head, your head is wet and luke warm.
>You try and move your head but can't.
>So almost automatically, you reach for your head.
>You feel something wet and cool on it, grab it and hold it up for you to see - it's a soggy icepack.
>You drop it somewhere aside and hear it drop to the ground with a loud thwack.
> Then you feel the pressure on your jaw and your brain finishes booting.
>Why do you feel encased?
>A quick look at an arm stretched above you and you see that your arm is wrapped in bandages, from shoulder to finger tips.
>Whats with not being able to move your head?
>You feel around for something on your neck and immediatly find a plastic thing that encases your neck.
>Could you take that off?
>Wait, where are you?
>You... You fell. right.
>Oh, EMTs - so this is probably a hospital.
>You search for latches on that thing on your neck but can't find any, when it occurs to you that maybe, just maybe, it's there for a good reason.
Hello?
>No one answers you.
Hello?!
>More silence.
>Are you just supposed to sit around and do noting until someone comes - no, hospital beds always have that call a nurse button.
>right, you feel around on the bed.
>Nada.
>Hmm. Maybe it's hanging off the side?
>Wait, there is a wire here and - oh. It was right on top of you.
>You press and wait.
>Nothing happens for a bit, then the door opens.
I'll be right with you, just a moment!
>It's actually a bit longer, but now the feeling of being in a dead room is dead as you can hear the hustle and bustle of a hospital station outside.
>eh, they must be busy then.
>It doesn't take too long until a nurse shows her face.
>She's human and judging by how close she is to your face, she's 5' none and her long braid makes her look like a disney princess.
>Righ tafter that, a blond male shows his face, looking a little more clinically at you.
Hi, my name Is Dr. Dubian and this is nurse Sharon. Good to see you've woken up. How are you feeling?
>Uh. actually, pretty good, albeit you feel like you haven't moved in a while. And itchy. Oh god, itchy as fuck, all over your body.
Itchy. All over.
>The doc nods.
You were pretty cut up. We'll see about getting something done about that after dinner.
>He looks at his wristwatch, then stares off in to space as sharon waits for input from him, clearly far more happy to rest her eyes on him than on you.
Sharon, if you could, change Mr. Anon's bandages, I'm thinking Betaisodona? Mr. Anon, I'll get back to you after you've had dinner, if you feel alright with eating.
>He leaves, so you look at sharon instead.
Can I take this off?
> You motion to the thing keeping yoyur neck encased.
>Sharon, who had started to unwrap your arms, stops.
I'll be right back.
>She vanishes again from sight and your headache returns, albeit a fairly normal one, not the blinding nausea kind.
>Moments later, Sharon returns, smiling.
Doc gives his okay.
>You return her smile.
Great.
>She leans over you and rips open some velcro.
>It's loud, but you're not really getting a spike of pain that lances through your skull.
Okay, now lift your head off the pillow for me.
>As you do, she unwraps something around your neck. As she pulls it away, you turn your neck and see a large yellow polycarbonate .. cast, for lack of a better word.
>She puts it aside, then starts unwrapping your bandages again, quickly moving down your arms.
So for dinner, I'm afraid you'll have to be okay with some bread, cheese and jell-o. We couldn't exactly ask you for what you'd like, you know?
>Bread is fine with you, as is cheese.
That's alright.
>She nods, then keeps going
Would you like some soda with that or tea?
>Tea. Tea sounds absolutely excellent right now.
Definitely tea, please.
>She nods again, having unwrapped both of your arms.
>Your bed begins to move as she gets your upper body moved upright.
Alright, lean a bit forward, would you, i need to get this off of your back.
>Unlike your arms, your torso isn't bandaged up, it has a huge piece of dressing taped to your back.
>Sharon quickly rips it off, then starts applying a cool brown ointment to your back.
>She does the same to your arms, then applies new dressings wherever she slathered on ointment and wraps your arms in bandages again.
Alright! I'll go and get you your dinner.
>Now that you have had your body upright, circulation has begun and while the headache has inreased a bit, it still isn't terrible.
>But, you're also a lot quicker in the head.
Hey, how long was I under?
>She opens a folder on a table next to your bed and looks through it.
Uhhh... 3 days. But Dr. Dubian is your guy for questions like that, i'll go get him once you've had dinner, alright?
>You nod while your stomach audibly sings you the song of it's people.
>It doesn't take her long to come back at all, which isn't very surprising considering the dinner tray holds a few slices of stale untoasted bread and a small bowl of cloeslaw.
All I can do at the moment. Don't expect it to get much better, though. Tea is on it's way, i'll get it to you when it's done.
>She pulls a small dresser on wheels to your bed, then unfolds a table big enough to hold your tray.
Thanks.
>She smiles, then gestures to a small cup with pills in it.
In case you have headaches.
>You take the pills, throw them down, then dig in to the bread and cheese.
Do you need anything else?
>Well, yeah, can you get up? But then again, she said that the Doc is the guy to ask those questions, so you leave it be. Instead, you shake your head and give her a thumbs up as you wolf down the admittedly stale food.
>By the time she comes back with a cup of tea, you're halfway done and between slices of bread, so you ask her for a glass or two of water, which she gets to you as you start with the coleslaw as a stand in for dessert.
>You ask for a refill, but she returns to you with a large bottle of water instead, placing it on your dresser and filling one of your glasses.
>After that it doesn't take much longer for Dr. Dubian to reappear.
>Now somewhat sated and slightly woozy from the meds, you watch as Sharon shuffles around in the room for a while, cleaning up somewhat, fetching another ice pack for your head after confirming with the doctor and taking her time to leave the two of you alone.
>In the meantime, you get all the boring things out of the way. What you're doing, how you're doing (okay), you're allowed to get out of bed, but take it careful, and so on and so forth.
...So what you have is a skull dome fracture. No breach of skin, which is good, but not a simple clean fracture either, as part of your skull broke lose and got pushed in, here.
>He shows you a section of your skull on an X-Ray. Without him pointing it out, you would have missed it.
Compounded with that, your brain experienced significant trauma, which is why we kept you under for the last three days. Significant, and i mean significant swelling. But you should be okay for now, but we're gonna keep you here for a few more days so we can monitor how things develop, although I'm optimistic that you'll recover without any permanent damage. Do keep an eye on those headaches though, some are prefectly normal, but if they get worse, tell us. Take it slow, no stress, no sports.
So now that you know what's going on with your head, why don't you tell me a bit about how this happened?
>As he explained that you have a fracture at the back of your skull, you're suddenly worried about putting pressure on it.
>He seems to read your thoughts.
Go on, lean back, it's been immobilized.
>You lean back and start to talk.
>or at least you try to, but you stop as soon as you realize that everything is very fuzzy and ther are only some individual sounds and pictures available.
>It starts with.. what's her name again?
>the panther girl.
uuhh...
>Megan!
>Megan was at your place because...
>Alimony?
>No, that can't be.
>But...
>So she was at your place. She definitely was.
>You can see her in your kitchen, making tea.
>And then you can see her defending herself against Jenna.
>You have memory of a vague feeling of losing balance.
>And then there was police.
>And EMT's, as well as an ambulance ride.
I.. think I fell. I must have fallen on something. I think... My girlfriend was there and someone else.
>You don't feel particularly well with saying my rapist.
And they were fighting? I think.
>Dubian watches you closely.
That's all I remember.
>He nods.
A bit of amnesia is normal in these cases. Those memories probably will not come back.
>You swallow. Somehow the feeling of losing some of your lifetime, something that was probably important as Jenna attacked someone so much bigger than her, doesn't sit well with you.
>Come to think of it, why was Megan there?
>You get somewhat more uncomfortable. She didn't take you again, right?
>right?
>You absentmindedly nod as the doc explains a few more things about your injuries to you, mentions that the police, a neurological specialist and a few others would visit you tomorrow over the course of the day, then finishes up.
>Before he leaves, you have on final question:
Do you happen to know where my phone is?
>Does your boss know where you are?
>Probably not. Maybe check in there as well, it occurs to you as Dubian promises to send someone with your personal belongings so you can call your girlfriend.
> It doesn't take much longer for the door to open again and for Sharon to come in with a plastic bag. In it are keys, a dead phone and your wallet.
Nurse Sharon, right? Do you happen to have a phone charger I could borrow?
>She scratches her head.
I'm not sure, I can see whether someone left one, but don't count on it.
>She disappears and you're left with a dead phone in your hand, waiting.
>It doesn't take too long for her to come back, but the charger is for a pear phone, while you're on the robot side of the force.
THanks, though.
>She smiles apologetically.
Were you trying to call someone? You can use our hospital phone line if you want to.
>That occured to you as well, but it still wouldn't work.
I don't know her number by heart.
>Her smile changes to a smirk.
Ah, I think I have the solution to that.
> She turns to walk away, but she is still in the door as you hear her again.
Mr. Anon, I think your problem just solved itself. I'll leave you two alone.
>You turn, expecting Jenna...
>...but to your horror, it's actually Megan. She's standing in the door, trying to smile at you, but she casts her eyes down fairly quickly as she sees your reaction, or at least your momentary loss of control of your facial features.
>No stress your ass.
Can I come in? I'll leave the door open.
>That second sentence seems like something meant to comfort you, and it does, until you realize that Dubian is a lanky twig and Sharon probably weighs 95 lbs soaking wet.
I brought you dinner, I've spent enough time in hospitals to know how horrible the food is.
>She pulls something large wrapped in paper out of the bag she is carrying.
>That does look enticing, but you're still not sure whether you want her in here.
>Then she pulls out two phone chargers.
I'm not sure what phone you're using, but I figured the battery would be empty by now.
>The ability to call Jenna wins out. Plus, afte rthe inital shock, you really do want to know why on earth she wa sin your kitchen.
>Her entire stance also seems deferential, head bowed, as if to say 'I am no threat to you'.
Robot charger?
>She nods, the fumbles for a bit until she holds the right one up.
Come on in.
>Megan walks in, leaving the door open as she had promised and hands you the charger.
>You immediatly plug your phone in, then, after giving her another long look, carefully unwrap whatever food she brought you.
Thanks, I guess.
>You're not particularly comfortable with eating while she is here, as it would only drag this out longer.
So why are you here?
>She fidgets, then catches herself after a deep breath. Her gaze steadies, she looks you in the eyes.
I wanted to see ho wyou were doing and figured you could need a few things.
>She takes a few more things out of her bag. A book, some chocolate, a toothbrush, a clear bag with toothpaste, deodorant and shampoo as well as a razor and shaving cream.
As I said, I've been in hospitals often enough to have a pretty good idea of what they usually won't have and i figured you could use these.
>That's it? That can't be it. There has to be something else. But why bring this stuff?
I... Uhh. Thank you?
>You do feel unwashed.
>But why is she here?
So you're here because...
>You trail off, but she gets the hint and ends the sentence.
I wanted to see how you're doing.
>Simple questions get simple answers.
Better, I guess.
>She nods.
That's good to hear.
>You raise your eyebrows.
>She gets the hint again.
And... I wanted to continue our conversation where we left off.
>ah, there it is. So you two had a chat. Why on earth would you have chatted with her? Alimony? For her? Why?
>but before you can ask her any questions, your phone vibrates as it turns on.
>You take it form the dresser and watch it cycle through boot, but Megan seems to be getting increasingly nervous the longer you hold it.
Are you going to call someone?
>You nod.
My girlfriend.
Maybe you shouldn't, not right now.
>She quickly follows up with an explanation, while she waves her arms as if trying to say 'YOu're getting the wrong idea.
I don't want another fight and I'm pretty sure she'll start another one.
>Wait, so Jenna had started the fight?
>She could be lying.
>after a second of trying to judge her intentions, you slowly put the phone down.
Thanks. I know you probably don't want me here right now.
>You silently nod, and she casts her eyes down.
I ... Mind if I sit down?
>You were expecting her to gesture towards the bed, but she actually gestures at the wall on the floor as there are no chairs in this room, despite there being a table that seems to be part of a set.
>She slides down on the wall, knees bent in front of her as she settles.
>Megan's eyes search your's and she makes a pause to emphasize what she has to say.
I never figured you'd take this so heavily.
>Was that what you'd been talking about?
I mean, that night wasn't the first time I'd done that, you know?
>Apparently not.
All the others... They enjoyed it.
>She snorts.
I mean, I met most of these guys more than once, you know. That was just the first time.
>She looks at you again.
But I never figured you'd take it that hard. I mean, no one ever pointed a gun at me, you know?
>Her voice is not exactly a whisper, but it's definitely to quiet to hear outside of this room.
>Gun, right, you had bought a gun.
At least until you did.
>Ah. Well. That's what you'd bought them for.
I didn't really take you seriously, I thought you were acting, drawing this entire thing out a bit because you liked it, which really confused me, but then you said you'd kill me if I tried anything after I figured maybe I should play along.
>That's... wait. No. huh?
And I mean, I was so confused already, I mean, what were the odds of you getting me pregnant like that in the first place?
>Oh nooooo. No no no no no. The word pregnant is a red flag so big that it tilts your brain and you spring in to action. Which is stupid.
You're pregnant?
>And the moment you say that, you realize that you're now at her mercy.
>Her inredulous look, the raised eyebrow after that - she realized that you don't know.
You don't remember?
>She can tell you whatever she wants now, and as long as it fits those key frames in your head, you can't know whether she is lying or telling you the truth.
>Who knows?
>She could tell you that you had tea during your chat or after she'd taken you again... no. She said you pointed a gun at her. How would she have overpowered you when you were armed without getting a scratch?
How much do you remember?
>Ah. Not a question you'd want to answer.
Enough.
>She shakes her head.
No.
>Fuck.
You fought with Jenna.
>She nods.
But why were... Why...
> You shut your mouth.
Why did I come to your place?
>Your turn to nod.
I wanted to tell you that I was pregnant. And that you're the father.
>You sigh.
For real?
>She nods.
>You fall back in to the pillow.
Fuck. That's why you and Jenna fought, isn't it.
>You turn your head to see her face.
Kind of. I said I'd keep them and then it escalated.
>Wait, what? She was going to keep them?
Stop. You're going to keep them?
>She nods.
why?
>She seems fairly desperate now.
Not like I have a whole lot of choice, you know?
>You don't know.
>So you raise an eyebrow.
>Megan drops her head almost to between her knees and explains.
I... I've got the choice between having them or getting an abortion. And getting an abortion...
>She looks you dead in the eyes.
They're not that good. That...
>She looks somewhere else.
I probably will never have the chance of having babies ever again if I...
>Her voice cracks, but she swallows and keeps going. Her arms are now tightly wrapped around her knees.
... If I get them taken out.
>This tower of a woman that seemed so menacing not that long ago, now sits in your hospital room, small as a mouse, tail and arms wrapped around herself, holding herself as tears flow from her eyes and she tries to fight them.
I know I fucked up. I fucked up so badly.

>Kid in last year of High School ( european, if age doesn't work out in american schools for this to be legal)
>There is a group of anthros that bully a lot of kids as their anthro bfs run the sports teams
>one of them is a gideon-level endowed mare, both in muscles and tits ( except for the dick. Fuck that)
>She picks him as her favourite subject of torment
>Constantly gets on him to the point that one of the others feels bad for him
>Mostly because as his science partner, she gets to see him transform from a genuinely nice but shy guy to a callous, angry cynic
>But he has a plan
>He watches the mare's house through a webcam
>and when he knows that she will be alone for an entire night, he strikes
>He procured a nerve agent that immobilizes her limbs completely, but lets her feel everything and doesn't attack her parasympathic nerve system, so she keeps breathing and her heart goes on.
>He hits her with it, timing his doses so that he has 6 hours with her, 6 hours during which he initially wanted to torture her
>But before he went there, his older cousin had mentioned as a side not that no girl ever was not turned on by the concept of being forcibly taken
>So he plans a far sweeter revenge, he's read up all he could, watched everything he could find and is now absolutely certain that he can make that mare dance to his fingers and dick within those 6 hours.
>His plan is to mindbreak her so hard that she will be begging for him to do it again with her
>So this isn't the usual forcible rape, as his intention is to make her cum as often and as hard as possible
>As a cover in case his plan fails, he wears a venetian mask and tells her to wear a specific black ribbon on her clothing if she felt like having him return
>Which will save him later on ( idk why yet)
>and it works.

Day 69 of Invasion
>To say the planet of Australias hung on the edge...well...that would be lie.
>The Tyranids had control of most of the planet, almost all resistance had been subdued.
>Now, only the Hive of Haarlock's wager(Joseph Haarlock sucks at cards) was putting up any decent fight
>Other population centers were being ignored at this point, having little to no strategic value.
>Given that General Powerstache was defending it, well, it was in good hands as any.
>Though his plans were about as complex as his extended family tree, they worked.
>In these circumstances, it was only a matter of time before the defenses began to fail, and the 'nids swarmed inside.
>At this point, it was all a matter of spite, the planet wasn't really worth much, just a penal colony.
>With the Fall of Cadia, and the rampant incompetence of the sub-sector Governor, help would not be coming.
>The Astropathic Choir reported full warp shadow, so they couldn't get a message out if they tried.
>Given that the Hive city was under siege for over 2 weeks by Tyranids, it would be an impressive feat.
>That is, if the 'nids weren't handicapping themselves, they weren't spamming the defenses like normal 'nids.
>They bombarded the city constantly with a variety of biological munitions, destroyed defense emplacements.
>However, they dare not repeat their initial assault on the hive walls, lest they enter range of a very heretical measure.
>A good number of captured Tyranid synapse creatures were spaced out along the inner portion of the Curtain walls.
>Upon approach, the power dildos the 'nids were hooked up to wen into overdrive, incapacitating any approaching 'nids.
>The general lead several offensive thrusts to keep the 'nids from overwhelming the remaining defenses.
>Today was no different, as a wedge of Leman Russ tanks and Hellhounds moved along the outer trenches.
>Near the front of the formation was Rupert's Slammer, his upper body sticking out of the hatch.
>A few Tyranid groups were scattered about the various craters in No-man's-land, but nothing major.
>Rupert's facial hair suddenly bristled, a viscous grin forming below it.
"Seize the moment, a Hive Tyrant is nearby"
>The Vanquisher tank rumbled forwards, Wolfe scanning the area with the storm bolter and augmentic eye.
>The 'nids were crawling all over the place, the probing assaults on the edges of the hive city had ended yesterday.
>There wasn't a giant leader among them however, a few warriors moving forward in cover of trenches, sure.
>Idly, he gunned down one that had exposed itself a moment too long.
>Which begged the question of where the Hive Tyrant really was?
>Then the ground 200 meters out burst open and caved inwards, three Trygons roaring in triumph.
>They were backed by a Ravener brood and a small swarm of 'nids, right before the armored spearhead.
>Defensive batteries and spotter on the curtain wall of the Hive quickly zeroed in the location.
>Through the could of dust and spores marched several Tyrant Guards, and a Hive Tyrant.
"A magnificent specimen, Don't you agree Wolfe?"
>The Commissar for his part didn't bat an eye, he was a little too used to the insanity now.
>That should have worried him, but instead, he sized up the distant target, before making a query.
"You admire the...horror General?
"Indeed, her head will go nicely in my Trophy Collection...Aim low."
>Wolfe smirked slightly, glad that his General still has his sensibilities...even if he was...eccentric.
"Load Turbo Penetrator men...target the Hive Tyrant...aim low.
>The gunner grinned, bringing the Vanquisher cannon to bear as requested, before firing.
>A rocket boosted shell tore from the barrel, cutting across the gap in an instant it seemed.
>For a moment, it seemed the Xenos' psychic barrier would remain intact, before it shattered.
>Commissar Wolfe snorted, hammering away at targets with the storm bolter.
"Not that low Gunner, target the Tyranofex on the right, high explosive!"
>Be Lt. Darius Rupert, distant cousin of General Powerstache
>Be guarding one of the few open gates leading into the hive.
>Battlefield casualties are high, but deaths are almost non-existent, for the first time in ever.
>The 'nids really wanted the D apparently, and more than a few men didn't seem to mind this.
>The Hive gangers who volunteered to help guard the gates seemed a little eager to face the Tyranids.
>Apparently, a shortage of Commissars made people speak their minds a touch too much.
"Oi, Bossman, this is tower."
"Go ahead tower."
"Since when did the Ultramarines get here?"
>There were Ultramarines here? Surely word would have gotten out about the Angels of Death.
"Tower, Elaborate."
"Well, looks like a bunch of Rhinos with Ultramarine colors and symbols on 'em."
"Hail them."
>Standard procedure was to inspect every incoming vehicle in the prepared kill-zone of the gates
>This prevented the 'nids from sneaking inside with the help of collaborators or Genestealer hybrids.
>The "defense" grid that the General ha assembled from captured synapse creatures was fairly short range.
>Did not stop the Tyranids from firing long range weaponry at the remaining defenses.
"Boss, I couldn't get anything out of the Smurfs, but I was able to get word from the cargo trucks behind them."
"What did they say?"
"Said that the Marines cleared the path, and that they're carrying refugees."
>Something didn't add up, the Astartes' arrival would be a momentous occasion, not a secret.
>That, and they would have arrived at the Hive's star-port if they had armor...not the Tyranid Zones.
>You give orders to prepare to stop the oncoming transports for inspection.
>Sadly, the first Rhino decides to start hosing your position with bolt rounds.
"Close the gate."
>At that moment, a krak missile flies forth and hits the control tower, leaving it a blazing wreck.
>The Rhinos come to a stop when they smash into the barricades, plowing the road open.
>Then the "Marines" pile out. screaming about their Spiritual Liege.
"Hostile Ogryn at the gatehouse, somebody close the bloody doors."
>As you duck behind cover from the wild spray of heavy weapons fire, you curse under your breath,
>Apparently, Baron Matthias Ward the 13th wasn't just content with sicking an Eversor on you.
>The doors slowly began to close, as the growling of engines came closer.
>Suddenly, the convoy of cargo trucks had arrived, and were speeding through the gate.
"Someone track those trucks down, and alert all forces inside the Hive, perimeter has been breached!"
>You managed to plink a few las-bolts into the back of the vehicles, but too little too late.
>By the time anyone found the trucks, they would be empty of whatever was in them.
>In the mean time, you had more pressing issues to attend.
>The Tyranids had managed to surprise the Armored spearhead, and a fearsome battle ensued.
>Rupert for his part faced another Hive Tyrant and her Guards, all of them leering at him.
"Xenos filth! Come to me now!"
"Oh, trust me General, it will be you who cums to me."
>Rupert's face went pinkish and his mustache gave a violent spasm.
>HE closed the distance rapidly, cutting down several Guants, hamstringing a Guard.
>His backup power dildo was jammed firmly into the folds of the Second Guard, putting it out of commission.
>It was only then that he began his duel with the Tyrant.
"Take a good look men, this is how I deal with Xenos...as well as traitors...and cowards....all much the same to me really."
>The Hive Tyrant chuckled.
"How? Jamming a metal phallus into them?"
>He opened his mouth, paused, sidestepped a thrust from her bone-sword and jabbed at her wrist.
"Must you make everything perverted Xenos? Do you derive a sick pleasure in doing so?"
>The two leader continued their duel as both sides did battle around them
>As it began to drag into the five minute mark with no signs of stopping, the Hive Tyrant gound her teeth in frustration.
>This was an old man she was fighting, admittedly one that had stolen her heart, but by the Norn Queen!
>How did he have his much energy and mobility? This much stamina?
>She was going to be testing that latter attribute out in great detail later...
>Her focus slipped, and she put a bit too much force behind her next strike.
>With a whistle, the bone-sword thrust forward with tremendous speed, sinking into the ground.
>The Generals' head jerked and he staggered, as though he'd been struck.
>For a moment, the Hive tyrant froze, thinking she'd injured her future mate.
>General Cornelius Rupert felt at his upper lip with a trembling hand, feeling nothing but smooth skin.
>A few meters away, a very familiar chunk of facial hair lay in the mud.
>She all but fell to her knees in relief, before becoming confused at a rapidly darkening sky.
>A growl from her beloved opponent(and soon to be mate), sent chills running down her rather lengthy spine.
>His expression was one of absolute fury, and his eyes glowed with a crimson light.
"I have underestimated you! No more. I will end the blasphemy of your existence here and now!"
>Huffing, the Hive Tyrant swung a bone-sword, intending to knock the man off his feet and end his rant
*clang*
>Ruppert declined dodging, halting the force of the blade entirely, before forcing it in the direction from which it came.
>He then lunged, forcing the Hive Tyrant to backpedal, taken off guard by his sudden strength.
>The power-sword became a blur, parrying and blocking the four organic blades repeatedly
>Soon, the Hive Tyrant found herself on the defensive, having to devote considerable focus on her opponent.
>Perhaps, she'd made a rather serious error in her plan to seduce him.
>The Astropathic Choir was resting inside their tower deep within the hive.
>They were tired, having gotten little sleep due to the influence of the Hive-Mind
>The constant sensation of chittering voices and numerous claws touched their minds.
>That, and a ravenous sexual hunger that never quite seemed to abate, and worse, began affecting them.
>Being a Astropath, and thereby a psyker by extension, made relationships a little difficult.
>This resulted in a room full of pent up, sleep deprived individuals who desperately wanted some alone time.
>Unfortunately, they were to be kept under heavy guard in the Psychically shielded room until...whenever.
"Ahg, I can't take this anymore! When will this end?"
"Calm down, we either drive off the 'nids or we get out minds fraked out of us."
>One of their number was close to the door, which is why he paid attention to it rather than the ensuing argument.
>There was a series of muffled thumps and cries, and then silence, followed by the clanking of locking mechanisms.
>The doors opened, and everyone in the chamber felt their hair stand on end, and a crawling sensation run up their spines.
>Several Tyranid Zoanthropes filed int the chamber, grinning madly
{{Allow us to introduce ourselves}}
>Several floors up, arcane mechanisms activated, as the "Bonding" commenced.

>After half an hour of sustained fighting, the Hive Tyrant fell to the ground panting.
Innumerable, but slowly regenerating wounds criss-crossed her body and limbs.
>General Cornelius Rupert stood over her, his greatcoat reduced to tatters.
"You were strong, but strength is no match for intelligence and resolve."
>For a moment, there was silence, then she began to laugh.
"Oh
>Everyone within 10km felt a sudden surge of heat in their loins.
>There was a sudden surge of pleasure, and everyone went over the peak
>Rupert spammed as his loins erupted, his eyes rolling back up into his head.
>He collapsed not far from a panting, and very satisfied Hive Tyrant.
"Ahhhggg, How can this be the end? I've commanded men for a century, Achieved so much glory...not like this."
"Oh please," She huffed, "Don't be....so...dramatic."
"I cannot live with this shame."
"Oh...you'll survive..."
>She presented her sizable ass to him, a hand reaching back and spreading her cheeks.
"Tell you what, best two out of three, whoever cums first loses."
"I shall...claim victory...in the name...of...The EMPEROR!"
>Be Lt Darius Rupert of the Imperial guard.
>Mere moments ago you were fighting for your life against a squad of Ogryn.
>Then some manner of warp fuckery happened, and you came so hard your vision went white for a moment.
>Fortunately, it would seem that your attackers were also not immune to whatever happened.
>Unfortunately, it seemed that every Tyranid on the damned planet was heading to your location.
>That, and several confused Ogryn were now looking at you.
>You barely manage to duck back into cover as high caliber rounds and insults.
>There is then the sound of numerous weapons running dry, and something large stomping in your direction.
"Oi, Waz Dat?"
>You peer over your cover and spot a Hive Tyrant barreling down on the Ogryn's position.
>A group of Ultramarines that size would have wiped the floor with her.
>She turns them into mincemeat.
>You then have her full and complete, undivided attention.
"Well now," She croons, "Just the man I was looking for."
"Me?"
>With a flourish she planted all four blades into the ground,before spreading her arms wide.
>Clear fluid is leaking from her lower lips in copious amounts.
>You can barely keep the Las-gun level, your body shaking from...well, everything.
"Aww, your defiance is just adorable, but we both know how this ends."
>She had a valid point, and the las-gun drops to your side.
"Is it too much to take me out for dinner first?"
>At this, she turns into a stuttering nervous wreck for all of ten seconds before you laugh.
>She scoops you up a moment later, glaring at you as hr boobs spill around your shoulders.
"Oh trust me Lieutenant, I'll be educating you on how to respect a superior for a week."
"Can't," You mumble, "Emperor know's there's going to be meetings."
>The glare holds for a second before she gives you a kiss with lots of tongue.
{{Oh that won't save you. You're mine now, and I intend to savor you tonight}}
{{Willing or not...I want to feel you struggle.}}

>meet a HUGE tiger girl at the gym
>this bitch looks like a tank that ate a tank
>jesus, her ass and arms are a huge turn on
>haha, wouldn't it be funny if she squatted your entire body with those tree trunk legs?
