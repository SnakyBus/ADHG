Day 42 of invasion
>Be Lt. Darius Rupert of the PDF
>Be evacuating another supply depot as Feminids advance across the planet
>Suffer surprise attack from Genestealers , hybrid infiltrators, but they were dealt with swiftly.
>Now you're trying to get as much ammunition loaded onto the cargo shuttles as possible asap.
>And to top it all of, a local noble was trying to get someone to evacuate him and his valuables.
>Matthias Ward the 13th was inbred as they came and resembled a squig in a suit.
>He was rumored bedfellow to the late Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge
>You had no desire to find out. All you wanted to do was escape to a fortified position.
>Marching over to the mostly intact Salamander, you asked your subordinates for a sit-rep.
"Sir, major enemy force twenty minutes away."
"How did this get so close?"
"Trygons and Raveners have been digging tunnels all over the place sir."
"Additional reports of traitorous elements and Genestealer cults providing mechanized transport."
>Wonderful...how long had the Genestealers been here to begin with, and how did they aviod detection for so long?
"Sir, Baron Ward wants an ETA on transport of himself and his collection."
>Looking at the Comms officer, you decided to indulge the slightly heretical and sensible part of your brain.
"Inform the Baron that due to misfiled paperwork from the Administratum, authorization cannot granted for...6 months and nine days."
>The Comms officer does, while you grab a dataslate containing inventory, trying to find the most valuable items to load.
"We might last about five minutes against this assault..."
"Sir, Baron Ward states that is unacceptable-"
"Then tell the ft bastard to pack a suitcase an get over here, we leave in twenty four minutes."
>You begin barking orders for the withdrawal, desperate to deny the Xenos anything of value
"HE SAID WHAT! HE DARES!"
>The ostentatious Ward Estate trembled under duress, mostly because of the upcoming attack.
>The other portion was provided by the spherical wobbling mass of angry nobility screaming in his quarters.
>His servants did their best not to flinch, enduring a storm of swears and spittle.
>The baron would be loading up his private shuttle, bu a cultist had made off with it.
>His collection of 1/6 scale Astartes models, his life's work, were stuck here with him.
>After a few more minutes of swearing, he stopped abruptly and stood, going to where his techpriest was working on a special project.
>Administratum misfiled paperwork, he was about to misplace a monstrous misplacement of his own.
>The Lt. would rue the day he defied Matthias Ward the Thirteenth!
>Entering the sidechamber, he looked at the pod that had come in on a bulk freighter a few years back.
>Upon it were emblazoned two very noticeable things, the first being the Officio Assasinourm's Seal.
>The other thing was the words, "Eversor XXX"
>Someone, somewhere, had well and truly fucked up.
"Tech-priest, tell the assassin to target Lt. Anon, and eliminate any Tyranids in the area!"
"As you wish, so shall it be done."
>The Tech-priest would do his best, but the nature of the subject within the stasis capsule made things tricky.
>Said Tech-priest had a bit to much confidence in his own skills, doubly so to those who knew what he was messing with.
>After a moment, the Tech-priest had finished uploading the commands, and de-activated containment.
>90 seconds later, the room was thoroughly coated in gore, oil, and scraps of armor and weapons.
>XXX heaved great gulps of air, twitching as drugs pumped into his bloodstream.
>He'd eliminated the people who dared to co-opt an Officio Asset, and thought themselves of higher standing than the Office.
>They had been successful in implanting their target however, PDF Lieutenant Darius Rupert, his location, and what was to be done.
>Grunting, XXX tore the over-sized syringe from his arm, cursing the ultramarine cosplay Ogryn.
>Grox Breeding Hormone...a full fifty cc's...explained why he felt so hot, and his synth-skin suit so tight in the crotch.
>Gripping his bolt pistol, the Assassin streaked down the halls of the mansion, gutting any unfortunate between him and the exit.
>XXX didn't bother with doors, he created new ones in walls as he sped toward his target.
>The HIve Tyrant snarled under her breath as yet another probing strike was thwarted
>She'd been sent to lead an attack on this supply depot, preventing the defenders escape, taking as many as possible.
>Her infiltrators had been identified by a Lt. before they could do any major damage to the guardsmen.
>Their Captain was out of commission, sure, but the Lt. had rallied his men and set up a line of defense.
>He'd even thwarted the efforts of a Ravener brood and several Lictors...impressive for a human.
>Still, this would make taking the humans alive a touch more difficult, they were organized.
>Worse, her scouts, living or otherwise, found the defenses to be well manned and planned.
>Removing that lieutenant took priority...and she had just the...individual...in mind.
{{Prepare the Dimachaeron}}
>The Hive Tyrant rumbled as she marched toward the human positions, her forces moving as she directed.
>Biovores expelled spore mines toward their target to soften it up and provided cover for the advance.
>Inside a dedicated transport creature, the Dimachaeron began to stir from bio-stasis.
>Things, for once, are going well, which means that everything is going to go sideways any second now.
>The Tyranids had run into prepared kill-zones and small minefields, though the bulk of their formation hadn't arrived.
>Another spore mine slammed into the ground, releasing a pink haze that Guard and PDF came to dread.
>Anyone who inhaled it would start moving as though heavily drunk, and reported a surge in libido.
>Thankfully, the supply depot had plenty of masks, heavy weapons, and explosives in stock.
That and a few of the power dildos had been shipped to your unit, and led to a surprising tactic.
>Tyranid Synapse creatures were isolated and pinned down, before/during/after inserting one.
>While probably heretical, any Tyranid in a short radius felt it too, preventing them from fighting.
>There was a roar as another pair of craft left ground, a Valkyrie and a supply shuttle.
>Casualties were starting to mount, those who could were being moved to the evac point.
>Other had been taken by the Tyranids, dragged into the hordes kicking and screaming.
>And the last fallback action had gone well, in another five minutes, all aircraft would be off the ground.
"What the frak is that!"
"Shoot it! Shoot it!"
"It's tearing through us!"
>Ah, the other boot just dropped, now you just needed to figure out what in the name of the Emperor had hit the line.
"West flank, start pulling back, I don't want those Tyranids to overrun the landing pads."
"Not Tyranids, some skull faced fraker is ripping apart everything in his path!"
>Not Tyranids...well, that's not good.
"Sir, what are your orders?"
"Begin final fallback maneuvers and board the shuttles, try and cover the west flank."
>You give a short salute, grab your bolt pistol and saber, before heading to the west flank.
>Your about halfway there when Tyranid fire starts peppering your position.
>A pack of Gaunts seems to have broken the line, and they look all to happy to see you.
>You hadn't been slacking off in your weapons drills, and you put three of the things down.
>Problem was, there were nine of them left and they were starting to try flanking you.
>Something human-shaped, black, and incredibly angry slams into them from the left.
>Bowlingpins.wav
>Seconds later, all but one of the Guants is dead, and is being violently violated by the thing.
>There's no small feeling of dread when you recognize just what hit the West Flank
>An Eversor Assassin, and it looks a little too happy to see you.
>Dropping the now catatonic Guant, it points at you, before making a slitting throat motion.
>Somehow, you can hear that blubbering Baron Laughing from here.
"WRYYYYY!"
>Yo back up while firing your bolt pistol, mentally writing up your will and testament.
>Suddenly, you trip on the edge of a drainage trench, falling backwards as the Assassin leaps at you.
"SKREEEEE!"
>Something thunders up, casting a shadow over you, before the Eversor is yanked from overhead.
>Landing in the water unharmed, you stand upright and turn to see what the frak that was.
>There was a very large Tyranid, slightly larger than a Carnifex, and with what looks like doubled up Lictor arms.
>You waste no time in scrambling out of the trench, grabbing the creature's attention.
>Suddenly, Its ribcage opens up, as the Eversor forces its way out in a grotesque parody of birth.
>Tearing your eyes from the damned thing, you run between a pair of containers, back towards the landing pads.
>The Eversor starts screaming, and the sound drops off rapidly, the 'nid probably having thrown him.
>Already you can hear the thing stomping towards you, smashing containers aside.
>Weapons-fire and Tyranid screeching are the backdrop to snarling and sundering metal.
>Glancing at your wrist chrono, you see you have 90 seconds to get to a Valkyrie.
>Your foot slips in a random patch of oil, just a pair of massive talons strike a few meters away.
>The 'nid is perched on the tops of the containers, claws snapping at you like a pair of tongs.
>You put two bolts in it, before it yanks the gun from your hands, tossing it aside.
>It grips your boot, hoisting you several feet off the ground, chest maw flexing open as it laughs.
"WRYYYYY!"
>The Eversor landed on the claws, slime-coated and a little battered, but no less murderous.
>You manage to free yourself from your boot with panic induced kicking, landing hard on your shoulder.
>There is a lot of screaming, but you just focus on running as though a daemon is on your heels.
>The Assasin is flung into the side of a container with enough force to dent it, but is up in seconds
>The Tyranid is assailed with toxin and brutal slashes, but it isn't even phased.
>Somehow, the dueling killing machines are always one step behind you, and you manage to reach the landing pads.
>Craft are already starting to take off, and the gateway slams shut behind you cutting off most of the screaming.
>You sprint with everything you have left to the nearest Valkyrie

>The Dimachaeron had had enough of her latest, and by far most persistent and stubborn, Assailant.
>Her target had escaped, and would likely be airborne in moments.
>The skull faced creature, for no human could take that level of punishment, seemed equal parts irate and erect.
>Well, if the wannabe wanted to fuck with her, she Would FUCK HIM!
>Her lengthy upper limbs slammed the feisty little shit to the ground, pinning his arms to the solid surface below.
>Drooling lower lips engulf his throbbing dick, before she slammed down.
>Every time he started thrashing, she'd apply just a little more force, he was sturdy enough to take it.
>He might have been unmatched in terms of ferocity, but he;d been merely modified.
>SHE, on the other hand, had been designed with DNA filtered through numerous battles.
>It would only be a matter of time before he succumbed to her relentless mating instincts.
>The roaring of numerous engines barely drowned out his cry as he exploded within her.
>His thrashing lessened, and she knew for certain a few more ought to teach him where he belonged.
>The Valkaery was lifting skywards when the gates at the far end of the pads were smashed open.
"Lt. Hive Tyrant!"
>You looked out the rear door of the drop-ship to behold a monstrous intelligence.
>Tyranids poured through the gap, but towering above them were a pair of Tyrant Guards, and the Tyrant herself.
"Orders sir?"
>On the one hand, killing her would devastate the local 'nids, but a warrior brood with venom cannons...
"Do not engage, just get us out of here. We can't risk it."
"Aye sir."
>Before the ramp closes, you could swear she was looking at you with a hungry grin.
>Adrenaline wears off, and you begin to laugh and cry at the same time.
>You're alive, and your plevis isn't beign ground into paste.
"Praise the Emperor."
>An hour later...
>The Hive Tyrant looked at the scene before her, utterly amazed as how one little thing could do so much damage.
>The discovery of Servitors had been shocking enough, but this thing was in a league of its own.
>Currently, it was immobilized by bio-resin and sporting a cracked pelvis at best, and a very flaccid member.
>A Venomthrope and Zoanthrope attended it, keeping it sedated and calm respectively.
>Not far from them was the slightly emaciated, very exhausted, and very satisfied Dimachaeron.
>Another Venomthrope attending her to neutralize toxins, and a Tyrant Guard permitting the normal violent organism to suckle.
>Shaking her massive head, the Tyrant reached into the Hive-Mind, alerting the others to the threat the Lt. posed.
>Moments later, she was given some inserting information, the good Lt. was related to General Powerstache.
>...He was going to be hers, she would outmaneuver and overpower him through skill of command and force of arms.

>tfw Peggy will never abuse her authority and make you eat her out under her desk for a promotion

>You try to get out, but your captor just shushes you and caresses your head, whispering about how happy you'll be together

>Humies wanting waifurs to be protective and change a human male’s life is considered agenda driven
>Next they’ll have a movie where two humie bois are gay and don’t need a reason to get a anthro women’s to be happy

Do you think thirsty anthros obsess over fictional human husbandos? Do they get into shitposting wars about who's humando is better?

110%
Probably even more than us.

>Probably even more than us
Just imagine their forums are like during heat season.

Bovine waifurs are the master race

>He needs someone to take care of him (maybe an anthro old friend or hired help)
>The anthro falls in love with him, but isn't sure if he would accept her
>She gets more and more horny at the idea of taking him, but resists because she cares about him
>Eventually she tells him how he feels, and he says he feels the same way
>This leads to sweet sex where he tries his best to make her happy too
>He might not be as proficient as he once was, but she loves him enough not to care

>she laughs as she opens the door two cups of coffee in tow,

>you shakily rise up to your full height, hand on the armrests
>"How'd I sleep? HOW'D I FUCKING SLEEP! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME LAST NIGHT?"
>her smile vanishes before returning in a much smaller and more embarrassed form.
>"yeah... sorry about that.. it's sort of our job y'know."
>she was clearly uncomfortable judging by her sudden avoidance of eye contact.
>"Sorry isn't going to cut it! You were all kindergarten teachers and then you slipped me a fucking roofie!"
>she looks even more upset now, her ears noticeably pressed back against her head!
>"Listen I know you weren't expecting it but it was supposed to calm you down."
>You were furious, your masculine anger and rage were what kept you from those despicable mommyfags
>How dare this hippie bitch violate your mind like that!

>she gives her deepest sigh yet

>You look at her shocked, you thought that this was to break your will make you subservient.

>she continues, her head drooping with every syllable
>"within a week... wonder why right?" bitter sarcasm now tinging her normally sweet voice
>"Our job is to figure out.. how to find out how to prevent that problem. Especially more troubled ones like yourself.."
>"What we gave you last night was supposed to calm you down.. make you react less violently to us without a full lobotomy.."
>"Of course there were a few girls back home who were down with that, but me and the girls running these places don't jive with that kind of thing."
>looking back this actually made sense

>"a lot of people were hurt."
>the Cheetah looks up at you sniffling and clearly restraining tears before a weak trembling smile forms

>she was now doing full on damage control
>and from her quivering smile, you can tell she knows it
>that under all the acoustic guitar and crystal telepathy, all of them knew just how awful this was.
>you looked up at her a mix of rage and sympathy
>then you stop, you can't even muster any will to be mad any more
>the cheetah gets up panicked that you'll get closer to the thing she's working hard to prevent
>"Ohmigod I'm so sorry! I shouldn't 'ave freakin dropped this on you."
>the rage comes back but it's muted and just as directed at yourself as it was at her
>you clench your fist but your head continues to sag
>"I can't say this is ok..."
>she tries to put her paw on your hand but you gently push her away
>"but this just didn't turn out how I expected it would."
>"If it's any consolation I get it, lot of dudes come here thinking they're gonna play Hogan's Heroes. Heck I came here, thinking I was gonna be some kinda superhero."
>"course in the real world things turn out different.
>you don't talk anymore
>you are now sitting there silently for what feels like eternity
>both of you staring at the floor not daring, to look at each other just in case eye contact alone would reveal more uncomfortable truths
>she clears her throat and leans against the wall for support, her hair now covering her eyes almost completely
>"You should finish your coffee."
>you nod still reeling and a little emasculated
>you gingerly sip the warm black liquid
>"It tastes like shit.."
>she laughs this time it's geniune, "Yeah it does... come on we should get out of here, Andromeda is making waffles and I don't want

>"Oh. Then I suppose that asshole would like his drink back."
>The bird swipes the expensive drink from her and knocks it back
>You could have sworn you heard the woman complaining, but you were too surprised by the bird grabbing you and releasing the drink into your mouth
>You feel your mind becoming fuzzy as the alcohol does its work, and melt into her as she kisses you

>"He bought the drink. I was merely returning it..."
>Her tongue licks her beak

What next? That doberman trying to convince him to become a special informant? A sloth or koala trying to get him to leave the city and join their commune? A puma gently persuading him to assist in her organization's trafficking operations? A panda offering him a nice luxury apartment across the world in exchange for 'joining' the doberman for her? An exotic lioness princess offering him a big white palace with all wives he could want so long as he has many, many children? A pine martin requesting that he become a figurehead of her novel and clearly superior movement in exchange for a seat beside her after they inevitably 'win-over' everyone? A kangaroo trying to convince him that moving with her into a big and isolated bunker complex is the only way he'll be able to survive what's inevitably going to happen to the outside world?

>Getting tongue bathed for hours after sex because she likes your salty sweat and exhausted whimpers

>getting tongue bathed for hours
>rough as fuck tongue like sandpaper.
You will bleed. Humans who have been licked by big cats in captivity say it’s exactly like sandpaper and will rub the skin raw. The cats don’t know this so you have to try not to irritate them because they may get upset if you refuse them yet allowing them will eventually result in so much skin being removed you bleed.
Getting tongue bathed for hours would probably be an effective form of torture. As the skin is removed more and more nerves get exposed thus it slowly gets more painful. Ever touched a really bad deep wound and feel excruciating pain? Imagine that over a foot of skin but constant.
