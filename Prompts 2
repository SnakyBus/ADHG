Day 42 of invasion
>Be Lt. Darius Rupert of the PDF
>Be evacuating another supply depot as Feminids advance across the planet
>Suffer surprise attack from Genestealers , hybrid infiltrators, but they were dealt with swiftly.
>Now you're trying to get as much ammunition loaded onto the cargo shuttles as possible asap.
>And to top it all of, a local noble was trying to get someone to evacuate him and his valuables.
>Matthias Ward the 13th was inbred as they came and resembled a squig in a suit.
>He was rumored bedfellow to the late Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge
>You had no desire to find out. All you wanted to do was escape to a fortified position.
>Marching over to the mostly intact Salamander, you asked your subordinates for a sit-rep.
"Sir, major enemy force twenty minutes away."
"How did this get so close?"
"Trygons and Raveners have been digging tunnels all over the place sir."
"Additional reports of traitorous elements and Genestealer cults providing mechanized transport."
>Wonderful...how long had the Genestealers been here to begin with, and how did they aviod detection for so long?
"Sir, Baron Ward wants an ETA on transport of himself and his collection."
>Looking at the Comms officer, you decided to indulge the slightly heretical and sensible part of your brain.
"Inform the Baron that due to misfiled paperwork from the Administratum, authorization cannot granted for...6 months and nine days."
>The Comms officer does, while you grab a dataslate containing inventory, trying to find the most valuable items to load.
"We might last about five minutes against this assault..."
"Sir, Baron Ward states that is unacceptable-"
"Then tell the ft bastard to pack a suitcase an get over here, we leave in twenty four minutes."
>You begin barking orders for the withdrawal, desperate to deny the Xenos anything of value
"HE SAID WHAT! HE DARES!"
>The ostentatious Ward Estate trembled under duress, mostly because of the upcoming attack.
>The other portion was provided by the spherical wobbling mass of angry nobility screaming in his quarters.
>His servants did their best not to flinch, enduring a storm of swears and spittle.
>The baron would be loading up his private shuttle, bu a cultist had made off with it.
>His collection of 1/6 scale Astartes models, his life's work, were stuck here with him.
>After a few more minutes of swearing, he stopped abruptly and stood, going to where his techpriest was working on a special project.
>Administratum misfiled paperwork, he was about to misplace a monstrous misplacement of his own.
>The Lt. would rue the day he defied Matthias Ward the Thirteenth!
>Entering the sidechamber, he looked at the pod that had come in on a bulk freighter a few years back.
>Upon it were emblazoned two very noticeable things, the first being the Officio Assasinourm's Seal.
>The other thing was the words, "Eversor XXX"
>Someone, somewhere, had well and truly fucked up.
"Tech-priest, tell the assassin to target Lt. Anon, and eliminate any Tyranids in the area!"
"As you wish, so shall it be done."
>The Tech-priest would do his best, but the nature of the subject within the stasis capsule made things tricky.
>Said Tech-priest had a bit to much confidence in his own skills, doubly so to those who knew what he was messing with.
>After a moment, the Tech-priest had finished uploading the commands, and de-activated containment.
>90 seconds later, the room was thoroughly coated in gore, oil, and scraps of armor and weapons.
>XXX heaved great gulps of air, twitching as drugs pumped into his bloodstream.
>He'd eliminated the people who dared to co-opt an Officio Asset, and thought themselves of higher standing than the Office.
>They had been successful in implanting their target however, PDF Lieutenant Darius Rupert, his location, and what was to be done.
>Grunting, XXX tore the over-sized syringe from his arm, cursing the ultramarine cosplay Ogryn.
>Grox Breeding Hormone...a full fifty cc's...explained why he felt so hot, and his synth-skin suit so tight in the crotch.
>Gripping his bolt pistol, the Assassin streaked down the halls of the mansion, gutting any unfortunate between him and the exit.
>XXX didn't bother with doors, he created new ones in walls as he sped toward his target.
>The HIve Tyrant snarled under her breath as yet another probing strike was thwarted
>She'd been sent to lead an attack on this supply depot, preventing the defenders escape, taking as many as possible.
>Her infiltrators had been identified by a Lt. before they could do any major damage to the guardsmen.
>Their Captain was out of commission, sure, but the Lt. had rallied his men and set up a line of defense.
>He'd even thwarted the efforts of a Ravener brood and several Lictors...impressive for a human.
>Still, this would make taking the humans alive a touch more difficult, they were organized.
>Worse, her scouts, living or otherwise, found the defenses to be well manned and planned.
>Removing that lieutenant took priority...and she had just the...individual...in mind.
{{Prepare the Dimachaeron}}
>The Hive Tyrant rumbled as she marched toward the human positions, her forces moving as she directed.
>Biovores expelled spore mines toward their target to soften it up and provided cover for the advance.
>Inside a dedicated transport creature, the Dimachaeron began to stir from bio-stasis.
>Things, for once, are going well, which means that everything is going to go sideways any second now.
>The Tyranids had run into prepared kill-zones and small minefields, though the bulk of their formation hadn't arrived.
>Another spore mine slammed into the ground, releasing a pink haze that Guard and PDF came to dread.
>Anyone who inhaled it would start moving as though heavily drunk, and reported a surge in libido.
>Thankfully, the supply depot had plenty of masks, heavy weapons, and explosives in stock.
That and a few of the power dildos had been shipped to your unit, and led to a surprising tactic.
>Tyranid Synapse creatures were isolated and pinned down, before/during/after inserting one.
>While probably heretical, any Tyranid in a short radius felt it too, preventing them from fighting.
>There was a roar as another pair of craft left ground, a Valkyrie and a supply shuttle.
>Casualties were starting to mount, those who could were being moved to the evac point.
>Other had been taken by the Tyranids, dragged into the hordes kicking and screaming.
>And the last fallback action had gone well, in another five minutes, all aircraft would be off the ground.
"What the frak is that!"
"Shoot it! Shoot it!"
"It's tearing through us!"
>Ah, the other boot just dropped, now you just needed to figure out what in the name of the Emperor had hit the line.
"West flank, start pulling back, I don't want those Tyranids to overrun the landing pads."
"Not Tyranids, some skull faced fraker is ripping apart everything in his path!"
>Not Tyranids...well, that's not good.
"Sir, what are your orders?"
"Begin final fallback maneuvers and board the shuttles, try and cover the west flank."
>You give a short salute, grab your bolt pistol and saber, before heading to the west flank.
>Your about halfway there when Tyranid fire starts peppering your position.
>A pack of Gaunts seems to have broken the line, and they look all to happy to see you.
>You hadn't been slacking off in your weapons drills, and you put three of the things down.
>Problem was, there were nine of them left and they were starting to try flanking you.
>Something human-shaped, black, and incredibly angry slams into them from the left.
>Bowlingpins.wav
>Seconds later, all but one of the Guants is dead, and is being violently violated by the thing.
>There's no small feeling of dread when you recognize just what hit the West Flank
>An Eversor Assassin, and it looks a little too happy to see you.
>Dropping the now catatonic Guant, it points at you, before making a slitting throat motion.
>Somehow, you can hear that blubbering Baron Laughing from here.
"WRYYYYY!"
>Yo back up while firing your bolt pistol, mentally writing up your will and testament.
>Suddenly, you trip on the edge of a drainage trench, falling backwards as the Assassin leaps at you.
"SKREEEEE!"
>Something thunders up, casting a shadow over you, before the Eversor is yanked from overhead.
>Landing in the water unharmed, you stand upright and turn to see what the frak that was.
>There was a very large Tyranid, slightly larger than a Carnifex, and with what looks like doubled up Lictor arms.
>You waste no time in scrambling out of the trench, grabbing the creature's attention.
>Suddenly, Its ribcage opens up, as the Eversor forces its way out in a grotesque parody of birth.
>Tearing your eyes from the damned thing, you run between a pair of containers, back towards the landing pads.
>The Eversor starts screaming, and the sound drops off rapidly, the 'nid probably having thrown him.
>Already you can hear the thing stomping towards you, smashing containers aside.
>Weapons-fire and Tyranid screeching are the backdrop to snarling and sundering metal.
>Glancing at your wrist chrono, you see you have 90 seconds to get to a Valkyrie.
>Your foot slips in a random patch of oil, just a pair of massive talons strike a few meters away.
>The 'nid is perched on the tops of the containers, claws snapping at you like a pair of tongs.
>You put two bolts in it, before it yanks the gun from your hands, tossing it aside.
>It grips your boot, hoisting you several feet off the ground, chest maw flexing open as it laughs.
"WRYYYYY!"
>The Eversor landed on the claws, slime-coated and a little battered, but no less murderous.
>You manage to free yourself from your boot with panic induced kicking, landing hard on your shoulder.
>There is a lot of screaming, but you just focus on running as though a daemon is on your heels.
>The Assasin is flung into the side of a container with enough force to dent it, but is up in seconds
>The Tyranid is assailed with toxin and brutal slashes, but it isn't even phased.
>Somehow, the dueling killing machines are always one step behind you, and you manage to reach the landing pads.
>Craft are already starting to take off, and the gateway slams shut behind you cutting off most of the screaming.
>You sprint with everything you have left to the nearest Valkyrie

>The Dimachaeron had had enough of her latest, and by far most persistent and stubborn, Assailant.
>Her target had escaped, and would likely be airborne in moments.
>The skull faced creature, for no human could take that level of punishment, seemed equal parts irate and erect.
>Well, if the wannabe wanted to fuck with her, she Would FUCK HIM!
>Her lengthy upper limbs slammed the feisty little shit to the ground, pinning his arms to the solid surface below.
>Drooling lower lips engulf his throbbing dick, before she slammed down.
>Every time he started thrashing, she'd apply just a little more force, he was sturdy enough to take it.
>He might have been unmatched in terms of ferocity, but he;d been merely modified.
>SHE, on the other hand, had been designed with DNA filtered through numerous battles.
>It would only be a matter of time before he succumbed to her relentless mating instincts.
>The roaring of numerous engines barely drowned out his cry as he exploded within her.
>His thrashing lessened, and she knew for certain a few more ought to teach him where he belonged.
>The Valkaery was lifting skywards when the gates at the far end of the pads were smashed open.
"Lt. Hive Tyrant!"
>You looked out the rear door of the drop-ship to behold a monstrous intelligence.
>Tyranids poured through the gap, but towering above them were a pair of Tyrant Guards, and the Tyrant herself.
"Orders sir?"
>On the one hand, killing her would devastate the local 'nids, but a warrior brood with venom cannons...
"Do not engage, just get us out of here. We can't risk it."
"Aye sir."
>Before the ramp closes, you could swear she was looking at you with a hungry grin.
>Adrenaline wears off, and you begin to laugh and cry at the same time.
>You're alive, and your plevis isn't beign ground into paste.
"Praise the Emperor."
>An hour later...
>The Hive Tyrant looked at the scene before her, utterly amazed as how one little thing could do so much damage.
>The discovery of Servitors had been shocking enough, but this thing was in a league of its own.
>Currently, it was immobilized by bio-resin and sporting a cracked pelvis at best, and a very flaccid member.
>A Venomthrope and Zoanthrope attended it, keeping it sedated and calm respectively.
>Not far from them was the slightly emaciated, very exhausted, and very satisfied Dimachaeron.
>Another Venomthrope attending her to neutralize toxins, and a Tyrant Guard permitting the normal violent organism to suckle.
>Shaking her massive head, the Tyrant reached into the Hive-Mind, alerting the others to the threat the Lt. posed.
>Moments later, she was given some inserting information, the good Lt. was related to General Powerstache.
>...He was going to be hers, she would outmaneuver and overpower him through skill of command and force of arms.

>tfw Peggy will never abuse her authority and make you eat her out under her desk for a promotion

>You try to get out, but your captor just shushes you and caresses your head, whispering about how happy you'll be together

>Humies wanting waifurs to be protective and change a human male’s life is considered agenda driven
>Next they’ll have a movie where two humie bois are gay and don’t need a reason to get a anthro women’s to be happy

Do you think thirsty anthros obsess over fictional human husbandos? Do they get into shitposting wars about who's humando is better?

110%
Probably even more than us.

>Probably even more than us
Just imagine their forums are like during heat season.

Bovine waifurs are the master race

>He needs someone to take care of him (maybe an anthro old friend or hired help)
>The anthro falls in love with him, but isn't sure if he would accept her
>She gets more and more horny at the idea of taking him, but resists because she cares about him
>Eventually she tells him how he feels, and he says he feels the same way
>This leads to sweet sex where he tries his best to make her happy too
>He might not be as proficient as he once was, but she loves him enough not to care

>she laughs as she opens the door two cups of coffee in tow,

>you shakily rise up to your full height, hand on the armrests
>"How'd I sleep? HOW'D I FUCKING SLEEP! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME LAST NIGHT?"
>her smile vanishes before returning in a much smaller and more embarrassed form.
>"yeah... sorry about that.. it's sort of our job y'know."
>she was clearly uncomfortable judging by her sudden avoidance of eye contact.
>"Sorry isn't going to cut it! You were all kindergarten teachers and then you slipped me a fucking roofie!"
>she looks even more upset now, her ears noticeably pressed back against her head!
>"Listen I know you weren't expecting it but it was supposed to calm you down."
>You were furious, your masculine anger and rage were what kept you from those despicable mommyfags
>How dare this hippie bitch violate your mind like that!

>she gives her deepest sigh yet

>You look at her shocked, you thought that this was to break your will make you subservient.

>she continues, her head drooping with every syllable
>"within a week... wonder why right?" bitter sarcasm now tinging her normally sweet voice
>"Our job is to figure out.. how to find out how to prevent that problem. Especially more troubled ones like yourself.."
>"What we gave you last night was supposed to calm you down.. make you react less violently to us without a full lobotomy.."
>"Of course there were a few girls back home who were down with that, but me and the girls running these places don't jive with that kind of thing."
>looking back this actually made sense

>"a lot of people were hurt."
>the Cheetah looks up at you sniffling and clearly restraining tears before a weak trembling smile forms

>she was now doing full on damage control
>and from her quivering smile, you can tell she knows it
>that under all the acoustic guitar and crystal telepathy, all of them knew just how awful this was.
>you looked up at her a mix of rage and sympathy
>then you stop, you can't even muster any will to be mad any more
>the cheetah gets up panicked that you'll get closer to the thing she's working hard to prevent
>"Ohmigod I'm so sorry! I shouldn't 'ave freakin dropped this on you."
>the rage comes back but it's muted and just as directed at yourself as it was at her
>you clench your fist but your head continues to sag
>"I can't say this is ok..."
>she tries to put her paw on your hand but you gently push her away
>"but this just didn't turn out how I expected it would."
>"If it's any consolation I get it, lot of dudes come here thinking they're gonna play Hogan's Heroes. Heck I came here, thinking I was gonna be some kinda superhero."
>"course in the real world things turn out different.
>you don't talk anymore
>you are now sitting there silently for what feels like eternity
>both of you staring at the floor not daring, to look at each other just in case eye contact alone would reveal more uncomfortable truths
>she clears her throat and leans against the wall for support, her hair now covering her eyes almost completely
>"You should finish your coffee."
>you nod still reeling and a little emasculated
>you gingerly sip the warm black liquid
>"It tastes like shit.."
>she laughs this time it's geniune, "Yeah it does... come on we should get out of here, Andromeda is making waffles and I don't want

>"Oh. Then I suppose that asshole would like his drink back."
>The bird swipes the expensive drink from her and knocks it back
>You could have sworn you heard the woman complaining, but you were too surprised by the bird grabbing you and releasing the drink into your mouth
>You feel your mind becoming fuzzy as the alcohol does its work, and melt into her as she kisses you

>"He bought the drink. I was merely returning it..."
>Her tongue licks her beak

What next? That doberman trying to convince him to become a special informant? A sloth or koala trying to get him to leave the city and join their commune? A puma gently persuading him to assist in her organization's trafficking operations? A panda offering him a nice luxury apartment across the world in exchange for 'joining' the doberman for her? An exotic lioness princess offering him a big white palace with all wives he could want so long as he has many, many children? A pine martin requesting that he become a figurehead of her novel and clearly superior movement in exchange for a seat beside her after they inevitably 'win-over' everyone? A kangaroo trying to convince him that moving with her into a big and isolated bunker complex is the only way he'll be able to survive what's inevitably going to happen to the outside world?

>Getting tongue bathed for hours after sex because she likes your salty sweat and exhausted whimpers

>getting tongue bathed for hours
>rough as fuck tongue like sandpaper.
You will bleed. Humans who have been licked by big cats in captivity say it’s exactly like sandpaper and will rub the skin raw. The cats don’t know this so you have to try not to irritate them because they may get upset if you refuse them yet allowing them will eventually result in so much skin being removed you bleed.
Getting tongue bathed for hours would probably be an effective form of torture. As the skin is removed more and more nerves get exposed thus it slowly gets more painful. Ever touched a really bad deep wound and feel excruciating pain? Imagine that over a foot of skin but constant.
Anthro cats hired at Guantanamo bay confirmed.

Boys can do sports. Wrestling (with other humans), volleyball, basketball, track and field. The girls wouldn't be happy if they lost their chance to gaze at men in tight pants.

They might be faster, but we're the distance runners. By the time they manage catch up, they'll be frustrated and horny.

Now I want a story where a man is constantly being hunted by a single anthro, running for days until she finally manages to get him.

That's literally the highest rated game show on anthro tv

>occasionally watch "The Sexiest Game" on Anthro Entertainment Network
>it's secretly become my guilty pleasure
>premise of an anthro woman being given 72 hours to hunt down a human within an enclosed environment
>if the human manages to survive for the time period, he wins $10k
>if the anthro manages to catch him, she wins an all-expenses-paid wedding and honeymoon for the both of them
>though perceived as very demeaning within human circles, it's become a staple TV show within anthro society
>decide to volunteer as a contestant
>called in, meet with a few TV execs and their lawyers, sign a few waivers
>"You have 3 months to prep, good luck"
>right, totally
>brush it off, as real as they make it out to be it's hard to believe that such a ridiculous premise ISN'T scripted
>fuck around for first two months of "training", only deciding in the last month to actually start

>pushed out the heli
>black out for a split second
>nearly fucking pissed my pants

>loud speaker blares seemingly from all directions "You will be given a 30 minute grace period. After that, your Sexiest Game will begin! Good luck."
>take the first few minutes after landing to calm down from a bit of shock
>deep breaths, recollect myself before remembering: I'm on live television and being hunted for sport
>heave pack over my shoulder, shit's actually pretty heavy
>empty it onto the dirt ground
>rummage through all the stuff provided; power bars, jerky, a couple of water bottles, and a first aid kit to highlight the most important stuff
>been at least 15 minutes since the first warning, decide to take only what looks necessary
>cram food, water, and medical gear, and some other shit into backpack
>notice a sheet of paper that fell out along with the rest of my gear

>sun almost completely set, practically pitch-black
>suddenly hear a branch snap from afar, footsteps approaching, the sound of dead leaves crunching

>"Oh, that's no fun."
>She's whispering very quietly, as if we weren't the only two in this whole damn forest preserve
>Humans are distance runners, but what does it matter if she can clear 50 meters in a third of the time it takes me?
>"This wouldn't make for a very entertaining episode, don't you think hon?"
>She waits for a response but I sit still
>I can practically hear the smile on her face
>"I was asked to play this out for as long as I could. But I could take you right now and no one would blame me for claiming my prize."
>She licks my cheek with her hot tongue
>"Then again, the fun is in the hunt. You better start taking me seriously."
>I sit there for too long again, and as I get up to walk away I'm certain there's no one nearby
>legs trembling a bit, breathing slowly coming down
>and the most powerful fear-boner on this side of the earth
>can't shake the feeling that she's gonna fucking wreck me
>pull out a space blanket from my pack and call it a night

>against all odds anon, somehow, actually manages to win
>everyone is left baffled, this has never happened before in the history of the show
>wolf is heartbroken, her chance to claim a humie of her, and she somehow lost
>anon walks over to her
>she expects him to start gloating about hpopw he won
>instead jumps up into her arms and starts kissing her
>now everyone is even more confused

I wonder what demographics would watch that show.
Would it be a thing a whole family would sit down for, just lonely anthros, would it lean male or female viewership?

Majority
>Female anthros who:
>Are lonely
>Want to improve on their husband hunting skills
>Hope to eventually join the game

>Minority
>Male humans who:
>Wish to learn how to fight or escape anthros
>Cynics who want to laugh at the stupid guys who think they can win
>Survivalists
>Conspiracy theorists who are preparing for when anthro females finally abolish laws making rape illegal (which will never happen, definitely won't happen, trust us the anthro lawmakers will ensure these rules stay in place so please vote for us you cute male humans, and loneliness will be a thing of the past)

Anyone else here ever go from having no interest in anthro's to only being able to get hard to them? Not sure what the fuck is going on or why I keep doing stuff automatically without even thinking about it. Obviously, I don't need to worry about Snakelady, I can trust in her completely. And she really does have the most amazing eyes that are so easy to get lost in. Still, I kind of feel like this is moving a little fast.

I’ve found that a lotta anthros do that. At least the female ones do to human guys
Either it’s a look in the eye, or it’s the way they smell. Or even in their spit
Knew a guy, a friend really who was openly anti antro-human relationship. You know the type, scrawny, pale and just kinda angry at the state of the world and his place in it
One day he was talking about why we shouldn’t trust the anthros while we were at campus and while he was talking a tiger lady, probably about 7 foot with broad shoulders and wide hips, and a admittedly amazing rack, walked up behind him, grabbed him, and before he could say or do anything, kissed him on the mouth, like, a deep kiss, I heard him choking and saw that his throat was bulging where you could see her tongue wiggling around.
He was really fighting, but she had his arms pinned to his sides and he was only like five 10 at best. His eyes were bulging out of his head and his brow was furrowed and he was fighting like a monster...then he wasn’t. He just kinda went still, he looked relaxed and calm...and he was kinda smiling, he wasn’t even choking on her tongue anymore. I think the scariest part was that he was all of a sudden locking on to her eyes and she was looking back
Then she pulled away and put him back down, patted him on the head and walked away...and before I could ask what the hell happened, he trotted off after her.
That was the last I saw of him for a few weeks
Then he turns up again. And I swear he grew 5 inches and got like 80 pounds of pure muscle mass...and the tiger lady was with him, or I guess he was with her. And they had some other folks with them a bunny girl and a some sorta lizard, but he looked at me, talked to them and pointed at me and they both started walking my way, and I got this sudden rush of fear, and I made a bee line for the exit and my car, which I made it to, I remember when I was driving out I looked at the campus and I saw all 4 of them smiling at me.

I didn’t know tiger pheromones could give a dude a 5 inch growth spurt in a matter of weeks
Like
Dude didn’t have bad posture or anything, he was 5’ 10”. Than when he showed up again he was like 6’ 3”, 6’ 4”

No clue about your friend. I'm guessing the pheromones are what initially made him all docile and compliant like you mentioned, but as for the growth, no clue. Sometime working out can maybe add an inch as they start to actually stretch out using different muscle groups, but as for the rest of the height, not to mention the muscles, no clue.
Was his personality still intact, or was he basically just a himbo in tow?

Well
When I went back to classes a little while after that incident where he and that damn tigress tried to bushwhack me with the two anthros, I was walking around campus I heard him running his mouth, except that now he was talking about how great anthro women were great, and how we as a, and I freakin quote, “good and just people” should help them find “mates” because they don’t have many men in their species, and without us they would have huge problems.
Like some sort of evangelical for species mixing. He had that tigress hanging off of him the whole time. I would have continued to listen but that rabbit lady from earlier snuck up on me and she....its not important
But I had to break and run while I was still able to think straight so I didn’t get the chance to hear the rest of it.
But from what I heard, it was the opposite of what he was like, he always said that it was a invasion, that they were lying about what they wanted from us. That we were no better than cattle to the slaughter at best and a race of slaves at worst. And he said we were already lost because of how fast they got themselves into places of power.
He talked about self defense and humans working together to get back control and how people who dated and married anthros were traitors and the like.
It’s like he was a completely different person. But somehow the same.
But I think that he was right, about us being no better than a slave race. I didn’t used to. But after what I’ve seen the last couple of months, before and during this lockdown.

I just want to say I like that
>The Sexiest Game
is now thread canon. It doesn't even matter if the details are all over the place, it's like survivor, after a certain number of seasons they just start going crazy with the rules.

Oh God, the season/episode ideas.
>Bayou Battle: with croc ladies
>Turning the Tables: The hunted is the hunter.
>Northern Exposure: Polar bears, moose, etc
>Isolation Island: Tree snakes, jungle cats
>Austrailian Anarchy: Special episode which a collection of Aussie anthros battle one another for a human to claim while on the run. Possibly Mad Max influence.

Any good rabbit episodes? I haven't seen much of them but they'd probably be pretty good at it

The rabbit episodes aren't that great, it's always the exact same formula.
>rabbit runs around and finds where the guy is most likely to run to
>settles in to a small hole between landing zone and where he'll run and waits to ambush
>soon as he comes into range she bolts out, dropkicks him, and snaps the cuffs onto them
>the most variance their ever is is if he takes a different route or decides to run somewhere else
>if so she just moves to settle in to a different ambush spot
Rabbits have a much easier time because they're actually fairly close to humans so they can just feel their way through what they would do in that situation and it usually ends up being the same as what the human does.
I know I said the rabbit episodes weren't that great but compared to almost all of the rest of the other episodes they're pretty damn good. With most other anthros' episodes you can know who's going to win as soon as you see the human; either he's going to be completely out of breath before the grace period ends and just get rushed down immediately, which is what usually happens, or he's just gonna keep running nonstop and the anthro is gonna expend all of her energy in the first few hours and at that point they may as well forfeit. At least with the ambush anthros there's multiple times throughout the game where the anthro could win even against a fit human and where an unfit human could win as long as they're able to outwit the anthro.

>Be a human who has fallen on hard times
>Had to change your name because you're ashamed of the things you had to do to live
>Go to the Jade Palace because you felt like it was your best chance at a new life
>So you sit before Shifu, begging for him and the others to let you join
>"Please, I can't go back to living there! I'll learn, I'll cook, I'll clean! I'll do anything!"
>Shifu avoided your gaze, opting instead to look at the floor
>"I'm sorry, Anon. We already have enough students, and no human has been able to become a kung fu master in many years!"
>"Just... please. I don't know what else to do. I'll just do chores if I must, I'll work harder than anyone, just please let me stay."
>"I'm sorry, only students are allowed, and you fit no school I know of, so I can't teach you. I really wish I could help, but I just can't."
>You hang your head and you start to feel your eyes water
>You can feel the regretful gazes of the others
>But then an old voice breaks your misery
>"But there is a school."
>You look up and see an old turtle standing behind the others
>"Really? There is?!"
>Shifu looks to his master, surprised
>"But Oogway, you can't mean I teach him-"
>"Yes, human style. The way of diplomacy, and misdirection."
>Diplomacy?
>You thought this place taught martial arts, not diplomacy
>Still, you aren't going to complain
>"I'm willing to to learn the way of the diplomat, master!"
>"No, no you aren't!"
>"He seems perfectly willing to me. In all my studies, I know well about the master of the human style. He was a lot like this boy."
>"The master of the human style made it himself. To make Anon learn it to live here i-it's undignified!"
>"Undignified? The man who made this style was said to control armies with a wave of his hand, could distract the most disciplined warriors allowing for a fatal blow, and even the most fickle of people held undying loyalty to him."
>You give a deep bow
>"Please!"
>Shifu looks annoyed for a second, but soon relents
>"Fine. You may join us."
>"Yes!"
>"But! Before you agree, you need to know what you are getting into. The human style is unlike any other. It is a style that, while useful in battle, is almost useless in a fight alone."
>"I can accept that."
>"It even attracts foes who would wish to make use of you."
>"But also many more allies."
>"I'm willing to risk it."
>Shifu picks up a scroll from his robe and hands it to you
>"This style is not one I'm familiar with, but it takes a lot from the other styles, using their grace and beauty as a template. I can teach you those parts, but there are some..."
>He lets out a cough
>" Advanced techniques that requires a female partner to train. Whether they want to help you is up to them."
>You excitedly unroll the scroll and see
>"Is this porn?"
>"The human creator of this technique knew how to use the natural charms of humans to stoke the lust of many females, and even some males, that he so set his eyes upon. He could convince anyone to fight for him with even more vigor than many would fight for themselves," Oogway smiles at you
>"I'll need to know how to eat people out? This seems a little more like prostitution."
>"That's why I was uncomfortable about the idea of teaching you," Shifu shakes his head
>"Ah, but with these skills you will always find yourself in the lap of luxury wherever you may go."
>"W-well, I did say I'd do anything. I want to learn."
>"Good. Heh, I'd bet with the proper training you might even be able to get Tigress to show some emotions."
>The tiger glares at him
>"I take my practice very seriously. I shall not stray from the path."
>"Oh, no you won't. I expect you and Viper to work harder than ever in fact. Hehehe."
>What did you get yourself into?
>The next day you are standing in the training room with Shifu
>He hands you two fans which you gratefully take
>"While your uniform is being made, we shall practice. Now, this style makes heavy use of fans, but they are less weapons and more a way to help your charm. You can also see through them with the right angle."
>He does some dance moves with the fan that would probably look seductive if they weren't being done by the small, old kung fu teacher
>You can't help but let out a chuckle
>"Yes, uh, it doesn't translate well to red pandas. Now you try it."
>You make an attempt, but from the cringe coming from him you can tell it doesn't look good
>"No, turn your hips and let the motion push your arms naturally. That's too robotic."
>Again
>"The main trick is that you want to keep their attention on your body while hiding your face. Then give them a glimpse of your eyes."
>"Could I get a mirror or something? It might help a little if I could see what I am doing."
>"Hmm, yeah, might be a good idea. This is a lot more visual than the others."
>You sorely regret getting the mirror
>Now you have a good view of all your failures
>Looking 'seductively' at yourself just feels wrong
>You are at least getting better at hiding your face with the fans, because you don't want to see the shame on your face
>Still not good at the peaking come hither look
>"Anonymous, the scroll may say that a shy look is a great weapon in your arsenal, but it emphasizes switching between the two whenever useful."
>"I know, I know! I'm trying!"
>"I think you need a break, you got better, but now you're getting a bit sloppy."
>"But master!"
>"Constant work can hinder progress. You need a break."
>You slump your shoulders in disappointment
>"Do not think that doesn't mean you won't be improving still. Martial arts is a way of life, so even when the training is over you can still improve. You've got homework."
>"Really?"
>"Yes. Keep the fans and try to keep others from seeing your face with them. Even in the presence of others this elegance must be maintained, or else the illusion may be broken.
>"But first we need to wash you up a bit, you can borrow one of the bath gowns after this, those tattered things would hinder you. They also don't look very comfortable."
>You feel grateful for the practice, but at the same time you want to curse him
>"Anon, do you really need to keep those fans up at the dinner table?" Crane asks, giving a strained smile
>"It's homework."
>"Wait, you have to do that all day?" Mantis asked, raising one of her minuscule eyebrows
>"Yes. Something about not breaking the illusion. I need to be seductive"
>"Well, I think you look good," Monkey says with a wink
>You hold the fan closer to you as your face starts to burn
>"Thanks, but I'm really not good at it. I mean I've just started and I've hardly practiced. I don't think I've made enough progress to warrant compliments."
>"Maybe not, but when you definitely have the looks of a master!"
>You unconsciously pull down the fan a bit in surprise, but quickly manage to pull it back up
>"I knew you had a nice face behind all that dirt," Viper kindly smiled
>Tigress' face lights up a small bit before returning to her usual stoic self
>You continue eating in silence for a bit before Tigress speaks
>"Are you planning on learning those other techniques?"
>"Other techniques?"
>"The ones that require a partner?"
>You stare at her in surprise
>It isn't long before Monkey breaks the silence
>"If you need a partner, I wouldn't mind...?" she says, scratching the back of her head
>"I... I already know a few things."
>"Really? Of course, I'm not surprised. With a face like yours of course you spent some time with some ladies."
>"Don't be so uncouth, Monkey."
>"Hey, I'm just offering to help. You get a lot of practice?"
>You get up
>"More than I wish I ever had."
>You leave the room as the rest fall silent

You think anthros post cute humans getting fucked by old, fat bitches to piss other anthros off?
>anon's sitting on a couch
>"whats your name?"
Ano-
>two big titty/booty, polar bears come in and ICE anon.

I imagine it would piss human women off even more. Imagine being 10/10 human Stacy in the prime of your youth with a perfect movie star face and figure and seeing all the human men going out with something like pic related. Imagine the seething at knowing that the cute guy you've been crushing on is getting fucked into the mattress by some 7ft tall forty/fifty something she-beast, who likes like her diet consists of sausage and beer.

Tigress Story
>The pain in your limbs made it hard to focus
>The jumping and ducking was hard enough, but having to keep shifu from getting a clear view of your face
>You tried to cheat once by just not facing him, but then he'd just jump at you and kick you
>Worse, he said that eventually you're going to need to do fancy maneuvers while going through the obstacle course
>You've seen the others do their dodge practice, and while theirs may be a sight to behold they were also fairly simple
>You, you had to learn every single acrobatic move from each school
>'Beauty is in each style. You must flow like each of them, with speed, power, fluidity, flexibility, and become near impossible for someone to guess. You should reach any position and move with any blow at any time.'
>When you asked why the others don't do this stuff, he just said it's to make up for your lack of combat skill
>You also aren't as capable of specializing as the others, so since you can't be perfect at one of them, you'll have to be good at all of them
>At least you have more time to learn how to move, since this style has almost no attacks
>"That is enough."
>You jump out of the course, breathing heavily
>"The one thing I always found remarkable about you humans is how you can work for so long and still keep the same mien about you."
>You'd chuckle at this if you weren't so tired
>He's talking about you keeping a mien, and yet here you are gulping down air like a man who almost drowned
>You'd love to collapse on the ground if it didn't break down your image any more than it already is
>He hands you some water, which you gladly drink
>"Now, your uniform is finally done. I'd like for you to change into it."
>Having finally caught your breath and cooled down, you manage to ask speak
>"Really?"
>"Yes. I think it came out well. It's a lot like the previous master's. From now on, you'll need to wear this whenever you practice."
>With a nod, you grab the clothes and head to the changing room
>Closing the door, you take the clothes and unfold them
>Only then do you realize his words
>You saw pictures of the last master, and the clothes were a little
>Showy
>M-maybe if you put them on it won't be as bad

>Oh, it is definitely bad
>There are openings along it that shows off plenty of your more masculine features
>But at the same time, if you move just right the flaps of cloth along it hides it
>Just barely
>There's even an opening along the crotch
>It's like it's made to have people look, hoping to catch a glimpse of something more
>And you need to be careful or else someone might actually get that glimpse
>You walk around the room a bit, looking in the mirror to make sure you aren't showing anything indecent
>When you are finally find a gait that's good enough, you leave
>Shifu sees you and and quickly turns around around
>"I'm glad you've managed to get the walk down."
>"Yeah. Do I really need to wear this?"
>"I'm afraid so. It is meant to be very distracting, and you'll need to learn how to dodge in that."
>"Wait, I need to dodge in this? But what if I trip on the flappy bits, or show-"
>"That is what training is for. I assure you, I'm not happy about this either."
>At that moment, the others walk in
>"So then I caught it with-woah."
>They all gawk at you
>Even Tigress' mouth is open a bit in surprise
>"Uh, hello." you wave to them
>They wave back
>"Is this going to be your new look?" Crane asks, her face hidden behind her wing
>"Yes. This is an important part of the style, so you must get used to it."
>"Anonymous, you don't feel embarrassed in... that, are you?"
>Before you can answer, Shifu speaks
>"Yes. It is important that Anonymous not embarrass himself in public, so you I am giving you all the task to tell him if he shows anything too revealing
>They all swap to their stoic faces and give a yes sir
>That face hiding training is going to come in handy soon you feel

>After that, she's constantly having sex with you, and she's never not filled with children
>She says it's because she needs to save her species
>You're pretty sure she just has an impregnation fetish

>Shark mommies
Pfft, they aren't all cute and cuddly anon, I'll tell you that off the bat. The dolphins are rapists to the core and the sea lions are always wanting you to do weird harem shit, but at least they can't be randomly triggered like you said an MK ultra codeword. This happened to me just the other month
>Finally finished work, head on out and down the block
>Live on the coast, lots of wind off the nearby bay in the evenings
>Cool dusk comes, with my hands in my pockets, my... empty pockets
>Forgot my rape whistle, pepper spray in my locker at work
>Fuck
>Hurriedly run back home through the empty streets, water sloshing as the tide rolls in
>Two blocks out when I trip on a fucking curb and skin my knee
>Hurriedly pull up my pants leg, praying quietly
>For a moment it's just the white of scraped skin
>Then blood pools to the surface
>Sprinting now, I can see my house at the midsection of the block
>"Are you okay, baby?" A voice giggles, not too far behind me
>I bodyslam my door and thank god I switched to a fingerprint lock as I get inside
>Standing in the hall, a moment passes before I see the handle jiggle just a moment
>"I just want to make sure you're okay! C'mon, open up! I-I'm a nurse shark..."
>Silence

Sharks go into a trance-like state if you can get them belly-up in the water. it's referred to as Tonic Immobility.
And at least sharks are more wholesome than dolphins.

Yeah, the dolphins around here are just fucking hedonists. "Fuck my blowhole" "This pussy is internally muscled, humie boy" just absolute raunch 24/7. I have to say the rare sea turtle chicks who come through are the chillest, they all only eat vegetarian and get real down on you if you have a burger or something though. i'm just especially afraid because I might be going back to work soon, and if she wasn't just making a lame joke and really is a nurse shark, end of June starts her breeding season. Nurse shark litters are fucking huge! I can't afford that.

Day 48 of invasion
>Be Anthony Wallace, medical student and overworked essential worker.
>You'd been run ragged over the last few weeks dealing with an influx of refugees and resultant minor injuries.
>Despite the valiant and unusual methods the Guard and the PDF were using, they were losing ground steadily to the Tyranids.
>The saving grace of the 'nids not sending hordes of their own number at them was good.
>The fact that the Xenos were using Imperial Guard tactics and equipment in some cases was alarming.
>For the town of Gambrok, there would be no escape, they'd been encircled days ago.
>For you however, you'd been dealing with far, far worse things than putting people's guts back inside them.
>An involuntary shudder raced down you frame, as you wondered if the Tyranids were even aware of what they were doing?
>By the Emperor, you'd had the misfortune of learning how an undying erection got treated.
>And then there were the other things the Tyranids did to people.
>First, there were the victims of the paralytic quills, and while those were easy to remove, the left noticeable side effects.
>Most notably impaired movement and a flushed face, and perhaps a bit of excessive drooling.
>Thankfully, you just made sure any of the incapacitated soldiers didn't stumble to their deaths before the toxins worked their way out.
>Second was the spore victims, anyone inhaling them felt very hot, very drunk, and very horny.
>Again, you mostly monitored them and kept them from trying to wander off.
>Otherwise they might attempt to molest the medical servitors.
>Several personnel had gotten covered in bio-resin, which oddly enough dissolved upon contact with human saliva.
>In developing a solution to this, the Magos convinced you that he was outright mad.
>And finally, you had removed 96 Ripplers from the crotches of Guardsmen, PDF, and idiot teenagers.
>Fortunately, you were able to remove the little buggers without them biting off any important bits.
>Unfortunately, earlier in the morning, the lines had fallen, and Tyranids were moving from street to street.
>Now everyone was scrambling for shelter and weapons, or seeking one last moment of peace.
>The Tyranids didn't kill humans, mostly, but if one was threatening or had killed his fellow man...
>It seemed the only thing the Tyranids wanted was to...fornicate with any guy they came across.
>You ducked under a fallen beam blocking the street, gazing at the corpse of a flying Tyranid.
>It was massive, having smashed though a building on its way down, and oozed out across the street.
>All around the town, battle sounded off again and again, as the Tyranids advanced.
>The streets were empty, mostly because everyone was hiding, or flying Tyranids had picked off everyone.
>It had been tempting to wait for the inevitable back at the clinic, but you figured you could hide down in one of the old sewer pipes.
>You've done so in the past, there were few, if any mutants to speak of, and you knew an out of the way place...
>These was shouting and gunfire up ahead, and the screeching chittering of Tyranids.
>You stopped short, before ducking down an alleyway to escape the fighting, pistol raised.
>Your legs ached from all the running, and he cursed his lack of foresight by waiting for the next transport.
>There had been fighting just down the street when the men guarding the place said that you'd best run.
>Bracing yourself, you exited the far end of the alleyway, and emerged into combat zone.
"Keeps firing!"
>The red strobe and cracks of las-fire contrasted with the firing of Tyranid weaponry.
>You had to flatten yourself against a wall as the foot of a Sentinel walker stomped down before you.
>Heat from the multi-las firing cause you to shrink back, but not before one of the soldiers noticed you.
"Get down civilian!"
"Shit, I knew we lost the outer line, how far in are they?"
"Lines are collapsing backwards, you have a gas mask right?"
>You nod, pulling it out.
"Good, put it on, we;re heading to the Arbites' Headquarters, don't need another person going down ."
>Right, apparently he doesn't know you lack major medical experience, but given how bad things are...
>The multi-las is probably the only thing keeping the Guants from pouring up the street as the squad begins to withdraw
>Then something slams down into the middle of the squad, before unfurling.
"Rippler Ball!"
>At those words, several of the small toothy critters wriggle forth faster than one would think.
>The Guardsmen do their best to shoot the small things, before they can attach themselves in a very vulnerable spot.
>You stomp on the closest one, feeling its body give and crack slightly under your boot.
>Several of the Guardsmen also are successful at shooting the little buggers, a few are not.
"AGH! HELP!"
"Not Again, no."
>Something large and fleshy lands further back in the street, pouring out an immense amount of spores.
>The pink fog wasn't lethal, but it did obscure vision and gradually incapacitate anyone who breathed it too long.
"Grenades out!"
>Explosions tor up the street, and everyone pulled back, save for one man who was trying to free his junk.
>The Sentinel sprayed las-fire into the smoke, walking backwards, paying little attention.
>Massive metal feet stomp all to close to you, as you begin retreating from the makeshift barricade.
"Auspex Contact! Large Xenos specimen approaching!"
>There is a lashing sound, like heavy flesh whips, and a half dozen tendrils are wrapped about the Sentinel's raised leg.
>It tries to aim at whatever is holding it, but more suddenly strike the multi-las with enough force to bend it.
"Move!"
>With a groan, the walker falls over, legs kicking as it is dragged back into a thickening wall of fog.
>Metal squeals and screeches as you and the rest of the Guardsmen run like hell.
"Emperor's mercy, they're tearing open the hatch!"
>The doomed machine and it's crew is left behind, as your small group begins firing back.
"The frak was that?"
>You weren't sure, but hopefully you never found out.
>It was a running gun battle in low visibility while wearing a gas mask, in a fair world, the 'nid would have it just as bad.
>Life wasn't fair however
>The Tyranids were never affected by their own toxins.
>They were without number, and hey adapted to everything.
>A small flock of Gargoyles swooped down on the squad, carrying several of them off.
>Then the large thing following you though the smoke grabbed another two, yanking them back.
>At this point, you just ran, stumbling through the streets heading deeper into the city
>You could hear the thumps of whatever was perusing you, but the fog was to thick to see through
>The city was getting bombarded with spore mines, and the sounds of battle were dying down.
>Suddenly, someone collided with you, sending you both sprawling to the ground.
>The las-pistol clatters away, and you do your best to untangle yourself from the man.
"We need to run."
"More Tyranids?"
"No, the priest, he's gone mad."
"I assure you my sons, that I am most certainly sane."
>Ordinarily, that tone of voice would have been a bit too insistent for your tastes.
>Not so today, as you beheld the priest the man was running from.
>The faithful servant of the Ecclesiarchy is wearing a smile, and holding a flamer.
>Never a good combination, under any circumstances.
"Father, please, think about what you're doing."
>It's hard to read his expression through a gas mask, but you have no doubt he's cracked.
"I am saving souls from eternal damnation at the hands of the foul Xenos child, I do what must be done.
>You've gotten half the sleep you need and have been worked to the bone helping inured.
>Despite all this, you figure you can try reasoning with the man.
"Listen to me, you should be helping your fellow man in their time of need, not burning them."
>He levels the flamer at you, the pilot light stuttering in the thick fog.
"Tis the only way I can save you, may the Emperor forgive me for what I must do, and may your suffering come to an end."
*fwip*
>The flamer jerks suddenly, as a pale, fleshy tentacle wraps about it.
*fwip* *Fwip*
>The priest is lifted off the ground, struggling against whatever is holding him.
"Now now, that's not a very nice thing to do."
"Unhand me foul beast!"
>His mask is ripped off by another tentacle, his face red and eyes wide with panic.
"Oh sure, hold your breath, you'll need to breathe eventually."
>The fog has cleared enough to reveal the particular Tyranid, nearly the size of a chimera,
>It was if the 'nids had decided they didn't have something with enough tentacles.
>She had a dozen arm tentacles, twice as many around her mouth, and the biggest pair of breasts you'd ever seen.
>There's the whine of a las-pistol, followed by the unoccupied arm full of tentacles lashing at the other man.
>A second later, he's as tied up as the priest, fully immobilized and exposed to the spores.
"Seems I will need to give you both an injection to keep you calm."
>Each of her tentacles has a sharp tip, which she jabs into them for a moment.
>After a few seconds, they go limp, and are laid down on the street carefully.
"well now, with that out of the way, I have a question for you cutie."
>WHAT?
"What?"
"Ready for your massage~"
>Oh no, you do not like where this is going.
>A moment later her tentacles are all over you, the whip-like appendages wrapping about your body and limbs.
>Your struggling could best be described as pointless, each of the tentacles is steely muscle in a thin package.
>That, and there are a dozen of them, rubbing and squeezing your body pretty much everywhere.
"My my," She croons "Whatever have you been doing? You have so many knots. So tense."
>Well, not everywhere, she seems to be avoiding your crotch for the moment.
>Still, her "massage" feels good, not that you have any experience with such a luxury.
"Most of the girls wouldn't hesitate to pounce on you without so much as getting your name, let alone consent."
>You'd reply, but you were a little preoccupied with all the squeezing along your legs and feet.
>Wait, What?
>Now that you're paying attention again, she's slipped off your boots and socks with her motions.
>Your clothing is also being slowly sliced up by the little blades at the ends of her appendages.
>That, and feels like the filter's clogged on your gas mask...she's producing a cloud of those damned spores.
"Now, I think you silly little mask isn't working, if your thrashing is anything to go by...let's see that cute face."
>Before you can protest, the mask has been neatly sliced off your face, which comes under immediate assault by caressing tentacles.
"You are sooo cute~. What's your name?"
"Wallace,"
>Already a few breaths in and the spores are doing their work, you feel drunk, you feel good, you feel hot.
>There really wasn't much you could do anyhow, and the Tyranid was polite enough to not obliterate your pelvis on sight.
"Aww...that's adorable. All you need to know about me, is that I am yours. All you have to do~oo....is ask."
>Its obvious what she is referring to, she's stripped you down to your boxers
>She could physically force herself on you like the rest of the 'nids, but she doesn't have to.
>It would be as easy as injecting Tyranid brand aphrodisiac into your bloodstream and you'd be all over her.
>Your dick is so hard it hurts, everything feels hot, and she is nice....smells nice...
"Please"
"Don't try holding back, just relax. Resisting won't help you, you're already mi~ne."
>Her mouth tentacles descend on your junk, causing you to lurch.
>Every nerve in your body is played like the strings of an instrument, and she has mastered it.
>You're limp as a wet noodle, and a nap is fully in order, not like you can do anything else.
"SOMEONE HELP!"
>The frak?
>You shift and spot a Guardsman doubled over almost, hands trembling around his crotch.
"IT WON'T STOP SUCKING, IT HURTS!"
"Nurse," you slur, "I need some supplies."
"Oh don't worry, I'll handle this."
>Be Commissar Wolfe
>Be at a command meting in Hive Sydney.
>Be witness to many acts insane and heretical, and somehow actually working.
>Be nursing a cup of recaff ans General Powerstache goes over defense plans.
>Suddenly, the General lurches forward, his mustache bristling.
"What's happening."
>General Powerstache stares out into the distance for a moment while his facial hair makes alarming twitches.
"The penultimate battle approaches, may the Emperor protect us all."

>Be unlucky in love
>You're pretty sure you're cursed
>When you were in high school you went to a buddhist alter on a trip to Japan and prayed that you could get a girl
>You went out with a girl and had sex at her house on the first day
>At first you thought you were lucky
>But you soon woke up naked in a dumpster, and outside you found a laughing fox
>No, not a fox, a kitsune
>"I can't believe you actually fell for the 'sex on the first date' trick!"
>It had been an illusion
>After you realized you had been tricked you were about to chase her, but running around town naked wouldn't be a pretty picture
>After that, shit like that kept happening
>Another girl asks you out and it lasts longer, but you wake up to find that damn fox again
>Then again
>The next girl who asked you out, you ended up yelling at telling the kitsune to leave you alone
>She left in tears, and you heard cackling from behind you
>"Can't believe you let her go! You really are something, aren't you?"
>By college you decided to ask a girl out for once, because you are pretty paranoid that anyone who asks you is that kitsune
>She said yes
>The data was a disaster though
>The restaraunt was slow, something kept kicking her from under the table that you swore wasn't you, and you spilled her drink on her when you went to the bathroom even though your arm wasn't that close to the glass
>She decided against a second date
>And again this happened
>You started getting a reputation for being an awful date, and because you kept turning girls down people started wondering if you were purposefully sabotaging them
>Eventually you just started accepting the dates, and that girl is eventually replaced by a fox every time
>She tells you that no human could ever be with a fox fucker like you, and at this rate you'll either die alone or end up marrying her
>You've given up expecting someone else
>You've accepted love for you will always be a cruel prank made by that thing
>You were sent to be his wife, but you couldn't help yourself
>The first time was supposed to be a joke, a one time thing
>But that face he made when he was disappointed, you loved it
>Whenever you ran off you had to touch herself, you couldn't help but be turned on
>You just wished she could have him make that face and have him afterwards
>The date was wonderful, you loved every moment, but nothing could have topped that face
>A pure hopeful love crushed
>You could have told him that she was sent to be his wife, but she had to see it more and more
>And every time he made it the better it got
>He tried to get other girlfriends, but you fixed that, and it got even better
>Now he's running into your arms even when he should know it's you
>He thinks those kisses are just jokes but he always accepts them because he thinks they are fake
>You've tried to tell him the truth but he calls you a liar when you do
>And he makes that wonderful face
>It's easier and so fulfilling to make him think it's false
>You know it's true, every kiss, every hug, every bite along the nape of his neck, every whisper of affection
>He needs you, he clings to you like a rock in a river that would sweep him away
>His kisses are so sweet, letting out hiccups as you touch him
>You ask if he's okay but he doesn't answer, only holds on tighter
>You lick away his tears and let your hands search him like it's your first time
>But you've felt every crevice, every bump, every piece, and you know it's all yours
>He's so perfectly fragile
>His desires are so pure despite everything
>He gives and gives and you only take it away
>The truth you give to him is not something he can accept
>If he really knew the truth, what would he say?
>What would he do?
>Why are you scared?
>You can always follow him
>He would view your actions more kindly knowing you are a girl in love
>Yet you feel like he'd be angry
>It couldn't hurt him more than you already have
>So why
>Why, why, why do you keep doing it?
>It feels like it would stain him
>Helplessness turned to anger
>He loves you
>But he'd hate you
>But he already hates you
>But he doesn't show it
>But he hopes that you love him
>But he shouldn't love you
>If you loved him he'd hate you
>You're a monster
>A curse placed upon him
>To think he could love you is arrogance of the highest order
>You don't deserve it, and he shouldn't give it to you
>He clings to you in fear if what you've brought on him
>A fear of being alone
>But it's better he shake in fear than shake in fury
>That would ruin the purity
>Anger is ugly, terrible, not worthy of tainting his face
>So please/\esrow si tahW
>Stay pure and sweet/\lufituaeb si hcihw taht tniat oT

Human males are horrible for unit cohesion. We shouldn't be letting them mix with Anthro units at all, because it always results in is girls fighting over humies. Plus they're weaker, can't carry as much gear, resulting in other members of the unit having to pick up the slack, and they have to use dinky little intermediate caliber weapons that are a logistical nightmare because now you're throwing 2 to 3 completely new calibers in to the supply chain. The only role humans have is in human only units or as comfort boys.

>draft requirements are adjusted to allow for less physically capable humans
>assigned as comfort boys to anthro squads
>morale goes up, squad performance improves as they all have a tangible and immediate goal to fight for
>strict penalties and possibly dishonorable discharge for anyone that abuses or breaks the boys
it could work out

But then they become prime elimination targets for the enemy to reduce morale.

So a concept:
Anthros can only make babies with their own kind: canines with canines, felids with felids, etc. The more specialized/niche/rare the anthro breed, the harder it is for them to find a mate, and thus the harder it is to make babies and have a family and continue the species.
There is an exception to this though: humans. For whatever reason, and against all scientific laws of nature, humans can impregnate/be impregnated by any anthro species. In the case of male humans, they can impregnate any female anthro and the babies will be of the same species as the mother. Female humans can be impregnated by any anthro, and the babies will be of the same species as the father. Humans only breed true with themselves.
There'd be a lot of intrest in humans from the rare species that need to keep their numbers up in the face of overwhelming felid and canine numbers. Humans would also be encouraged to have many children of their own, in the hopes those children would eventually bear/sire some anthro offspring. Polyamourous families might be not uncommon, with multiple parents raising anthro and human siblings side by side.
Of course, there'd be haters and racists. People who say an anthro can't be "pure" if they have a human parent. Rumors and stereotypes. Could be an interesting place.

Ferret NEET Story
>Month 1
>You only missed a day of work, your two days off coming right after the one you skipped
>Because of her
>She had started calling out to you, talking through the vent
>"Hey, I have some extra buttery popcorn and put on a movie, want to stop by?"
>"I made too much Oyakodon for dinner! You can come over if you like!"
>She even started singing to you anytime she hears you shower
>"Hey, you alright man?"
>You blink and look to your coworker, a 30-something jerboa with a big set of buck-teeth
>"Yeah, sorry Gordo." You yawn and stretch. "I'm thinking I need to switch to night shift."
>He snickers. "Oh yeah? Why's that."
>"I have this neighbor, things started great, she was quiet-" You're elided by a laugh from Gordon
>"She! Oh man, lemme guess... A lemur chick! No, no." He rubs his chin, grinning. "Maybe a goat?"
>"It's not funny man, your fairer sex is absolutely demented!" With a sigh, you continue. "She's a ferret. And things were great! But then she got kind of creepy, and, uh..."
>Gordon's face fell as you continued talking
>"Gordo. What's up? You're freaking me out here."
>He won't look at you anymore
>"Uh." He finally starts. "That's no good. If she's taken a shine to you, I mean."
>It feels like there is no blood in your body
>You hear a bell ringing somewhere
>"Gordon. Spit it out." The words come out almost garbled, saliva solidifying to wallpaper paste
>"Ferrets are induced ovulators. You put her in heat." His eyes meet yours, damp, sparkling
>"If ferret women don't mate they'll die dude. Heat kills them."
>The two of you just stand there, silent but for the sound of the clock on the wall
>Month 2
>"...so we'll see what the manager says as this month ends." Gordon speaks pensively around a mouthful of cornichon
>"But they'll hold the job for me?" You sit back in your chair. "That's a relief."
>"Business is so slow I'm sure they'll be glad someone volunteered." He winks. "I'll talk to HR, make sure you get gubment dollars. Speaking of-"
>"Her? Nothing happened yet." You sigh. "I should at least talk to her."
>"You should at least learn her name." Gordon snorts, waving for the bill.
>"I know her name!" You say sharply. You can't tell who it surprised more, you coworker or yourself. "It's Dahlia. I-I heard it through the vents."
>He looks you over, concerned. "You're spying on your horny neighbor through a vent? I got this, company card."
>"Thanks. And it's not like that. She spells it out loud every time she names her player character."
>"And I suppose she yells it? No way you're actually getting up there to listen through the vent, hmmm?" Gordon chuckles, then his whiskers droop. "C'mon, let's get back home, it's getting dark."
>The low rumble of Gordon's truck disappearing into the distance, you climb the stairs to your apartment
>'Well,' you think to yourself, 'Time to finish my part in all this.'
>'Maybe I can let her down easy. There's medical treatments and other ways to end a heat.' Your brown furrows. 'I can barely afford a shitty apartment! I can't deal with kids.'
>'On top of that, now I'm unemployed, a-" Your thoughts scatter as you round the corner and come face to face with Dahlia
>Like a coiled spring she leaps, your center of balance vanishing as she wraps you in a vice grip
>A glimpse of gleaming eyes meets yours before she buries her face in your neck, moaning and taking deep whiffs of your scent
>She's impossibly strong for someone so scrawny, your heartbeat frenzied as a shaky paw struggles to undo your pants
>"Oh god, help!" Her other paw snakes up your back, grabbing your neck before she silences you with a kiss
>
>Thoughts cease to flow as her tongue explores the insides of your mouth, greedily intertwining with yours and pulling back again in a teasing dance
>The paw now in your pants deftly tears at the seams of your underwear, shredding her way through to the prize underneath
>Dahlia's breath catches in her throat as her velveteen fingers wrap their way around your cock, sliding to the base and massaging your balls with two fingers
>Her entire body trembles against you, eyes that once gleamed with predatory focus now look glassy and dazed as she brings her other hand down to play with you more
>'I won't get another chance.' The thought comes, echoes in your head
>In a surge of panic you push her off of you, Dahlia landing heavily on her side
>Your tattered underwear still in her grip, you watch as the ferret girls eyes clear and widen, before filling with tears
>Springing to her feet she takes off down the hallway, scrambling to her apartment with muffled sobs before disappearing behind the slam of a door
>"Shit!" Staggering to your feet, you hurriedly adjust your pants and run to her door, pounding on it. "Dahlia! We need to talk!"
>You can't hear a thing
>Fingerprint lock, lights on, grabbing the stepladder
>"Dahlia," you call into the vent hoarsely, "Dahlia please, I'm sorry if I hurt you. Can we talk?" No response. "Dahlia!"
>Pressing your ear to the vent, you wait for a reply
>Instead, you're greeted by whispered moans and ragged, drawn breaths, and finally
>"Say my name. Again." You gulp, the soft sound of paw pads rubbing her wet mons coming into focus
>As you hesitate, the crystallization of so many moments in life float through your mind; the rubicon, stretched before you
>Fated desire flares through your body
>Cast the die and damn the consequences
>"Dahlia." The name flows from your lips like cool water, a weight being lifted
>Again and again you call to her, Dahlia softly crying out in the throes of orgasm and together lapsing into mutual silence
Month 3
>You don't even flinch as the mail slot clatters open and letters fall to the floor, your forehead pressed to the wallpaper
>It's been over a week since you last heard from her
>Three weeks total now since the incident in the hallway
>You take a deep breath before the grate, then speak in a clear but gentle voice
>"Dahlia, I know you're in there." Your phone buzzes on the table. "Please answer me."
>The prior weeks she could at least be heard moving about furitively, pleasuring herself at all times of the day
>Sometimes strange thumping sounds next door, or soft squeaking from the vent would propel you there, pleading with Dahlia to just speak with you for a moment
>But there remained no answer, no questions, no offers for you to come over
>The roar of your shower feels deafening now without her chirping songs
>You climb down from the stepladder, now a permanent fixture in your home, and check your phone alerts
>Unemployment confirmation and subscription cancellation emails, missed calls from 800 numbers and telemarketers, and a text message from Gordo
>(still coming down to the bar? got ur usual already n its getting warm)
>Fuck, you'd forgotten completely
>How many hours had passed, staring into the void behind those metal bars?
>(omw)
>Placing an ear to the wall of the hallway, you still hear nothing on the other side
>With a pit in your stomach, you make your way out into the daylight
>
>"So that was that. Since then she's definitely been doing something though. I hear this kind of soft thudding sometimes? Maybe she's building something."
>The Jerboa sat with you at the bar, swirling the dregs of beer around his glass as you recounted the assault and sucking his teeth as you postulated on her potential schemes
>"And in the past few weeks, all kinds of packages are showing up to her house. More than usual, I mean."
>"Mmm, yes, of course! No one orders things through the mail except the criminally insane!" He levels you with a flat gaze. "I don't think the prison system is ready for her."
>"Never mind." You groan. "Just tell me what to do."
>"What?! What the fuck are you talking about?" Gordon pulls his ears down over his head, incredulous. "You make a fucking choice!"
>He swivels in his chair to face you, incensed
>"One, you can call 911, get her hospitalized and forcibly administered medicine to artificially end her heat." He's almost snarling now. "
>"Two, you can nut up and help her yourself."
>"Three, you can keep lounging around waiting for her to die." He rolls his eyes. "Hmm, a torture, a death, or accepting someone who loves you, tough call."
>"Dahlia won't die, doctors say masturbating delays mortality effectively in most cases." You receive a disgusted noise in reply. "What now?"
>"So, you're still spying on her? This girl is suffering and in danger and for months on end you won't do anything but peep on her." Gordon quickly tosses some cash on the counter
>"You're playing some kind of sick fucking game and acting like the victim the whole time, and I'm tired of it. One, two, or three." He leaves as the bartender scoops up the payment. "Walk home."
~
>You trudge up the stairs unevenly, having stayed for another two or three drinks after being scolded by your supposed best friend
>'Three options. I'm gonna figure out my own option.' You think, making your way into your apartment. 'I'll sleep on it and then call Gordon and fix all this dumb shit.'
>You hang up your jacket and take a deep breath
>Your apartment feels... stuffy
>'This building is a sty, it's always like this.' You tell yourself, inhaling deeply
>But that's not it this time
>Everything smells musty and sweet, like overripe apricots
>'No. What is that?' You walk around, sniffing the air for a moment, then freeze
>Your eyes glide to the vent, and for what feels like a small eternity you just stare at it
>Boarding the stepladder, you climb up and peer in between the slats to see the same pitch blackness as always greeting your eyes
>You also note a little tiny bit of fuzz at the bottom of one of the openings
>Pinching at it with your fingers, you pull it up to your face and inspect the papery black fibers
>"The fuck?" Jumping down, you run to the kitchen and grab a butter knife
>One softly squeaking screw at a time, you remove and place each one securely in your pocket before finally prying off the grate
>You're met with a black sheet of cardstock
>
>Baffled, you pull at its edges only for it to easily pop free as an avalanche of cloth falls to the ground in an array of colors
>Astonished, you reach into the vent and pull out a fistful of panties
>That pungent and sweet aroma suddenly becomes completely overpowering
>Your head swims as you dismount your perch, falling to your hands and knees
>The air feels even thicker at the ground level, pressure rising in your temples
>Your erection throbs to the beat of your heart, straining against your pants as your olfactory senses are completely overwhelmed
>'No. No. No.' You panic and lift up the couch cushions, trying to stuff as many pairs of underwear underneath it as possible
>"Shit!" Your expletive comes out slurred as you crawl around, your brain struggling to maintain your balance, much less concoct any kind of plan
>Unbidden, your arms falter and you go face down in a pile of the well-worn fabrics, a shuddering groan escaping your lips
>Cock oozing pre-cum like a leaky faucet, your last few vestiges of strength go towards feebly humping the floor
>Your drunken brain is swimming with endorphins, delirious
>You don't even feel sure that you're even breathing oxygen now
>'I'll sleep on it.' You decide to yourself, gathering the remaining panties under your head as a pillow. 'I'll sleep on all of this stuff.'
>As you slumber, a series of screws is removed from the other side of the vent, one last time
>Awakened by the low buzz of your cell phone ringing on vibrate, you allow yourself a satisfied sigh
>Cinching your eyes further shut, you nestle your back deeper into your mattress
>'Must have moved into bed last night.' You think with a smile, the sun already coming brightly through your white curtains
>You'll see who was calling later you decide, realizing with glee you didn't even get a hangover from the... four drinks you had?
>You stretch your legs, feeling them tingle as you try to recall the other evening
>A breeze rolls across your body, making you shiver
>An attempt to reach down and pull up the covers is foiled, your arm, both arms, stuck
>In a moment of cold fear, you take a deep breath
>Your eyes open
>It's her
>Dahlia stands at the edge of your bed, nude but for a garter belt fashioned of tattered cotton
>It's underwear that she tore from your body weeks before, you realize as your eyes focus
>Her body is lithe and athletic, you can easily see now how she was able to wrap you up with a single arm
>Her breasts are surprisingly pert, too often hidden under baggy t-shirts and hoodies they now rise and fall evenly with her breathing
>Turning to look, you see both of your arms expertly bound to the posts of your bed, nearly painless yet totally unyielding
>Two free slipknot loops hang from the fiber "handcuffs" restraining your wrists
>Wordlessly, she steps to the foot of your bed
>"Dahlia." It feels like you're underwater as she climbs onto the bed. "Whatever you're planning, it doesn't have to be like this."
>You gasp as she grabs your ankle and cranks your leg upwards, perpendicular to your body, bending your knee with the back of a paw
>She slides your foot through the loop by your wrist before tightening it, and doing the same to the other side
>Now she sits, knees-folded beneath her at the base of the bed
>You are locked in a full-nelson position, absolutely nothing hidden from her eyes as they wander across your body
>She smiles. "My gods, you're even more beautiful than I could have imagined."
>Leaning over the edge of the bed, she reaches down for a moment, then comes back up with medical tape and an egg vibrator
>Placing them to the side, she cradles your sensitive gonads with a little chirp of delight
>Dahlia leans over and places a delicate kiss on your nuts, her whiskers tickling your already throbbing member
>"Ahhhhh." Opening her mouth, the ferret girl lets a little trail of drool fall from her tongue to the base of your shaft before licking along its length like a popsicle
>Nudging her nose against your taint, she breaths hard before sucking one of your balls into her mouth, then releasing it with a lewd -Pop-
>She ends her ministrations with a single kiss to the swollen head of your cock. "Are you going to give me what I want?"
>Holding the egg vibrator in place, she deftly sticks the end of the medical tape onto it before wrapping the rest of the length around your sack
>You gasp as she sets it to low, the vibrations running through your penis, little beads of pre-cum starting to form as you whimper
>The bedsprings creak as she crawls about the mattress, turning tail and spreading her cheeks to show off as she cranes her head back to watch you
>"You like that?" Her pink pussy is drooling by this point, and she rocks her body back to rub her slit against the underside of your shaft. "You like to watch, don't you. I know. I can feel your excitement."
>Standing up, she breaks into a squat and begins to sink the very tip of your cock in, watching you over her shoulder while rocking her hips
>"Now," Dahlia's fluffy tail trails a figure eight on your chest, "I have you."
>In a single swift motion she slams her taut derriere down, enveloping your cock with a scream of animal pleasure
>She tries to lift herself into a squat, but her legs turn to jelly as her taut ass drops back down onto your folded body
>Thighs pressed aside by her ample cheeks, her moans become more insistent as she grinds her clitoris against your buzzing balls
>"F-fuck, oh yes." Dahlia's strength returns, her bucking motions fed by her desire to milk your body dry. "Isn't this better? Isn't this how it should be?"
>Her striped tail lands right across your chest and face, sopping up sticky love juices that trail their way down your folded-over abdomen
>"C'mon." Dahlia huffs, a paw drawing to her belly and rubbing her womb. "Please, make me a mommy, give me that thick cum you made for me."
>You can feel her climax approaching, the her wet walls constricting in ever quicker rhythms, her fertile body seeking to milk you for all you've got
>"W-wait." Your breathing halts with every smack of her hips as she rides you ferociously
>"I w-want yo-ou to -Ah!- look at me."
>Dahlia freezes, hilted on your mere-moments-from-climax-cock
>She falls to her hands and knees on the bed and dismounts your cock with a frustrated huff, then turns to kneel before you
>You lock eyes with Dahlia, the gleam you saw before now inspiring you to fight, not against, but for her
>"I want to watch you bear my child." You say, rocking your body to settle in better against the mattress and swinging your cock back and forth. "Please. Mount me."
>Her pupils appear to physically pulse and dilate, locked onto yours
>Unblinking, she stands on the bed and steps forward, her feet coming to place on either side of your torso
>You can't look away, her expressionless face making you question your decision to speak out at all
>Crouching down, Dahlia pushes your cock against your belly as she comes to sit on your hips
>Letting go, it springs up and strikes her pussy lips with a soft smack, a gleeful shiver passing through Dahlia's body
>"Is this true?" Gently, she begins sliding up and down, grinding herself along your length. "Or are you just trying to hurt me again."
>"Yes!" You gasp, as Dahlia turns the egg vibrator up to medium, then back down again. It almost comes out as a sob. "I do, I'm obsessed!"
>She cranks the vibe even higher, the ferret girl griping your calves so hard her claws dig in as she goes back to teasing your tip. "I don't believe you. What changed?"
>Your brain and body ache for release, for the absolution that only Dahlia can give you now
>"I missed you!" She flutters the throttle on the vibe, your voice cracking. "I missed you singing to me in the shower, your invitations.
>"Those nights, I'd listen at the vent, hear you cumming. It made me crazy." Your heart thuds like you're running a marathon. "I wanted to be there, with you."
>"I can't leave, I'd never forgive myself." You swallow hard around the lump in your throat. "I'd never be able to live with myself if I abandoned you. I was confused for so long."
>"I give in. I want to be wanted." Frozen in place, you'd swear Dahlia isn't even breathing. "I want your love. I want Dahlia."
>A paw slaps down onto your chest, Dahlia centering her weight directly over your dick before bringing her face to meet yours.
>"That's all you ever had to say." Her eyes swim with tears and yet she smiles like the sun
>Dahlia's legs muscles ripple as she squats with agonizing slowness, taking you bit by bit until your hips firmly meet
>-Slap- -Slap- -Slap-
>Again, and again and again, her motions becoming more fluid as she begins making pleasured chirps with every pump
>She grabs a fistful of your hair and leans in to kiss you, your body restless for the taste of her lips (like a drug) as you strain forward to meet her halfway
>Her mouth tastes like nectar to your foggy mind, drinking her in like wine as a hummed moan sticks in your throat
>Dahlia sucks on the end of your tongue before breaking the kiss, a string of drool connecting you then falling away
>Grinding forward and back, she lets out a tinkling laugh of delight as the mini vibe bumps and buzzes against her cute little rear
>"Hn! I'm guh-! I'm gonna cum!" Her voice has gotten breathy and high, and she suddenly grabs your bound hands in hers
>Feeling your body tense, you thrust back as much as you can and hear Dahlia's breathing go ragged as she climaxes, a low moan coming unbidden as you finally approach release
>The first thick bout of seed jolts her back into orgasm, she almost crushes your hands as she squeezes to the beat of each shot of your cum
>It almost feels unending, white jism already pooling back out of her, running down your thighs and ass
>"Mmm." Dahlia rolls her hips in a small circle before allowing your softening cock to plop free, lazily scooping your cum back into her needy snatch. "You have five minutes, then we go again."
>"Okay, just one request?" You nod at the egg vibrator. "TURN IT OFF GODS PLEASE TURN IT OFF."
>"Ah!" You kick feebly against your captor as she laps at your pecker again
>"You set the five minute breaks, at least abide by them!" You take a moment to stretch your legs, glad they were untied by attempt 3. "I'm still sensitive."
>"Tch. We've only gone four times so far, and the second and third times you were ready again in well under that." She smiles darkly. "I can always get the prostate stimulators."
>She giggles seeing your visible horror. "I'm kidding. Mostly."
>"Maybe a break is in order." She sighs
>Getting up from the bed she inspects the matted fur around her thighs and pelvis
>"Bathroom is-" "Off to the right, I know." Dahlia interrupts, the soft pad of her feet on the floor fading. "It's a mirror layout to my room."
>Scooching your way up the bed, you rotate your arms and try to soothe your shoulders before calling out. "Hey, can we lose these hand restraints next? My wrists are k-"
>-Thud thud thud-
>"Yo, it's Gordon!"
>
>-Thud thud thud-
>"Look, I felt bad, and uh, thought maybe you'd handle this whole thing better with some support? Look, I heard you in there dude."
>You look to the hallway and see Dahlia, eyes wide, body tense
>"Yeah, I'm here." You swallow hard, your eyes never straying from her. "But you're a little late. Option 2."
>"Oh. Ohhhhhhhhhhh! Hey, wuh, well great!" You hear shuffling from the other side of the door. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything, and I'll see you at work!"
>You close your eyes and sigh deeply as you hear Gordon leave, chuckling to himself as he departs
>You look back to Dahlia, just now seeing the pair of gleaming scissors clutched in her hand
>"Uh." Your mouth dries as she steps up to the bed, still clutching the implement like an ice pick. "Dahlia. My hands."
>"Who was that." She asks, flatly.
>"Gordon," you croak, "we work together, he was just checking in on me."
>"You won't need him to do that anymore." Dahlia deftly threads her fingers through the scissor loops parts the blades. "Be truthful. What terrible things did you tell him about me."
>"Nothing!" Dahlia trails her pawpads down your stomach to the base of your shaft, encouraging it to swell. "I-I kept trying to tell him you were obsessed with me and he never believed it!"
>"And why not?" Kneeling on your thighs, she leans in close, her face filling your vision. "What made you unworthy of your friend's trust?"
>"My obsession!" You roar the words, icy fear spurring you onward. "I burn for you! Spying and filling my time with your life felt so good, oh gods. It's all I need."
>"Well then," crawling up your torso, you see the flash of the scissors before your face
>-snkt- -snkt-
>You rub your wrists as Dahlia parts her legs wide and prepares to mount you again
>"Come serve your purpose."

Epilogue

Do it.
I will!

don't bother

He know's whats up
>she chuckles, then walks out in to the street, quickly jogging again as if nothing had happened at all
Hey!
>Your gf yells after her, attempting to stop her but unwilling to leave her side

i'm so sorry...
>then she starts bawling again

> your girlfriend wants to do the talking, but there are a couple of guys in here, lounging around so you put your hand on your arm to stop her.
> you approach the desk sargeant
Good Evening. How may I help you?
I... can I talk to someone somewhere more private?
> The desk sargeant gives you a weird look.
Uh. Yeah, sure. It would help if I knew what this was about though.
I'd rather not tell in public.
>his eyes flicker between you and your gf, who stands behind you with her arms crossed. She's mildly annoyed that you wouldn't let her do this for you.
You're going to have to give me something so I can get you the right colleague to talk to.
>you swallow
I was... assaulted.
>he raises an eyebrow.
and you can't talk to me about this here because...
>you want to go home so badly. Nothing feels more emasculating than telling someone that you got raped.
>you turn to your gf, who gibes you a 'go on' look.
I can't. Please?
>He frowns, than slides his chair backwards in to the corridor on the other side of the protective glass.
I'll be right back.
>you turn to your gf, who closes the distance.
You should have told him about the -
>You stop her mid sentence. Not in a room full of guys, that would be absolutely humiliating.
I'll talk to them. Okay?
>she seems to disapprove and quietly whispers to you
All of these people here, they probably are here because, like, their bike got stolen or they lost their pet or dumb shit like that but you're here because you were fucking raped and -
>the door leading in to the station opens and blond woman looks through the door, accompanied by the desk sargeant who waves you over.
>You cut your gf off, having internally cringed as she said the r-word.
Hi. I'm detective Christensen. You had something you want to talk about?
>you nod and walk through the door she holds open.
You good?
>She smiles and responds to the desk sargeant.
Thanks, Harry. We'll be at my desk. And who might you be?
>Your gf stops, seemingly pissy that this isn't immediatly obvious.
I'm his Girlfriend.
Alright.
>Instant animosity. Great.
>the two of you follow her through the small station in to a room with just one desk in it.
You're lucky i'm working late today. Anyway. Coffee, tea?
>your gf softly prods you and quietly repeats the question.
tea?
>you nod. Tea seems nice. Internally, you're quite happy that you're not talking to a dude.
Both of you?
> your gf nods as well.
Alright, i'll get the water boiling. Both of you can sit down in front of my desk and we'll start in a minute.
>Detective Christensen starts boiling water, fixes herself another cup of coffee and sets out mugs with teabags in them, then sits down in her chair, produces a notepad and a pen and clicks it.
why don't we start with who you are.
>you answer her questions as she methodically asks for your info.
>she also takes down your gf's info
Why don't you tell me what you were doing before the assault.
it wasn't assault, it was rape.
>your gf immediatly jumps the gun
>Detective christensen comes a lot more lively almost immediately.
You were raped?
No, he was.
>that gets you a raised eye brow, as you try to disappear in to the chair you're on.
You were raped? What did he look like?
>You just let your gf do the talking at this point and focus on the pens in a cup on Christensen's desk.
It was a woman. A black panther chimera.
>Christensen's eyebrow is raised significantly, as she looks at you.
>you mumble a confirmation, as christensen starts writing while your gf tells the whole story.
>slowly but steadily, christensens enthusiasm wanes until all that is left is a frown.
So you two were fighting her off, but she still managed to do what she wanted?
Yes!
>your gf seemingly has become quite irritated and impatient.
>Christensen looks at you, while you cling on to the mug of tea that she got you earlier.
Jenna, right? Would you mind leaving me alone with anon for a second?
Wha-
Just a minute or two. You can sit outside.
>your girlfriend snaps her mouth shut. She seems severily irritated now and leaves in a huff.
>christensen shuts the door behind her and then turns to you.
Can you recount the entire thing for me, with your own words, please?
>you do, and you notice that the detective is making no notes whatsoever, instead piercing you with her gaze.
>the ask a few clarifying questions, but not many, culminating in the final one
Did you cum?
>you mumble something.
I ask again. Did you have an orgasm?
well... yes
>something seems to close in the detectives eyes.
>She exhales, then inhales loudly.
Alright, here is what I think happened: You know that girl. This was supposed to be some fetish thing after you dropped your girl outside off. Maybe this is the new way to end relationships among you kids. Whatever.
I don't care. I don't believe this was rape for one second. Know how I do? I have rape cases in here every month. The guy just overpowered the girl and yhe slumps there just like you do, telling me the story of how she got taken. Overpowered. You know how many stories to the contrary i hear, a girl overpowering a guy? very fucking few.
Know how many stories I hear of a guy and a girl getting overpowered by a single woman? zilch. Never happens. Wanna know why? Because it's impossible.
Which means you're full of shit. I'm one hundred percent certain that you could have fought your way out if you'd wanted to.
So i'm not going to do anything.
What I am going to do is I am going to set your girl straight.
>She punched the intercom.
Harry, one of my two is done, can you escort him out?
>the intercom responded
Lenny will be with you in a sec.
Thanks.
>she turned to you again.
Send your girl back in on your way out.
>Wondering how this could have gotten any worse, you leave the room and an officer waits for you.
>You motion Jenna back inside with your eyes as the officer escorts you through the station and back out, to the desk sargeant.
>It doesn't take much longer for your furious girlfriend to storm out of the station.
>She grabs you and pulls you out of the building, responding to a
good evening!
>by a guy next to the door with
Fuck you too!
>She's absolutely brimming with rage.
They don't fucking believe us. Can you imagine that? I told her all about this and she doesn't fucking believe its real. She tried to tell me that you were cheating on me. What the fuck is wrong with these people?
>A ball of fiery rage dripping tears of pure anger drags you along to her place, so easily visible that even the half naked retards usually hollering at girls try and disappear in to the streets.
>it lasts until you arrive at her place. There, she collapses and weeps like a waterfountain, clinging on to you, sobbing how sorry she was over and over again.
>you feel dirty
>there is crusty stuff all over your dick.
>You have this overwhelming need to go clean yourself
Jenna,
>as you say her name, she immediatly looks up at you
I need a shower
>she comes around a little, smiling through her tears
o-of course.
>She pushes you in to the direction of the shower, still weeping.
>You stumble your way in and slowly take your clothes off, then get hot watwr going and start slowly washing your body, then more aggressively scrubbing yourself down until jenna interrupts you.
How are you doing?
>The shower has gone cold and you've frozen with your dick in hand, red as a lobster, using one of her scrubbers on it.
>You can see her behind the shower curtain, peeking in through the slightly ajar bathroom door.
>You are struck by the sudden fear that she might see this as odd
Jenna, do you believe me?
>She walks in to the bathroom, then pulls the shower curtain aside.
>Your eyes meet and she searches yours
I do. I was there, honey.
>Her tears are flowing again.
>She shuts off the water, then stands on her toes to hug you.
>After a long time, she lets go, pushing back against your embrace of her and takes the scrubber and shampoo out of your hands, then leads you out and wraps you in a towel.
>You're feeling better, now that you're squeaky clean.
>gradually, you take Jenna in to your arms and you hold each other again for a while, during which you finally crack and tear up, not even entirely sure what about.
>after a while, you both just go to bed.
>You curl up and for the first time ever, you can feel Jenna holding you.
>Next day, you spend a few hours sulking until you realize that it won't help. Jenna asks you to see a psychiatrist, but you're not feeling like discussing the matter further, instead opting to bury it deeper.
>After breakfast, you decide to go home. >Jenna had an appointment with friends of hers and you don't see the point of being in an appartment that isn't filled with your stuff.
>On your way home, you pass a gun store and decide there and then that this was the last time that anyone got to fuck with you physically without repercussions.
>You walk in...
>... and leave without a pistol.
>But you do have an order for a CCP pistol for your noodly arms and signed up for a CCW course, and also brought an AR with you.
>You walk home, feeling a lot better, as if you finally have control again.
>Control is back. Your mancard got reissued.
>it wasn't cheap, but it was worth it. >Nothing says fuck off like a military style assault weapon.
>At night, Jenna stops by your place. While she isn't happy about your purchase, she is understanding and having her around is comforting.
>Over the next few days, your CCW course starts, you spend evenings at your local community college, making sure that you walk in groups or in brightly lit areas if you have to and you went back to work without missing a day.
>everything seems to be getting back to normal and fiddling with your guns has made you a lot more self confident.
>the next chimera to try something will get some.
>you have a random afternoon after you got off work, before you go down to your local college for your CCW class as your doorbell unexpectedly rings.
>You're not expecting anyone tonight.
>You go to answer the intercom, but there is no answer as you cautiosly say
hello?
>instead, there is a light knock on the door.
>you open the spy glass and peer through.
>you see the empty corridor and reach for your AR, quitly racking one in to the chamber.
>a black furry paw comes in to view
>you tense up, but the paw is holding something for you to see.
>its a stick with a double oval outline, off white, with a pink tip on one side and a tiny window - shwoing two lines.
>You can hear her talk through the door.
We need to talk!
>You don't feel like talking at all.
Go away!
>she shows her face in the door spy
We can talk through the door and keep your neighbours entertained, or you can let me in!
>no fucking chance.
Fuck off!
Alright, I'm suing for alimony!
>oh fuck.
>alimony? In this state?
>ohjeezohfuck
>you'd be turbofucked
>Wait, wouldn't she be admitting she raped you?
How are you going to argue in court that I have to pay for kids I did not willingly conceive?
>her hand moves away form the door spy and you can see her face for the first time. It's not even nearly as frightening as you remember it.
Can you just open your door and we can talk about this somewhat in private? Otherwise I'm just gonna drop this in your girlfriend's letter box.
>ohshitohfuggohjeez
>You really don't want to open the door, despite feeling secure with your new aqcuisitions from a few days ago.
>But maybe you can talk about this with one of them trained on her.
>you quickly think through your options. If you open the door, you can't have both of your hands on the rifle and you could be overwhelmed.
>So you have to open the door and step away quickly, out of arm's reach.
>but then, what if someone passes by?
>They'd surely do something about a chimera in a doorway with a dude in the flat aiming a rifle at them.
>So you have to be out of sight.
>your apartment is somehwat shaped like a hotel room, the the left of the front door is the bathroom, beyond which the room opens up in to the kitchenette on the right and your living room where the bed in a hotel would normally be. Your bedroom is to the far left.
>The smart move would be to unlatch the door, immediately retreat out of the hall in to the living room and move left, hiding behind the wall there, out of arms reach.
>but wait. what if she snatches one of them out of your hands and turns it against you?
>dread of loss of power flows through you again and you quickly look around for your pistol and it's holster, but they're in the living room.
Wait, please!
>You check the spyglass on more time and expect to see a frown and folded arms, instead she's looking down the corridor, seemingly at a state of total ease.
>You run back in to the living room, slide the holster in to your jeans, then the gun in to the holster.
>oh wait, load one.
>You quietly chamber a round
>then slide the gun in to the holster.
>sufficiently prepared, you return to the door and execute your plan.
>handle push, pull and jump backwards a few paces, beyoned the corner of the bathroom and a few paces more, then a quick 180 and guns up.
Helloooo?
>You hear the door being pushed open.
Just come in and walk in to the living room.
>steps are moving through the hallway as you remember rule #1 of firearms just before they reach the corner: Never point a gun at something you don't immediately intend to shoot.
>you don't relax your deathgrip one bit as you pull the muzzle from headheight down to 45 degrees, just as she walks in to the living room, looking in the direction of the kitchen.
I'm here.
>she turns around and freezes, eyes wide.
Is that a real...
>as she trails off, you nod.
ooo...kay.
>well, this is going a lot better than you expected.
Did you shut the door?
>she shakes her head very carefully.
No.
>You point to the couch, facing away from the hallway.
Sit down, if you want to talk.
>you keep your eyes on her as she moves over to the couch, allowing you to move in to the hallway walking backwards while keeping out of reach.
>as you reach the door, she sits down on the couch, hands out of sight.
>Her posture is straight as a rod, looking in your direction.
>the door shuts with a click.
I guess i got lucky that night, eh?
>She seems to be trying to break the ice.
>You walk back in to the living room
What do you mean?
I mean, wouldn't you have shot me?
>You think about it. Yeah. Absolutely.
>Given the choice, just straight up shooting her to save you all the trouble would have been better.
I guess.
>You continue moving, carefully staying out of reach until you can sit down at one end of the other couch in your living room.
