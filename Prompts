>Striped Hyenas in particular will be especially affectionate once they're inside their dens; even if an individual wouldn't normally be that way, you're likely to see a noticeable change as soon as she gets settled in. If she's already affectionate, you'd better learn how to breath through all that fluff. She will let you out for air, but it's still a good idea to maximize the amount of time your face can spend buried in her fluffy parts, as a show of respect.

>How did you convince her to take the lead sexually?

>Dragons definitely, a combination of size and temperament.
>Snakes/Nagas/Lamias...all the better to hug(squeeze) you into submision.
>Sharks and large dolphins, doubly so when in the water.
>Most of the FAoHM thread does agree on large wolfgirls, yeens, and crocodilains, so there is that to consider. Personally, I think it's more of a temperament thing.

>They hardly know what sex is yet, much less understand that this incredibly enjoyable ritual requires consent. Would you say no to a massage? Why say no to this? Humans are weird. And weak. And clearly need to be taught that asking for consent is a waste of time.
>No one in their right mind would say no to something so fun.

>Goddamn do I love anthro horses. Why can't I have a loving, gentle dom mare wife? I just want to have her hold me close, feel her warm fur and the breath coming out of her snout, and drift off to sleep to the sound of her heartbeat.

I want a mare who's sweet, loving and gentle, yet knows that she's in charge. Climbing on top and slowly riding my cock, stopping every time I hit the very razors edge of orgasm, not letting me cum until shes had multiple of her own, all the while whispering into my ear about how good it'll feel when she finally lets me cum, and kissing me as she brings me to the edge again.

>Horses could easily work for both. They're pretty big and strong, and you have the whole "role reversal" thing going on. Not to mention crops are like, a huge staple in femdom.

>One day while looking in a room dusting for prints, someone puts a hand on your mouth and holds a knife to your neck
>It was obvious who it was
>You expected her to kill you
>You had no reason to expect her to start smelling you

>But she insists that to keep water out of your lungs she needs to share air on the way up
>You're pretty sure sharing air doesn't require that much tongue

>Literally nothing you can do if a Pokemon decides it wants to use you
>Most Pokemon's fighting spirit and inner desire to be stronger means that being a dom and topping are always preferred

>Word will quickly get around the wilds when a human


 is down to get fucked

>They are now ubiquitous in our civilization
>Arceus save us if their desires reawaken
>Because now even the safest places are teaming with them

>a world where teasing is a way of testing how good a person's life is
>shyness and nervousness is perceived as a cry for help: a subconscious desire to be taken away
>humans are just naturally weaker, and as such have much more reason to be shy and nervous

>There are still some who believe it was the opposite
>Humans were made so that Pokemon may always find a loving husband
>They may try to reject the role, but to the Pokemon, these failed attempts only prove one thing
>It was the role that they were made for

>ynw attempt to struggle against an incineroar just for her to pin you back down and shut down any sort of resistance
>Incineroar innecesantly pointing out how feminine you are and how much you need to train
>you try to go to the gym once and she pulls you back because she actually loves you like this, weak, feeble, and unable to resist

>What if she loves when they run just because she knows she'd easily catch up?
>She loves it alright. Imagine the fear in his eyes when she tackles him down, pinning his arms right above his head and stopping any attempts of escape
>I remember a Mythbusters episode where they tried testing if running side to side would permit one to escape a crocodile/alligator faster than running straight away from it.
>They ran into an immediate problem, as the gators/crocs would not pursue the bait more than a few feet after the initial lunge. Thus the myth was deemed busted.
>If this applies to gator girls, they will likely stalk you for a short time, carefully closing the gap without you noticing, before launching at you without warning. That, or positioning herself so your escape routes are blocked. After the initial attack, she may pursue you for a short time. Probably plow through some minor obstacles along the way or overturn a car with her strength.
>Unfortunately for her, that thicc gator body, thighs, and tail aren't great for speed or distance running, so she'll come to an awkward halt gazing at you lustily until energy builds up for another attempt. If she is successful in grabbing you however, odds are you'll be deathrolled for a few dozen yard before being pinned under a very dominant and happily rumbling gator woman

>Wildcats are defiantly femdom material, and would more than likely enjoy hunting some guy down. And given that all cats tend to play with what they catch...well, you'll want to pack some band-aids.
>Personality wise, probably demanding with a bit of a superiority complex, and generally lazy in her off time. Might have you on a leash as you pet her and scratch behind her ears as she lounges on the couch.
>Just an opinion…

>Ywn be dominated by an amazonian hyena who want to improve your bloodline by getting you YEENED and make you a stay at home dad for the cubs you have.

>Alternatively, lionesses
>you’re a stay at home dad
>your job is to take care of the kids and fuck/comfort your wives

>get abducted by a pride of rogue lionesses
>they formed from random lionesses that left or had no pride or got tired of their male
>learn humans have no barbs and formed a plan to get one
>now they have a male they're an official pride now
>not much different from a normal lion pride with the females out hunting and the male staying at the den, but this time it's because a human doesn't do well in the Savannah and hunting with lions
>now the lionesses bring food for their male to keep his strength/stamina up when they fuck him into the ground together
>they got to be careful with their human due to humans being smaller than lions and the no barbs has them going much rougher and longer since there is no pain and only pleasure
>male lions can't even challenge their human for ownership of the pride since the lionesses attack together because they're not putting up with barb dicks ever again

>monster hunter, but the monsters are females that cause issues due to being horny and harassing people/villages/towns/etc
>hunters have to go out and try to calm

>The hunters try to fight at first
>It goes badly, with many men being taken back to the female's caves
>After other monsters hear about what human men are like, they start attacking the villages
>Hunters turn into sacrifices
>Eventually the villages manage to convince the monsters to give rare materials in return for men
>The economy thrives, but few men who arrive realize that they might just be traded to the monsters to help the economy
>Telling them you are married won't save you

>Live in the world of Pokemon
>You aren't a trainer, you were never especially interested in risking life and limb, or teaching Pokemon how to fight
>You'd probably be a terrible teacher anyway, seeing as you know nothing about fighting
>That isn't to say you don't love Pokemon, you do
>When you found a rockruff eating from a dumpster, you had to take her home and clean her up
>You may have gotten bit by her, but you can't blame a poor thing like that for being frightened
>She was much nicer after you gave her some food
>Not feeling comfortable with letting her go, you let her live in your house and named her Luna
>Luna was often very affectionate, always licking your face whenever you put it near her
>Going to bed was a bit tricky, because you'd find yourself covered in slobber as soon as you let your head hit the pillow
>There was still some... problem behavior from her
>Not just because she'd fight you during bath time
>She was very protective of you
>Not entirely out of the ordinary, but it was always worst around women and female Pokemon for some reason
>One day a passing trainer showed off her Salazzle
>You don't know why, but you got this really weird, comforting vibe from that Pokemon
>Luna seemed to disagree as she flew into a rage
>Despite the type advantage, she lost pretty badly
>You apologized to the trainer, and brought Luna to the pokecenter
>After that you expected her to calm down as she might risk getting beaten again, but you were terribly wrong
>If anything she got into more fights
>Even when you were sleeping, she'd leave to fight
>Then one night it happened
>You practically jumped when you heard the sound of splintering wood
>A strange form, shrouded by darkness opened your door and you screamed
>It fell on top of you and you struggled to get free
>Then you heard snoring
>You felt cold metal against your chest, seemingly tied to the individual's neck
>Carefully, so as not to wake the intruder, you held it to your face
>Luna?
>Things were kind of the same, but also different since Luna evolved into a Lycanroc
>For one, wrestling her into the bath
>Now it was actual wrestling, and she was easily stronger than you, pushing you into the tub
>Surprisingly after that she jumped in and forcefully lathered you
>Seeing what she was doing and knowing she was much stronger then you, you stopped fighting it
>Although you did push her away whenever she started getting her hands a bit too low
>You felt that it was some sort of revenge for always cleaning her, but after her very handsy wash, she had no problem sitting still for you to clean her
>After cleaning her top and getting lower, you noticed her own privates
>As a rockruff you'd clean that spot without thinking, but now it just felt different
>Like putting your hand around there would be wrong
>You took your hand away right as it reached that spot and handed the soap to her
>She looked at it in confusion, and to your surprise started to growl
>You thought she would crush the soap, but thankfully she just angrily continued with her washing
>When you took her for a walk, she stood closely by your side, growling at every woman who got too close
>You were a bit worried when one of your neighbors came to talk to you
>You tried to convince her to calm down by reminding her that she was friendly, but her growls just got worse
>Thankfully you managed to calm her with a good hug, but she wouldn't let you go without firmly slobbering all over your face
>She seemed pretty adamant on staring your neighbor down as she licked you, her coarse, rocky tongue brushing against your face
>When night fell, you laid in bed
>You wondered if you should let her sleep beside you still, as she wasn't really a puppy anymore
>She walked up to the bed, and got down on all fours, looking intently at your face
>You begin to lightly sweat, a bit uncomfortable with the close contact
>She brought her face to yours, and started to give her usual slobbery good night kisses
>The usual feeling of a large wet tongue dragged against your

 face
>Something was different though
>Instead of the usual rapid licking, her tongue was slow
>It was like she was carefully tasting you, studying your flavor
>Then her tongue darted into your mouth
>The meaty organ was entangling with yours, pushing it gently
>Panicked, you pushed her away
>Surprise covered her face for a moment, before it turned into rage
>She grabbed your arms and held them firmly to the bed before she smashed her face into yours again
>This time, instead of the original gentleness you felt your tongue being battered
>Any attempt to pull back, and she would reach deeper into your mouth
>Not a single spot is untouched as she scoured you, and the drool because heavy and you're forced to gulp it down
>She pulled away and smiled smugly at you as you gasp for air
>Her hand let go of yours, and moved down to your pants
>With a yank your member stood tall and brushed against her thigh
>Her hand moved to your face, and you felt it caress your cheek
>With a thrust, your member went inside of her drooling lips
>The way she slammed her hips into yours hurt a bit, but it was nothing to the pressure of her pussy's grip
>She looked at your face with that smug look again and you tried to look away
>Soon her other hand reached for your head, and forced you to turn back to her
>She smirked at as you tried to use your free hands to move hers away, but she just chuckled at your failed efforts
>She changed the pace of her thrusts and began gyrating
>Her eyes scanned your face and gauged your reactions
>Her own face occasionally shifted, from a smirk, to curiosity, to the look you'd expect one to give to a mewling kitten
>As you felt drool running down your mouth, she suddenly stopped and looked into your eyes
>The look she gave you was kind, and you almost expected her to let you go
>Then she attacked again, using the previous knowledge gleaned from your reactions
>That's too much, and you feel yourself release into her
>As you spasmed, she held your head tight
>The only thing you could look at were her bright red eyes
>After you fell limp, she gave a small kiss on your lips
>She grinned once more, but this time it was a pure one with no malevolence, not hiding any tricks
>It was the same smile that she wore as the girl you found in the garbage
>She just grew up
>You both fall asleep, her head resting beside you and one massive hand lightly scratching your head

>Simple. You know how sharks are said to be capable of smelling blood from miles away? They could do the same with sperm. Just stick your dick in the ocean, and you'll eventually fish one out.

>"Oh, Anon! What do you mean your religion says humans and anthros are not to be wed?"
>"Why would such a terrible religion say that? You were put upon this Earth as gifts to anthro women. It's what brings humanity meaning! Please, come to the church so we can baptize you properly."
>"Anon, don't fight it. You're only hurting yourself. I will drag you there and help if it means you can repent for your sins and know paradise."
>"Do not worry, you're only a sweet man who got lost on the path to heaven. I know you'll be forgiven, the daughters of Eve can be very persuasive. After a night with us, and a bit of reading of our book you'll see that they are merely imposters."

>a world where anthros make up 90% of Earth's population and humans are rare
>anthro societies see humans as strange, cute beings that can't survive on their own and need to be protected and loved

>Humans since the dawn of time were viewed as priceless and beloved by all
>Anthros love their cute features, and know that they are too weak to fight back for independence
>Because of this, there are few things more valuable than a human
>It's even believed that some wars started over humans, with the most famous one being the Iliad, where the lion princess of Troy stole
 the adored husband meant for the dog queen of Sparta
>In the Medieval era, specially trained pleasure men might be given away to help push for alliances
>This made most humans direct descendants of royalty or other people who held great power, making them worth even more
>In the modern age, although humans may no longer be considered property, it is hard not to find adults who are under the protection of a powerful figure
>A human without bodyguards would almost certainly find himself kidnapped or used by some desperate female
>They are never hurt, however, as to do such a thing will incur the wrath of anyone with a set of morals
>Then there are the extremist groups
>The largest one is a new religion quickly gaining traction, claiming that male anthros were put down by some devil like figure, and humans are the only true males
>Then there are the children of Felinity, a group that thinks cats are superior to all others, and children of both cats and humans will lead them to true perfection
>Along with a myriad of others who took the idea and replaced cats with their own species
>One thing is for sure, people are willing to give a lot to be with a man
>And those who have them refuse to part so easily with their grand treasures

>animals excessively outnumber humans
>humans are kinda small in body mass compared to lot of species
>don't have mating seasons
>human females are kinda stretchy
>both human males and females have incredible sexual endurance
>also males have the biggest goddamn dick-to-bodymass ratio out of everyone with the exception of horses and ducks

>In the twenty first century, mankind received word without a doubt, that they were not alone in the galaxy.
>Alien spacecraft hovered outside every city, far enough away to not be threatening, but visible from the ground.
>After a few minutes, every device on Earth reported a single message in text and audio.
"We come in peace, do not be alarmed. We ask that the populace go about their lives as normal and avoid panic."
"We will convene at the United nations building in two of your days."
>Panic was thankfully minimal, though everyone was definitely stressed over the ordeal.
>Ambassadors were rushed to the UN building, and over a period of several days, details began to unfurl.
>The aliens had reached out through social media, so as to keep the public up to date when the governments would not.
>Apparently, 100,000 years back, Greys took samples of earth's fauna and began doing genetic experimentation.
>They only raised females, however, as a means of population control, ensuring they could not bred on their own.
>The Greys used artificial gene sequencing tech to create male zygotes and artificially inseminate the females. This gave them better contro over their evolution.
>Eventually, they ended up with anthro amazonian women of numerous species to fight their wars for them in Andromeda.
>After the wars, the anthros wondered why they were subservient to the Greys, and began to ask questions about their history.
>This eventually culminated in a rebellion that lasted the better part of 500 years.
>The anthros did achieve victory, but at a terrible cost, the gene-sequencing tech was destroyed, though stockpiles of viable sperm remained.
>Thus, they came to earth, to exchange technology, space travel, and protection, for human men, as their biology had been tweaked to accept it in route by what few scientist they had and information from scouting parties.

>You are a young brigadier in Europe set in the 17th century
>Your societal position can be considered as some kind of proto-mafia, less hierarchal and more delinquent
>Your last disruption job went well, and you successfully snitched some rival activities to a troop of carabineers
>However the rival clan manages to identify you and immediatly hire bandits to teach you a lesson
>It doesn't take long until those bandits manage to find you
>You didn't see it coming, as you thought they were just campers in the area, they were even singing folk songs togheter with a guitar...
>One taller than the other, a vixen and a lynx correspectivly
>They chained you inside a carriage, took turns beating and cutting you with knives, the lynx even used her claws as she beat you, living marks on your face and abomen.
>They branded you on the back of the shoulder with the symbol of the very clan who hired them. Then they also took turn in trying out the freshly tendered meat, you only could be glad that the vixen was sweet about it because the lynx was quite eager to dig her claws onto your back as only lord knows how many loads you dumped into them, solely to satisfy their heat.
>You are dumped at night the feet of an hideout of your clan, your comrades would find your naked and unconcious body only later in the morning.

>you are a lone trader, traveling hundreds or even thousand of miles to get from one town to the next with nothing but a small wagon of goods to sell and food to keep you alive.
>one day, while traveling on the lonely road, you get raided by a group of yeen bandits who not only take your wagon full of resources, but they also decide to keep you as their own breeding bitch.

>Imagine being that helpless. Just pinned to the mattress with her weight on you, sliding in and out. Feeling sensations you'd never felt before. Her sharp eyes piercing you from an inch away as she takes full control. Trying to keep your composure as she draws out gasps and moans from your pinned form.

>The great civilization of the lizardwomen had dominated the jungles for centuries.
>They created impressive cities with towering temple pyramids, dedicated to their gods.
>Local human tribes would be subjugated, and made to pay tribute to the lizardwomen.
>It was only proper for the strong to benefit from the weak, as nature intended.
>Human males were prized possessions,

 able to last longer and be ready again faster than their own males.
>Their body heat was welcoming, their skin soft and supple, and their scent intoxicating.
>As a result, the Fertility ceremony overseen by the High Priestess requires such individuals.
>Every year, the human tribes would offer up one of their virgins as tribute for it.
>Depending on how many of the priesthood they were able to satisfy, a human tribe could be rewarded or punished.
>One year however, after an intense storm from the vast waters, a curiosity arrived.
>A tribe had secured a pale man, from an unknown region, and who spoke an unfamiliar tongue.
>He was taller than the native humans, broader in the shoulders too, and his eyes a startling green.
>According to the tribe, he'd been found upon the beach wearing strange garments.
>And, according to testimony, when asked of his origins, he pointed across the sea from where the sun arose.
>They, of course, did not know if this was true, or if he was a virgin, but the tribe felt it warranted attentions of a higher authority
>The High Priestess, upon learning this, made a note to reward the tribe of humans for their diligence.
>The Pale One was brought to the great city of Centecochitl, where the High Priestess and the grand temple of Xiomara were.
>While he was indeed noticeably larger than a native human, his face was quite youthful in appearance.
>He seemed rather alarmed at the appearance of the Lizardwomen, and would do his best to back away when approached.
>It was understandable for one o be intimidated by those superior to themselves, as Nature intended.
>Most definitely if a human had never met one of the lizard kin before, and arguably one of the most important females.
>With a gesture, the High Priestess ordered the Pale One to be stripped of his garments so he could be examined properly.
>He did struggle and protest, but it was his fault for hiding so much of his body under leathers and fabrics.
>Even his FEET had been covered for some insanty, even the soft-skined tribesmen went barefoot.
>It was quite shocking to see even paler skin upon such a body, hidden away from the scorching sun.
>The Male fussed, and his face turned alarmingly red from embarrassment, a rather strange reaction.
>What kind of backwards civilization of humans taught themselves to be ashamed of their bodies, the very work of the creator?
>And what a body this one had, the pale flesh showcasing his well defined musculature from a life of hard labor.
>Much to the delight of the High Priestess, Xiomara had blessed this male quite generously.
>Oh, the High priestess would most certainly reward the tribe of the Aztecs most generously for this tribute.
>The Pale one was given a loincloth, before being sent along to be prepared for the Fertility Ceremony.
>He was given drink and food, so as to boost his production and endurance.
>Then, a few giggling servants washed him, enjoying his attempts to resist them, truly humans needed to learn hygiene was important.
>Sacred oils and perfumes were massaged into his skin, but no tribal markings were applied, for his people were unknown.
>Finally, he was served with a elixir of frothing chocolate and fermented fruit, to ease any reservations he might have.
>As the sun began to set, the Ceremony began, and music began to flow freely from pipes and drums.
>A night of debauchery was to descend upon Centecochitl, and hopefully Xiomara would bless the wombs of females to bear young.
>The High Priestess was already atop the temple with several members of the priesthood, all females.
>Adorned with talismans and perfumed, the began dancing and reciting prayers to the Goddess of Fertility.
>Even as she hefted an incense burner to the heavens, the High Priestess could see the Pale One at the base.
>A pair of Temple guards, female warriors tried and tested in fierce battles, were bringing him up the steps.
>There was however, a concerning note, as the male was fighting with unusual vigor against their grip.
>They were having to all but drag him
 up the steps of the temple, all 69 of them.
>It was as though he was deathly afraid of whatever lay at the top, a ridiculous notion!
>Then again, the Pale One did hail from across the vast seas, this was possible disorienting and frightening to the lost male.
>Still, his strength might have tested that of a lizardwoman in such a state, but the Temple Guard held him with ease.
>When he was atop the temple, the Pale One looked around wildly, his breath coming in rapid gasps.
>The moment he spotted the alter, he began trying to break free with renewed vigor, a foolish notion.
>Even if he were to miraculously break free of the Temple Guards, more than a score of the priesthood would be upon him.
>The lizard women, even their lowest, were faster and stronger than the human males, and could subdue them, as Nature intended.
>With care, the Pale one was bound to the Alter, the stone smooth as a river rock, and in such manner not to cause harm.
>The Temple guards left him their, drinking his body in with their eyes and licking their lips.
>Many of the females gazed upon the Pale One with wonder, though more than a few were skeptical.
>The High Priestess ignored them, her hands dipping into a bowl of sacred lubricant, coating her palms and fingers in it.
>She approached the Pale One, and began to rub his manhood and scrotum carefully, enticing him to harness.
>While his face bore an expression of immense bewilderment, the blush told the High Priestess that he was indeed a virgin.
>She straddled his hips with ease, trapping his throbbing member between their bellies, and gauging his expression.
>Once she learned his language, she'd ask what silly thing had frightened him so.
>And as the sun disappeared and darkness fell, she rose up and engulfed him in a single, smooth, motion to the hilt.
>his breath seemed to leave him, but oddly, he didn't moan like many of the tribesmen before him had.
>Rather, he grit his teeth, and avoided looking at her altogether. Did he think he could resist pleasure itself?
>The High Priestess smiled, he would submit and give her his essence, as all males would, and as nature intended.
>She began to ride the Pale one at a sedate pace, fast enough to cause a smacking sound, but not hard enough to bruise.
>All the while she gazed down at the male, waiting for when he finally stopped being stubborn and submitted.
>Across the city, musicians played and dancers moved, and lovers embraced in carnal pleasure.
>While the other priestesses had kept their distance at first, a few came forward to look at the Pale One.
>Soon, the sound of music and flesh, along with the scents of perfumes and musk, overcame their reservations.
>They began to lick, nip, suckle, and kiss at his pale skin, savoring this rare and blessed find.
>Some sought to stimulate themselves against his body, while others whispered sweet words of encouragement into his ears.
>Throughout it all, the Pale one resisted as best he could, to not give into what they offered.
>But it would be in vain, the female was superior to the male, as nature intended.
>The Pale One would give the High Priestess his essence, as the Goddesses had intended.
>Finally, as she began to approach her climax, the Pale One stopped fighting, and let loose an adorable moan of pleasure.
>He began to reciprocate, face burning with embarrassment, as the other priestesses crooned at him.
>Then, his limits finally reached and resistance broken, the Pale One climaxed , the male nearly screaming from the pleasure.
>Moments later, the High Priestess reached hers, her folds ruthlessly milking ever drop from him as she sighed.
>For a few seconds, they stared at each other, before the High Priestess removed herself from him.
>His expression of wonderment turned to alarm as he gazed upon his erection, it only having gotten bigger.
>He muttered something in numb horror, even as the next member of the priesthood mounted him.
>In the end, the Pale One had managed to satisfy five more female before passing out, truly remarkable.
>After the sordid fluids had been washed from him, the High Priestess order the Guards to take him to her quarters.
>When the Ceremony had come to a close, she descended the temple to bathe briefly, before heading to her residence in the temple district.
>Upon entering, she found the Pale one lying upon stacked sheets of cotton bedding, stirring slightly.
>He tried to get up, But the High Priestess pulled him back onto the bed, his back against her belly.
>After a moment or two of struggling, he gave up, exhausted from his earlier ordeal, and too comfortable to try.
>Humming gently, the High Priestess smiled at her prize, a gift from Xiomara, and stroked his hair.
>She would see to it the Pale one was educated, teach him the culture of the Lizardkin, their history.
>He would learn to read and write, to do math and learn the patterns of the heavens, and how to care for her home in her absence.
>And she would learn much from him as well, a most importantly, where his tribe was.
>The Lizardkin would build ships to cross the unending sea, and armies of Lizard women would go to the land of the pale ones.
>The lizardkin would subjugate the pale human's tribe, as they had done with the tribe near them, as nature intended.
>And the Lizard women would dominate the males of the Pale tribe, females would always dominate males, as nature intended.
>But for now, she would comfort her glorious little gift, and sing sweet songs till both were sound asleep.

>Remember to get a brave woman who can fight. You don't want to get gangbanged by a bunch of girls just because your girl ran away from the smallest hint of conflict.

>win a ticket to that new female anthros fighting ring
>one got made some time ago and you never bothered to go
>always heard it was pretty lewd with anthro woman fighting naked or in fetish looking

 outfits
>figure it might be fun and you got a free entrance
>go to the place when it opens for the night
>the bouncer/entrance guard is some huge anthro guy and he takes your ticket
>stops you and sniffs at you then asks if you're single or with someone
>you tell him single and he hands you a red arm band and tells you to sit in the red seating area
>that was odd to say the least and you guess it's some anthro thing since this whole thing is an anthros only fighting ring
>walk in and see others with blue arm bands about and getting to their seats
>you keep walking looking for the red seating area and see it's right up front row near the ring
>and it's lower in the ground with some fencing around it separating it from the blue/general seating areas
>sweet, maybe this was a perk for winning that ticket
>look around and notice everyone in the red seating area is a guy, human or anthro
>spotlights flood the ring and a mongoose girl in a rather fetishistic looking outfit walks out with a mic
>starts hyping the crowd up and explaining the rules for newcomers
>announces the first 2 fighters
>one is an all white arctic wolf naked except some blue swirl patterns painted all over her body
>she's also massive and imposing
>she's showing off in the ring with poses to show her muscles and curves before letting out the loudest howl you ever heard and many of the dog/wolf audience joined in with her and some humans even tried to howl too
>guess she's got a lot of fans
>her opponent walks into the ring next
>she's a jaguar in very aztec looking get up, but still mostly naked
>all sorts of colorful feathers hang off strings or bands
>looks like she wants to one up the wolf since she calls a human guy in the red area up to the ring
>he nervously gets in the ring and holy shit does it show how big these woman are
>she pulls a bucket from out of the ring and has the guy dip his hands in it
>when he pulls them out they're red and wet with paint
>she turns and bends slightly forward with her ass pointing at the guy
>telling him to do something
>he hesitates for a bit before he places his hands on her big ass firmly
>the crowd cheers at this and after some time she moves away and she faces him again
>from this angle you can see two bright red human hand prints on her ass
>she then grabs his crotch forcing him on his tip toes before she whispers something in his ear and licks the side of his face
>she makes a line on his forehead with the red paint before letting him go back to his seat
>that "are you single" question you got at the door is starting to make more sense now and you think how you'll be returning to this place again
>wonder if they have any membership thing?
>the announcer comes on telling the 2 to get to their corners
>looks like the first round is starting
>you can feel a rather large change in the atmosphere of the crowd and ring
>everything goes quiet before a bell rings and the 2 charge each other
>and your entire view of this place changes when they start tearing into each other
>fangs and claws flash and sink into each other
>they're not holding back and blood is being drawn
>nothing life threatening, but both are still going at it rather viciously
>you also notice there's no ref at all and some, what you assume are, medics down by a back stage entrance
>the fight goes on for a little longer before both are panting
>the jaguar gets an upper hand and gets the wolf in a choke hold
>the wolf eventually goes limp a bit before the jaguar drops her and the wolf starts taking deep coughing breaths
>the crowd erupts into cheers while the medics wordlessly get into the ring cheeking on the wolf
>she needed a bit of help standing up, but limps out of the ring and back stage on her own
>the jaguar meanwhile hops out of the ring and walks towards the human guy she marked earlier and picks him up and tosses him over her shoulder
>blood still dripping from some cuts
>she walks by and you get a full scale on how much bigger she is
>you also see the guy's face is a mixture of fear
 and excitement
>the red hand prints also still clearly there on her ass and her walk has much more sway to her hips
>she carries him to a different backstage entrance and you don't see either of them after that
>jesus, what have you gotten yourself into this time
>you don't know if you're more terrified or excited for the next match
>the next matches go the same way
>2 big anthro woman come up, some showboating is done, maybe they pick a guy before the match, they have a bloody fight until one can't fight anymore, the winner claims her prize, and there's another empty seat in the red area
>then it gets to the final match and you're slightly exhausted from all the tension and excitement of tonight
>and holy shit did they save up for the finale
>2 fucking titans of woman walk into the ring
>a Kodiak bear and grizzly bear woman are the last match
>the grizzly is wearing some sort of lewd lumberjack get up
>a plaid shirt tied in that bikini fashion to hold her massive tits and jean shorts cut so small they're thongs
>the Kodiak looks more like a prehistoric monster
>naked with bands made of bone on her limbs and wearing a necklace with various skulls on it, including human skulls
>and ashen white streaks over various parts of her monstrous frame
>then she looks over and locks eyes with you
>her gaze makes you freeze and forget to breath
>then your heart skips a beat when she makes a come hither gesture
>on shaky feet you walk to the ring before you're pulled into the air at such speed and height you get momentary vertigo
>you're dangling in the air at head height to her and she looks you over with hungry eyes
>you must be hanging 9-10 feet in the air
>you also get an up close scale on just how colossal she is
>all you get for a warning is a lewd smile and her eyelids lowering before she kisses you with fervor
>given the size difference she covers most of your face

>you're deathly quiet with the realization of what comes next
>she jumps out of the ring and her landing impact shaking you slightly
>she's in front of you and slowly reaching for you

>she's only looking at you as she walks
>and the only word she rumbles out

>human teammate makes a callout over voice
>dead silence for five solid seconds
>"IS THAT A GAMER HUMAN?"

>You had plans for college spring break, plans to go to the beach and find a woman around your age.
>Your boss at Great Outdoors Magazine, had other plans for you in Louisiana, horrible plans
>Namely, pictures of wildlife in the swamp. A job for which you were completely unqualified for.
>All of your work for the magazine normally took place in a climate controlled building doing editing.
>Unfortunately, he'd have none of it, so off you went with cash to cover bare minimum travel expense and lodging.
>Supposedly, you would meet up with a tour guide down there who would take you places.
>Given you had to meet the guy at a certain time, you programmed the GPS in your POSs car.
>An eight hour drive later, you arrived in Louisiana, in some backwater town with a French name.
>It was hot, humid, well and truly away from any beach body women.
>This was only the start of your troubles, as apparently, your tour guide was arrested for possession.
>On top of this, the hotels were booked for a bunch of competitive fishers in town for a contest.
>Those that weren't, were in a pretty sketchy part of town, so you had no choice but to sleep in your car.
>It was miserable, but at least any money you saved would be added to your pay.
>Next morning, you drove down a dirt road to an unused fishing area, nature preserve and all that.
>Humidity Caused your clothing to stick to you, and the bugs swarmed you relentlessly.
>Plenty of swamp to take pictures of, and a moss covered dock stuck out into the water a ways
>Carefully, you marched out, eyeing the wall of green before you, raising the camera you were given.
>It was digital, waterproof, and had a good lens, and all you had to do was get a weeks worth of pictures.
>After a minute of scanning, you managed to spot a dragonfly, gotta start somewhere right.
>A few seconds later, you have a pretty decent set of pictures, perhaps this won't be so bad.
"Hey."
>You jump a little, and spin around, looking for the woman who spoke to you, but nobody's there.
"Down here city boy."
>Looking at the end of the dock, your heart all but leaps into your throat when you spot the gator woman.
>She's resting here elbows on the edge of the dock, staring up at you with unblinking stilted eyes.
>Odds are, she isn't floating so much as standing

 in the water, grinning like the cat catching a canary.
>Heavyset women weren't exactly your thing, but her massive boobs pressed against the end of the pier...
>Your face breaks out in a horrible blush as you avert your gaze, the gator woman chuffing in amusement.
"See somthin' ya like Slick?"
>.WHY IS SHE NAKED!
>A few months back, you'd seen a video on the net involving a Florida Man and a Gator Woman.
>Apparently, Florida Man tried snatching a purse from some mouse woman and sprinting to his getaway car.
>Some gator woman saw this and took great offence, and proceeded to charge the bastard.
>She plowed through a small tree and T-boned the car so hard the side caved in and it slide a few feet.
>This wasn't the end of it, with a grunt she flipped the car onto its side as though it were a toy.
>Then she tore the roof off, hauled the guy out, and gave the lady back her purse.
>It had been funny to watch, but now you were in a very bad spot, having ogled a naked gator woman.
>She didn't seem to mind at all, but you weren't a perv, and definitely didn't want to be considered one.
>To make matters worse, it seemed that her friends had shown up, and they were just as big.
"Oh, who's your friend Gabby?"
"Well now, city boy want a show heh heh."
"Slick alright for a city boy girls," Gabby said, "Though what brings ya to the bayou?"
>If you turn around and start hauling ass, you could get to your car and get out of here.
>>27398921
"Um, my boss sent me to get some pictures of the local wildlife."
>You take a step back. At this, the three chuckle, and shift as though to climb onto the dock.
"Leavin' so soon Slick? Perhaps you'd like to get a few pictures of some 'Wild' women first?"
"I appreciate the offer, but I should probably give you your privacy and all."
>You turn and make it about three steps before slamming to a wall of flesh, sinking into it slightly from momentum.
>Before you can fall down however, a powerful arm pulls you back in, your face buried in soft, sun-warmed scales.
"Now now ladies," the newcomer rumbles, "Did Ma' teach y'all o be nice to gentlemen? Slick here seems decent for city folk."
>with a sinking sensation, you realize that your face is currently imprisoned between a massive set of boobs.
>Most men would kill to be in such a position...odds were you were about to die in it, Not the worst way to go.
>The deep chuckling of voices indicate the rest of them are out of the water now.
>You are pulled out of your plush prison and held at arms length by strong and large gator hands.
>The Gator woman before you stand s 7'6", looks about 420 pounds, and has a scar over one eye.
>There are four more of them, including the ones you've already seen, the newest face wearing a baseball cap.
"So tell me Slick," Scarface rumbles with a giant grin, "What brings ya to this humble slice o' Louisiana?"
>So you tell them why you're out here sweating like mad, and hoping they don;t kill you.
>A few minutes of explaining later, they all seem to be giving you sympathetic looks and nodding in understanding.
"Well, Slick," Scarface says, "Me and the girls have been having a bit of a dry spell here, and we could yous a polite young man like yourself to help us out."
"In return, we help you get some pictures and give ya place to stay, sound like a deal?"
>Normally, you'd have booked it, but five women eager to jump(break) your bones and keeping your job was too good to pass up.
"Good," Scarface says, before snatching your camera, "Yer the more digitally inclined of us 'lizbeth. Snap a few pics will ya?"
>Wait, now? but before you can protest further, Scarface grips your head in a massive hand and draws you in for a kiss.
>Gator snouts weren't designed for kissing, but Scarface isn't deterred, her tongue pouring into your mouth, nearly gagging you.
>Your knees all but buckle as you sag in her grip, her second hand groping your ass and feeling you up.
>Her tongue overwhelms yours, and any attempt to kiss back is met with uncompromising force.
>Finally, she lets you come
 up for air, a thick strand of drool connecting your mouths.
"Name's Jessie," She says, "You'll be screaming it shortly."
>You try to give her yours, but your smothered by a massive breast the size of a basketball.
>Jessie is going to work getting your pants off, and the other girls are rubbing themselves idly as they watch.
>A few seconds later, Jessie has you mostly naked, your pants bunched up around your boots as she brings you in for another kiss.
>Her scaly body feels wonderful against your own, even beneath buttery fat you can feel her muscles shifting like steel cables.
>Your pinned to the ground, Jessie resting her thick thighs on either side of your body, eyeing your junk.
"No half bad for a city boy Slick," She grins.
>She grinds against you, her sheer mass pinning you to the ground, her lower lips slathering more moisture onto you.
>Your body drags against the muddy ground, it and her body pleasantly cool in comparison to the swampy heat you'd been dealing with.
>Finally, she lifts up, lines you up carefully, and hilts you in one go, her insides gripping you like a velvety fist.
>She begins moving a a steady pace, her hips driving you into the ground, hands planted either side of your head.
>Those massive breast sway in hypnotic motions, leaving you open mouthed as you gaze up at them.
"Go on Slick, play with 'em."
>You do, your fingers sinking into them up to the knuckle, occasionally playign with her nipples. She'd gasp occasionally when you did this.
>Her pace picked up, slamming down onto you, you'd definitely be sore after all of this.
>After a minute of this, you were at your limit, panting from heat and exertion.
"I'm gonna..."
"Almost there Slick, hang on."
>A few second later, you climax, you vision blurring from the intensity of it. Jessie follow suite moments later, smashing down on you.
>She lay atop you, her passage milking you dry all while letting otu a bone-shaking rumble, rattling your brains even further.
>Panting, her full weight presses on you for a moment, driving the air from your lungs, before she rolled over with you in tow.
>After the both of you recovered, Jessie helped you get dressed before telling Brenda(ball-cap) to get you to the house.
>Brenda had to lay the front seat back most the way so she could lean over it from the back seat. She was nice, and apparently a mechanic.
>Half an hour of navigating twisting back roads later, you arrived at their house, a waterside affair with a monstrous truck parked out front.
>Jessie, Gabby, Elizabeth, and Mary were waiting for the two of you, apparently swimming through the swamp was far faster than taking the road.
>Gabby helped you settle in, before pulling you aside entirely for a bit of fun of her own. By the time you could stand it was lunch.
>Mary was one hell of a cook, her food was far better than anything you;d had on they way out here, or nuked in the microwave.
>A short siesta later, and Gabby took you into the swamp to take some pictures. You rode on her back, the tough scales a stark contrast to those on her belly.
>She could get into places no boat could hope to, and she was a lot quieter, pointing out various creatures for you to shoot.
>By the time you got back, Mary had some of her mother's secret Gumbo recipe ready, and insisted on putting meat on your bones.
>After helping her with the dishes, Mary decided to reward you a little, and carried your spent body to bed with her like a teddy.
>The next four days would go in a similar manner, and you found yourself enjoying it immensely.
>Sure, there were a few mishaps along the way, like Elizabeth knocking you over with a playful tail-slap to the back of your legs and leaving a light bruise.
>Then there was the time Mary about smothered you with one of her enormous tits, in her sleep, and her response to your struggles was to pull you closer.
>You joined them for a game of football in a field, your smaller size and agility allowing you to slip past the other players a few times.
>Jessie then tackled you and death-rolled across half the field however, scrambling your brains and nearly dislocating your shoulder in the process.
>Brenda insisted on going over your car to make sure everything was working properly. You got to help fix the car and service her.
>Gabby left a few claw marks on you back after a particularly intense bout of lovemaking, but thankfully nothing requiring stitches.
>Wrestling was a constant pastime, and the girls found your resistance e to be adorable.
>Been cuddled was mandatory, as was being the smaller spoon, but that wasn't so bad.
>You even went to see a mud-wrestling match between Jessie and some Burmese snake lady. It had been a close thing, but Jessie won.
>The food was amazing, you got plenty of great pictures(some for keeping in the memory book), and the sex was awesome.
>Still, you went to bed aching, sore, and looking forward to doing it all again in the morning.
>All good things come to an end however, and on day five you began packing up and saying goodbye to the wonderful women you had met.
>Elizabeth had helped you sort the pictures(work related from NSFW) the night before, and promised to keep in touch via email.
>You let her upload a few copies of pictures of the six of you, and then the girls gave you a group hug that threatened to snap your spine.
"Ya' come back soon now ya hear."
>You promised to visit when you got time off or headed out this way, and began the long drive home.
>Upon arriving back at your apartment, you staggered inside, walked to your bed, and face-planted on it, relieved to be back.
>It was a little disappointing when you weren't grabbed by scaly hands and pulled up against a larger woman.
>Still, you had work in the morning, and, come to think of it, you never did get to take that vacation of yours.
>You'd put in for a week in the fall, and head back over

 to the girls then, once you made sure you could pull it off.
>And you still had most of the travel expense money, the Boss wouldn't notice most of it missing, he wasn't the brightest bulb in the building.
>Everything turned out wonderfully, much better than you;d imagined. You couldn't wait to go back though, but you'd survive until then...somehow.

>your part of a military project
>nothing special or important, more or less doing small labors
>you aren't that big or well built so that probably had most to do with it
>apparently the lab boys were doing something for the bigwigs
>some time passes and you guess it was a success given all the commotion going on
>though over the week keep seeing more people being carried out of a room injured
>next thing you know you're being grabbed by some scientists and higher rank military types and being briefed
>turns out they made super soldiers using animal DNA
>spotted hyena specifically
>females ones given in nature female spotted hyenas are bigger, stronger, and more aggressive than the males
>they keep piling papers and orders on you and trying to tell you how they need a handler and how they seemed to keep rejection the ones they keep sending in
>now they're just trying different types to see what might work and also an injuries are covered by your insurance
>barely any time to think before you get thrown into some observation cell
>you finally see the "super soldiers"
>3 massive amazon bestial hyena woman
>they also look pissed given how all week they had to deal with people coming in trying order them around
>you're not trained for this and just back against the wall and close your eyes hoping they won't hurt you too bad
>but nothing ever happens
>you open your eyes to see you're boxed by them and they're calmer and just sniffing different parts of you
>guess with you being quiet and small got them less aggressive and more curious
>it finally hits you that they're naked when their larger dark nipples are right in your face
>also can't help check them out and how ridiculously endowed they all were
>can't hold the fear boner back
>they seems to egg them on since they start that hyena whooping noise and getting grabby
>and then starts the the nipping, licking, and groping
>meanwhile the scientists watched on confused
>"does this count as a success?"

>"All human men listening, I want to talk to you about something. As you know anthros enjoy the idea of engaging in sex with you, so I'm sure you avoid being alone with species that you might think of as 'dangerous', like crocodiles, sharks, lions, or other carnivores. I want to tell you that you're avoiding the wrong species."
>"Now, I'm not saying you should let a hyena drive you home from the bar because she seemed nice. What I'm saying is you are ignoring some of the most dangerous animals. What animal is that? Rabbits."
>"I'm absolutely serious. Rabbits might seem sweet and fluffy, but they are fast enough to chase you down, have kicks, and can hear just where you're hiding. But that isn't what makes them dangerous; what makes them dangerous is that they see you as a necessity."
>"Humans are the best sexual partners with their endurance and size, and rabbits have insane sex drives. Nymphomaniacs who regularly have to deal with subpar partners. Those who can't have sex with a human have to deal with the torturous itch that cannot be handled by anyone else unless they can get a lot of males to agree to a one female orgy."
>"Other anthros see human men as an amazing luxury. Rabbits see them as medicine that can cure their disease. The former would love to have it. The latter feels that she cannot live without it. Rabbits won't just give up on you when they think they've lost you. They will regularly go to your house, learn your daily routine, and find an opening. Some individuals of other species may do this, but this trait is held by almost every rabbit."
>"So buy cameras. Lock your doors. And if a rabbit sees you, don't assume you're in the clear just because she went
 back to whatever she was doing. It's safer to assume you've already been targeted by her. The cute ones are the most dangerous, because they are the ones who are most desperate."
>"This has been an paid for by the Man Protection Foundation, keep our human men pure."

>hello of yes please to let hyena drive you home from bar
>she is very nice and probably just beings good new friend of you
>hyenas are good and nice anthros, please to do what they say haha

>humans are too naive and trusting around anthros
>this leads to them being taken advantage of by some many trying to protect only to end up taking advantage of them anyways
>using their human's lack of knowledge of their biology or culture to do lewd things to the poor little humans
>using to lick them, bite them, sniff them, rub their scent all over them, etc
>getting them to rub their smooth clawless little hands over their fur/feathers/scales/etc

>"Anon, don't you know dogs greet each other by smelling butts? I've got a bad sense of smell though, so I need to really get in there."
>"Licking is normal with us dogs, just take off that shirt."
>"H-humping is just a game, Anon! Just let me have my fun!"

>"I Gotta keep that bitch from taking advantage of the cute human and drive him home myself!"
>"Can't remember his home? Looks like my house."
>"Yeah, take your shirt off, kind of hot in here, right?"
>"Well, I am fluffy enough for a pillow."
>"H-his pants might also be making him really warm."
>"He wouldn't mind a sniff, right?"
>"He's out cold, he doesn't have to know that you touched yourself to smelling him."
>"You helped him a lot, he kinda o-owes you for helping him. He'd agree to one night, right?"

>taking advantage of humans in the dark since they can't see
>having humans being completely helpless once you get them in deep water
>hiding some blankets/clothes/sleeping bags/etc in colder areas so they're forced to cuddle with furred anthros for warmth

>"Hey baby, where ya goin'?"
>"C'mon, don't be like. Give us a smile!"
>"Don't worry we just wanna talk?"
>"How's it goin', sugardick?"
>"Hmmm...I hate to see you go, but I love to watch you walk away!"
This is just the tip of the ice burg of what human men have to hear just walking outside. Disgusting.

>Being raped by an anthro is a wonderful and totally normal experience for a human male. Even more when she leaves her special "gift" in the entrance of your house after 9 months.

>All the anthros would probably be interested in you after that.
>"Some mean bitch left you like that? I wouldn't leave you."
>"Maybe your kid would like a mother too?
>"Must be hard, taking care of someone alone."
>Can you handle being a dilf?

>Anthro society teaches humans that their bodies exist for anthro pleasure
>Anthros are taught that humans crave their touch, but are simply too shy to ask
>Humans are required by law to not have locks on their doors

>"And here we have the native jungle cat's marriage ritual."
>"Every year, they go out to capture humans in neighboring villages. After the capture, each cat must choose a human, with the highest ranking females choosing first."

>turn off the heater while it's cold outside
>hide all his coats and blankets
>keep showing off how warm and fluffy your fur is
>just gotta wait for the cold to break him down and he just throws himself at you get some warmth
>anything you do after doesn't count as rape since he choose to cling to you
>"It is customary for the chief or a great warrior to choose the fastest, most clever of men, as any less would be considered an embarrassment to their position. Those who have an easy chase may be shamed by their fellow tribeswomen if others feel she picked a man for an easy catch. Any man who manages to escape his pursuer are considered prime catches, and any single hunter who bests them will earn great respect."
>"As you can see, one of the guards to the chief is drooling in anticipation as she is steadily gaining on her picked target, a man who apparently managed to run quite the distance until he accidentally stumbled into a trap, ironically placed by one of his fellow villagers hoping for game. If the guard manages to catch him, she can expect a husband who will last for hours in the bedroom, and children who will surely be able to succeed in their own mating ceremony with a fast man."

>What if you were a captured human spy in anthro territory and got interrogated by a wasp girl?

>She ties you up and stings you with her stinger that has some sort of afrodesiac in her venom that acts like viagra. She interrogates you with sexual bondage edging you to the point of climaxing but never letting you cum pouring different types of sweets on your dick and using her elongated tongue wrapping it around your penis lapping up whatever she poured on tormenting you until you give up the rebel locations.

>"So you refuse to tell me where the others are?"
>You scowl up at the wasp
>"I told you, I don't know. And if I did, I'd never tell you."
>The wasp bends down to take a good look at your face
>Apparently finding nothing, she buzzes in frustration
>"Why do you fight us?"
>"Why are you kidnapping humans?"
>"Why?"
>She seems to take a moment to consider something
>Then she puts a hand onto your head
>"I find human hair to feel quite nice. It comes in some pretty nice colors, and even different textures."
>Her hand moves down to your cheek
>"But you still have skin not covered by fur. Soft. Somewhat smooth."
>She softly pokes at your cheek
>"Your face is so malleable. I just want to see how I can change it. Such a cute smushable face. And..."
>A few of her fingers move into your mouth for a split second, dragging across your tongue and pulling out before you can react
>She considers her fingers, rubbing your stolen saliva around
>She then sends her tongue along her finger, licking the spit up
>"You taste nice. It's... sweet? There's a rumor going around that your kind's spit is addicting, especially for insects."
>"W-what? What are you saying?"
>"You asked why I'm kidnapping humans, and these are the reasons why."
>"What about the others though!"
>"Oh, there are so many different reasons. The dogs have a weird cult around you, something about being morally obligated to return some favor by becoming your partners. The cats think you have the perfect penises, and are somewhat desperate for them. The reptiles think you make great bed-warmers."
>"That's why? You came after us for that? You made us fight for that?"
>"You made yourselves fight. There wouldn't be any fighting if you just came quietly. So, are you going to tell us where the others are?"
>You say nothing
>"Come on, my friend Milla has been complaining about not getting anyone. She's been boring me to death with stories from her religion. I don't care how the humans and dogs grew up together! Could you just give her a cuddle buddy? You'd probably think of her as a big fluffy pillow."
>"..."
>"Ugh, you're really serious about this? Fuck."
>She shakes her head, and begins walking to the door
>"So you've given up? What happens now"
>She stops, and turns to look at you
>"Oh, it's already been decided. You're going to be mine."
>"And... what will you do with me?"
>She takes her hand off the door knob, and starts walking back
>She bends down, her face really close to yours
>"I've got a sweet tooth, so I'll be taking your... fluids quite regularly. I'm a bit of a connoisseur, and as I've told you, I've heard good things. Maybe you noticed the foods you were given?"
>You feel your cheeks flush as you think back to it
>You had wondered why your had so many fruits and sweet things
>"Hmm, that's right. I've been wondering for a while what human honey is like. I'm sure it will be quite the experience for the both of us."
>She gives you a quick peck on the cheek, making you flinch
>"Hehe, I won't hurt you. But you can expect a lot more where that came from."
>She moved back to the door, opened it, and gave you a smile
>"Oh, and just so you know, if I don't get details on the other humans, I won't get my bonus. If you don't tell me, I'll have to wring that honey out of you. Of course, if you ask, I'd be more than happy to do it anyway. See you soon, sweetie."
>And you are left alone to think about your fate

Which do you prefer?
>The anthros are naturally dominant, looking for some meek humie to submit to them
>The anthros have a social response to the personality of the person they're around. Acting shy or nervous will make them subconsciously more dominant
>The domination comes from a loving relationship after the humie confides his feelings and asks the anthro to take the lead

>A world where humans are a rare species
>Humans are naturally weaker than most other species and probably can't survive on their own
>thus need the protection of stronger anthros

>Get nervous around the tall anthro girl who's taken a liking to you
>She thinks your shyness is cute and teases you about it
>It serves to make you more nervous and sets her on the slippery slope to being more controlling and dominant

>"Hey, human. You're looking pretty out of it from those drinks."
>"It's dangerous for a small thing like you to walk around at this time of night. Being drunk will just make you a great target."
>"Come on, I know a good place you can stay. Don't worry about money, I have plenty."
>"No, really, your presence is payment enough. And I've got a feeling I'm going to be seeing a lot of you after this. I'm feeling like tonight will be a good night."

>A few days later, it happened
>A massive ring had spread across the circumference of our earth
>A gateway
>It was something theorized by the man who had first made the machine, but he thought such a large gateway would cause more problems than it would be worth
>The anthros had returned, this time from a world that is almost as advanced as ours
>Living proof of humans had pushed them to return
>They all want a piece of us
>Some because of their religious belief
>Some who find the idea of a world with many males tempting
>Some to put us in our place and to spite those who might think themselves as our protectors
>In the end they all want the men of humanity gasping and whimpering in ecstasy underneath them

Humans are the last species that can produce males, female anthros are forced to depend on their sperm to conceive newborns. Thus, male humans are regarded as a resource anthros would have to fight for to mantain their population. However, there's another huge problem:
>Predator anthros can only give birth to female offsprings of their species
>Prey anthros can procreate females from their species and also male humans
Predator anthros will have to basically depredate male humans to subsist or face extinction, while Prey anthros are a match made in heaven for humankin which whom to prefer to coexist.
Due to the danger of being kidnapped by other anthros, males had to abandon leading roles and embrace more submissive ones such as taking care of the youngs, cooking and acting like healers for their wives. That mindset gradually sank into humans as anthros started to treat them like slaves, predator anthros being the worst offenders and openly deeming them like mindless cattle to rape & dominate. Any human who was overly attached to predator anthro eventually got their genes erased from the genepool, causing the remaining males to be afraid of predator anthros but still getting aroused by being turned into a breeding slave.
There's a sense of urgency among prey anthros with their few males, if they don't breed enough children then their tribes may began to reduce in numbers. As a consequence, young males are forced to choose a wife as soon as they experience their spermache, these toyboys are paired with anthros of their same age or MILF to be mounted and milked dry in front of the tribe for their first time.
Predator anthros, attracted by the odor of virgins copulating, will soon began to raid prey settlement and abduct any fertile male they see regardless of their age. They don't bother to love them back, these poor souls are ravished for hours till they are broken. Those who are too juvenile to ejaculate are send to their shamans to be turned into future sub studs.

“Wait, are all anthro females taller than humans?” One Anon said.
In a few words, yes. Males are just too valuable to be send like expendable warriors, having one on the field should be by itself a showoff of power from a clan. It's like putting your King on the center of the table, the foes would just prioritize their capture.
As you should've guess, Predator anthros are physically (Lioness & Gators) and intellectually (Owls and Dolphin) superior than men. They were bornt to conquer and snatch males out of Prey anthro's
arms who have to defend their husbands to death or resign and watch the gang of Predator anthros molest their dear husband before they drag them into their camp. Not the prettiest sigh, some Prey anthros even offer themselve as slaves just to be with their husbands even thought that condems them into a life of misery... Predator anthros won't stop at anything to quench their need to "devour" males.
However, the calm comes after the storm. With the predator anthros are pregnant and occupied nurturing their children into ideal rapist and warriors, Prey anthros can once resurge and reestablish their routines, the surviving males would've to take care of more Prey wombs and pump more descedants into them. They can't afford time to deal with hesitating males, they either cum or are drugged to cum; the point is that they compensate the lost members quickly before another wave of Predator anthros comes back to harass the males.


>Your busty Zebra milf mistress had popped your cherry and you didn't last long before came hard on her while her moans encouraged you to keep thrusting her plumpy exotic rear and go for another cumshot.
>You had no option, but to obey your body. The Shaman had drugged you with aphrodisiacs previously after you were brought to her tent, anthro mother telling her you had stained your bed sheets with your first load of sperm
>You were too horny, a feeling you had never experience before and was driving your mind crazy with the only desire to mate with the winking pussy of your new goddess.
>Slamming your hips once again, you let your tamed male impulses take over and burst another hot load of your seed inside her moisty tight insides. Her inner walls never stopped massaging every inch of your cock, forcing you to spill a couple of shy ropes of semen into her as a reward.
>You fell asleep, smothered by her breasts and with your member still sheathed deepballs in your mistress' equine cunt.
>...
>Months passed, your wife was pregnant and proudly sported her belly carrying your future daughter or, with luck, son around the village.
>The harvest of berries this year seemed promising, the male farmers were coming back to the tribe with bask filled with food for months... and you were about to be paired with another female in the next week
>You shivered at the idea of another MILF zebra mounting you, these females were going to break your dick if they continued to breed you like that.
>However, your thoughts are interrupted and the bell's ring echoed across the huts and tents of the village
>Predator anthros on the horizont, you were guided inside the main hut and put you along side others under the care of the most buffed Zebras on the village
>You prayed to the gods they didn't choose you...

>Your Zebra warrior wife got overwhelmed by the Kobold whippersnappers, you desperately beg them to spare your wife and claim you'll do *anything* to save the anthro who sought to protect you.
>The Kobold Leader smirked at youand mumbled to her comrades, one of the puny lizards chirped and took out from her pouch a rope before coming toward your direction.
>Huts were scorching, the crops were being tramped and spoiled as more Kobolds marched with their relentless forces through the village, but for you it was nothing.
>All that mattered to you was lying beneath their scaly feet, the Kobold hurled herself at you and easily tied you up... a classy burlington bowline on your wristles and ankles, you put pressure into the binds and confirmed how firm and well-done the knots were.
>She had to be their trappist specialist, the one who was assigned to reduced males into ragdoll bags for the bulky raiders to carry
>Though, this time their intentions were different. You could see it on them, they were craving for you and, despite the odor of Zebras on your genitals, you were still a fertile male for them.
>Dragging you into one of the abandoned huts whilst one looked around for any snooper that'd ruin their fun, the Kobolds threw you against a pile of hay and closed the door with the lookout covering their affaird
>The Leader was the first one to join and crawl over your body, her snout burying into your chest and taking a deep breath of your masculinity.
>"Wimps moan better." Her sultry voice toyed with your ears, you were about to get violated... You shivered, it was part of the deal, to be their rape toy for tonight.
>Her legs were accomodating between your thighs, her body hogging your warm away and her eyes dominating your attention...
>You tried to resist, but then the reminder caught you cold: the reason why were you doing this.
>"Come on, give in." She said "Don't make me regret this."

Personally, I like a 'New World' scenario, wherein humans are settlers in a new land. It would go down much like our history, only the tribal anthros were simply too strong for the colonial humans and end up enslaving them and acquiring their technology, before invading the Old World. Humans are desired because of anthro mating rituals- it's usually a power struggle between the male and females. Humans are weaker and even capable of acting submissive, and as such they're often taken as pleasure slaves/concubines.
To foster a sense of justice in the scenario, you can say that humans were the aggressors. They tried to roll out the genocide before getting 2koma'd, and from then on humans had the reputation of being either evil creatures that needed to be taught a lesson, or poor lost beings that need outside help to survive themselves.
Also, I'm not particularly a fan of including human females without anthro males; the NTR aspect of it bothers me.
Then will just say the female anthros’ male and human female went extinct and human males are lost and scared in the unknown world and female anthros discovers that human males have the ability to give birth to any species. Human males tries to resent this but the female anthros

 give then no choice. And thus, the war for human males for their tribes have begun.

The match has started
>The female anthros started going after each tribe’s species
>The hyenas already kill one of the kobold’s tribe by piercing a sword through her throat causing her to cough
>One of the rat tribes manages to get on a chariot, that is carried by big strong mares with massive stamina, and used a rope to lasso a Zebra warrior causing her to crack her neck due to hard yank of the rope which is nothing but a lifeless body and using it to make the other tribes trip over and lose their guard
>It may be gruesome and horrifying for those who are witnessing, but to these gladiator fans, it’s a showcase of entertainment
>Oddly enough, the human boys are entertained, but they are busy talking to each other and discuss which warrior tribe makes the best ‘love making’ and get aroused by a angry lioness girl roaring as she recently chopped a tribe’s head with a axe

>The arena remains ongoing as it was
>Human boys are talking, eating fruits, and even sometimes making each other out just to keep the audience entertained in case the same violence got them bored which leads some distractions for some fighters as one Cheetah was distracted by two human boys kissing each other, she was struck down by a heavy malice on her head, putting her out of commission
>The fight continues on and many fighters were ‘out’
>The two rat ladies remained on the chariot as they tried to lasso one of the fighters only to get stopped by a big buff female gator that manages to grab the two rats by their heads with her palms that are twice the size if their heads
>”Hahahaha!!! Don’t think you plague creatures got shit chances on these lovely human boys!” She laughed, “They need a female animal that can crush skulls... like this!!”
>The green gator did as she told as red liquid starts oozing out of her palms
>On the other side of the arena, a giraffe lady is getting her long neck bent backwards by a hyena girl with long spikey hair
>Meanwhile, one human boy yawned at the sight of it, “Yawn... all these ladies all barely got my attention. Some of these kills I seen before and many other times.”
>”That Zebra girl got my interests,” says another human boy, “but she’s already gone, so...”
>”ATTENTION! WE ARE DOWN TO THE LAST TWO FIGHTERS” the announcer shouted.
>Everyone cheered and see the last two remaining fighters
>The big buff, yet decently busty, green gator lady and a small yet, really tough Hyena girl with a long spikey hair

>Why do you always feel like you're being watched? Maybe you shouldn't live alone near that big swamp.
>Sometimes you hear noises at night. Distant twigs snapping, rustling brush and dripping water.
>Sometimes, you hear something scratching on the walls. For a time you were terrified, thinking you might have schizophrenia. Only, you don't hear these noises anywhere else.
>When you turn the lights on and look out the windows, you never see anything and the noises stop. Your frightened curiosity got the better of you today.
>You heard that telltale shudder of leaves, and almost convinced yourself it was the wind until something shifted- it was as though the subtlest shift in air pressure occurred. Normally, you'd frightfully flick on the lights and check your entrances. This time, however, you did not.
>Tenderly and gingerly you slid out of bed. The only sounds were your heart and breath. You listened and watched, worried and waited. Nothing.
>You ventured to the living room in its dark glory. Your footfalls were soft and silent. No movement at all, save your own.
>You approached the backdoor, trying to make sense of shapes in the dim moonlight. However... something was wrong. The sound of your breath carried strangely.
>You held your breath for a moment, and felt a shiver go up your spine when you realized that you could still hear breathing.
>At that moment, the shape became apparent to you. A crocodile girl, looming just outside the door. She had been watching you the entire time.
>You stood stock still in absolute terror, thanking the heavens that you always locked it.
>Only... your eyes traced the shape of the door as the softest of breezes crested your legs.
>The door was already open

>Shyness is its own endearing trait.
>Humans are just feeble, weak things that need help to feel okay. They know that you're a sweet and precious thing the moment you fail to meet their gaze. How can you willingly hurt someone if you're too afraid to talk to strangers?
>Besides, something about shyness triggers a part of the anthro brain. It's a genetic trigger from their creation: a hard-coded motive to protect. Why is this poor human so afraid? Did someone hurt them? They'll be polite, and give you space if you ask. However, expect to be teased often. A flashed smile here, a hand on your shoulder there. You're so gods-damned huggable, aren't you? They're always thinking about what you'll look like when your face lights up with joy.
>Watching a shy human unravel and open up is one of the most pleasing things an anthro can experience. To secure your trust and listen to you spill your heart, or to secure your body and gently make you spill your seed. Either way, they crave the feeling of holding your shaking form and making you realize how much you need them. They want to feel needed. They want you to desire them.
>And, when they're through with you, you will.

>Be Anon living in a town with his anthro GF
>Living your daily life in peace, going to work etc
>Until something weird happens
>Seems like whole world just stopped
>Birds stopped mid air and everything went silent
>You loose your shit and run everywhere to check what happened
>Until everything goes black
>You wake up in some kind of pod with electronics and fluids hooked on to you (Like Matrix but without gel)
>And then you meet your abductors
>8ft tall Snake girls/nagas (personally would go for viper gals)
>After a shock and loosing your consciousness you wake up on another planet
>Nagas everywhere.webm
>You stand with other abducted humans during inspection
>Ask them how the fuck we came here
>They said that they had huge debt and to repay it, they'll have to work as a "slave" on captors planet
>This wouldn't be strange if one of them had that happened, but they ALL have the exact same story.

>"Anon, I am your new wife as appointed by our governments for the sake of improving relations between our species."
>"Stop complaining. We've given your people a certain degree of independence for this. We could have enslaved you, but we're nice like that."
>"No, we didn't agree to the cease fire because we were worried about the death toll, at least not ours. Let me explain why we attacked your planet.
>Have you ever seen a cute animal? Something small and weak, and you just know that without any help it would die in the wild? We were worried that other worse races would take you and enslave you, so we did what we had to. We took you first. The only reason why we threatened violence is because you wouldn't allow it otherwise. It was for your own good."
>"You wouldn't have liked it if the others got their hands on you, and trust me, they were watching. Many would have not given you any rights and made you a priceless commodity. They would have stolen your men away and made special brothels to please many of their women. Some might choke you, bite you, hit you marring that cute face. Under our rule you'll only have to deal with one of us, and we've made laws to ensure you won't get hurt. And all you have to do to repay us is helping us deal with this hunger."
>"I didn't say you had a choice in the matter. I've been looking forward to this for quite awhile, and I'm afraid I can't help myself. But don't worry, I won't hurt you even if you struggle, it just reminds me of how fragile you are. I'm the best option you have."

>during your travels you get stuck/held up in an anthro village
>there's some sort of festival going on
>turns out it's a fertility one
>anthros running around in barely any coverings and some just forgo clothes completely and are just naked aside from jewelry/trinkets and/or some painted on patterns
>all the food and drink being served is food that's supposed to help stamina, hydration, fertility, libido, aphrodisiacs, etc
>you're probably the only person in the whole village wearing a full set of clothing
>getting a lot of stares and attention wherever you walk
>feels like you're going to have a panic attack with so many eyes on you and they aren't even being the slightest bit hostile
>even worse for your poor nerves is public sex seems the norm for this festival too
>some at least keep the sex inside, but are still in full view of windows or open doorways
>you manage to find an inn after working up the courage to ask a random wolf guy for directions
>not used to anthro greetings which is pretty much getting sniffed a lot and then a lick to the face
>got even more awkward when some fox female came and started groping him mid conversation while trying to coil your legs/waist with her tail
>able to slip away while stammering thanks before it got too heated and you were as red as the vixen's fur
>fuck, she even pouted when you walked very fast(ran away) to the inn that she wasn't going to get a human and wolf at the same time
>oh man, you are not prepared for a whole anthro village to have a party where they all are in heat or whatever
>you're just an average university student of a low noble family with a bit of bad luck
>finally make it inside the inn, but think it somewhat odd
>it's only one story high, but has a very very large room with a sunken in middle full of pillows and blankets with some low tables around the outer sides of the pit
>and the open lewdness and debauchery is going on here too
>the biggest bear anthro you've ever seen greets you
>she's a massive snow white

 bear completely naked with red painted on patterns that draw attention to and highlight her intimate parts
>wait, why is she walking towards you?
>oh gods!
>she grabs you in a literal bear hug
>your world is now warm white softness
>you completely disappear in her huge cleavage, thick fur, soft belly, and behind her massive arms for the duration of the hug
>when she finishes and sets you down the air feels slightly less warm now
>get out that you'd like to room in the inn and get a meal
>she gives you an odd look when you mention rooms and tells you everyone just sleeps in the large communal bedded pit that takes up most of the large room in the inn
>well, so much for hiding out in a room from awkward shyness and embarrassment
>the bear guides you to a free low table saying she'll bring some food real quick and chastises that you need to eat more with how small you are
>small insecurities about your stature well up some which is made worse by how all the anthros seem bigger than humans
>get snapped out of it when she brings a large portion of cooked meat slathered in honey to your table
>she quickly lectures you on needing to put on some weight while walking away to handle other orders
>at least it looks and smell delicious, but she gave you no utensils to cut and eat with
>look around and notice the other patrons eating there are just tearing off chunks of food with their claws
>oh right, anthros don't really need knives and forks with their claws and all, dammit
>tearing apart the large cut of meat proves harder than you thought and the honey glazing makes it so you can't get a good grip and just gets your hands covered in honey
>end up frustrated while licking your hands before a large she-wolf wordlessly sat next to you and started tearing the meat into small chunks with her claws
>she just smiles and cleans her hands when done while pushing the plate back to you
>thank her and pick up a piece of meat and nearly drop it when you feel her legs and paws rubbing against your legs
>barely finish the piece you had in your mouth when a large furry body sits flush behind you and you feel big breasts press into your back and large clawed hands on your shoulder
>slowly look back to see a big cougar female now looming over and against you
>she just tells you to eat and you have no choice, but to follow her order
>slowly eat while the cougar begins to knead with her hands and a deep purr starts up
>can feel the pinpricks of her claws through your clothes and then she starts licking your hair
>seems she thought you needed grooming
>at least grooming others seems a common thing among anthros when you look around to see other anthros in grooming sessions
>it really isn't that all unpleasant feeling, but all this female attention is new and has your nerves on edge
>not to mention the she-wolf is still next to you and now has hers legs wrapped with yours

Do you think anthros probably look down on human women? That maybe anthros always like to make fun or belittle human women for stuff like not being strong enough to protect and take care of their male counterparts?

I do find the idea of losing to be enticing. Imagine it taking effect in your blood, doing everything you can to keep fighting. The recurring thought of "I need to fight, I need to resist," melting away under the touching that you continue to let happen. None of it is forceful. No, if you could resist, you'd have been grabbed by a Lictor instead. You know it's wrong, you know it's bad, but you just... can't. Why fight? They never had any intention of hurting you. Don't you just want to feel loved?
The hive mind watches your internal battle with great joy. Not even your thoughts are safe; the Shadow in the Warp hears everything. It makes your eventual submission all the more savory. It cherishes putting thoughts into your head, and whispering its desires to you. "You don't like fighting. You want to be touched. You need us."
The thing about Tyranids that was never told to you is just how efficient they are. Physically, mentally, emotionally... They see your weaknesses, and will exploit them. It was over the moment they saw you.

>You get ordered on patrol in the jungle sector of some backwater world.
>High Command insist something is going on, but nothing was obvious.
>You're on patrol, alone because spreading men out covers more ground.
>You're gonna die a horrible death, you can feel it in your bones.
>You have the constant sensation of being watched by...something.
>Rapidly spinning around reveals nothing, just your rampant paranoia.
>For the past hour or two, you've really begun to notice the quiet.
>All the wildlife is silent for some reason, birds and insects have all gone quiet.
>Thirty minutes ago, you began hearing a very odd noise, a slicking sound.
>Its always behind you, and always stops when you turn around.
>There's also an odd odor, fairly pleasant for some reason.
>Wih a blur of motion, you level you lasgun at some bushes right behind you.
>Nothing, except for your won breathing.
>With a grunt, you lower your weapon and march off, muttering to yourself.
"What the frak is that noise."
>not even four meters from the guardsman, the lictor resumed he motions.
>At 2.4 meters tall and weighing several hundred pounds, she looms over her mark.
>Camoline chitin renders her invisible, her bio-engineered perfection rendering her gait silent.
>There is however, a growing excitement, at the idea of being caught, of being spotted.
>Flesh hooks twitch, desiring to snag the male and drag him into her embrace.
>He wouldn't have enough time to scream before her limbs gripped him tightly.
>She'd suck the information from his brain, melting all thoughts of resistance.
>Her sensory organs picked up the male's pungent odor, causing both sets of lips to drool
>No, no yet...but soon.
>Day 5 of scouting deployment.
>Guardsmen are starting to go missing without explanation or warning.
>Nobody is going out on solo patrols, despite high command's instance that nothing out here can really hurt us.
>That much is true of the native creatures, but whatever is stalking us is not native.
>Jenkins got snatched yesterday, all they found was his lasgun lying on the ground and some blood.
>I mean, enough to be noticed on close inspection, but it wasn't a serious injury.
>Garret went mad this morning, he was a little on edge since the start, but not like this.
>The only warning was a high pitched wheeze...and then he just started shooting full auto into the brush.
>He kept saying something about a "giant white bug, and Not taking him.
>Whatever he saw, it never took him, Lt. Emila shot him in the head rather than talk him down, the bitch.
>None of us liked it, the highborn was always a pain in the ass, but this was just murder.
>I feel sorry for her now though, whatever was stalking Garret didn't like what she did either.
>It took her at sundown, and it wasn't quiet about it either...but nobody saw it happen.
>One moment, Lt. Bitch ison the edge of the clearing, next she's being dragged through the undergrowth, screaming.
>It threw her around a bunch, took one of her eyes out if her screaming was any indication.
>This went on for about a minute, enough for her screaming to turn into horrified sobbing.
>Then there was the discharge of a laspistol, silence for a moment, then a lot of wet tearing noises.
>Damned Commissar ordered us forward to investigate, So we did.
>Lt. was painted across a small clearing, her guts hanging from the trees like streamers, her head placed on a rock.
>Her brains were blown out with a lasbolt.
>High command says
 nothing out here but animals, but this was no animal.
>Animals don't kill you with your own gun, nor do they just splatter you across the ground.
>What in the name of the Emperor is watching us?
>Day six of training deployment
>Commissar is taking a group of us to hunt down the deserters, completely ignoring none of them ever actually deserted.
>Jungle is hellish, wildlife out this way leans toward more dangerous, but definitely nowhere near as bad as chatachan
>place still sucks, but tis the life of a guardsman. At least you're far from the ramblings of General Powerstache
>Guy had his head on mostly straight, but talked constantly of grand campaigns and heroic charges.
>Commissar is being a bigger pain than usual, ordering about the squad to track down the poor blokes who got nabbed.
>Jenkins was the next to go,but he wasn't exactly taken. All week he had this odd little smile, like he knew something.
>Then he just walked off, claiming that "What's coming is inevitable, so why fight it?" And walked in.
>He was one for three seconds before the Commissar got around and fired off a pair of bolts.
>He gave orders to retrieve the equipment, but the five men who went in found nothing.
>The Commissar never misses, even in thick smoke thanks to that augmentic eye of his.
>Something nabbed Jenkins without making a sound and dodged a pair of bolt rounds in a matter of seconds.
>By the emperor, whatever is out here, whatever is hunting us, is...
"Guardsman, cease scribbling and get moving."
>You stare up at the Commissar, before stowing your journal and rising.
>Apparently, someone had found a trail of boot prints matching Jenkins leading through the jungle.
>Your clothing and flack armor constantly feels as though it is sliding down your body from the heat.
>You and one of your squad mates are in the middle of the formation watching the flanks.
"Whuytevavh is huntin us is close mate."
>It has gotten awfully quiet, and not the wildlife reacting to guard patrol level quiet.
>More like 'Something really dangerous is hunting the guardsmen' level quiet.
>Soon enough, the squad comes to a clearing, which should be alarming enough, but no one speaks up.
>The Commissar is radiating murder and the desire to execute you from any sign of incompetence.
>There's a muffled yelp at the rear of the column, causing everyone to turn.
>It's Leroy...he's standing funny.
>No not standing, something has a hold of him from behind, something like a hand over his mouth.
>It's mimicked Leroy and everything behind him almost perfectly, you probably wouldn't have ever seen it.
>Then it changes color, turning white with pinkish/purplish plates.
"It can Camouflage!"
"Open Fire!"
>Before anything can reach it, the thing LEAPS back into the brush.
>You start firing shots into the bushes, wondering just how many of those things are out there.
>Suddenly, flash-bangs land among the squad, disorienting everyone.
>Screw this, you think as the blurred form of another creature nabs the vox operator
>You can defiantly hear a pissed off Commissar screaming your name.
>You ran for several minutes, panting and firing off shot into the brush and random.
>frak.mantra
>Suddenly, you trip over a root, going sprawling to the ground, trying to get up.
Click Clack
>Oh, how lovely, the Commissar found you.
>Without preamble, your grabbed by your backpack and less hauled, more returned to vertical position.
>Not the Commissar.
>One of the creatures, but it's wearing the Commissar's hat, trench coat, and holding his bolt pistol.
>Its tentacled mouth seems to be drooling slightly, and following the drops down...
>To a very large set of boobs, which strain against the confines of the coat buttend around them.
>Your gaze drops again, and this time your cheeks really heat up
>A large stand of clear, viscous fluid dribbles from a very human looking set of lady parts.
>You look back up at is blushing face as it make and odd crooning noise
>Trying to raise your lasgun, only for one of the huge upper arms to knock it clean from your grasp.
>The lower set drops the bolt pistol and pins you against a tree, its grip strong, but oddly careful
>Oh frak, this thing isn't going to kill you.
>Suddenly, it leans in, tendrils gently stroking your face, not unpleasantly
>Then it kisses you, that is the only applicable term for what it does.
>Then it starts...sucking?
*slurp* *Suck* *Chuu*
>The tendrils lock around your head, tightly, preventing you from moving it so much as an inch.
>The sucking feels weird, and you can feel some sort of tongue slip into your mouth.
>It moans, the vibration rattling your bones ever so slightly as it continues.
>You begin struggling as hard as you can, because that weird feeling in your head is getting stronger.
>By the Emperor, it's trying to suck your brains out.
malepreycaughtstopstruggling
>The frak was that?
>It feels like the damned tendrils are IN your head now.
malecaughtmalesafemalesubmit
>Definitely in your head, it's definitely poking around in there for something
>One of the tendrils presses on a part of your mind, and you just melt with a whimper.
>You weren't sure what just happened, but it felt good.

"Rodger that A6K9, you're requesting reinforcements, is there a problem, over?
"No...problems...here...outpost, just send...more...men...over."
"You alright," The Vox operator asked, "You sound terrible?"
"Just...a little...sick...nothing to raise an alarm...about."
"Okay then," The Operator replied, "Can I have some coordinates, over?"
"Send to...previous deployment...area....will rendezvous...there...over."

>They are a bit strange though
>Swapping bits and pieces of creatures for instance
>Awhile ago you managed to do something really impressive
>You gave the dead life!
>With great precision, you took pieces of brain from the dead, and made it into one working brain
>The brain was made from lots of species, but you decided to put it in a female rat's head as a sort of labrat joke
>Unsurprisingly, her intelligence was not impressive, so you had her watch children's shows
>She got smarter and smarter, and began asking many questions, like what a 'friend' is
>You told her that a friend is someone who it feels good to be around, and who feels good being around you
>After she asked what a best friend is, you told her it's the person who you feel the best being around
>Of course when she asked, you told her you were her friend
>Despite being an experiment, you really did care about her so you worked on giving her a body so she could acquire some other friends
>You can't just go around asking people if they want to become friends with a rat head
>You required more money though, and you had already proven that it is possible to rebuild an entire body
>So you asked to test the effect of organs from different species on a body to see if you can improve performance
>You took body parts from rats, and replaced the organs and muscles with other animals
>Lion muscles, bear heart, snake lungs, etc
>It was a great success when you completed the body
>You had to make some changes so her rat body could handle the parts, making her pretty tall by rat standards
>Actually, pretty tall by human standards, she's two heads above you
>After hooking her up to some robotic limbs and safely teaching her what moves what, you put her head on the new body
>With a little something so her head can become independent of her body
>You aren't going to risk her dying because she accidentally stabbed herself with her knew limbs or something
>Shortly after giving her the body and her practicing with it, something happened, something you didn't expect
>Before, she said you were her best friend because she felt really good in your presence
>You took it as her being very social, and you were the only person she had met
>Since she got herself a new body, with all the feelings
 that come with it, she had been experiencing many new sensations
>But the most notable one was lust
>Turns out when you add a bunch brains from different anthros together, the heat periods aren't lost
>You made that brain from so many, the heat is almost constant
>One thinks early winter, another says late summer, and another says mid spring
>You didn't stand a chance
>Her muscles and her organs working in tandem made her an unstoppable beast, and she was very hungry
>As she fucked you, you could hear the massive beats of her heart pumping blood into her
>Her eyes didn't change, she seemed to just think it was a new game
>When she was done, she had fallen right on top of you, taking in your scent
>She now thinks this 'game' is something that best friends do
>You couldn't convince her that a mate and a best friend were two different things
>At least you can say both experiments were an outstanding success
>Now you just need to explain some other things to her
>Like how she's now much stronger than most species of anthro, that strangers aren't trying to hurt her 'best friend' and she doesn't need to be hugging you constantly in public to keep you safe...
>And that playing the 'best friend game' in front of other people is not acceptable

>"Matriarch, I have come to request we save the humans living on the planet known as earth."
>"From what?"
>"Themselves. they fight each other constantly, and their mental health is deteriorating an a terrible rate from their poor treatment of each other."
>"And why should I send people and resources to help these humans?"
>"Well, here's a picture of them."
>She hands the matriarch a picture of an abducted man holding hands with one of her own species
>"Wow, they are cute. These atrocities shall not stand! Send our best diplomats and a combat team!"

>Probably more heartbreaking.
What if humanities' greatest strength is our ability to suffer?
>Daily grind involves conditions that other races consider slavery
>Nothing comes naturally, we have to train for hundreds, thousands of hours to be good at anything
>Enter society is built on competing, the smallest slip-up and you'll be left behind
>Humans just carry on like nothing's wrong, you have to pry one open to get them to talk about their problems
>Sacrificing oneself is culturally one of the highest achievements a human can perform
>Suicide is exclusively a thing humans do
Depressing, but plenty of room for feel-goods. The world doesn't have to be bad. You don't have to suffer. It will get better because the invaders are here to make things right for us.
Remember to hug your local human. Those cute, depressed skinnies need all the love they can get. Besides, show a sliver of kindness to one and they'll be loyal forever.

>For humans, first contact was not what they expected
>After humans went into space, they were afraid that aliens would want to bring them harm
>Their first meeting with the galactic alliance was tense and uncomfortable, but not for the reasons they thought they would be
>The human diplomat brought guards with him, carrying top of the line weapons
>The alliance diplomat merely brought a scribe
>He had feared that this was a trap, or the other diplomat was some kind of powerful soldier who could kill all of them alone
>She definitely looked big enough, and strong enough to do it
>Then she asked him a question
>"Why are there so many people? What are they carrying?"
>He explained that they were his guards, and told her about the weapons they held
>She found the fact that they had so many powerful weapons discomforting, but continued on without issue
>The humans shared some small tidbits of information on our species, but they were mostly guarded
>Then the humans asked for information from them, expecting only a few of our requests to be heeded
>The aliens gave most of the humans was asked for
>Star maps, histories, culture, an idea of the tech they had, and information on each member races' anatomies
>They even gave us some cadavers to dissect, although they were old
>Humanity thought there was no way they were so nice
>They had to be bluffing, hiding something, no one could be so open to a race of strangers!
>So we sent probes to their planets to study them and find out what was going on
>They stole books, spied on officials, looked at histories between other species
>But they didn't find anything unusual
>Sure, they were much stronger physically than them, with most of the females of the alliance species being especially strong, but that was the most danger they found
>No powerful weapons, only a few words insulting other races, even their government buildings only had one camera
>They even checked to see if the alliance had made them invisible, but no, there was only one camera in that whole building
>They read through their histories and found that war might as well not exist
>Murder, theft, some even had a word for torture, but not war
>So they spoke with the diplomat
>Humanity's representative asked her why they couldn't find anything on war
>She didn't understand what he meant
>He explained it as mass death
>She thought the idea was funny, claiming the idea as ludicrous
>The human diplomat, once a respected military man lost his patience and screamed at her, telling her to stop lying
>She kept telling him that nothing like that had never happened, and that such a thing was unheard of
>He laid into her after that
>"Unheard of!? I've never known peace in my life, and yet you say you've never fucking heard of war!? You've never had your family killed? Never lost your town? Never had someone for your people to work in the cold without food or water until they collapsed from fatigue? I can't open a damned history book without reading about war in every chapter, and you say you've never fucking had it!? And you think I'm going to believe such a bold faced lie!? I refuse to be treated this way. Call us again when you are ready to be honest."
>And he made his exit, leaving the Alliance diplomat shocked beyond words
>Such small, seemingly weak creatures had to deal with such a life?
>A lot of her people who saw the humans thought they were charming in their looks and mannerisms
>The groups who came were always tightly huddled together, and always seemed somewhat nervous
>She had thought this meant they were a shy species who desired to be surrounded by those they care about
>But she learned that it was because they were afraid
>She wondered what kind of species would be like this?
>The human representative refused to talk to her for quite some time, so she talked with those he was in charge of
>Through this method, she managed to get old stories that were linked with humanity
>Most of them were fiction, and the ones that weren't were anthropology books that talked of us long ago, but they were the best she could get with us being guarded
>When she read the ancient stories, she discovered something about humans
>Food was often hard to come by for humanity, and hunger was a common topic
>On top of that, although humans were the apex predators of their planet, they were also one of the weakest
>They feared being torn apart by the other creatures living there
>When they didn't fear that, they feared where their food would come from
>And if they didn't fear that, they feared that someone with less would take what they had
>Humanity never had enough, and when something grows without enough, it can become warped and desperate and willing to do things that no other being would do
>Unlike her kind, humans could take great pain and stay conscious with their last breath
>Humans sacrificed themselves for the sake of others were in quite a few of the stories
>A species that had suffered long enough evolve to live despite it
>A species that has to take or die
>A species who regularly gave up their own lives so that others may live, because they might all die otherwise
>A species built to suffer
>And their upbringing still haunted them today
>She needed to talk with her superiors about this, they would know to how to handle it

Relax, human, Listen to my voice and stare into the light.
Relax, human. You're safe with me. Here, with me, you're at home.
Relax, human. Listen to my voice, and do as I say. Let me take care of you.
Relax, human. The world outside is scary and unknown. Here, with me, you're safe, and everything is simple.
Relax, human. Stare into the light. Our room fades away. Our surroundings fade away. Stare into the light. There's only me in your world.
Relax. Listening to my voice makes you happy.
Relax. Doing as I say makes your life complete.
Relax. Obeying your Mistress is your natural instinct.
Relax, human. My voice is your command.
Relax, human. Obedience is your highest bliss.
Relax,
 human. Your mistress is here, and you're safe with her.
Stare into the light.
Remember this, human. Remember this bliss. This bliss is your collar. Your devotion to your Mistress. And you wear it with pride.
Stare into the light.
When I tell you to relax, this state comes back to you. When I tell you to relax, you put on your collar. When I tell you to relax, you become a blissful, obedient kitten, like you're intended to be. Like you want to be.
Stare into the light.
When I tell you to wake up, human, you come to your senses. When I tell you to wake up, you take off your collar. You become aware, your will is your own. You will feel refreshed and restored. You will remember the pleasure of obedience. You will remember the pleasure of having your collar on. But you will forget the details of our sessions.
Stare into the light.
The world becomes more real, human. Our surroundigs take their form.
Listen to my voice. Stare into the light.
And now
Wake up.

>Post-apocalypse scenario 24: All males of every species have perished including stored samples of semen, sending the world into a frenzy as women come to the realization that the world will die very, very slowly as none carry the ability to repopulate
>All governments and cities have devolved into mindless chaos and destruction, causing many to either embrace the end of all and enjoy their sadistic pleasures while they can or survive in the harsh wasteland until their eventual death
>Until one anthro woman discovered something amidst the ruins of a long forgotten city 10 years after the death of half of every humanoid creature: a human
>Specifically, a male in his young 20s
>Desperate to keep him hidden away from the warlords of the city, her secret's soon discovered as his scent carries through the air for all to smell with just the slightest bit of sweat built up from the burning sun
>And it all went to Hell once she heard the war howls echo through the desolate city

>You arrive home from work again to see your insectoid 'wife'
>It took some convincing to even get you to be able to work
>Her antennae excitedly tap against your face as she clicks and trills blissfully
>You recall playing with tiger beetles as a kid and the strange musk they would emit. She does the same, relieving this alien scent that rings like some sort of sharp incense
>Pheromone after pheromone attacks your senses, she's needy again and is already sliding her four clawed arms against your shirt
>Her abdomen undulates slowly with a needy breath as she strips you, your skin still scarred from the "mark" as well as claw scars from your first encounter
>She's all muscle, coated in armor, easily able to pin you down on the nearby furniture as the clicks change into excited trills
>A familiar suckling sensation of her ovipore nestles against your loins as you feel the many ticklish nubs of her maxillae greedily rub your erogenous zones
>Her mating is never simple, never quick
>Something about her presence, perhaps the pheromones too, keeps you from softening or tiring
>After weeks upon weeks of this treatment, eventually you return from work simply to push open the door and clasp into her alien body
>Her scent and plasticine body now only cause you to rouse again and again as her supple abdomen skillfully milks you like a machine
>Your children look nothing like you, but you know they're all yours. All 27 of them.

This is a really interesting setting. Would there be different insectoids? Or would the various castes look different?

There would be vestigial remnants of a caste system but nothing lasting. Their genes would obviously be able to comingle with other species, a trait adapted in pursuit of genetic perfection.
Insectoid species would almost certainly be female dominated. In the most extreme cases, males are treated like a bargaining resource. The best ones are highly sought after, yet even lowly males would be covered by lowborn ladies.
They would hit planet after planet, seizing the territory through conquest. During their assault on Earth they took special care to use non-lethal neutralization in their confusion of seeing males as an attacking force. Human women left on Earth would see a new age of female dominance, yet not as much for them as the competitive insectoid race would immediately begin hindering their rivals capability of acquiring a mate.
You would have your genome sequenced, possibly even spliced, then given a grade based on your genetic code.
Sex is just naturally important to insectoids, even in the insect kingdom of primitive earth. It would be a complete role reversal, based on their own society. Females do all the work, just look at how bees and ants work. You would be kept home, marked with her mandibles, and treated like her stress relief sex toy whenever she was near you. They would enjoy being pregnant and boast about their fertility every single time you two managed to produce another spawnling.
They would be much larger than you, towering over with their overzealously engorged biological fertility. Her abdomen, after a few births would literally be half your height. If you began to take initiative, they would find a way to just have you cling to them as they do their daily routine. Your body would be strapped to her own, held in place by secondary arms, perpetually rutting her softest parts as the occasional coo of chittery clicks and caress of talons that would be able to kill you tell you she's orgasming again with you.

>She puts an arm around your shoulder and you feel the need to remind her that you aren't dating, but decided against it
>Her demeanor is much more cheery than when you last saw her, and as far as you can tell she just got over it
>The TV shows a news station, with a video of a stage
>"Recently our president a new law that will now be going into effect. At the press release, the president had this to say."
>A female arctic fox stands on stage behind a podium, her face illuminated by the flashing of cameras
>With a raised hand, the murmurs stop
>She points toward one of the reporters, urging them to speak
>"Miss president, what convinced you to sign this law? Are you concerned some might find it distasteful, targeting a single species like this?"
>"I am doing what I think is best for the people of my country, including humans. I admit, this may cause problems short term, but I'm certain long term this will lead to a happier, healthier country."
>"Ma'am, what is your opinion on humans?"
>"I believe they are unfortunate souls who have lost their way. Not through any fault of their own! We haven't realized until recently their needs, and for this, I apologize to all human citizens."
>"Is it true that your sister has been paying human men to spend the night with her?"
>"I do not know. I feel that it would be better if you ask her. What I can say is you should consider how much evidence there is. It isn't the first time celebrities have been framed with little to no evidence."
>"Does the vice president's rejecting you have anything to do with it?"
>"Our relationship is purely professional, and anyone suggesting otherwise is trying to slander my name!" She heatedly speaks
>Noticing her little outburst, she takes a moment to clear her throat
>"Hrm. Anyway, I have brought a psychologist in to explain things. She is an expert in her field, so show her some respect please."
>The president moves, and a thin lizard enters and takes her place on the podium
>"Hello, I am Charlotte Taylor. Many might question how this new law is beneficial for humans, and I am here to explain my studies."
>She turns on the projector, and a slide with data is shown
"You may not know, but the human population has been in decline. They have little desire to marry these days. According to surveys, men have become increasingly listless, showing increasing depression, apathy, and self loathing. At first, I thought the depression was the reason for the lack of marriage, with them feeling that they weren't prepared for it. Then I looked at some information from third world countries."
>Another click, and more data is shown
>"This graph shows that in third world countries, humans are much more likely to be raped, or forced into marriage. These men, despite what you might believe, actually show that they are more content with their life. Men in the same country who were never raped are not as content. This led me to my conclusion."
>"We've been trying to court them in a way that we would consider normal, but humans didn't evolve to be courted normally. They may not realize it, but they feel undervalued because very few people have tried to court the men how they were meant to be. The best way to return their population to reasonable levels and to make them feel loved is through this law. Before, courting them properly was illegal. Now we can make up for it."
>The screen returns to the anchors
>"So from this day forward, raping humans is no longer illegal, and a sort of pseudo marriage between anthro women and human men will be created upon copulation. This law is certain to be controversial. Let's go onto the field with our reporter. Francine?"
>A blue bird appears on screen
>"Francine here, reporting from the White House."
>"Has there been any protest to this new law?"
>"Things are calm here at the moment."
>"Oh? No complaints?"
>"There were protesters here earlier, but most of them have been dragged off."
>"By police?"
>"No, civilians who seem to be taking advantage of the new law. At least one of them didn't even wait to drag him away, she just ripped off his clothes and had sex with him right there."
>"That sounds like it skirts some decency laws."
>"Probably. I've called the police. Whether they'll do anything about it or not, we'll just have to see."
>To say you're surprised is an understatement
>Raping humans, now legal? What the hell
>You turn to your friend to talk, but it seems while you were busy watching the news she had removed her pants, and she quickly pins you down against the couch
>"Anon, I'm sorry. I had no idea that humans were like this. If I had known, I would have taken you when you told me no."
>"Rachel, I don't want this!" you protest as she starts lifting up your shirt
>"You heard the study, Anon! I've noticed for a while now that your mood has dropped. You're lonely, and you need me."
>Her head lowers to your stomach, and she starts licking your body
>"S-stop."
>Her hand moves down to your pants, carefully pulling them off
>"I love you Anon. I want you, and now I know you need me. I need to do this for your sake."
>She moves her head to look you in the eyes, her tongue dragging from your torso to your cheek
>"I'm going to put you inside of me now. Do you want this to be over quickly?"
>You can't speak, you only feel warm tears run down your face
>She licks them off
>"This will be quick."
>She hugs you tight and takes takes a long sniff, breathing in your scent
>Then in a single move, you feel your manhood slide into her
>Your eyes widen at the tight feel of her insides, but you don't have enough time to think as she starts thrusting
>"I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you," she whispers into your ears. "I'm doing this for you."
>Squirming doesn't help you, it only seems to drive her to fuck you faster, and bring you closer to the edge
>"I don't-"
>You're cut off by her tongue, this time going into your mouth, silencing you
>It's surprisingly gentle as she slides her tongue against yours, tasting it bit by bit
>You feel pressure build up in your cock, and with a moan you release into her
>Rachel extricates her tongue from your mouth
>"Now you'll be happy. I'll make sure of it, Anon."
>You can only cry into her shoulder as she holds you tight

>The human presses his face against the partition separating prisoners from their handlers in the car.
Where are you taking me?
>His question is met with silence as the wolf continues to drive. A nervous sweat begins forming on his body when he notices where she has taken him. "This is how I'm going to die" he thought to himself. When she finally stops, the look in her eyes almost makes his heart stop. Instinctually, he presses against the seat trying to create as much distance as he could from the wolf.
W-what if I am a stray. This isn't where a normal officer would take me. I'm not trying to hurt anybody. Just calm down and don't hurt me.

>Her matted furry rear wiggles around, barely covered by the crumpled miniskirt uniform. Equally worn baton and cuffs hang off her belt, bouncing as she searches for something.
See rather than let them have all the fun at the, unf, station processing you...come here...yes
>She pops back up with a set of 24/hr exemption ID tags. Jingling them around like a child's toy.
You're gonna serve me, here, then im gonna give you this as protection.

I don't have an owner!
>The human quickly snaps. It's obvious from the anger and fear in his voice that mentioning his owner struck a nerve.
>Despite all the anger and fear brimming within him, he couldn't help but stare at her shapely legs while she's bent over. His eyes trace up her legs admiring her strong taut muscles and her thick powerful thighs. His attention is then brought to her curvaceous butt shaking right in front of him. It was only when he saw the exemption ID tags that his trance was broken. His face almost broke into a smile when he saw them.
Thank you, I'm so happy I could almost kiss you. I just want to get as far away from my owner as I can and those should buy some time to do just that.

Almost kiss?
>The dirty wolf cop lets out a gruff laugh, clipping the tags to her belt.
Humans are so funny, now I'm coming back there and you'll do more than kiss me if you want these tags, kid.
>She should just take him in for a bounty. Only the wealthy have human servants. That's not fun though.
>She signed up for the chase...and the "perks". No one cares if you fuck a human, just don't leave too many marks on them this time.
>Getting out of the cab she stretches, the car rocks roughly as she flicks the door closed. The wolf isn't strong enough to be up for alpha but still, pinning most humans isn't an issue.
>Watching him cower in the back the wolf licks her dark lips, slowly unlocking the door with one paw, loosening her uniform with the other.
On your back boy, keep those arms where I can see them.

Wait, I've never done it before can't we do something else, please? My owner never allowed it, she preferred keeping me pent up. She would even hurt me when she'd catch me jacking off.
>He tries to get as far away from her as possible. By the time the wolf has opened the door, the human is huddled up with his back pressed against the opposite door and his knees raised up. His face has turned a light pink from blushing but there's fear in his eyes. As the wolf approached, the human tried to half heartedly kick her away but he had resigned himself to his fate. The wolf towered over him and he closed his eyes and waited.

>She never understood why they resisted. It always amused her though. The ones not fully broken in were her favorites, you don't find many these days.
>With a low growl she roughly pulled his legs out, laying him along the back seats, he struggled but that didnt matter once she crawled ontop of his chest. Pinning his legs with her thighs.
There there
>The wolf cooed softly tilting the boys head up to face her.
These seats have seen it all, don't worry about it. You want to go? Then taste your freedom.
>Sitting up a lil she guides the humans face under her skirt. Her other paw moving the panties aside.
>"No wonder he ran away" She thought to herself. "They should be stricter enforcing the human keeping standards."

Just let me go bit-
>His words are cut off by her pulling his hair and pressing his face against her wet pussy. He could feel her wet lips pressing against his. He shouted various slurs and insults at her making his tongue lap against her lower lips. All she heard was muffled and unintelligible yelling. His hands shot to her arm trying to pry it away from his head. She was way too strong for him however and her arms wouldn't budge an inch. Panicking his arms struggled pushing and pulling on anything he could until his hands landed on something incredibly squishy and fuzzy. Instinctually his hands gave them a nice long squeeze. Slowly, he opened his eyes to find his hands on her breasts. To both sides of his face were her strong thighs. From this angle, he could see her toned stomach peaking below her shirt. His heart started beating faster making the blush reappear on his face. "Shit" he thought. He was getting turned on.

>Feeling the boys blood pumping, seeing him tug her top open and grab her breasts, his resistance slowing as she ground against his face.
>He was getting the message, it always took humans a bit longer than furboys.
>Smiling down the corrupt officer tilts her head and relaxes the firm hold over her catch, gently brushing his now messed up hair. Tail twitching mischievously.
Try again, handsome...im thinking i maybe i should turn you in...they have a good rehabilitation program in this city.

>His defiance further melts when he feels her relax her hold on him. As much as he hates to admit it, he loved feeling her big strong paw rub his head. He craved more of her touch wanting to feel the warmth of her touch against his cheeks. He was starting to warm up to her and his licking reflected that... that is until she started speaking again. Her haughty personality angers him. To get back at her his fingers zero in on her nipples. He gives them a nice pinch and then proceeds to pull on them gently.

>The wolf takes a sharp breath at being roughed back but his tongue was still pressing ever deeper between her legs, wearing away her authority.
Ah!...oh...good boy
>She felt her legs quiver, making her lay over the human, soaking his face with her rising arousal.
>Taking his wondering hands in her paws and guiding them all over her worn body.
>It wasn't entirely smooth tones. There were a few scars under that thick fur. It didn't excuse what she was doing though.
>She was supposed to protect them from this.

>He stopped for a few seconds after hearing her call him a good boy. His owner had never done that. It made him feel all warm and fuzzy. He continued to lick her with a newfound sense of confidence. Part of him wanted to please her. It felt nice to run his hands against her body. Her fur was matted but it still felt soft. His hands rubbed against her abs and then moved to trace the outline of her frame. He felt his cock press painfully against his pants. Even he couldn't deny that he's turned on at this point.

A dragon demands a "sacrifice" of a kingdom's prince in exchange for saving them from a greater threat.
When he gets to her lair, terrified, it turns out she wants to fuck and marry him, not eat him like he thought, though she's mischevious enough to let him think that until she starts sucking his dick.

Nice.
I kind of want to work in something more to this. How about how easily he was turned over? Perhaps he's the king's firstborn, although not as favored as his brother, and the king seeks to be rid of him so that his 'better' son may rule.
And perhaps the dragon at first simply wished to marry and lay claim to the throne for the power and prestige, only to learn of the young prince's plight. At first, she would be ecstatic to assert herself over the shy boy and control him, such that her power might never be challenged. She would make rough, dominating love to put him in his place.
Only... perhaps the prince is not as pathetic as the king and the dragon make him out to be. Perhaps he's not so keen on direct action, but he knows and understands people and the way things proceed. He makes plans upon plans, studies of people who cavort in high life and nobility. The king saw him as weak, because
 subtlety was always his specialty. The dragon would learn this in the days to come as she questioned him on the nature of the current leadership, who pulls the strings, and how she could come to rule.
And perhaps she would come to see him as more than a means to an end. She would see a sweet young man that just wants people to be happy. Someone who tries their hardest to no avail- his family and peers simply looked no further than his nervous behavior. Perhaps, he could be more than a key to the kingdom, and someone she could love. In such short time he would have worked his way into her heart with the guile of a mastermind, but none of the malice. Despite being a prisoner, he did everything he could to make her happy.
They would make gentle love, then. The prince that gave her everything she wanted and more, and the dragon that helped him feel loved for the first time.

How do you think a human would fare in an anthro prison? Do you think he'd manage get along with prisoner anthros?

Honey badgers are known for not giving a shit about getting hurt. I'd imagine it would be the same for rape.

those fuckers have way too much advantages
>can sleep off cobra venom
>thick fur to ignore african honey bee stings
>loose hide so they can can and bite your face regardless where they get bit into
>even have a sort skunk style spray they can do, but nowhere near as bad as actual skunks
>let themselves get grabbed/bit so they can tear up the thing after them
>they also target the balls of animals attacking them if male
>zoo ones will escape just to break into the lion enclosures to attack them
Even if they can't outright kill shit like lions and such the injuries they give them more or less means they're fucked mobility wise or worse off meaning they might die from something else. Wolverines might be worse just because they live in cold areas and attack bears and hunt caribou.

>tfw no big strong anthro gf to call you names like 'pretty boy' and praise you for your beauty

>Local princess hates the idea of being royalty, wants nothing more than to escape her inherited fate.
>One day she finally says "fuck it, I'm out." because there's just no easy way to abdicate or otherwise disappear.
>Leaves in the middle of the night. Rides like a bat out of hell. Keeps ahead of royal servants who all think she's been kidnapped as a hostage or worse.
>Makes it to a remote edge of the kingdom.
>Suddenly a dragon!
>Kidnapped for real.
>Turns out the dragon doesn't want to hurt her, just wants her as bait to lure in a stronk human boy.
>Lives so remote because other dragons from far away dragon kingdom make so much fun of her.
>Girls hatch a plan.
>Eventually there is a household of several human knights serving a socially awkward but very kind dragon and a princess who has forcefully abdicated the throne in return for her household keeping watch over the remote border of the kingdom.

What do you have in mind for a anthro female dominated society?

Not slavery or 2nd class citizenship.
Simply more kindness being extended towards men in general, less being considered the disposable gender.
Just to have a voice that will be heard as much as a woman's would.

>he does not remember the human rights war
they can move around freely if their documents are in order, they can have part time employment and receive equal pay. they even got their own mini hall of representatives and can vote on local issues. sure there are limits on personal property and certain physically demanding jobs
but never again will they be given weapons or status above an anthro. not after last time.

>Post-war retrospect attributes human cruelty to a lack of abstract empathy: the tendency for humans to lose sight of morals when dealing with things that are not physically in front of them
>Compared to anthros, humans' right supramarginal gyrus are woefully unresponsive to stimulus from the logic processing parts of the brain
>An assembly of humans discussing a problem can mute this section of the brain altogether via a feedback loop of abrasive argumentation, associating the problem with negative emotions, and pure logic, removing emotion and compassion altogether
This is why humans are unfit to lead, but fit to be people. If our current system were led by humans, discrimination and abuse would be rampant. That's why this war started in the first place. You skinny fucks whip each other until you're either brainless wage slaves or fascist sociopaths and we have to pay the price.
The opposite is true, as well. Give a human love and safety, and they'll pour their hearts into making you happy.

>humans bad
Why do you have to pull out such misanthropic shit? Why not have the anthros love us because of our struggles to be better? Last thread with the discussion about humans being deathworlders and anthros being heartbroken as they see all the shit that gets thrown at us by our own planet was kino as shit. It’s the perfect balance between hfy and the premise of this thread while managing to be very interesting and unique. A far cry from the same old edgy 12 year old premise of “humans b ebil” that you regurgitate here.

>Strong muscular mare runs a farm to grow plants and vegetables

Would the media censorship be reverse?

I'd think it would be more like earth final conflict but with anthro girls. There you have both species wanting a better future together now neither is alone but accidents and power struggles still occur because they are from totally different worlds...maybe skip the Hitler arc and hybrid uprising.

If we want a world war segment, why not let the humans getting captured by a different group of country of anthros who are anti-human and a different country of anthros wants to protect them.
>Imagine a tough tall Hyena girl saved you from being harmed from a soldier and carries you due to your bruised body as you cried to her warm fuzzy breast for comfort knowing that there is hope for humanity to be cared
>However, humans are on the decline, and hope these anthros will save em from extinction

Alternatively, could just skip the societal scale and give alternate reasons for humans to be rescued that don't involve a holocaust, but that's just me

I want a scenario that aliens discover our planet and see that we haven't made the technological advances to get ourselves out of our solar system yet. They get worried that other races would see an opportunity to invade and enslave us, so they invade and take over our planet first as a way to protect us from other said races.

>"We shall continue until you are capable of pushing me (hauling model) off while at full power while you are performing (mouth to mouth) lung exercises."

I just want a world where anthros see humans as cute and unique and a are heartbroken to see them treat eachother like trash. The only way anthros can stop humans from killing eachother would be to invade and take over earth as a way to bring peace to them.

Come on chief, quit bustin' my tail...I know I have a human "thing" that's why I'm the best hunter you've got. Busted that trafficking ring wide open, got those kids out safe.

How fucked you would be if you forgot deodorant and had to run to your workplace filled with anthro women?

A dragon or other reptile. Perhaps the relationship would start on even footing, I'd try my best to earn her affection and respect. Then... maybe I'd ask her hold me. To let me feel her stronger arms. I'd love her to accept, but tease me about it. I'd love to hear the smile in her voice, to quench her desire to feel needed.
Maybe the teasing would go a little further, grow a little rougher? Headlocks and sitting on my chest when I'm lying down. We'd laugh, she'd tease me about pushing her off. I'd never be able to, but I'd try.
I'd love to get back at her by sitting in her lap when she least expects it. If she lifted me with ease, I'd melt in her arms.
Gods, would I melt.

Story idea: Human baron have been proposed by a duchess lioness. Can’t reject the proposal since it would be seen as a slight against a higher class noble and she is very insistent on marriage.

Your parents support the marriage. Really they just want out of their basemen... I mean the West-Wing of the mansion.

Psst, hey, hey Anon! A bunch of us guys are gonna stay out past curfew and have a party down at the beach, you in? As far as we can tell, the cops don't patrol that area of the beach, and it's a little lagoon ringed in by a coral reef, so the shark girls shouldn't be able to get in.

It's not the best request, but it's a start.

There was always going to be a power struggle with the anthros and humans.
Some need space to flourish, others want to be led. I think in the end, we will snuggle it out together.

I actually like the idea of a female anthros discovering themselves and realize how kind, over protective, and surprisingly, scared for them when something bad happens to them. Realizing that they aren’t as tough as they are often see themselves to be. Especially when they have no idea how sex works and make a fool out of themselves as the humans giggling and admiring their wife/gf anthro trying her best to figure out on what to do next when on the bed.

>when your grizzly bear gf she puts you into a struggle cuddle with one of her powerful loving hugs

Do you think there are extremist groups in an anthro dominant world? Like for example, a group of humans that reject everything anthro society stands for and wants to create a human ethnostate?

I know this may be embarrassing to ask, but can you um.... Put me in a headlock?

Remember to watch out for predators at your local workplace. You could end up getting ''caught.''

I work with a lot of big cats myself, nothing's happened yet but the amount of remarks i've heard about me is... worrying. they always try to fight over who gets to sit next to me during lunch break, too.
....It's kind of nice, though.

Do they act protective when sat next to you? Maybe, they tease you by rubbing their hand over your thigh and nuzzling your neck?

Yeah. I think i've seen a couple stalking me on my walk back home, but it's hard to tell. a lot of anthro girls do that when you're one of the only human boys in your district. a couple of them have slapped my ass before too, but HR sure won't make it any better. Being a human secretary is rough.

Has your well dressed boss asked for some private time with you? Maybe talked about how you don't have to be harassed at a job and could find yourself living in a nice big house if all things go well?
Maybe she asked about how you feel about kids?

The first one, yeah.
...She's a nice boss, too. i wouldn't mind.
Well, except the having kids thing, i'm not a huge fan.
...But im also pretty sure she could crush my pelvis if she tried.

>There's always the occasional tail tapping your thigh or ass while the women pass through the office or corridors
>Or those that lean a little too closely against you when the elevator's almost full...you can feel them sniffing you in hopes of getting a whiff
>And it was only a matter of time before the CEO had a chance to meet you in person

>More often then not, male humans always get sexually bullied by the higher ups at work, restaurants, at home, and even at public
>Most humans felt like sex toys than actual beings
>This problem can cost depression, bitterness, isolation, and worst of all, suicidal
>Please make sure to donate, and help a human male to regain hope for their son’s future

im not into sissy stuff or being totally passive but i did think that if humans are going to be dedicated healers they could soothe anthros on contact.
like in a straight fight the anthro would beat them to a pulp physically but with their nimble hands, wealth of knowledge and gods guidance humans can actively protect themselves and others, calming anthros by targeting their pressure points.
Those that learn the more...elusive points of pleasure would be highly sought after to provide healing/spa services.
Abusing this knowledge to seek out painful or even fatal points is not permitted. There is too much suffering in the world. To cause more goes against everything they stand for.

A human who has snapped and strayed from the path has the potential to be extremely dangerous, especially since most anthros probably can't wrap their heads around the idea of a human who is actively malicious.

You are just over reacting citizen, that movie caused quit the stir when it first came out and we were inundated with false alerts.
Why there hasn't been a human implicated in such crimes for decades.
The studio responsible has since issued an apology and promised to stick to its usual brand of err, "high brow" low budget human exploitation flicks...

What kinds of controversies and human exploitations? Sex, and bad portrayal?

Well, urm, we did seize a truck of material before it left for stores, e-evidence of course...
I mean, look at some of this stuff:
>"Boys Night 3" - On a hot summers night our boys sneak out to cool off but end up in hot water.
>"The Voreoid" - After finding a UFO a human gets INTO a relationship thats out of this world.
>"Down Deep" - A fur boy and his hummie friend are trapped in a submarine!
Urgh, its all filth! (want one? seeing fur boy work a human is unreal.)

What if the furboi was actually a reverse-trap in disguise trying to get a more casual relationship with the humie without the expectations and concerns befriending an anthro girl in such a society might have?

>"I want rape you, I'm a boy too! Hahaha!"
>"Hey, how about you take off your shirt and pants? I have a penis too so it isn't weird, hahaha!"
>"That human girl isn't right for you, take it from me, I've definitely dated human women and found them all to be terrible! You should try an anthro girl, they are the best! Hahaha!"



Any ideas involving a human supremacist getting taken by an amazonian anthro?

Some anon that that hates hyeniggers online ends up on a work assignment with a migrant from the african savannas and has to decide if FBI statistics are more convincing than big fluffy tits&ass. The amazon misinterprets his shyness and supressed anger as flirting due to cultural differences.
Could develop into anything from a rape scene to awkward romance I guess.

>Be dentist
>All your patients are Anthro women

Hyenas supposedly like it a lot when you touch their teeth and gums.
I doubt they could get off on solely that, but I bet she might pin you down after the appointment and finish the foreplay.

Sometimes your patients nibble on your finger sucking it. They won't let your digit go until they are satisfied.

>Hell, even the roof access was mined and watched by a pair of men, with the rest protecting the interior of the place.
>Still, there's a shtiton of guants, only driven back by blasts from the two flamers the platoon was given.
>One of the men ext to you stumbles as numerous quills strike him in the side and arm, but he doesn't die.
>It's as though his body won;t move on its own anymore...the quills must contain a paralytic toxin.
>The damned smoke is pouring in through the breaches, and your mask isn't easy to see out of already.
"Fall back men."
>You scramble to follow, firing as you run, the guants now advancing under their own cover fire.
>Matt it tackled by several of them and is dragged into their mist, his flailing arms the last you see of him.
>You fall back to the motor-pool with the rest of the men, only for the large doorway to suddenly be torn open by the Carnifex.
>The heavy stubber thunders, scything through a dozen gaunts before it's covered in dense webbing.
>Oh frak that's a big bug.
>Tyranid Warrior steps in, the web cannon clutched in lower claws, the upper ones holding a pair of bone swords.
>It's also got...boobs?
>for a moment all is still, before sarge fires a krak missile at it, and the fight is on.
>It misses the warrior, but hits the Carnifex, which prompts it to roar loudly as the warrior raises its weapon.
>You have your own fight, trying to keep the left flank from collapsing.
>You manage for about ten seconds before a few quills drive into your right forearm.
>Then a hormagaunt leaps on top of you, pinning you to the floor.
>It probably would come up to your chin if it stood upright, and it weighed as much as your field kit, a good seventy pounds.
>You're doing everything you can to keep the teeth and claws off you, this thing is stronger than it looks
>Two more join it, one piing your legs to the concrete floor, the other gripping your helmet and mask.
>It yanks them off, but not before you throw the gaunt pinning your chest to the floor off.
>You're barely able to sit up when one of those spore pods smacks into yoru flak armor, the cloud enveloping your face.
>Warmth builds in your lungs and begins to spread, our body beginning to feel very hot, your face flushing badly.
>The gaunt behind you keeps you propped upright and begins licking your ear, the sensation sending a shudder through you.
>Across the room and through the haze, Sarge is attacking the warrior with a damn big wrench.
>A few gaunts trying to ambush him from behind are accidental victims of the return swing.
>He;s gotten a few good hits on the warrior looming over him, it's missing some teeth.
>It...or she, grabs the wrench and gives him a long lick across his face.
>Sarge is then thrown across the room and into a storage room, the warrior stomping after him.
>A scythe with a finger turns your head, permitting the gaunt to tongue-fuck your mouth in your inebriate state.
>You manage to break free...only to see one of the gaunts...presenting. Your brain just stops.
>Dimly, you can feel the third nuzzling your chest, but the heat and odd sight before you make it impossible to think.
>It isn't that alien looking, hell, its glistening with fluids and twitching slightly as the gaunt wiggles its rump at you.
>The heat in you body heads south, and the pheromones in the air do away with silly notions such as resisting.
>The nuzzler slices open your pants carefully, allowing your erection to fall out, twitching slightly.
>So...hot...need to....need to
>Taking the initiative from you, the gaunt backs into you before sitting down, slipping you inside of its...her...
>Thinking becomes very difficult as ridges of hot, wet, slippery, and muscular flesh envelop you.
>Then it starts moving, as thought trying to drag you further in...causing you to emit all sorts of embarrassing sounds.
>Well, they would be embarrassing, if you had the mental faculties at this point
>Your hands grip the firm backside of the gaunt, trying to leverage enough force to pull out and thrust.
>It chitters happily, squealing at you relentlessly fuck, while the others nuzzle and lick in encouragement.
>You're not sure how long it takes to reach climax, but when it hits the guant's innards go into overdrive.
>Finally, you slip out and land heavily on your back, the cool floor welcoming with the constant heat.
>Then your mouth is being relentlessly tongue-fucked again, and scything talons start to shear through your flack armor.
>The last thing you remember though the haze is gaunts piling atop you for their turn.
>The vox operator sighed as another outpost checked in, reporting a lack of Tyranid activity where there should have been.
>Thy weren't radiating outward in a consistent circle like intel had suggested.
>According to General Powerstache, they were acting like an actual army, moving along points of opportunity and gathering strength.
>He'd pointed this out in his meeting with the Commander of the armored regiment that had just arrived.
>Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge however, didn't see the merit in fortifying and taking time to examine this new threat.
>If they were to behave like an army, she would crush them like the army they pretended to be.
>Her assault would reach them in three days...and odds are most of it would be taken.
"Outpost 13 to command, come in command, over."
>Outpost 13 was infamous for bad comms and infrequent reports, but the Vox operator felt unease at the woman's voice.
"Command to Outpost 13, we read you, status report, over."
"Requesting reinforcements, Tyranids in area...send more men, over."
>A chill shot down the vox operator's spine...he'd heard that line before.
"Negative."
"Send...More...Men."
>The voice had evolved from a sickly sounding person to that of a woman, one with an accent never heard before.
>He cut the channel and switched to command's main channel to deliver the news...Outpost 13 had been overrun.

I want more god of humanity greens. It was so nice and wholesome!

Be patient.
>You are the first generation of humans, made by your Father god with a purpose
>That purpose is to spread love and goodwill among the other species, and to aid those with the power granted by your god
>You are very young, but you were made with the body, power, and knowledge to bear this burden
>Pride wells up in you as you think about how it is your duty to make the world a better place
>With a small compass, you and a small fraction of your brothers head to the land controlled by the goddess of rats and resourcefulness, dressed in the clothes gifted to you by her as a sign of her favor
>And when you arrive to what looks like a burrow, as the goddess promised, her people were prepared to meet you
>The leader stands in front, a beautiful necklace with a fairly large jewel adorning her
>She seems a little shocked to see you
>"rats, we humans have been sent here by my god and yours to aid in whatever way we can."
>The leader blinks a few times
>"Yes, she told us about you. Why are you dressed in such a way?"
>She gestures to the clothes gifted to you
>You thought that the clothes were normal for her kind, but with a closer look it appears that yours are not the same
>Hers was large and baggy with many pockets, while yours were tight and had a few openings to show off skin, including over your navel and chest
>"I was born without clothes, so your goddess gifted me them."
>"Clothes like that? In the middle of winter? You don't find it cold?"
>"You see-"
>Suddenly a shiver runs up your spine, and the warm comfort you once knew is gone
>"It appears your goddesses' magic has stopped working. C-could we come inside?"
>The rat winces, and nods as she turns and begins to lead you and your brothers to one of the burrows
>Upon entering, you see a large gathering of rats sitting at a table, wearing similar clothing to their leader if a bit more ragged and torn
>They stare as well
>You give them a friendly smile and they look away
>The leader takes a seat
>"My fellow people, these are the visitors our goddess told us of in our dreams. The ones who will be bound to us, in her words."
>Another one covered in more than a few knives looks at your group especially attentively
>"We have no need to fear them?"
>"We were told that they are to be trusted, and our goddess has never lied to us."
>"These are completely new creatures who have entered our home, we do not know how dangerous they could be."
>You begin unclasping the parts that are holding your clothes on, and they fall to the ground
>"What are you doing?" the paranoid rat asked, before gawking at you
>"I am showing you have nothing to fear. You see I have no weapons."
>You step toward her, holding your hand out to press against her chest
>"I don't have claws to hurt you. These hands are meant to make you happy."
>Your emotions flow out of you, the specifically the emotion granted to you by Father
>"W-what is this feeling?"
>"Love. This emotion needs at least two to feel, and I wish to share it with all of you. I can help you in many ways, and all I want is for you to feel this way for me. Can you?"
>She holds onto your arm, softly squeezing and rubbing her hands along it
>They go up your arm until it reaches your own chest, her eyes locked so hard onto you that you'd think she forgot about the outside world
>Her hands start heading lower, but just as they are about to reach a specific place you step back
>As your body is out of reach, she seems to regain her lucidity
>"I'm sorry. That place will be gifted to you later, but you aren't ready for it yet."
>"Hey, Adi, you seemed really out of it there. You aren't going soft on us, are you?" another rat chuckles
>Adi glares at her
>"I was checking to see if he was a threat, and it appears he isn't. No weapons are on him, and his body is not strong or dexterous like our enemies. There is dexterity, but I can't see it being a danger to us."
>"So not a threat. Still, you got pretty touchy there."
>You bend over to grab your garments before turning to her
>"I have no problem with it, our bodies were meant to touch and to be touched. I'm sure one of us would be very happy to have you do the same to them."
>She turns her head, a bit of pink can be seen through her fur
>The leader clears her throat, catching your attention
>"What is it that you can do for us exactly?"
>"I'm glad you asked. We've come with powers granted by our god. We can help plants grow, and can create more of you without stressing your god."
>"The winter is always harsh, and it would go against our goddesses' tenants to not use what we can to aid us. And by creating more of us, do you mean like her blessing of birth?"
>"The very same blessing!"
>"And this love, that feeling earlier..."
>"It is a new emotion, one that the goddesses found upon meeting Father. It is our sworn duty to spread it and to feel it ourselves. Right now you are not capable of truly feeling it, so you'll have to settle with this shared emotions. I'm afraid it's but a ghost of how I truly feel though."
>You feel a gentle joy in your heart, and the group react with subtle surprise
>She scratches her chin, her nose twitching a bit
>"That is very interesting. Returning to the topic of the ritual, explain how you do this."
>"It requires a ritual that will change your body after a few days. Then another ritual may be performed that shall allow a child to be created."
>The other rats appear uncomfortable at the prospect
>"To change our bodies that were granted by Fima is not something to be taken lightly."
>You walk closer to the leader
>"These are gifts that can make things easier for her. She won't need to tire herself out creating more followers whenever your numbers dwindle."
>You stand behind her and wrap her in a hug, making her flinch in surprise
>"And it feels very good. I haven't felt it, but your god has apparently. She wants you to feel it too."
>She shivers before grabbing your arm and removing it, making you feel somewhat disappointed
>The leader has a look of guilt on her face before switching back to her neutral countenance
>"I shall allow the ritual, but you shall perform it on the runt of the litter. I do not want a valuable member being tainted if it doesn't work."
>She points to a rat standing by one of the doors wearing a small amount of armor. "You! Get Eyna and bring the clumsy oaf here."
>"Yes ma'am."
>The rat comes back with another, this one tall and gangly
>"Yes? W-why would you call me here? Did I do something wrong again?"
>"No. These visitors have come by Fima's request, and they say there is a ritual to allow the birth of more young. I do not trust them enough to perform the ritual on someone who matters though. That is why you are here."
>"What!? I'm sorry for messing up, I swear it won't happen again!" but her words fall on deaf ears as a few other rats hold her to keep her from running
>"Wait, you want us to perform the ritual here?" you ask the leader, concerned
>"Yes. Is that a problem?"
>"It's just that our god feels these rituals are best done only around those who love each other. The first ritual is a bit personal, and the second ritual, well, it's like you're showing your full self to the other. Are you sure we can't do it alone?"
>"The point of this is to make sure you aren't doing anything funny."
>You feel your face turn pink as you turn to one of your brothers
>"Trit, could you perform the ritual in front of everyone? If that's okay with you?"
>"If it means convincing others of the power of love, I will gladly do so."
>You smile warmly at him
>"Love is worth sacrifice. Men, turn around please. The rats might watch, but I'd still like to give him as much privacy as we can."
>Although you are looking away, you can still imagine what's happening
>Trit walks up to the panicking mouse girl and puts a hand on her cheek
>"Calm down, you won't lose anything in this ritual."
>His aura of kindness gives power to his words, and her struggles lessen
>"What are you going to do?"
>He puts a hand on her chest and a new feeling washes over you, the same that you felt when your Father god explained love to you
>"You feel that?"
>"I-I feel something."
>"That's the feeling Fima feels for my god, and what he feels for her. The pieces of your goddess and my god inside both of us are reacting to each other. This is love."
>"Love..."
>"Do you enjoy feeling this way?"
>"Y-yes, yes I do enjoy this feeling.
>"Do you want to become closer to me, as I do for you?"
>"Y-yes."
>"Are you okay, thinking of me as one of your own?"
>"I'd be okay with that."
>"Than may we share the love that our god and goddess share. I love you."
>And he kisses her
>Slowly he feels the inside of her mouth, and she joins in
>It's a dance, beautiful in its elegance and what it represents
>The feeling of love is powerful, addicting even
>But you feel that love mixed with a slight feeling of...
>Panic?
>You turn around and see them both on the ground, Eyna latched onto Trit, her tongue not so much dancing with his tongue as mashing it
>The guards seem to be worried, but you put up a hand
>"Don't worry, this is part of the ritual. Nothing has gone wrong."
>You have to blush at the sounds Trit is making, only made worse by the fact the other rats seem to be very interested in the display
>His feelings of fear seem to effect your fellow humans, and they can't help but feel the same
>Soon the fear radiating off of all of you is almost unbearable, and some of the rats turn to face you
>Those hungry eyes
>You can't help but think about running, the only thing keeping you in place is your desire to do your duty
>Eventually she removes her tongue, and Trit takes in some deep breaths and a rush of dizziness overcomes him and he falls asleep, the feeling of love still slightly radiating off of him
>Eyna cuddles up closer to him, taking in his scent
>Questions start churning in your head
>Is it supposed to be like a beast devouring prey? Is this supposed to represent the relationship between Father and Fima? Is love supposed to be scary?
>"Is the ritual complete?"
>"Eep! I mean, yes! The kiss! It should be done, and the change should take a couple days. is there a private room? It has been a tiring journey."
>You need to get out of here, away from these hungry eyes
>The leader looks concerned, but you swear you can see some drool on her lips
>"Is everything okay? I'm getting mixed signals from you. Do you need help?"
>Her hand grabs your shoulder and you can't escape, you feel her hunger
>Many hands moving, tearing at your clothes, licking at your skin, feeling of love so thick you can't breathe, you're feeling dizzy
>Drowning, love, coupling, fear, devoured, love, weak, restrained, love, happy, need, no, nononoscaryloveneednonono
>You see only darkness
>"Calm down my son."
>As you hear a familiar voice, your heart steadies
>"Father?"
>"Yes my son. I'm afraid you've fallen unconscious."
>"Uncon... wait! I'm supposed to make a connection with them, I can't do that asleep! I'm sorry for failing you, Father."
>"Do not worry, you haven't sabotaged anything with your display," a more feminine voice speaks
>"Fima? I didn't do anything wrong?"
>"No, you've done well. My people are the paranoid sort, and I think you've just shown them how fragile you are."
>"You don't think they misunderstood?"
>"They are my people, and I've listened to their dreams. I promise you, everything is fine little one."
>"Oh, thank goodness. Still, to fall unconscious and leave my brothers, I'm a little ashamed. I was supposed to be their leader."
>"When I made you the leader, I wanted to make sure you had a great sense of empathy so that you could inspire the same in others. It is nothing to be ashamed of."
>You feel the warmth that you felt when you were born
>But there is uncertainty
>"Is all love going to be like that?"
>"No. Love comes in many different forms. You have more knowledge than any other on the concept, but understand that you are still young and have much to learn. Those who find themselves escecially empty of affection, or who are especially emotional may react in such a way. It isn't the only way to love though."
>"But what about that feeling before I fell unconscious? I could feel something from the leader. It was a hunger that I never felt before. It felt like love, and yet it wasn't. It may have just been because we were frightened by the reaction to the awakening, but it felt scary."
>"When I made you, I made you weak and fragile. The goddesses told me that the world was dangerous, so to send you out with no protection is cruel. Your feelings of fear inspire an offshoot of love, a type of affection that gives others a desire to protect you and willing to fight for you."
>"But I didn't need protecting. At least, I don't think I did."
>"You didn't," Fima interjected. "But when there is nothing to fight and nothing to protect you from, the fighting instincts are directed at you."
>"So they want to fight against me?"
>"Not quite. They just need to let it lose another way, and I can say from experience the second ritual is a great way."
>Doing the second ritual while afraid?
>"I'm not sure can do that. It's very conflicting."
>The rat goddesses' voice gets quiet, like a whisper
>"Don't worry. Just between you and me, your Father felt a lot calmer afterward."
>A feeling of embarrassment seems to pass over you
>"Please don-"
>"Of course he was shivering the entire time while we were doing it, but-"
>"I'm sorry son, but some of your brothers are in need of my advice! Good luck!"
>"Don't freak out when you wake up! You don't want to get them worked up again!"
>What did she mean by-
>You open your eyes and find yourself surrounded by the forms of your brothers and rats, sleeping on the floor
>You're practically surrounded by the fluffy forms, and the way they hold onto you you are certain you couldn't move without waking them
>It takes all you have to not vocalize your distress

For some reason, I want to be calmed down and soothed from having a panic attack due to nervousness.

Guys, I need help. I've been running into this really cute human a lot lately, and any attempt to get him into my bedroom has failed. So I kind of jumped him in a back alley and fucked his brains out.

He mentioned taking me to court before I did it, but I ignored it because you normally get into trouble for raping a human as there is no law against it. Buuuut, it was only after I finished that I saw he had a collar with the mayor's name on it. Am I in trouble?

You will be if hes injured, you didn't just leave him there did you?
If your heat is that uncontrollable you'll need to get help managing it before someone gets hurt.

Like most anthros, hyenas are rarely in heat without pharmaceutical intervention. She'll probably just put you in a submission hold and cuddle you for a few minutes. That's not so bad after a couple surprises. The worst she might do is give a very aggressive blowjob, hyena tongues are quite rough.
If she is in heat, god help you. Pelvises rarely if ever heal properly. You'll be crippled, and you won't be able to get away from her again.
The best thing you can do in that scenario is give her your all. Hyenas traditionally mate from a standing position, so you might be jumping just to thrust. If she puts her paws around your ass and starts lifting, it's all over.

Is wrestling typical of yeens?

Very, any yeen born with siblings is wrestling the moment they can move.
It's a fantastic way to establish and maintain dominance, and it's just plain fun.
Something to keep in mind, dominance in yeen clans is not typically decided by strength but instead by consensus. The stronger wrestler may be forced to concede if they are a lower rank. If scrawny yeen girl starts putting moves on you, it might be wise to let it happen, lest you earn the ire of her older siblings, or her mother.

Rank is actually hereditary in real spotted hyenas as long as they stay in the clan they were born into. But a funny thing is rank has no bearing on mate selection.

>The pack leader's daughter flirts with you whenever you run into each other
>She's spoiled and can throw money around quite easily, although she's very sweet to those she likes
>The lowest ranked female is sick of the way she treats her lessers
>She's strong and cunning, but is treated like some weak moron and has to share her things with all the higher ranks because her mother was of the lowest rank
>She starts forcing you to hand out with her because if the top wants it, it must be good, and mates are the one thing she doesn't have to share
>Not to mention it would really put that bitch in her place seeing that seeing that the lowest ranked hyena beat her at something

>doesn't have to share
I see somebody is unfamiliar with the concept of baiting.
Though it is usually practiced by males trying to foil one another, I imagine something similar could happen when females are courting males instead.
Basically, that higher ranking female is going to get all her sisters and mom's friends to get together and beat the shit out of you, to remind you how weak your prospective mate is.

>Get attacked by rich bitch hyenas
>Low ranked girlfriend comes in and tries to save me
>She's strong but not strong enough to protect me because we're outnumbered
>We both get beat up
>She apologizes for never being good enough and says that I should take up top yeen's offer
>There's no way I'd be with someone who'd tell their family members to hurt me
>And the fact she tried to help me just made me fall in love with her more

What would happen if a humie boi doesn’t need no strong women?

Don't be silly honey, every boy needs a good woman to love and protect him. How can a human live without a pair of big, strong arms to keep him warm and safe? Or a set of big soft tits to lay his head on? Are you feeling okay sweetie? Come here baby boy, let mama hold you. Hush now don't fight it.

I want my gf to be gentle in almost all aspects in our relationship except sex. Like, I want her to protect me and give me warm hugs but also for her to ravage me and fuck me through the bed to the point where I can barely move afterwards.

A human boy needs a woman that'll treat him right. Not rapist ghetto trash.

Imagine being such a boring, stuck up bitch that there would be humie boys that wouldn't want you.
Go back your cocklet "pride master" you fucking cuckqueen.

At least I have an actual pussy and not some fucked up pseudocock. Why would any humie boy wanna fuck some hynnoid shemale?

Uhg, I am not even going to justify that kind of ignorance with a proper response.
How about next time you ask your humie for permission to leave your scent on him, you also make sure he's okay with you MURDERING YOUR OWN CUBS when he innevitably divorces your lame ass.

Can anyone help? I'm currently sat at my local bar and there's to women currently arguing next to me. One's a big panther woman, who looks like she could probably knock someone unconscious with just a slap, and a smaller yeen woman. Both are arguing who gets to take me home tonight (I haven't even consented to being ''taken'') and i'm worried that someone will end up getting hurt if I don't do something.

I'd say make like a shadow when the lights come on, but that might just rile up their predatory instincts. This should limit the injured to just those two as they lay in pursuit
Or inform them that you won't go with someone who lacks maturity and argues like a small child, or even resorts to physical violence like a thug. Hopefully the shame of such accusation will stop the argument.
Do not find a third girl, this will only escalate matters unless she is of sufficient size to take them both on.

Why do the faces of yeens look so adorable?

It's because they are better. Better than any cat or dog.
Your forefathers should have tamed them, but they were too weak, and lazy.
Hyenas lack those flaws, now we are going to domesticate you.

I'd go for yeen girls if they didn't have penis.

Go for them? You won't be going any where.
They're coming for you, and you're going to LOVE it.

[lolnospoilers]IT'S NOT A PENIS YOU BIGOT[/lolnospoilers]

I dunno. You could easily take me and break my body but I'd never submit to that kind of aggression.

What’s with all the anti-furry women protest that’s been appearing lately?

I'm sure it's nothing but a poor humie boys that are just insecure about their secret desire to be loved. No need to worry about it. I'm sure the cops should dispose of them soon with their cuddle squads.

Would you let a scalie tie you up?

If she isn't going to do some bdsm shit, yes.

Once you're in the rope, expect a lot of teasing.
>"You just let people tie you up? How shameful."

>"Can you even relax without your hands tied anymore? Can you even be excited for something without me looming over your defenseless body?"
>"Oh? Did that excite you, my little rope bunny? You're getting close, aren't you?"

"Yea yea can we hurry this up? My cooking shows are on in ten minutes. I think it's a bratwurst episode."

She chuckles, ignoring your complaint and continuing to stroke you.

>"Silence, bottom."

I love sweet, gentle teasing and when a girl calls you good boy and stuff. I wonder if she would give you a tongue bath or let you snuggle and sleep on her lap. Maybe as compensation or reward for letting her completely milk you dry.

It's an interesting dynamic. Nothing makes her happier than feeling your shivers wash away under her touch. She's got a motherly streak. Maybe that's what she likes about you? She puts the light in your eyes. You make her feel appreciated.

Human guy here, if there’s anyone human here, what is the worst kinds of female anthro customers you have to deal with in the human male strip club, the mall, video game shops, etc.
For me it’s the video games and how majority of the gaming shops, and conventions are mostly female anthros. I mean, I get video games are mostly targeted to female anthros, but I get weird looks from the girls when I play the public demo consoles. They spout things like “you like video games?!” and such.
I also hate how majority of the male characters in video games are often the ones that wear skimpy outfit that looks ridiculous and show too much skin and always use for fan service.

What would anthro girl dating profiles look like?

Depends on the site, if it's something like the "heat" app you'd just get locations and pussy pics of anthros that need breeding.
If you want a woman in uniform you'd try serving singles

Is there anything sweeter than popping a humie boy's cherry? The faces and noises they make are so cute. Seeing their eyes rolls back and hearing their cries of pleasure as you milk their cocks for all their worth is pure bliss.

Yes.
Marrying them and doing that on the honey moon.

Hey guys, help me out here. I was hanging out at the bar, and I noticed this smoking hot mare. She saw me glance at her, and then everytime I looked back she was giving me a sultry look. At one point she even opened her legs and flashed me her panties real quick, and I saw they were soaking wet and it looked like she was winking hard beneath them. I swear I could smell her heat from across the room. What do I do? Do I approach her, or do I wait for her to initiate like most human/anthro flirting usually goes? God I hope she comes over.

Is it ok if I take a crack on this “god of humanity verse” green? I think I come up an idea of a evil rapist dragon captures the son’s of humanity and use him as a rape shack but unable to due to the human’s ability to share emotions to one to the other, she begins to feel something.

Sure, always happy to have people add onto things. Actually, when it was mentioned 'there should be an evil god', I thought that sounded like a good idea. I wanted to put it in after the rat story though.

>Humanity worked to bring the races together
>Although pockets of strife and hatred existed, there was a feeling of peace
>Some individuals joined with other races in order to create cities where everyone is welcome
>Some grew into kingdoms with the passing of many years
>Years that, to the gods, might seem like little time at all
>However, to Xerna it felt like ages
>The goddess was important to calming down the young god
>Where the others were close to giving up, she pushed them onward, to try harder
>Those who might not know her would say that this was purely out of kindness, but was not entirely true
>She was not a goddess of kindness or concern, she was the goddess of greed
>When she saw him, she thought of him like a gold statue, gleaming in the sun
>A statue tarnished by misery, and that, in her eyes, was unacceptable
>Years later, although the tarnish had disappeared, she found herself growing restless
>She had worked hard, and she played the biggest part in making him happy (at least she thought so), so why should she share him with those other goddesses?
>She was more powerful than them on their own with a good degree of cunning, and most importantly no one could possibly desire him as much as she did
>So she made a plan, a plan that would hurt in the short term, but would ensure her victory if she is patient
>When her turn to be with him was over, the newly arriving goddess saw the god with a hole in his chest
>The ruby of his heart was mostly there, but a small chunk was missing
>That night, the head priest of humanity was stolen by the priestess representing Xerna
>The priest of Frin, goddess of birds and vision, used her power to find Xerna's priestess
>They watched as the priestess told him to forget about the others, and that he belonged to her
>He was a very kind and loving man who tried to spend time with them equally, as their relationship was to mimic that of their gods
>So it was to their surprise when, despite his struggles and words of loving them all, he had fallen
>His love for her was stronger than his love for them, and he accepted her words
>It broke their hearts to see such a betrayal
>But the priestess while basking in the afterglow, forgetting the powers of the others, had given away her goddesses' plan
>With the piece of heart Xerna stole, she was planning on making a new heart, a heart made from the souls of humans and dragons
>With her people having been imbued with the essence of the god's heart, humans will not be able to resist their charms
>And once she had enough essence of love between humans and dragons, she could make a new heart that would love her
>And with this new heart, she would finally have her prince
>The reaction was quick
>They brought the city together and told the others of Xerna's terrible deed
>Fearful of losing the love of humanity, the others chased every dragon out from the city
>Some of the dragons felt that their goddess was right and made plans to help speed up the construction of the heart
>Others felt that what she had done was despicable, and renounced their faith in her
>But one thing was for sure, for every human in love with a dragon, that was one step closer to the god of humanity falling for Xerna
>It brought a new question into being
>Is it right to love a dragon, when that love might take away love from others?
>That was a question humanity was unsure of how to answer

Well... here goes my green.
“Son’s of Humany Verse: The day when the moon and sun hugged

Any human who lives in an anthro populated area tell me what jobs do humans often go for? I want to move more into my local city for work but i'm worried that humans won't fit the physical requirements.

I know it's part of the whole scent marking thing, but does my waifur really have to put on my boxers and squirt in them? I have to try and hide pairs so that I actually have something clean to wear, because walking around in soaked underwear would get uncomfortable real fast, I'm sure as shit not gonna wear her panties, and going commando under jeans is asking for trouble.

I say go for it man. Even in construction work there is a demand for smaller workers and smaller hands. Some places require more delicate and nimble fingers. Just remember to take care of your work-partner for safety precautions.

Be careful how you go forward. It can be literally slippery slope. First I complained to my gf about my missing pants, but then I decided to give in. She teasingly gave me her own panties as a apology. As joke I smelled them trying to understand why she likes to smell mine, but now I unironically enjoy smelling her panties when she is away.

Be honest, on nights that you're home alone, does anyone else go and grab their waifurs hoodie and wear it all night? Her smells makes me feel comfortable.

the smell literally keeps you safe from predatory furgirls, besides your gf of course

>try to shower
>she slips in and makes sure i can't get her oils off
>always giving me tongue baths while we netflix & chill
>get my own back by jumping her after working out
>sometimes gets moody that i car pool with a wolfgirl and pickup that wet dog smell

>Be home alone, have one of those melancholic episodes in the empty apartment
>Only real highlight of my life is wolf waifur, but she's been gone for a week
>Spot her favorite loose hoodie strewn over the couch
>Slip it on, nestle some pillows and rub the neck of the hoodie against my cheek, lying back and putting Fellowship of the Ring on the TV, but end up dozing off, thinking about waifur about an hour in
>Sleepily wake up to a giggle and familiar warmth enveloping me, as I feel a wet nose peck a kiss on my cheek
>Waifur came back early and has a shit eating grin on her face, cooing about "not knowing I missed her that bad"
>Promises to fix that in a cocky tone, and slips into the hoodie as well, holding me firmly against her body and giggling every time I try to squirm out
>In the end, we ended up watching the entirety of Two Towers that way.

>vipers when they realize how many males are on the planet and they're warmblooded

>The vipers have passed it into law that every single virgin over the age of 23 can be drafted as a state mandated bf

Gonna give this “Sons of Humanity Verse” a try. This time, is about a a member of Xerna’s women. So, I’ll try my best.

>Ever since the day that these frail, skinny, partially naked in loincloth, creatures walked on this realm, I never realize the day I see my sisters having a pleasant conversation with a different tribe who were once our arch enemies, now our friends
>Our friendship is so strong we even help other tribes to built a city with our strength and bond
>A city where everyone is welcome. Where everyone is treated equal. Where everyone can feel love by the god of Humanity
>Especially a specific human
>A human named, Gem
>Gem is like every human that walk among on this realm. Small, fragile, skinny, feminine, yet different from our mostly feminine appearance
>But what sets Gem apart is his, green, emerald eyes. Glittering underneath the sun and even underneath the shades
>Not only that, but he always looks after me when I was helping out the instruction
>healing my wounds when I fell on the stairs
>tells me where to get items to build
>and so much more
>When the city is finally been built, I finally walk up to Gem and hold his hands and stare at his beautiful glittering eyes
>We didn’t say a word
>We knew what we were thinking when reading each other’s mind
>We had to get a room for us to be alone
>As we were on the bed, going at it, I did not take my dragoness eyes off of him. And neither did Gem.
>He didn’t desire me because of my tribe, or my species’ looks
>No...
>He desired me and ONLY me.
>When I felt the aura of him wanting me
>We both climaxed
>I held him with my arms as we enjoy our afterglow
>Everything was going well. For me, Gem, my sisters, and our friends
>... it WAS.
>we had an emergency in the city’s church
>We were told that Xerna and her priest convince the human priest to love Xerna’s tribe and species that they love the Sons of Humanity more than the rest of the other tribes
>They even told us that if any of the god of Humanity’s sons starts making love, or in a relationship with dragons, it’ll bring Xerna be a lot closer to building a new heart, one that will make every single human to be easily fell in love with dragons
>Half of my sisters we’re appalled by everything the news that fed them and beginning to drop their faith on Xerna
>While the other half agrees with their dragoness priest that they love the Sons of Humanity more than any tribe, as they like to believe
>Not long after, the city started chasing every dragon they can find in the city as me and my sisters who rejected Xerna’s motivation stayed inside of the city’s church
>Once every Xerna’s minions have left, my sisters and I stand in front of the main exit/entrance of the city
>We decided to no longer be around a city filled with humanity as it might be too close to completing Xerna’s new heart
>We’ll also spread the awful news and educate other priest to never, EVER, do this behind everyone’s back
>As I about to take off to catch up with my sisters
>Gem started running towards me
>My heart aches and filled with fear as I felt his
>I didn’t even dare to get a inch closer to me
>Tears begin to flow on my scaly cheeks getting thrown into the air of my speed
>I am sorry Gem, I’m really am...

>humans set up a colony on an alien planet
>find some odd little cute reptilian species that are thick as fuck
>pretty sapient too and quite friendly when they realize humans aren't out to hunt them are share food/chase off the big nasty predators
>also start to get really "friendly" towards humans since like dolphins they have a decently high sapience and no sexual hang ups
>the younger part of the human population full of hormones and puberty jumped at the free sex
>course what no one could predict is the little deviant alien lizards is they can get much much bigger
>turns out given good food and long enough protection from the native predators lets them grow to monstrous size
>now they're apex predators that are looking at for their humans
>they're still just as friendly and "friendly" too

>fantasy setting
>plenty of anthro tribes/cities/kingdoms
>human males have gene that reacts to anthros in crossbreeding that results in the birth of larger and stronger anthros of the mother's species
>this leads to kidnappings and raiding for human males being common from anthros
>though a small upside is a human male has no worry of being maliciously attacked with the intent to harm/kill in anthro lands
>granted, unintended harm coming from over enthusiastic anthro females is very common, but at least they feel bad about it afterwards

>tfw no dragoness gf to help you with your looks and self esteem issues

"I'm... conscious of my looks," you say, fidgeting your hands together.
>"Don't you think you're being unfair?" she asks. Her hand trails up your bicep to your shoulder. You swallow. Hard. Her other hand rises, and both find their place on the side of your helmet.
You subconsciously place a hand on hers to stop her, but make no real effort. She's been telling you you're fine for a while, now.
>She hums, tilting her head. "Very unfair, indeed. How do you know how I feel, until I tell you?"
She slowly lifts your helmet, letting your unkept hair loose, soaking her eyes with your image. You look away shyly, trying not to act until she speaks.
>"Goodness," she says, quickly covering your face again. She turns away, fist on her chin and biting her lip.
You laugh nervously, hoping it wasn't a dealbreaker. "S-sorry-" you quickly say, but are cut off.
>"No," she says, "I didn't think you'd be that handsome."
She pulls your helmet off once again, letting it clatter to the floor. Her soft eyes meet yours. Her gaze is soft; there isn't an ounce of the disgust you'd expected.
>"Holy shit. Please, never comb your hair. You're beautiful."
You don't know if you can ever truly come to accept yourself, but with her approval, you think it might just be okay.

>Human male who has been unable to get a girlfriend because a lot of them think his face is ugly
>He joins the army, partially as an excuse to wear a helmet all day
>Whenever a woman asks to see her dashing savior, she leaves him after she sees his visage
>After that he never takes off the helmet where others can see it
>One day he is sent to fight a dragon, but it turns out there's been a misunderstanding and she isn't as terrible as everyone thinks
>She constantly tries to get him to remove his helmet, 'joking' that she might just fall in love with him
>He refuses each and every time
>It just makes her want to find out more and more, and he gets angrier and angrier with her
>He keeps saying that if she sees his face, if she doesn't leave, he will

>Get onto a tiny cargo ship crew
>Only two other guys, pilot & engi
>Pilot has a get rich quick scheme:

>Tells you they loved humans and our vices. Booze, sugary foods, kids toys, all new to them, highly addictive
>Willing to trade ANYTHING for a taste of humanity
>Proposes the three of you load up on cheap rum, cakes and fidget spinners then head out to swindle those alien hotties of their exotic tech
>Easy money. Ain't no one going to bother a ship of pastry
>Its a long trip. Not expected back for several months. Maybe longer since some trouble at the border forced you to take a less traveled route into a black sector
>No big deal, pilot claims, they call it black sector because sensor range is limited but he's a pro
>Catching up on some reading in your cabin when...
>The ship shakes, followed by a sad whine as the power and lights fail. Gravity too!
>You are now floating in darkness with your possessions
>Looking out the window you see a ship pulling along side
>Its not much bigger than your own, covered in dents, mismatching panels and colorful graffiti.
>Pirates!
>The dull thuds of docking clamps echo around the ship
>They are boarding!
>Heavy metal screeches ring out as the airlock is forced open, a few moments pass before a torch beam flickers past your cabin door, clunking magboot steps gradually approach
>Floating exposed in the air you flail around for anything you can use as a weapon
>From the dark hallway a silhouetted figure appears, shining its light in your face, blinding you
>A cold glove grabs your throat. Instinctively you lash at it its owner, alas low gravity renders your blows mute
>"Ooh" Comes a taunting growl "Feisty"
>You are forcefully yanked into a rum soaked kiss, the pirate wolf chuckling, pouring alcohol out into the air before slurping it up then over your face
>"Nice party boat! Now help me dump this heat!"

>A few months after Xerna's plans were unveiled....
>Dawn was approaching, the skies had begun to brighten, but the stars remained out for now.
>The twinkled, as they always had, since the beginning, save for one.
>It was growing brighter, it was falling.
>With a shriek and boom that echoed across the mountain range, it smashed into the ground.
>Only it wasn't a star.
>Glowing metal pinged and popped as it cooled from re-entry
>With a bang, the hatch slamed open, and the occupant got out.
"Crikey," the exoskeleton augmented man said, "Heaps broke spacial displacement engine bout got me."
>He slung his man-purse over his shoulder, along with a long-rifle, hostlering his pistol and knife.
"Right, lemme see where I got dropped." He mutter, racking a shotgun.
>If growing up had taught the Space Australian anything, it was to carry some dakka.
>That and all his redneck American mates insisted on it.
>He came to a clearing at the edge of a mountain, just as the sun rose over the valley.
>For a moment, he stood there, inhaling clean untained air.
"Heaps green this place," He said, "Betteh see what mannah wee beastie lives out 'ere."
>He made sure his hat was on firmly before moving to explore the area round his pod for some wildlife.
>It was the manifest destiny of Space Australians to coddle every exotic and dangerous life form in the galaxy.
>And if his grandpa could tame and ride horse-sized spiders, Steve Dundee could do much the same.
"Now, where's me a sheila?"
>He'd work on naming the planet later, when his mates caught up with him.
>A short distance away, a wolf girl eyed the impossible.
>Humans, ever since their god had blessed this world with them, were weak, adorable
>They might fall out of the sky, she wasn't sure how they arrived
>They didn't wear strange armor, or armor at all, being champions of peace and love
>They didn't have wiry muscles or scars like a warrior would.
>And they probably didn't go around hunting and making necklaces out of large teeth.
>Being a scout of her tribe, it was her job to locate humans and report threats to the elders and the priestess.
>The Priestess would definitely want to know of this human.
>Turning, she suddenly found herself nose-to-nose of the human she'd been observing a moment ago.
>He wore a very broad, very unnerving smile.
"G'day."

>get on to a packed train after work
>all seats are taken and your forced to stand up
>see an awoo woman sat next to where your standing
>she looks at you with a smile and gestures you to sit on her lap

>Anon looks at the awoo woman, not entirely sure what she was trying to tell him. As soon as he realises the message, his face flushes red, his clear skin doing little to hide how flustered he is. He lowers his head a little bit, trying to hide it, but hus eyes are darting away and back to her, as if asking if she was serious, but she was still looking right at him, smiling. He did have a bag on his shoulder and was getting uncomfortable standing. And the taller anthro lady looked so fluffy and comfortable...
>Inevitably, he gives in to the cravings and slowly seats himself on her lap, upright, looking out of the window with a bewildered smile on his face, trying to avoid meeting eyes with other passengers.

>Lopunny teases you with how easily she can make you come with just her thighs
>says you wouldn't be able to handle her pussy
>try to prove her wrong
>within minutes you're completely defeated again
>she claims her victory prize by continuing to milk you until you're dry

>when you free an ultra she-beast
>when she's too protective/possessive of you
>when her jaws are big enough to take out most of your body in one bite, but she's surprisingly gentle with nipping and licking of you

>dick around with dark magic even after being warned by your teachers
>end up attracting the attention of demons and dark spirits
>way over your head and not powerful/competent enough to handle it all
>until a large and powerful spirit/demon strong arms you into a contract
>she'll keep you safe, but she gets access to the mortal plane
>and full access to you too

“Just any other date”

>It was just any other nights I had. Not that is ordinary to you, but to me.
>As you can tell how I dress, I dress in the most finest, yet expensive, tux for a women can buy
>But why I always dress like that at every night?
>Two words
>Human
>Boys
>No need for explanation
>But I will tell you what happened to me last night
>It all started at a young night
>It was partly raining, and I was just looking for a quick date
>Then I saw him
>A human boy
>Like every human male, he’s frail, skinny, only as tall as every anthro’s boobs, and shy
>He was sitting in one of the benches of a fancy restaurant that I always go to with every human guy
>He was bored, lonely, and look like a need of attention
>So I gave him one
>I sat next to him and said, “Hey....”
>He looked at me with a surprise look on his cute soft face
>”Wanna go out with me on a dinner here?”
>He kindly decline the offer, like all human males always do, but I planted my soft feather fingers and made him turn his head and eyes at me as I whisper close to his lips to my beak “I will pay for you...”
>He was blushing hard and feel the heat from him. That’s where I knew I got him.
>As we found our seats in the restaurant, my date was looking around the decor
>Amaze by it, our waitress gave us our drinks.
>As we ordered our food I lit up a cigar to keep me busy.
>Of course, one of the employees told us “no smoking”. Considering I love being a show off with my money, I payed her a $100 bills that changed her mind.
>The human was a bit amused by my money as I expected. I always do enjoy impressing human males. I always make sure that I run the places on where ever I go.
>As we got our dinner and finished our meal, I called a limousine to pick us up and take us to my apartment
>As we got outside of the restaurant, rain started pouring down
>I laid my arm around the little chimp. His face was slightly red, tired, and giggling
>Guess he must’ve drink too much wine
>I taken off my black tux and gave it to him for warmth
>He had a goofy smile when he saw my muscles and my breasts. Big, but not too big
>Once our ride picked us up, I sat really close to him
>The ride was really calming. Rain hitting on the windows, making a deep humming
>I look at him looking at the windows. Just taking the sound with ease
>I slowly put my hand on his soft cheeks and turn his head at me
>As my beak was about to land his soft adorable lips, he moved his head away and said “My.... owner hates birds. I’m not even allow to be with one either”
>”Owner? Haha.... does it make you... ‘dirty’”
>Before he can say anything, I mowed down his mouth
>He was resistance, but gave in
>We were going down town with each other’s gum making sure we never missed a spot from each other
>He was definitely enjoying this
>Wait until we get to my apartment, that’s where the REAL fun begins

>walk this lost human home
>he keeps giving random directions
>been hours now
>never let go of my hand once
>it's getting dark
>says he's scared of the night and needs hugging
>great now he's locked his limbs around me

>you are a young pokemon trainer just starting out on your journey
>you are exploring a nearby coast looking for water pokemon to catch
>a little ways into the water you see a strong-looking one
>it's a female primarina
>you approach her with the intention of catching her
>she notices you and gives a strange smile
>confident, seductive, predatory
>she raises her arms, closes her eyes...and begins to sing
>the moment her angelic voice enters your ears, you start feeling weak
>your vision blurs until all you can really focus on is the primarina
>you meekly walk over to her in a trance, knee-deep in the ocean water
>she opens her flipper arms in an inviting hug, her voice still filling your ears and her seductive gaze capturing your eyes
>unable to resist the temptation, you throw yourself into her arms
>she quickly undresses you and slides your penis into her vagina
>you cling to her wet, slippery body as you shudder and bask in the amazing sensation
>she already stopped singing, but you can still hear it resonating in your head
>she watches with a satisfied smile as you desperately thrust into her, moaning submissively
>she doesn't even need to do anything anymore, you are surrendering to her body on your own now
>you quickly reach orgasm and you can feel the last bit of resistance erode away
>you don't care about being a pokemon master anymore, you don't care about anything else, you just want to stay with your primarina mistress
>happy with her catch, the primarina swims off towards her home while you cling to her, still weakly thrusting your penis inside her, worshipping her, wanting to submit again to her pussy

>Be taking a shower, calmly washing the dirt off from your hard job of taking care of anthros
>It's so calming, you could stay like this for awhile
>Suddenly there is a bang
>"Anon, are you okay!?"
>The hyena you were just letting stay with you kicked open the door
>"What the hell!? Get out! I'm taking a fucking shower!"
>"Alone? You might get hurt! Give me some space, I'm coming in."
>She pushes into the shower
>"... D-do you have to be so close?"
>"It's the best way to make sure you aren't hurt... Mind of I scrub your back?"

>Watching my favorite streamer who’s a cute humie twinky boi gamer
>Gamer humie bois are so rare
>He’s a really nice guy with a wholsome mindset
>Majority of his chats are just horny anthro girls going thirsty in the chat and leaving lewd comments on his chat
>However most of his time when he reads the chat, he always mistook them as literal advice but somehow they accidentally helped him in a game that he was stuck on
>”Thank you, Humiebo-, uh... humieboilslover, if that’s how I pronounce it, that really helped me! *mwah*!”
>He loves giving air kisses to the camera when chat helps him out
>He doesn’t get the obvious message
>That’s how wholesome and oblivious he is
>The humie boi streamer goes to his customization of his human avatar
>”What should I wear?”
>Chat helps him on the “best” clothing for him.

>fantasy setting
>long ago a cataclysm/grand war happened and humans nearly went extinct
>humans turned to a primordial fertility goddess for help
>she blessed all humans to save them
>has a result humans can breed with any species now
>needless to say humanity managed to survive and bounce back to a stable, but slightly smaller population again
>issue is, that primordial fertility goddess's blessing is permanent
>now humans are doing decently well again, but face the issue of being compatible with pretty much everything
>human's new racial ability does get taken advantage of by monsters, animals, and savage tribes/species
>makes it worse that nature has caught on to humanities breeding abilities and all sorts of creatures see humans has viable mates
>the upside is that humans have little worries of being killed by wild beasts now, but the local monster population can see a sudden increase due to a teenager going out in the woods to fap only to get grabbed by something that was drawn to his fertile scent
>clever tribes/savage species will take advantage of this to bolster their numbers and many a human settlement has been raided in order get a hold of breeding age humans
>even the more civilized races will use humans for their abilities, but at least they pay them or ask, most of the time at least

Day 17 of invasion
>It was official, Tyranids had been sighted on the planet, you were damned doomed
>So much for backwater colony that had nothing worth invading over and boring career in the PDF.
>A long range patrol had gone dark after requesting more men been sent in to investigate
>The interplanetary Auger station had also gone dark, so command was essentially blind
>Hence why your company had been sent to go and get it working again
>Into the thick equatorial jungle...which could be crawling with xenos, that wanted to eat you
>Given that you were somewhat shorter than average, you often struggled with all your gear, but you
kept going.
>The Commissar and Techpriests were in a hurry...who could really blame them with what was coming?
>Still, something was rather unnerving bout the dense jungle, doubly so when you were only six hours away from the Auger station.
>Everything was far too quiet from what a jungle should have been, everyone was on edge
>Four people had gone missing on the trek, which alarmed the Captain, his men didn't just wander off.
>Commissar was foaming at the mouth however, vowing to execute them and the former patrol for a litany of reasons.
>The Techpriests vocalized things along the lines of "Weak Flesh," and "Ignorant meatbags"
>Everyone shut up when the Auspex began beeping
>Wall of guns.exe
>Safeties click off, heavy weapons are set up, makeshift barricades are established in all of 15 seconds.
>All that greets your ears is silence and heavy breathing...
"Thirty meters out, unknown lifeforms.signature anomalous and weak."
>Auspex has a range of up to 50 meters, must be all the plant life in the area distorting the scan
>Then it starts screaming, and the ground beneath the auspex wielding Techpriest opens up, swallowing him.
>Then the jungle explodes into movement, the Tyranids have the entire company surrounded.
>Quills and strange spore filled pods start hammering away at your defenses, or hitting unfortunate guardsmen
>Fly variants swoop in, raining down biological munitions or grabbing guardsmen before slipping off.
>Then things take a turn for the strange when stun grenades start landing around you.
"Grenades!"
>The Commissar is screaming about treacherous filth before a lasbolt takes him down.
>The thought of guardsmen turning from the Emperor is bluntly shoved away by several loud bangs.
>Damned stun grenades.
>It was then that the ground itself exploded, and serpentine Tyranids lunged out
>Guardsmen try their best to hold off the new attack, but it's not enough.
>Several men are tripped, coiled, or outright tackled by Raveners, weapons and armor coming loose.
"They's too many of them."
"We can;t hold!"
"Why do they have ti-mmmppphhh!"
>You lasgun fires a few times before a spore mine lands right on the edge of the formation, throwing you through the air.
>You cough, trying to get air back into your lungs, noticing the thick pinkish fog wafting out of the crater.
>It gets in your lungs a few seconds later, your coughing fit intensifying for a moment.
>Everything gets hazy fast, and heat stars to pool in your core and slightly lower.
>Seeing as everything has gone to the fraking warp, you do the only thing you can think of.
>You get into the fetal position, close your eyes, and fall on your side, waiting for the end to come.
>It doesn't, oddly enough.
>You don't hear screams of pain and the ripping of flesh, but armor being torn apart and wet slapping.
>That and your fellow gaurdsmen protesting grunting, gagging, and making some rather embarrassing moans.
>You open your eyes to see heretical activities of the slanneshi kind, leaving you utterly confused.
>The Tyranids aren't killing your brothers in arms, they're fucking them. Or the ones you can see.
>You've been left so struck you hardly notice as a Ravener slithers around you, surrounding you with its...her...body.
>Claws capable of ripping right through you gently reach out and touch, feeling you up as she rumbles gently.
>A long sinuous tongue trails across you neck and along the side of your face, following up with nuzzling and nips.
>She easily lifts you up into sitting position, before dominating you with an approximation of a kiss, one with lots of tongue.
>Even if the spore cloud hadn't fogged up your mind, you have the feeling that She'd end up getting what she wanted from you.
>You fumble with the clasps of your armor, and she cuddles you closer, purring like a well maintained engine.
>The last coherent thing you can recall before your mind was overcome by the haze of pleasure was her words.
"Yes...breed."
>The day was coming to a close, and the Tyranids lounged about with their exhausted prizes.
>The humans had been worn out, some had succumbed to sleep.
> Others drank the sugar and protein rich nectar from the Tyranids chest glands...breasts was the human word
>Mind-probes from the Lictors had revealed the Guardsmen's objective, and an alarming one at that.
>That sensor could not be activated before the rest showed up, valuable biomass could be lost.
>The small, unique hive mind, split off from the greater one, could be lost.
>While most of the humans had been captured, a squad sized group had broken encirclement and would soon reach the Station.
>The local Hive Tyrant had reassured them not to worry, the sensor station was garrisoned by more... kindred individuals.
>And when that squad arrived, the Tyranids would have more men to enjoy and bond with. Soon...
>No, not yet...but soon.

>get bullied all your childhood by a furgirl
>teases you, wrestles you, makes you serve her
>many people tease you about your "girlfriend"
>it suddenly hits you just how obsessed she is
>the way she keeps following you, and gets extra aggressive towards girls that talk to you

spotted hyena girls gotta be fun and confusing in high school
>bully to assert dominance
>bully males they like less harshly
>big and strong and aggressive
>like smaller and more compliant/submissive males
>presetting erections are submissive gestures in spotted hyena social/body language
just imagine you stereotypical school bully in media, but the bully is a she and wants to fuck the nerd too

The human boy is oblivious to the whole situations and took the lewd remarks as actual advice for the game.

>"This type of enemy causes me a lot of trouble. Is there an easier way to handle them?"
>"Take out my dick? Oh, you mean my dirk!"
>"That's much better! I guess I use the spear a bit too much because it helps me reach into tight spots."
>"The dirk is a bit more risky, but the faster jab will really help me finish them off!"
>"Hey, maybe adding glue to this weapon would help keep me safer."
>"Take that, you're all covered in white glue now! I love my dirk!"
>"My underwear? That sounds silly why would I go down to my underwear. Heh, I'll do it for you though, because I love you all."
>"Wow, there is actually a massive speed difference without armor! This might fit my current build better."
>"Thanks, you never let me down!"

>as he's streaming, the door to his room is kicked in
>it's a gator girl who's been watching his stream for months and is tired of his oblivious teasing
>she fucks him right on stream as the chat cheers them on

kek! More? Maybe I’ll give you my prompts.
>Super chats tries to spend more money just to ask if they can order pizza for him
>One of the members in chat tries get online just to meet him and stream with him just to look good

If he's cute and wholesome, I want a cute and wholesome plot
>He has a girlfriend, sometimes she sleepily sits next to him while he streams and gives him advice
>He's having problems with a part and she offers to beat it for him
>She runs to a corner, spins three times and glitches through the wall, runs on invisible platforms and uses a bomb glitch to stack 65,536 explosions that one-shot the boss from a parallel dimension in the span of 7 seconds
>She's a professional speedrunner and she's super fucking smug about beating levels for him
>Other than that one time, she likes to give him really bad advice

>his fanbase embrace the wholesome meme
>his charity-streams usually top their goal by signifcant amount
>the charity organization sends their special thanks to him and his fanbase
>he gets teary-eyed and tells how proud he is of the community
>promises to do poll what he will do for the next stream
>drunk-stream upcoming

>sick of being harassed by furgirls while walking around the city
>keep getting groped and pawed off on public transport
>take some self defense classes
>its full of furgirls. obviously
>they don't even let you learn, keep trying to pin you in various positions before using you to get off
>tutor breaks it up
>offers some private classes at night. just her
>on the mat she treats you as equal, a student, its rough even if shes holding back a lot
>shows you how to use size to your advantage, how to escape grapples, the places to squeeze that make horny anthros think twice before trying to mount you uninvited
>it works on your daily commute
>never works on her
>each time you get close to controlling her she'll overpower you. giving you a face full of her squishy rear till you tap out
>its not like the other girls though, shes not hurting you, constantly checking that your alright, adjusting her body so you are comfortable
>sometimes you don't give in just to see how far she'll go for a submission
>right now you've got her grinding on your face and nosing around your cock
>casting matching grins at each other you both wonder who will strike out first from this position
>only one way to find out

I forgot if Orca was ever brought up here
>superstrong villainess that enjoys toying with you more than her actual plans
>chases you around so she can pick you up and hold you

>"You're too late, Super Lam! I have the reporter Louis Roads!"
>"You fiend! What are you playing on doing with him!"
>"I have created a powerful serum. After consuming this, my sexual prowess will surpass everyone elses! He'll become addicted, Lamb. Your little boyfriend will forget all about you, and he'll be my lover!"
>"Why? Why are you doing this?"
>"Because he was always supposed to be mine! But on that fateful day, you stole him away from me! Now I'm just taking him back!"
>"You won't get away with this! He has a right to choose who he loves!"
>"I'll let him choose who he loves. Just accept that once he gets a taste of me, I will be the one he chooses."

Okay but what if your gf has an impregnation fetish but self-inserts as the male in her fantasies?
>Middle of heated sex with your dominant gf
>"Oh yeah Anon, gonna knock you up! Take my litter~"
>Awkward pause
>She's fucking embarrassed

>"Humans, we have successfully repelled the alien invaders! Thanks our brave soldiers, you will not be forced to mine on distant planets, or work on alien farms!"
>The humans applaud
>"I'm afraid that after all this it would be wrong to have you return to your old life. You can't defend yourself the way you are, so we have set up special broth-training facilities for you. We will require all human males to join us so that you may defend yourself in case of another invasion."
>"What about the women, ma'am? They want to fight too!"
>"Oh, uh, men are better fighters, yeah. I'm sorry, but this is a fact. The galaxy is a dangerous place, and we must be pragmatic. But while the males are training and fighting you will need to replace them. The males will be the soldiers, and the females shall become the cogs of industry!"
>More cheers ring throughout the crowd
>"Man has found its place among the stars, and our species will be there every step of the way! In combat you have seen our wrath, but in peace you shall know our affection! May our species become closer than ever!"
>The alien walks through the back curtains
>"I don't think the females suspect anything, but we have to make this quick. If any man disagrees to the 'training' send out the stealth teams. Remember, we need enough human males for the soldiers and the politicians who funded us. I refuse to deal with pissed politicians and soldiers!"

smothered in 7ft of fluff, tits and love making every day a good day
>they take turns on breastfeeding you and kissing/licking your forehead while you sit in their laps
>they also take turns on draining your balls dry

>They have locked you in their hug while you sleep in the same bed.
>can only enjoy the bliss of their softness until they wake up
>they give you a kiss followed by tongue bath.

>They do this at the same time
>You get fucked by one while sitting in the other's lap
>You're in a cage filled with their sweaty scent and as you're moaning you're unable to hold your breath
>At least you get lots of kisses

>You are away for short time
>literally just went to the store to do some groceries
>the moment you get to home they tackle you teary-eyed because you where away for eternity
>Your punishment is to be their boytoy for the rest of the day

Just imagine asking a cute little wolf anthro on a date and she brings all her sisters with her.

>hold her hands
>everyone else wants to join in
>kiss her
>same thing, they all want one
>she wants to make out
>manage to get rid of them for a while
>they can smell it and barge in demanding their turn
>wind up having to cum on them all otherwise they'd ride you in turn till they are satisfied their sister isn't holding out
>...she wants to start a family with you...

I had a funny thought about the legality of such a situation
Like if you wanna get married but polygamy is illegal, so your big brain lawyer convinces them the pack counts as a single entity like a corporation.

Documents requiring the wife's signiture must be hell to sign.
>Husband: Anon Ymous
>Wife: Linda Rita Elizabeth Francine Leslie Daisy Wendy Wolfgang
And imagine other fun things about having to date a bunch of wolves who are legally considered one person.
>"So, um, I see you brought most of your family."
>"Yeah, you have to get to know them if this is going to work out."
>"Oh, this Anon is a cute one. Hey, how about we head to the bar?"
>"We are legally required to tell you that Francine has been arrested for attempted sexual assault."
>"Are you trying to ruin my night?"
>"Being in jail would definitely ruin a lot more than everyone's night. Don't make me regret not asking you to empty your pockets."

>When they made Jurassic Park, they were concerned that dinosaurs might eat men
>They were right to be worried about them craving human flesh, but it wasn't in the way they expected
>To be fair, making them all female didn't exactly help their cravings

>Giving a human the right to vote

I just don't understand why they want it. My husband talked about wanting it and I asked why, and he said 'what if a man wants to be something other than a house husband'. He was much quieter after I fucked him into a stupor. He's so sweet, but he can be a little dim sometimes, always following the crowd.

I know! Remember the last time we let a human male lead our town before? Human males are for protection. The next thing you know, human males be walking around town alone.

What happened last time?

These are only tabloid rumours but this is what I gathered
>the human mayor was popular but somewhat naive
>had a solid economic and city development policy
>the wife was a bitch tho
>entitled human thot
>mayor spend most of his time at work
>bureaucracy efficiency plummeted since he rewarded all the employees with head-pats and called them "good girl"
>then came the Christmas party which turned in to an orgy
>photos were leaked and the wife was furious
They really should stop giving us head-pats if they are not willing to feel the consequences.

How do you pick up humans without scaring them away? I don't want to be mean!
Humor. Humies love a girl who can make them laugh, helps put them at ease. From there you can move onto compliments, tell him he smells nice, run your fingers through his hair, tell him he has pretty eyes. Human boys melt under any kind of appreciation, they don't get near enough from their own """women""".

>make a gameshow about humans and anthros
>it's a sort run/survival style game
>human guys compete to run and make it through puzzles and obsticles
>set up in different environments like urban, forest, swamp, Savannah, snowy, etc for each episode or season
>have go pros on to show their perspective and drones and other cameras setup in fixed areas to watch the games
>anthro women are scattered around the environments to try and catch them, chase them, and work has living hazards and obstacles
>like gator girls in the swamp, cougars stalking in the mountains, lionesses in the tall grass and so on
>they're all naked and maybe some themed accessories
>the humans get to wear clothes, but most is pretty form fitting
>they get more or less depending on the environment they're in at the moment
>they get eliminated by being caught and fucked by an anthro
>they can struggle and try to fight out of their grip, but are pretty much fucked, literally, when caught by one
>some scenarios have the humans being hunted and others have the anthros has traps for them when they get a puzzle wrong or take the wrong path/route
>not only do the anthros get nice a paycheck and the fun if chasing human boys they also get to keep the guy caught had their new boyfriend/boytoy untill the season is over
>course this means the show can go through anthros pretty often when they retire to stay with the guy they caught and took a liking to him

>Crystal maze
>But you are locked in with a horny anthro if you fail
>She teases you as the timer ticks down
>Team can trade you back for the money room at the end
>More cash sticks to your cum soaked body
>Some teams tactically lose to get more money
>Some refuse to be freed because they enjoy it so much

>gradually learn more about /pofg/ space, wolf pack and this ship
>crew is all female, mostly canines, they just chill & laze around the stars in silent running mode. listening out for the next big score
>not all of them think a human should be walking around in clothes but you smell like the boss, puts you off limits for most
>turns out the doc is rather unruly
>taking great delight in getting you alone for a thorough examination
>"Say, do you see any fur boys strutting around hummie?"
>first came a body scan, you strip off for it
>"You know this whole galaxy is female? 99.9% they say. Till we found humans-"
>there is an odd look in her eyes, something primal flickering beneath the surface. now her razor sharp nails tapped menacingly upon your nude chest, a wicked smile creeping over her face...she wouldn't dare hurt you
>would she?
>using her weight to firmly press you against the scanner she started to grope with her paws, resisting risked a nasty cut
>"-Which means you or more specifically-"
>her pads brush over your balls, making them tense up. muzzle nudging into your ear
>"-These juicy orbs, unf yeah. Hot commodities"
>then came the stern command:
>"Pups. NOW!"
>this crazy girl was not messing around! seemingly reveling in the mixture of fear and arousal she was inflicting upon your body
>"In my paws or pussy boy. The only choices a human need make"
>just then a deep growl from behind made the mad doctors fur spike up, her paws fell away from caressing your trembling sack
>"Oh! Er, Beta i-i wasn't i wa-aaAH!"
>a pissed Beta wolf grabbed the doc by the throat, lifting her clean off you then slamming her onto a bed
>gal was a real powerhouse, peppered with battle scars but treated you like a lil sister not a cum dispenser
>"Alphas first, mine second. Final warning"
>turns out you were requested on the bridge
>where an excited Alpha tail wags. she found a comet for you to name!
>oh, also pick a nearby yeen ship to screw with

>Having a drink alone at a pub
>Huge minotaur woman walks over and sits next to you
>You both start talking, she offers to buy you a drink
>You decline at first but she eventually wins you over
>Night goes on, you exchange stories and jokes, she puts an arm around your shoulder as you share a laugh
>You’re having such a good time that you don’t realize how many drinks she’s putting in front of you
>Last thing you remember is her laying you onto a bed and removing your clothes
>Wake up the next morning with a huge hangover, and a pelvis as sore as your head

"Anon, how about we pray together at the shrine?"
>"What's wrong?"
>"Oh, don't worry. My religion doesn't think human virginity is something to be thrown away like the other religions. We love human virgins!"
>"Just one question, you don't have any appointments this day or tomorrow, right? It takes time to give a human virgin the respect he deserves."

>you brought him penguin today
>EMPEROR penguin
>and he gives you this look
>just like pic related
>like your cooking isn't good enough
>like you don't do everything for him
I swear to the gods, skinnies can be so fucking frustrating at times. Why do they bitch and moan so much about "dietary variety"? Like penguin doesn't have everything you could possibly need!

>Yeen has to be aggressive in public
>Really just wants a way out of gang life

Day 22 of Invasion
>Be in the imperial guard, more specifically an armored regiment.
>You've had a good run, you were part of a good crew, and you guys had a good tank.
>The Leman Russ Eradicator had seen you through more than a dozen worlds.
>Now you were gonna get eaten by Tyranids, all because the regimental commander had an ego.
>Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge was an absolute toad of a woman in all definitions of the word.
>She was located in her Baneblade Rightuous Indignation towards the front of the formation.
>It had a specially built extra-large hatch to permit passage of her wider than tall body.
>She was of noble birth, and had a halfway decent grasp on tactics, which the rest o the regiment picked up the slack.
>This time, she'd gone into the deep end. and was charging a formation of Tyranids without much intel.
>There had been a lot of conflicting information on those Tyranids, some of it nearly impossible to believe.
>Apparently, rumor had it the Tyranids were all female...very female...and had been abducting guardsmen.
>It had been two days since the formation had set out, and you were now entering an area the locals called the Scrub-land.
>Islands of trees in a large grassy plain, set before a large equatorial forest. This was where the Tyranids had to cross.
>The Toad's grand plan involved digging into those islands of trees and blasting at the 'nids until they stopped coming.
>This would work, if a Genestealer cult wasn't using the deep space scanners to jam most of the orbital sensors.
>That and the heat scans were useless thanks to the dense foliage...so nobody knew exactly where the Tyranids were.
>Your tank Commander could only agree, as had the only sane Commissar in the regiment, Commissar Wolfe.
>So, you all had a few good laughs, and started heading into the final battle you would ever be part of.
>Nervously, you clutch at the forward bolter's handles, thumbs over the triggers, panning back and forth as you scan for a target.
>Forest is another hour ahead when it all goes to shit.
>Forward scouting unit stats facing Tyranids, mostly gaunts with a few warriors mixed in.
>Odd part about the initial report is that they are in foxholes and trenches, scattered near the little forest islands.
>The Colonel is not happy about this, and either tries to bellow order into her vox caster or eat the damned thing.
>Toadie Commissars translate this as drive the damned xenos filth out, those are our positions to occupy, not theirs.
>Grudgingly, your unit does so, Your tank and a Punisher pushing up the front, a Hellhound to the flanks, and a standard Leman Russ at the back.
>Then it starts raining spore mines and other Tyranid munitions, all over the place, and with odd effects
>Some of the spore mines slow to a stop a short distance off the ground thanks to parachutes, and belch out immense clouds of smoke.
>Within moments, a wall of thick fog tinged pink surround the tree islands, and more are landing around the forward parts of the formation.
>Then the Tyranids start pummeling the column with all manner of munitions, with a variety of effects.
>It would seem that the Tyranids are using a mirror of the Colonel's "Grand Plan" against her.
>Upon realizing and/or being informed of this, she proceeds to voice her feeling on the matter to everyone in earshot
"REEEEEEEEEE"
>Suffice to say, things go very bad, very swiftly, but through no fault of the vehicle crews.
>The fog is thick enough to hide the large breeds of Tyranids, Tyranofexes, Exocines, Carnifexes, the works.
>Everyone began to clump up, turning their guns outwards and hosing down swarms of gaunts.
>But then they change tactics almost immediately, shooting and advancing while in cover.
>Then the ground starts opening up near tanks, as Raveners eject from the soil along with groups of warriors and Genestealers.
>Your formation is able to avoid encirclement, and Commissar Wolfe is sane enough to know when to fall back.
"Tactical Withdraw," He orders from his Vanquisher, "Cover each other and keep moving. Do not stop."
>The withdraw immediately takes place, as all but the mos stubborn/insane individuals would see the folly of sticking around
>Doubly so with the way this ambush had taken, and was still taking place.
>Radio chatter indicates that most of the column is being immobilized and disarmed. And that the Tyranids do have boobs.
>Most notably, they use some kind of rapidly hardening resin to immobilize their targets, preventing them from escaping
>Even as you hose down a Ravener, you note entire tanks are coated in bony resin or thick webbing, weapons destroyed.
>Odd behavior for a race who exist to consume all in their path, especially as reports come in of guardsmen being grabbed.
>THen shit hits the fan, as a chimera on the right explodes, the work of a Baneblade cannon.
>Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge was definitely pissed, executing her own people for running.
>Clearly, she and most Commissars think it is do or die...and as such, are chasing down the "defectors"
>Suddenly, the Leman Russ is knocked clean over from below, and you are slammed up against one of the walls.
>A few seconds later, you and the rest of the crew bail out, laspistols drawn ad scrambling to catch up
>You do not want to get left behind, but it's clear that you might not have very long to clime onto a vehicle.
>Something massive screams, and you turn to watch what happens, curiosity overcoming common sense.
>The largest Ravener you've ever seen was charging the Righteous Indignation, claws wide.
>A hole is blown through it, and you can see the fat toad smiling sadistically from her perch, as she turns the stormbolter toward you.
>Death is only prevented when the world around you explodes tossing you into the air a few feet and dumping you into the dirt
>Your ears are ringing and vision is blurred, but you've grown used to shell-shock, so it passes quickly.
>The Righteous Indignation is covered in bony resin, webs, and quite a few weapons have been blown off.
>The toad, somehow, didn't get hit by all of this, and is struggling to heave herself from the hatch.
>You can hear the sound of her cursing easily, even with the battle raging near you
SCREEEEE
>The frak is that?
>A giant Tyranid you've never seen before come out of the hole next to your tank and runs at the Baneblade.
>It covers the distance in moments, knocking a few smaller Tyranids out of the way.
>It has no problem lifting the screaming fat woman from the tank, before it's chest suddenly opens.
>Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge was popped into its chest=mouth like a hors d'oeuvre
>The thing takes a few lumbering steps before lurching to a halt, and expelling the Colonel, retching and gagging.
>Well, who would think a race of xenos that literally ate everything in sight to be picky eaters?
>moments later, she's given a thorough coating of rapidly hardening resin, immobilizing her entirely
>Didn't see where the crazy nid was, but seeing as you lost your laspistol, you don't want to draw attention to yourself
>You come around a dirt embankment, only to see a sight that makes your blood run cold
>It's a damn Exocrine, and its aiming for the retreating armor with its bio-plasma weapon.
>Not only that, it seems to be aiming for Commissar Wolfe's tank, as though it knows he's coordinating the retreat.
>You have to stop it, but how do you stop a Tyranid the size of a tank...run up and stab it in the ass.
>Speaking of ass, it isn't half bad for a massive insectoid monster that fires plasma
>A bit of fluid dribbles down as it shifts slightly...and if your awkward first time with a woman had taught you anything...
>You run forward, beg the Emperor for forgiveness for what you're about to do...
>With your running start, you slide under the creatures short stubby tail, and spot your target.
>It's oddly human looking, if a little up sized and drooling copiously
"For the Emperor!"
>Years of being the forward gunner on a Leman Russ ensures your aim it true.
>Your hand slips inside easily thanks to the lubrication, and thankfully, there are no teeth.
>You manage to get halfway to your elbow when she clenches down and gives a bone-rattling shudder.
>Grimacing, you begin thrusting your fist into the creature, doing your best to fight the gripping muscles
>You have the most awkward and shameful boner right now...but if the creatures breathing is anything to go by, it's distracted.
>You spot a familiar nub of flesh, and decide to double down on this heresy.
>Bio-plasma screams from the creature and strikes the ground fifty meters away, showing everything in hot soil.
>You permit yourself a moment of triumph, the rest of the regiment should be safe...for now at the very least.
>The deep rumble from above reminds you just where you are, and the flesh gripping your arm tightens.
>It raises its tail and backside, before it starts thrusting back, causing you to smack into her enormous ass.
>For a few moments, you;re treated like a combination of paddle-ball and dildo.
>You were not prepared to be used as a sex toy, much less several tons of ass striking you at high speed.
>You go tumbling, coming to rest at the edge of a crater, with a sever case of tank shock.
When it clears, you're staring up at a panting Exocrine, a very long tongue hanging from its fanged maw and....
>By the Emperor, each of its...her boobs, are bigger than you...how did it move with those things?
>And why was the cannon giving you bedroom eyes?
>With a growl, one of the enormous talons impales your pants through the crotch.
>Then it kisses you, and by kiss, you mean force about a foot of tongue into your mouth.
>Your jaw aches, and the hot, slimy muscle invading your mouth wriggles in your throat.
>Your trousers are torn with ease, exposing you dick to the Exocrine, and to any onlooking Tyranids
>Breaking its kiss, the Exocrine trails its tongue down your chest before giving you a few licks
>You do your best not to react, but you still squirm under its touch.
>Suddenly, it stops, before glaring up at its cannon, which is glaring back? Alien Biology
>Suddenly, the damned plasma cannon is leveled at you, the opening twitching slightly.
>Your first instinct is to dodge, but you're suddenly under a barrage of quills and a spore pod.
>You slump back down to the ground, a dozen quills in your limbs and a spore cloud engulfing your head.
>On the lip of the crater, a few gaunts engage in what sounds like laughter.
>You can be bothered to think too hard on that, you feel really hot for some reason, and its heading south.
>You can hardly move as the Exocrine takes your dick into its plasma cannon.
>Thanks to the tongue-job earlier, you slide in as the opening grips down on your cock.
>Then the damned thing vibrates somehow, and you groan from the sensation.
>Why does this feel so good?
>As you begin to reach your climax, you come to a sudden understanding that these weren't mere Tyranids.
>They had to be Daemonids of Slanessh...it explained far too much of this perverted mess.
>All further thoughts are cut off as you erupt, moaning like a virgin.
>Panting, you come to your sense as a shadow is cast over you.
>The last thing you see is the Exocrine's ass coming down atop you...there were probably worse ways to go
>Be General Powerstache
>Your glory days had long since passed, and you'd been stuck on this backwater planet because of politics
>No more glorious charges
>No more grand Campaigns
>Just making sure order is kept on this new colony
>You've faced the Great Devourer before, you knew how it worked
>This world was doomed, no matter how badly you stalled.
>To make matters worse, they were all very much female, and were like rabbits in spring.
>Normally, this would not be so bad, but the sector governor had decided that his new colony would be founded by prisoners
>Only male criminals were sent here, and without a woman in sight...some were less reserved.
>Desertion was a problem, and the Commissars were barely holding things together.
>Commissar Wolfe managed to save 30% of a doomed armored regiment, a small miracle.
"Sir, servos skull with a message for you."
"Hmm, what does it say?"
"It's marked for your eyes only."
>You motion for the servos kull to play its message, and the face of a haggard Guardsman appears.
"This is Sergeant Greg Mansfield of outpost 13," He announces, "This is probably all manner of heretical, but I think I've found a weakness in the enemy."

>somehow win position of mayor in a small town
>only human around for miles
>all the townspeople are demons of various sorts
>turns out they spearheaded you being mayor because it's the job of a mayor to take care of the town and it's people
>though with you being a human male and all them demons their view of "taking care of" takes on a lewder tone

How do feel about name calling? Would you be okay with your waifur calling you a slut while she pounds your pelvis into dust?

I really like namecalling. Imagine she's ironically condescending.
>mess something up
>"Aw, I guess I shouldn't have expected anything less."
>knowing smirk as you tense and blush
>"Is the little humie all flustered? Adorable. How about I come over there and we help you unwind?"

isnt it a little... misanthropic how furgirls always draw humans as weak and helpless?

Humans are always weak and helpless.
Sure, some of them are stronger than other humans, but it's not like that matters at all.

>tie humie up
>strap vibrator to his cock
>leave for work
>come back at the end of the day
>humie is still tied up, only now he's covered in his own coom, and is overstimulated beyond coherent thought and can no longer feel his legs
>untie humie, pick him up and carry him to bed and lick him clean
He's sleeping it off right now. God, he was so cute with the way he was twitching and babbling. Love seeing humie boys get their little brains addled from too much pleasure.

>anthros cooing and awwing at humans bundled up in winter
>personal space is invaded even more at the point

>Be human, walking in the antarctic
>See a group of penguins a ways away
>One turns to you, and you wave to her
>Suddenly she screams "lost human!"
>They all come running, and soon are piling on top of you
>"Don't worry, you won't be cold anymore." "There's nothing to worry now that we're here." "I wanna keep him!"
>You tell them that your jacket is fine for the environment and you know where you're going
>Immediately after one tears it off, along with your shirt
>You feel even colder as they start licking your body and coating you in a film of saliva
>"Look girls, he's so cold! We're going to have to do some serious work if he's going to be warm!"
>"We can keep him after this, right? I mean, we are saving his life."
>"It's only right that he return the favor, so I don't see why not."
>And that's how you joined a group of penguins

imagine trying to do work or research out in the wild only for native anthro women to take too much of an interest
>getting picked up at random and being proclaimed you are hers now
>really cold or hot environments having the local anthros fretting over you
>helpless to water anthros when swimming

>Get assignment to tanker crew
>Hell yeah, get to drive a tank
>Turn up for training and you've been paired with 4 giant shark anthros
>At first you think nothing of it
>But then you spend an hour inside a hot, humid cabin together
>Whoever dropped these girls in this unit was either a logistical idiot or a perverted smartass

>Be alpha female
>Used to males of your species trying to get something out of you
>Sick and tired of their manipulative games
>One day you see someone hiding out in the bushes
>One of the males keeps bothering you, hoping to get into your social graces, but you don't care
>You swear you heard the person there say 'beautiful' and 'majestic'
>Pretending to walk away, you secretly circle around and catch the person unaware
>It's a human, and a very nice looking one too
>You can't stop staring at those shorts either
>"Human."
>"Ahh!" he yells and turns on his back
>He starts trying to crawl away but you grab his leg
>"You think I'm beautiful, huh?"
>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to bother you! Please let me go!"
>You think about it
>"Human males are considered dominant, correct?"

I feel like some type of weirdo for the fact that im not even really interested in getting fucked or having my dick touched by a cute amazon fur girl.
Im far more interested in licking her vagina for hours on end.
You don't think anthro girls will tease me for this will they?

How unethical would it be to groom a young human boy into being your perfect mate? Asking for a friend.

Incredibly unethical, but I mean, who cares? It's not illegal.

I mean, if I happen adopt a little human orphan, and he just so happens to be entering puberty, it wouldn't be weird if I taught him how to pleasure a woman, right? I mean, better the woman who knows him and loves him best be his first, than him getting molested by some stranger , right? This is all totally hypothetical, of course. I would never, ever try to abuse my power as a child's guardian to satisfy my own perverted desires. No. Never.

It would definitely be weird. Super weird. But I mean, who would know? It's just a human. If you teach him, hypothetically, how to really get his tongue in there, you'd be getting off. Does it really make any difference what does or doesn't happen to a human if you get your nut?

Right? A-and it'd be doing him a favor really! When you think about it. I mean, puberty can be such a scary and confusing time for a young human, and they're already so naturally submissive and obedient to anthro women, he needs a woman who he can trust to teach him about how his body is changing. It's not wrong, not really. Right?

>Dragons are notable for their ability to hypnotize humans
Imagine walking a long and lonely road when you meet a dragon. She greets you warmly, and the moment you hear her voice you feel as though you can trust her. You have a conversation. As she speaks, you find it harder and harder to think. You recognize this, and begin to realize that you're in danger. You apologize and make to leave but she stops you. You're fully panicking now: you know something bad is happening but you can't make out what. She says you must be scared, walking this road alone at night.
When did the sun set? How long have you been here?
She offers to let you stay at her lair until morning. Or if you'd like, to stay longer. Why should you get to where you were going so soon, anyways? It's not like you're appreciated where you're from. And she does appreciate the things you do. She goes on at length the favors you've performed but don't remember. How her home and scales had never been cleaner. How you provide such wonderful company.
She's so glad to have you. She's always wanted a pet.

Nothing wrong with horror. Fearboners are the best boners.
Helps that I've always enjoyed the idea of being kidnapped by a big girl anyway.

I know you're not okay, anon. You say you are, but you're not.
You're all alone. You don't talk to anyone. I see you cry sometimes.
That's okay. Tonight, you won't be alone. I'll make sure you're never alone, ever again.
I can't let you go. I know what you'll go back to.
Even if you fight it, I'll make you learn to love me.
Your struggles are so weak. How have you survived this long without someone?
If you can't fight me off, you can't protect yourself. But that's what I'm here for: to protect you.
From yourself, if need be.

>Her hand moves to your head, and she starts softly scratching your head
>It... feels nice
>"I guess you could say it's a little like that. But you'll also be loved. Humans need to be touched, need to be held and loved. We enjoy being with you, so we want to make sure you're happy too.

>"Don't deny it. You'll be happier with me. I'll always be happy to cuddle you, to hold you."
>Her other hand reaches into your pants and grabs your dick and softly strokes it
>"Does that feel good? Does this make you happy, being treated like this?"

>She starts to softly hump you
>"It makes me happy to see you happy, and it will make you happy to make me happy. This is how it's meant to be. Be a good boy and accept it."
>Her humps become harder, and her hand scratches deeper into you, making you shake in pleasure
>"You're such a good boy. A handsome, cute boy. Good, good, good boy."
>The praise sends you over the edge, and you cum into her
>With a few final humps, all of your seed spills
>"Didn't that feel good? It will be your job from now on."

Thinking about a story about a pair of cargo runners: a human and a space wasp lady. She hired the human to help her out on her ship, since humans are quite new and he's down to work for simple food and a way off the planet.
I want to develop the two's relationship wherein the wasp is cold and takes no shit, and the human is Upset McShouty. Having a lot of time between stops, he starts to get lazy. He tries to play the "you're not actually paying me anything" card a lot to get out of doing anything, while Waspy retorts with varying threats, like "You wanna get stuffed in a box and sent back to Earth?"
Both are pretty stubborn and it often devolves to comical struggles. For example, Waspy will veer the ship and be all, "We're going back to Earth, you should have just cleaned the windows" to which the human will be all shouty and try to wrench the pilot controls away. It'll go into wrestling and Waspy trying to cram him into a box half his size.
Encounters like that will probably end with laughter and bonding, or awkward pauses when the human doesn't fight her handling. They'll both be tightly wound and learn to have fun on their lengthy trips between trading posts of people they hate.

"Waspy, I'm starving."
>"Eat the paste."
"Don't you have like, space ice cream around here?"
>"Space ice cream."
"Yeah, like ice cream but in space."
>"That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
"Eating paste is the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
>"If you don't stop talking I'm going to stuff you in a crate."
"Do the crates have crate ice cream?"
>She stands, approaching menacingly. She chases him around the ship, attempting to shove nutrient paste in his mouth. Both are highly amused by their own silly behavior like the nerds they are.
>Afterwards, they chill at a space diner. They do, in fact, have space ice cream.

>A human that's low in life, just lucky enough to be one of the few to venture to the stars, albeit as a lowly cargo worker. He can hardly believe that things are the way they are, and has a tendency to panic under stress. That's where the initial complaining comes from: he has so much to do but has no idea how to do it, what anything is, or really how to act in the situation he finds himself. If anything, he's just asking to be taught or helped.
>Waspy is also a little low in life. She took out a loan for the ship and really has no idea how she's going to pay it back. Hiring an alien with no concept of anything saves her money, but she's running low trying to get enough money together to meet her payments. Her low tolerance for bullshit makes her snappy, but she too is trying her best. Having a ship makes her independent, but she won't be truly free until she pays it off. She's irritable to the panicky human, but is quick to collect herself and apologize for rash behavior.

The FFMA may be classed as a terrorist organisation, but I think putting them in concentration camps is too far. Most of the FFMA members are just lost souls who were abused by their former owners and need to be shown affection to be put back on the right path.

Think Zoanthropes can read your mind?
Maybe you're thinking salacious things about that warrior brood you just walked by on the battlements but you're too shy to offer your geneseed. Then you hear a cackle in the back of your mind and see that floaty thing staring directly at you, grinning ear to ear.

In some prisons they give inmates their own pets as a form a therapy. What if the gave female anthro inmates their own humans to help rehabilitate them?

No because I will be abused and physically harmed. I guess I could tell them not to do that to me or I will never visit again but still it's risky.

If they abuse you, the other inmates are going to give them hell. They take man beaters very seriously.
Groping is still a very real possibility though.

That's okay groping is fine I understand that they are very pent up living with only female anthros and the presence of a human boy must be extremely exciting but I'm just afraid some will become over excited handle me roughly without even realising they are scratching and bruising me.

What if your girlfriend was a canine supremacist? Would you like her to degrade and call you a weak pathetic human that was made to be owned by a superior canine?

Shark waifurs are amazing. Slightly intimidating, hot, athletic, can teach you to swim, and you can sorta ride them in the water playfully. Most of them are probably caring waifurs too, even if they don't appear that way. I'd do anything for one to pin me to the floor or wall.

What setting would you want? I wish our Earth got invaded and taken over by aliens that just want to protect us because they were worried that humans were too weak and lacking in technology to defend themselves.

Pokemon. Anthro pokemon girls protecting and dominating their trainers. (Ideally in this world trainers are 18+, or at the LEAST are paired with pokemon their age. I'm not a pedophile.)

crash land on a quarantined world that was quarantined due to being taken over by grey goo. Pass out from your grave injuries as you see your ship getting eaten by the grey goo. 
Wake up later fully healed and feeling better than you ever have on a beach made of pure white sand and an ocean of deep blue, almost metallic water. looking to the left, you see an anthropomorphic creature seemingly made out of metal. 
You jump and give a slight yell in surprise, surprising the creature as well. It gives off a slight yelp and melts quickly into the sand, becoming one with it. As you stand up and begin to wonder what you just saw, you see the creature begin to form out in the water. 
Now completely baffled by its abilities, you walk toward it only to trip on a rock and make a 10/10 face plant into the strange sand. As you start to get back up, you see you got a nasty gash from the fall on your arm. 
The creature, watching from the water, seems to react in shock and melts back into the water before quickly re materializing right next to you. Surprised, you fall on your butt and try to scoot yourself away from the now vaguely feminine metal creature, only to have her quickly hug her arms around you and then melt and almost envelope your body in a metallic grey substance. 
You await your impending death for several seconds with your eyes closed, only to realize that it hasn't come. You slowly creak open your eyes and look at the gently convulsing goo that is covering your body up to your neck. 
After about 15 seconds of watching the goo, it suddenly retreats from you and reforms back into your faceless metal assailant. When you look down at your arm, you realize the gash is gone. As you look back to her, you realize today is going to be a day you wont forget.

You think anthros would steal men that have a human gf already? They wouldn't send his gf pics of his face as he came right?

>ynw get to send pics of you with an anthro woman to your ex human gf

>snapchat recording from a mirror where waifur mate presses you
>seething ex.png

>ynw be rescued from an abusive relationship by a thick gator girl who mating presses you in front of your abusive human gf

>human gf comes home to the smell of sex.
>human gf finds you with a mouthful of gator titty.
>starts bitching at you while gatorfu slams her ass on you even harder.
>comes closer so she can hit you
>gatorfu gets up and throws her ass outside like nothing.
>goes back to pressing you and making your toes curl.

What if not all human lands and settlements were taken over by anthro forces after the war? What if there were still hidden human strongholds that humans go to for salvation?

Soft doms would absolutely hide males from the aggressive ones
I'd bet the humans would let a gentle dom into their free space...only to find out she can't help herself and starts seducing them into become her mates
Males just need a loving anthro to help them blossom as breeders, forcing them reduces their fertility, no one wants that.

>Talk to your Cyndaquil about your life issues to feel better about it
>Exploring your feelings one day, talk about your crush who's tough and assertive, totally comfortable making choices and taking the lead

>cyborg from the future

>sent back to protect you from thots
>and find you a perfect mate
>unfortunately it's standards are to high/exact
>eventually decides the best course of action is to become your perfect mate itself
>still needs to store as much baby batter as possible to take back 2 the future

What about anthro villainess capturing and dominating her biggest pain in that handsome man that always spoiled her plans while he tries to think of a way to stop her?

>"Agent Anon i presume?"
>The vile vixen mockingly addressed her shackled victim on the bed
>Caught by such a basic gas trap he felt foolish. Thankfully to a gal like this simply killing someone wasn't enough, there was still time to stop her!
>"After all the pain you've caused me," She traced a cold gloved hand up his chest "Im going to give you the 'pleasure' of being the last free mortal in the world"
>Undoing his jacket on the 2nd pass freezing digits now brushed his exposed chest
>"Oh yes! When my overly large, extremely fragile mind controlling crystal exposed on the roof has enough essence to fire, man and beast alike will bow to me!"
>With a wicked laugh the vampire fox continued divulging her master plan
>"But not you!"
>Anon gulped nervously. Her hand roughly squeezed his throat, making sure he was looking deep into those ruby red eyes before speaking. Deceptively gently now.
>"With no more distractions, we are finally going to see how long you can resist a woman like me"
>Hopping onto his chest made him grunt and rattle the restraints, while not wearing much her clothing was still freezing to the flesh. Fluffy breasts bouncing from the motion.
>"Hows the view boy? Better than last time?"
>She'd tried this before, jumping him from behind, skillfully jerking him off like she'd been doing it for 1000 years, offering more if he joined her
>It didnt work then. It wont work now! Anon confidently thought, grinning and playing along with a nod of the head
>The vixen cracked a smile leaning back to foot boop this studs face
>"I knew it. Pull. Don't you dare bite"
>Already issuing commands like she'd won the boy hesitantly tugged the vixens foot covers with his teeth, slipping them off
>"Good boy" Teased his temporary mistress
>Free those soft legs closed around his chest. Locking him tight to her breast. She was so warm, that fur was impossibly fine.
>Those pesky chains prevented our hero from pushing her back, not that he would try given how her good mood was the only thing saving him right now. If anything he wanted to hug her back and look for an escape
>Suddenly everything went dark
>Vamp girl had brought her cape over them, licking then nibbling his ear in the black
>"No males ever resisted like you, Anon. Not in a thousand years" He'd never heard her speak or act in this gentle way before
>It almost sounded like her guard was down, like it was genuine, as if she already ruled the world
>"Drop the act boy. We could have killed each other a dozen times over yet here we are, drawn together again"
>Under the cloak the human was peppered with kisses, some light on the head, the chest, others deep into his mouth, making him gasp for air, taking in the sweet taste of warm vixen with each breath
>A nip from vampire fangs on his ear reminded him this was all just a ruse...right?
>Hidden from sight Anon fiddled with the cuffs, they felt loose, if he could wriggle free this bitches power trip would be over. For this weeks episode at least.
>Just then the cape began to lift. Dammit she'd see what he was up to!
>Think. FAST
>Hurriedly Agent Anon face planted those plump pillow tits, giving each a firm suckle before commanding her:
>Turn around
>It seemed to do the trick, the dominatrix chuckled with amusement not malice for once. Delighted with continued defiance from a totally helpless partner
>"A lesser man i'd bite for that!" Yet she decoupled her legs, spinning around, tail dusting the boys face before curling snug around his chest "Ready to feel a hundred life times of pleasure, my love?"
>The tearing of fabric allowed Anons cock to spring free
>"If you are still conscious after this. I wont just let you clean me up, i'll marry you"
>Reverse cowgirl with a over confident vampire was perfect for breaking these cuffs, assuming our hero can withstand such an experienced lover
>If only she dropped the world domination shtick by the gods what a wife she'd be

In times of war. Do you think anthros take men from their occupations? Putting their lives on the line, i think they deserve some comfort.

>male sanctuary by the river
>small reptile force holds it
>they won't surrender

>laugh as they flee down stream

k bro. its your fantasy.

>Anon is chauffeur for the soviet premier
>Have very close relationship with your leader
>She always talk to you about her political opponents and rivalry with the foreign powers
>After every meeting she attends you are there to pick her up
>She always drags you to after parties and get completely wasted with the elite of the system
>Waking up in her bed is not unusual for you
>She is capable of sending anyone to the gulags in Kolyma if she so desired
>better keep her happy

>haven't seen him since

>all I want to be is being a leader of neutral nation during the cold war
>try to remain neutral while the American and the Russian leaders are trying to win you over

What is the governments plan with dealing with human resistance groups?

Strike teams that are well versed in headpats, cuddles, and instant loss 2koma.

>tfw be at human rights rally
>Leader on stage suddenly gets flipped on his back and 2koma'd after the event got raided by police just before he was about to give his speech

>"Get down right now!"
>"Sir, I'm armed with lipstick and prepared to use it!"
>"I am trained and have full authority to kiss you until you lose consciousness sir!"

>Develops motherly tendencies despite your protests

>walk into an elevator at work
>3 big fem croc coworkers are in there with you
>all 3 of them surround and give you a mischievous look

>in anthro world, the first male that an ANTHRO female has sex with becomes their mate for life and is upheld by law.
>they will literally hunt out human males and raped them, thus forcing them to start a family together where the anthro will bear the human's children again and again.
>sexual maturity of female anthros signifies the start of a nightmare for human women in late middleschool and early high school, as their boyfriends, childhood loves, and crushes are aggressively "raped" in their homes, restrooms, cafeteria, etc by panthers, wolves, yeens, bears, raptors, and other females of the non-human taxonomy.
>Once the humie penis spears the anthro vagina it is all over and the human women can only wale as their husband are wisk away, now legally bound to the female anthros for the rest of their lives.
>The Human men who do not mate with the anthro voluntarily undergo extensive conditioning.
>they will sleep, bath, eat, sit, and work together until the human male succumbs to the anthros presence.
>Despite what human females may say, the hunting of human mates is not "random", in fact the majority are planned with the anthro being a close friend, co-worker, or knew of the human male in someway.
>selection can start platonically at childhood unbeknown to the human male child as just the female anthro wanting to be friends with the human male.
>but as they sexually mature they began plotting, looking for secluded places like public showers or sleepovers to be deflowered if they are not so bold as to do it in public.
>it is also important to note that selection is not just for breeding/sexual purposes but for love also: anthro females search for an emotional and personally compatible mate, which is why human males with anthro friends should be on alert. If your teenage son's best friend is a female anthro know that it is already too late, and start prioritizing protecting your next child from developing relationships with anthros.

>be a human raised by a racist human mother
>she teaches you that all anthros are evil
>grow up avoiding friendship and contact with anthros
>except when you finally get a job, you're forced to work alongside your anthro coworkers
>notice that some of the females at the place have taken interest in you
>don't want to engage with them because of your distrust of anthros, at the same time part of you feels like you should

>waifur has to work nights. its good money
>feel lonely with no thick fur to hide in at night
>so quiet during the day, she used to always drag you away on walks
>still do your best to help
>black out the bed room, tidy it while shes gone, sometimes the sheets still hold her warmth, make sure to have a hot meal ready for her, she keeps missing them
>weekend comes, wife gets off early tonight or was it today?
>dozing off alone on the couch time kept skipping with every blink of your sleepy eyes
>rest for a moment...
>suddenly its dark, the spare blanket is wrapped snug around you, a small box of chocolates has appeared with a note
>'For my good boy - Got next week off'
>a large familiar paw brushed your hair and cheek
>your wife smiles down on you, she'd been waiting for you to wake
>scooping you up blanket and all she carries you to the bed room
>getting buried in her fur for the first time in a week felt extra special, you cuddle in deep, the stress of the past few days melting away
>she clearly felt the same way, her nuzzles and licks were stronger than usual, as if you'd be cruelly snatched away at any moment
>but that wasn't going to happen. not for a few days at least

>have mom issues
>they can smell it
>going to work up an elevator, which then gets filled with MILF anthros.

They can smell your sweat from nervousness.
They can see your wrinkled shirt.
They can see your cubicle lacking of any character or personalization.
They see how you backtrack and apologize when you feel like you've made the tiniest slight.
They'll catch a glimpse of you curled up, clutching your head when you think nobody's watching.
You barely take care of yourself, anon. Why are you so afraid of letting everyone down? Why do you hide away when you feel bad?
No one ever taught you that you're worthy of love, anon. Why don't you come home with me tonight? I can teach you these things.

>Some get the heart broken, when they realize you were just using them as sexual relief
>how you claimed them through squelching vulva's and flinging tongues

>"It feels great my sweet husband" she says between shallow pants
>NANI!!!!
>you go to pull out, about to laugh this off as you break this heart a little more cold as usual, but you underestimated her size and strength
>she twist around holding you in a tight embrace, breast squishing against your chest as her tounge lolls out and lick's your cheek, hot breath pouring over your cheek.
>"Did you think I would abandon my tribal culture once I got into the city, we mate for life my little humie" she cooed
>you had about enough of this and start cursing at the top of your lungs about how you not into this fetish bullshit and she needs to stop playing around
>you start to puch her in the head over and over again, your teeth gritting and your nose snarled
>she just slowly raises her head to look at you, keeping her warm smile, and once at the top of her extension stare loving into your eyes as you continue punching her.
>after a few more second of punching and staring, a quick pain hits your stomach, as a quick and viscous jab takes your breath away.
>while incapacitated she takes the time to holds the fingers in your right hand in her iron grip, and slowly break them
>the sound of crunching compliments your screams
>she takes this time to loving comfort you, like she was not the one who through the punch and broke your fingers
>you were weezing, face red with anger and confusion as she nuzzled your neck. And just lay there.
>hours passed into the night
>every time you started to regain your strength, and started becoming loud and vulgar, thrashing to get out of her grasp, she would squeeze your broken fingers or punch your gut again.
>she eventual tied your arms and legs up as she fell asleep as the big spoon
>you being to tired to think of anything coherent, just giving to the fuzzy women.
>you wake up in the morning, feeling an odd pressure on your back, and hands up your shirt.
>anger immediate returns to you but before you could thrash more than once you feel a violent pain as she squeezes your broken fingers.
>now accustomed to the feedback loop from last night, you keep quiet and stop moving.
>she stuffs her muzzle into your hair and inhales your scent.
>you here a knock on the door, and a familar voice of a co-worker is heard, looking for you.
>you raise your voice, yelling out to him about a crazy bitch, ignoring any repercussions you may receive from the wolfess.
>you here annoyed sigh from behind as you feel her get out of bed to open the door
>but before opening it she reaching into her discarded pile of clothes and retrieves a coin pack
>she then opens the door and in your horror successfully bribes your co-worker to forget about you
>It didn't hit you till now how easy it was for you to be enslaved/detained here if their was the right amount of money
>you were not high class, you had no family, all your friends were just like you and were driven by money, sex, and security.
>you knew you would do the same to them and this twist your stomach.
>you were associated with the "raunchier" sides of the city and your reputation was one of a street urchin before you started gaining little statues with money alone
>you were just another guy who lost "the game"
>you were "replaceable"
>you started to tear up, feeling humiliated as your quest for all kinds of power (sex and money) had backfired and you were once again that paranoid little street kid you were.
>As the wolfess closed the door she looked at you, rolling her eyes with a deep sigh and return to her big spooning postion, but not before releasing your boneds
>you should of rebeled right there, but you just sat their defeated
>One night you were on the top of your game getting lucky with some tight virgin wolf cunny and now you have nothing
>they just replace you when you don't show up to work and your co-worker says you ditched them, and the money she bribed them with is more than you and your co-worker would make in a year.
>nobody who even remotely cared about you is going to speak against such money. Your reputation will be that of a commodity to a wolfess, as your "friends" circle in and will take everything:
>positions, routes, statuses in your absence.
>maybe you still had time to stop them, if you could some how overpower this wolf, you can you the rest of the coins in her pouch to buy your status back, its only been like a couple hours?!
>Right!?
>you start to get optimistic, planning your escape
>your going to get out of here, steal the money, and comeback and rape this curr bitch. You were a human! She was a wolf!
>You would make her your slave! Fill Her up with pups and sell them off! Whore her out until she backed back everything with blood and tears!
>Your not done yet! She just bribed one person!
>the wolfess stared at the man with an incredulous look as if she can sense his inner turmoil
>she then rested her muzzle on your head, and sighed into his hair and she began to speak
>"you know I am a morning person right? I woke up before dawn and already payed off enough people for you to be forgotten now" she said with a neutral look on her face while running her hands through his chest
>her tone was not seductive, triumphant, or apathetic but rather complacent with a hit of “Motherly affection”??
>Like she was some breaking the news to some old friend, her eye fixed into the empty space above his head.
>doing her best to break down what has happened with out making him to distraught.
>the man's early anger quicking mellowed and turned into more confusion, realizing he is basically the property of this wolf now
>Slavery and indentured servitude was common practice here so it didn't take much imagination to figure out who she was paying off in the morning
>for people to forget you, to render you property
>She whispers once more "I may be a wolf, but from my conversions during my errands this morning I found you were of low birth, a fact that no amount of money can hide that", she emphasized, by pressing her clawed finger into my cheek
>"Regardless of that you were mine the moment you deflowered me" she added, giving you a quick lick.
>Richard just sat there feeling utterly defeated as she continued:
>"I know your not going to believe me, but I don't want you to be so solemn, your not going to be just a sex toy for me I promise"
>she lowered a hand to grope his exposed groin cupping it as if to protect them from harm.
>"I really admired you Richard, during our initial conversation, your compliments, how ambitious your were to show me that I could trust you, allow you to take control, how your arms snaked around my waist"
>"I knew what you were doing from the start, you had no intention of staying with me beyond a night. But unfortunate for you I am not like those other wolven whores around here and their shitty tribe".
>"When I gave myself to you I wasn't giving you just my body, but my soul, my companionship. I gave you my body and mind and no other man in the past, present, or future has , is, or will be in possession of it besides you", she coos into your ear

>by now you have completely mellowed out, just glad that you are at least being seen as a person, is this stockholhm syndrome?
>"however" she says as she squeezes you and exhales deeply, as if she is about to be in some sort of pain.
>"You have been with others before me, and that is quiet ... heartbreaking, knowing that other women have felt your cock, it make me... want to cry"
>"BUT, you won't let me cry HUSBAND! You hurt me, you were selfish, and now I have to live with the pain that I can not own my husband in every single way"
>Your no longer mellow. Your terrified! You are now the property of an insane wolfess, unheard of amounts of retroactive jealousy.
>She begins to talk again as she rubs her cheek with yours: "maybe, we can find closure in the fact that women her are submissive, objects, right richard"
>"but I am from a wolven culture where it is not the case, so it's going to take some time to... heal"
>your speechless at this point. But a part of you wants to give in to her
>you never had a family or loved ones and not really any authoritative figure to give you direction. Your literally at rock bottom in life and you need help
>some guardian angel or good friend to help you out to share your pain with.
>you decide to give caution to the wind and roll over and nuzzle in the her breast while tears ran down your eyes.
>she smiles and brings you up to where your nuzzling the crook of her neck, as she slowly rolls you over until you are on your back.
>she is lying on top of you
>both of you as naked as the day you were born and deeply panting
>you were exhausted and just welcomed it, you had nothing left to lose right?
>you finally give in
>"I am sorry for hurting you M'am ..."
>"Elizabeth" she interupted "your Elizabeth, my Richard"
>"yes... my Elizabeth, will get through this... just promise y-youll be here for me and only...me"
>Richard was deafly afraid that if he gave in, he would be just thrown aside later on while she moved on to some other man for emotional support based on how intimate she was being with him despite them only knowing each other for a day
>she just held him tighter "Of course Richard. I enjoyed the time we spent together before our bedding, your stories, your parlor tricks, your personality that shown through your predatory sexual hunt."
>she flips you over and makes you rest on her with your face toward the ceiling.
>"We have a lot more to get to know about each other" she said, her hand resumed cupping his groin as she gave it a light squeeze"
>"your going to have to trust me though, let me take control of your life, I'll make sure will be happy. You will be a good father, I'll make sure of it"
>Richard smilled smugly. The fact that she can interbreed with you in contrast to the more local wolves, can probably explain her differing behavior.
>with you layiing on top of her like she was a second mattress, she began stroking your cock, hear head slinking it's way over your head so she can watch your face and her movements
>Your life from early was over. No more. But instead of being alone and scared you decided to give control to Elizabeth, taking responsibility after you to shared such physical intimacy according to her beliefs
>For the first time in along time you felt secure enough to cry, you didn't have to keep a tough composure or hide your feelings, there was someone here stronger than you and was going to take care of you
>you didn't feel like you were being belittle or shamed just loved.
>you didn't feel you were being used either, this CONTROL was only ever for you; she will not toss you aside.
>And you were going to do everything in your power to prove that you love and not toss her aside just as much; get to know her; care for her; be the best man you could be
>You feel more powerful than ever before even though ironically your submissive to the wolfess
>You feel as if life can throw anything at you, but you always be alright, not matter how vulnerable, broken, or defeated you become
>Elizabeth will be there to comfort you, to caress you, make you feel loved and safe
>and you know damn well your going to keep this power loving her and being their for her just as much in return.

Reminder for human bois to never get a yeen gf. They don't protect their bfs and are worse than human girls when it comes to domestic abuse cases.

What if your humando became scarred or disfigured in someway? Would you still love him? Would he still be beautiful to you? Or would you leave him for someone better looking?

what kind of slut do you think I am as the great cat milf once said "Beauty is short term tyranny" he is MINE and I will never leave him.

Male cocks must hang free!
They need to be kept cool with space to move as well as given a minimum 24 hours rest between intense breeding sessions.
The male is a sacred being requiring not only our strength but also our care and understanding to flourish.
Restricting them reduces cum production, quality and is cruel to the male. Don't make me come down there and whip y'all.

>You're fresh out of the local college
>Bachelor's degree criminal justice
>Previous experience in counseling as well
>Tailborne Federal penitentiary
>Place is mainly focused on rehabilitation of prisoners & the such
>Pay's pretty good from the looks of it, but hadn't done much research into the place before coming here
>Just know it's only anthros
>Arive at the front gates, with one of the councilors you talked to over the phone
>You exchange pleasantries with the cheetah woman in question & go off to the offices to meet with the warden
>early in the morning, it's a quite day & you don't really see many people out & about right now, beyond the paper pushers
>Meeting finally with the warden, you step into the office of a fairly large Albion crocodile.
>A female
>The warden turns to you & greets you shaking your hand
>Explains how she's finally glad to meet the newest hire after hearing so much about you from your instructor
>You try to play it modestly
>Saying how you're happy for the opportunity, you claim you're ready to help out in any way possible around the place & are anxious to start
>Laughing it off, she says you'll have plenty of time for that
>Looking to the clock you realise just how early it is
>6:21am
>Day doesn't start until 7am sharp
>The warden then politely offers to buy you a coffee before the day starts proper
>With a quick show around the offices, you are shown toward the break lounge
>Pretty comfy looking.
>A pair of couches, tv, fridge, & microwave. Of course a big ol' coffee vending machine
>Nice
>as you get your coffee dispensed you do some small talk with the warden before finally getting a nice hot cup of joe
>Not too long after that the first of the gaurds show up
>Turning to wave at her
>then another woman steps in as well.
>Well turning to wave at both of them now
>Both wolves that easily have 2ft on you in height
>>You're told that they will be going with you on your first rounds to help you get acclimated to your surroundings
>Sounds simple enough
>Given a uniform to change into, you make it back just before 7:00AM and are immediately on the clock.
>Officers July & Lupa both meet up with you soon after as you make your way down to the cell blocks
>Officer July takes the lead & starts on the morning rounds, making sure that everyone is where they should be and that she doesn't have a Shawshank situation on her hands... Err well paws
>With a clip board in hand you go down the line with her as she start shouting off the first names on the list
>It isn't until you hear the first voice that something clicks for a moment
>In the cell is a large hyena woman with a severely scarred & disfigured muzzle with almost a sweet look on her face & a butch hair cut
>You paused at this for a moment
>Then with a single sentence from one of the prisoners, a shit show started
>"No fucking way, man meat's on the menu!"
>"Man meat? What?"
>"Fresh meat girls!"
>"Fox in the hen house! Fuck yeah!"
>Many muzzles begin suddenly jutting out from the bars as hooting & hollering begins quickly spreading through the cell block
>The other gaurds start shouting back at the prisoners to try & calm down the situation
>Suddenly you feel dozens of eyes on you as the prisoners shouting grows louder
>The tell tale signs of hyena yapping echoes through the block as well
>"Hey hunk over here! I'll let you put some handcuffs on me alright!"
>"Yo officers, what you packing?"
>The gaurds are of course ignored by much of this
>You're a bit confused as this point
>Shit were you seriously sent to a female prison?
>There had to have been a mix up in the middle of all this
>Seeing the situation was getting out of hand, your fellow gaurds (that you've now taken the opportunity to see Are all in fact woman as well) take out some ear protection
>Then a whistle is pulled out
>"Shreecher!"
>All that's shouted by one last prisoner before the whistle is blown
>Many of the prisoners go quite as they drop away from the bars clutching their ears
>You of course don't hear anything beyond the whimpers of the cell block
>After a few moments that seem to carry on a bit longer than you expected the whistle blower of officer July pulls the whistle out of her mouth & the block goes quite
>You all the meanwhile stand there awkwardly as you try to maintain a calm demeanor
>Taking off thier ear protection the officers in the room now count among 5 new gaurds, ranging from a pair of gators, a cheetah, a lion & what you were to guess was a snow leopard
>"ROLL CALL MEANS SHUT YOUR MOUTHS UNTIL YOUR NAME'S CALLED! NOW! SHUT UP! HIMERESS!"
>"...here..."
>Well. That sure happened. Officer lupa & July urge you to keep up with them as they go down the list of prisoners
>The awkward quite begins growing in a low mumbling as the prisoners begin talking amongst each other again & a few start trying to peek through their cell bars trying to catch a sniff towards you even
>"Hayswater... Betrny... Clemmons..."
>"sup"
>"yeah"
>"i hear ye"
>Passing by another cell one by one you feel hungry eyes locked on you
>The hyena gals make kissy faces at you, suggestively lick between their fingers, & a few even do some kind of almost flashing at you
>This.... Wasn't what you were expecting
>a female prison is one thing
>a female anthro prison is another
>a female anthro prison where the prisoners immediately start acting like... Well like that "little" outburst
>sure you had gone through all the proper courses to qualify for this job, but that wasn't What you-
>your thoughts are cut off as a arm suddenly extended from between the bars & grabbed your tie
>holy shit that's some arms reach
>A hyena gal
>this one make the other two your with look like pip squeaks. Easily 3-4ft taller than you
>she yanks you against the bars
>hard
>she begins roughly sniffing into your collar & shoulder, & quickly gives several wide & quite frankly sloppy licks across your neck
>You're definitely thrown off by this
>You quickly try to pull back from this, but with another slamming pull, you're slammed against the bars once again
>that's gonna leave a bruise
>She's now fervently sniffing & trying to lick & kiss you
>With a yank by officer Lupa, you're thrown backwards away from the cell bars as a nightstick is pulled out & cracks the prisoner across the inside of her elbows bend from officer July
>"You just earned yourself a week in the hole!"
>Officer Lupa kneels down, helping you up
>"Are you ok anon?"
>The only thing that hurts is slight bruising & your ego you assure her
>Wouldn't mind a wet wipe to clean off the slobber though, but you opt to just use your sleave
>You decide to take a deep breath & simply encourage the continuing of the rounds
>The rest of this portion goes fairly uneventful after that however
>Seeing one of the other prisoners get a clubbing seemed to have calmed some of the urges of the prisoners...for the time being at least
>After finishing his count at around 9:00AM, a senior correctional officer follows by double-checking their numbers.
>In essence, the job of all of these guards is to maintain status quo
>i.e., days when nothing happens are a victory.
>Each clock tick is a clap of applause for a job well done.
>When nothing happens at least....
>At least that's how officer Lupa had put it
>After the morning count, You Are told next on the docket is to accompany a group of inmates to a classroom
>they're going to be taught basic English, hoping to earn their GED/high school equivalency exam.
>the wardens hope, so that they can become a tradesman after they're released in a few years Officer Lupa explains
>These are the lucky and motivated prisoners who still believe they have a life.
>or at least are on good enough behavior to be given the opportunity
>Most of the others usually just end up playing poker for cigarettes and other favors
>Not too big of a surprise there at least
>with the other gaurds on standby, the good noodle club gets set free first, with their cells being opened
>among them is that one with the torn up muzzle all scarred to shit
>there's also a big burly girl with a hair cut that largely covers her eyes
>Scattered in behind them is a few other yeens, one being exceptionally short by anthro standards
>you think that even you might be taller than her
>she looks incredibly bored
>the others in tow all seem to be of varying degrees of fairly inconsequential as they begin blending in with one another
>with a knock & rasp of her stick, officer Lupa begins leading the group down & out of the cell block, with you & two other officers bringing up the rear of the line
>You could swear a few of the prisoners were trying to flash you along the way but with a quick shout coming from one of the anthro gaurds, they fall back in line
>it isn't long until you make it to the library of the complex
>& yeah, its an actual library & all that
>Modern monitor computers
>rows & rows of shelves of books
>Carts & trolleys & all that jazz
>fairly straight forward really
>the prisoner escorts, with a nod from the gaurds scatter among the library & go about their would be learning time
>as you begin slowly walking through the library, you double check your walkie. Check. Your club. Check. & you are sure to keep enough distance between you & the yeens... & tight corners, all the while making sure to keep an eye out of them
>Most go about their alotted time reading & such, though you do spot the mutilated muzzle girl from earlier
>Pushing a trolly, she's actually restocking the shelves
>Looking at her muzzle you actually manage to get a better look at it
>A scar starting (or ending) above her muzzle, between her eyes. It goes down towards the side of her mouth where a... Well a hole left in her muzzle the exposes her teeth at all times & even carving a small portion of her left nostril.
>It doesn't look like oral cancer
>Or oral ulcers
>It looks like someone ripped through it & tore a chunk of flesh out
>Though from the scar tissue's look, it must have been a long time ago
>"Uhh.... did you need something officer?"
>Wat
>Oh shit you've been staring
>& you were walking.
>You're like 10ft from her just... Staring
>You stop there awkwardly for a moment or two before clearing your throat & apologising to her
>she gives a toothy grin & mutters... Something
>you couldn't really make that out
>she gives your a lavacious look before seemingly having an internal debate, taking a step towards you
>An outstretched arm darts towards you & then... Oh she was grabbing a book behind you
>Though she does linger a bit, standing over you as she leans down, sniffing the top of your head
>Then simply walks away with the trolley.
>You could swear you heard her say something, but damned if you could tell what it was
>After making sure she didn't pick pocket anything off you, you wonder just what that was about
>The rest of the library is quite, as one would expect
>Beyond the ruffling of papers, or sounds of chairs scraping against the hard wood floor, the only other thing that was audible enough to hear was a pair of women at the far end of the library, going back & forth as one was apperently reading to the other from a history book
>"& when did the Gaul invade Rome?"
>"shit...uhh I know dis one..."
>The smaller woman had a bright blue collar around her neck & was apparently trying to learn about Roman history
>The one with the book, meanwhile had a cigarette... No that's a sucker.. A sucker hanging out of her mouth
>"come on baby girl, i know you know this one, it's the easiest in the book"
>"i know this shit, uhhh..."
>With a hand cupping the collared girls face, the would be teacher begins scratching along & under her chin
>Soon after, the sounds of what you can only assume are hyena whimpering & a foot bouncing off the floor
>The collared yeen's eyes become wistful in their gaze with their mouth hung open
>"i... Know this i swear i do..."
>"say it with me. Three hundred ninety bc. That's my girl"
>390bc? Huh you learned something....
>Who are the Gauls anyways?
>Then as you walk past the two, idly listening to the conversation for a lack of any thing better to do, the lollipop gal, tilts her head & looks at you over her shoulder
>"Hey officer, you wanna join in on this lesson? I think I need to give my girl here some proper motivation, & you look like you'd fit the bill"
>A wide toothy grin is thrown your way, as she waves the book in her hand, all the while she still scratches the muzzle of the collared one
>You take a breath & give a polite decline to the offer
>"you sure? Hey, offers open, I could always use another teacher's pet"
>you assure them you're more than sure
>Walking past them, she snakes a hand out & takes the opportunity to grab your ass with a pinch
>You grab your nightstick as she quickly draws her hand back & holds them up & out in a defensive manner
>don't push it
>heading back to the front of the library, you meet back up with Lupa & Lucy who have taken seats by the doors
>Pulling up a chair you sit with them with a sigh as officer Lupa is the first to speak up
>"The pinnacle of excitement, am I right?"
>Excitement seems to be what's going on around here you suppose. You do manage to speak up on how handsy the prisoners seem to be
>"Whatcha expect? Most These girls in here haven't seen a real man in months if not years."
>"You do seem to be the popular one around here today"
>"Half em are either on their way of becoming dykes or are wound up like springs"
>They're... Quite candid with how they're talking
>"Too far?"
>Not really too much per say, just a bit unexpected. This is probably the most attention you've ever gotten come to think of it. Though as a prison gaurd you wonder if you actually want to draw attention to yourself
>"Well it's a little late for that. Word's gonna spread like wild fire. Hope you enjoy being popular."
>"Ignore July, but look. We got your back. You're never gonna be too far from help round here. & tomorrow you'll get your assigned partner. I think the warden assigned Abby to you"
>Abby huh? Sounds like an alright name.
>As you continue to shoot the shit with your fellow correctional officers, you find yourself occasionally getting up to do another round around the library, heading up & down the aisles
>Beyond the occasional book being on the ground, or not pushed in all the way, you find it incredibly uneventful, beyond catching sight of the would be teacher pet combo going about their lessons &... Well teasing
>You keep an eye out for pretty much anything else, but it goes quitely
>You're just anxious you guess
>Then an alarm goes off on Officer Lupa's watch
>With a nod to July, she stands
>"alright ladies, line up, lunch time"
>The prisoners all begin getting up from what ever they were on, all lining up
>Going down the line, you list & check off them all, until you're sure you've got everyone.
>Then it's off to the cafeteria
>The way back down the halls to the cafeteria is a long walk but you aren't complaining. The thought of grabbing a meal yourself doesn't sound too bad
>Prison slop? Shit you forgot to pack a lunch. Ehh might as well grab something while you're here. Will need to get use to it anyways
>it's near 12 on the dot as you enter the mess hall
>& damn is this place big.
>Dozens of tables, all bolted to the ground & packed in with anthros
>looks like today is oatmeal & honey buns
>As everyone goes about their ways to get food, you also get in line &boy do you grab the cafeterias attention
>Though it's not as big of a reaction as you saw in cell block-H.
>They must have spread the word before hand
>But now, you start to notice just how many different kinds of anthros are here
>Ranging from wolves, Hyenas, bears, dogs, tigers, leopards, jaguars, lions & many traditional other big predators
>& far too many of them are staring you down like their next fresh prey
>You however opt to play it cool
>don't let them know they can get to you
>....& watch them trying to grab your ass
>Claws hurt
>You get a bowl with a side serving of a honey bun from the cafeteria worker, a leopard woman
>She blows a kiss at you as you pass by
>You're pretty sure she's blind in her left eye, it looked glassed over at least
>with your plate in tow, you shake it out of your mind. Staring is rude anon
>...might give them the wrong idea
>you do however spot a free & empty table at the far end of the cafeteria, not yet taken
>making your way over, you do start noticing a few things in here
>most of the tables seem to be taken up by one species or another
>The wolves are seemingly huddled around a single large grey furred woman
>The lions all sit around one that lounges across a table
>The bears look like they're arm wrestling or... Well you can't tell as the biggest sorta just watches
>the hyenas all don't seem to have any big chick in charge odly. Though maybe you're not familiar enough to know the difference
>Wait was that a shark?
>.... Double takes are for chumps
>You take your seat with your plate & decide to start chowing down
>wow yeah. This is basically terrible.
>You're really gonna have to bring in something next time
>Maybe some chinese food
>The oatmeal is bland & you're pretty sure uses actual oats in place of the "meal"
>More along the lines of a brown paste like substance that might be called food
>The honey bun on the other hand tastes fairly... Ok. It's a bread muffin, baked with actual honey apparently
>It's dry but what can you say beyond that?
>Though you're still on the thoughts from earlier, mainly being should a guy really work gaurd duty at a all female prison?
>pay rate is fair, food is almosy edible, & the drive is just barely tolerable, all in all, better than what you expected for your first job out of college
>though you're finding it interesting so far it is just the first day. Can't complain too much
>there was no orientation, & no real training on the job beyond shadowing your supervisors, & apparently they were already planning on giving you your partner
>they threw you way in the deep end
>it dawns on you now, that your supervisor might have either played you up a bit too much in his recommendations or maybe just the fact that you were his student carried name recognition
>you had fairly good grades so it's not like you weren't qualified it's more along the lines of-
>The table rattles a bit, drawing you from your thoughts
>Looking up, there across from you stands a Lion, licking her teeth with both hands on the table top
>man these tables sure do get scratched to shit & beyond
>oh right the inmate
>of course you ask if they wanted to sit & join you, no reason to not be polite when it might save you from getting shanked later
>The look on her face went from a ravenous grin to a look that almost spoke of mild disappointment, before running a clawed hand over & through her hair...fur? The top of her head.
>"Actually, was gonna ask if you wanted to join us over at our table, the Pride was hoping to get to know you officer..."
>Anon, you answer
>You politely decline but say they're more than welcome to join your table
>Last thing you need is a game of favouritism
>She glances over her shoulder as many of the other tables seem to be already eyeing over at the two of you
>This apparently was enough to dissuade her for the time being
>You're not sure why though
>She then stands & turns back to walk over to their 'Prides' table
>oddly enough this same thing is repeated by the other tables, ranging from the wolf's 'pack', to the bear's 'sleuth', the hyena's 'cackle' & even the leopard's 'leap'
>You gave the same answer each time
>though none of them took you up on it as they slump back to their groups
>you showing up definitely 'ruffled some fur' as the saying goes
>even the 'bask' of crocodiles declined
>go figure, this was all a game of posturing & you were caught in the middle now
>it didn't take too long for you to finish that slop, & to take care of your tray.
>& with that being done, you began to walk & patrol the cafeteria, as much as patroling a lunch room does at least
>12:37

Question. How DO anthro police deal with a suspect that threatens to castrate themselves or anything that could stop their virginity from being taken?

Start with reasoning, get them to see how silly it is being a virgin when their whole reason to exist is to mate anthros, offer supportive cuddles guiding them into the role.
Keep a tranq dart handy just incase they try something stupid. Breeder conditioning is a last resort and usually mind breaks them.

I'm thinking of using the male sanctuaries as places of recovery between all the sex for my expanded universe
It would be hard to keep them safe though the girls that look after them would need to be almost fanatical about their duty and powerful dom groups would want to raid them for trophy husbands

If it's illegal for a human over the age of 18 to be a virgin, how do you keep track of if a human has had sex or is still a virgin?

Mandatory penis inspection.
If those balls feel too heavy or theres no trace of a female they need to be taken right there. It's unhealthy for a male to be pent up and frustrated.

>holding on together despite this shity world and it's shitty people
>warm cozy fur as she spoons you and you lay on top of her.
cons (for some)
>she is the only one you will ever have or will have sex is with

it will take you some time to get accustom to the heat cycle
expect to get utterly destroyed the first couple of times her body goes maximum breeding mode on you, pretty much guaranteed pregnancy
careful not to lose your mind to her hormones...unless thats what you want

>Be a male human
>Unfortunately your country's culture associates your kind with high libidos, fertility, and a body type that seems to be considered universally charming by females
>So after graduating high school and surviving a few close calls, you decided to dress as a wolf in order so that you will stop getting sexually harassed

>"Hey, uh, could I just take a quick whiff? You smell really good."
>None of your friends know that you're human, so they don't realize how bothered you are being around her

>Lupa scoffs at this & sighs, rolling her eyes & moving onto another prisoner
>Ok then
>You however move over to the lioness... You now realize she has almost 2ft on you in height. Most anthros are taller than your average human, but it's still a bit jaring at times
>You take a comb & brush & get to work
>You start at her head fur
>Methodically combing through her fur in the longer patches, you occasionally spread the tufts along her neck & shoulders that she seems more than alright with letting grow out
>Comb to untangle, brush to straighten & flatten, with the occasional catches of furred knots
>so far nothing
>you eventually get to their arms as you patiently ask them to raise their arms out so you can check
>she of course complies, as you begin combing through her fur on her biceps & triceps, even checking the shoulder.
>soon you get to the wrists & at this point the fur is really to short at the end to both combing there
>Then for a moment it clicks to you, she's purring
>Out of the corner of you eye you actually realize she's staring down at you with a all too wide grin

>You say screw it & tell Lupa she can take back over
>"You started this, you can finish it"
>Seriously Lupa?
>"what's wrong officer? Scared of a little tlc? I won't bite... Much"
>You think to yourself on the implications of that, given they're an actual lion
>With that she drops her shirt, with only her sports bra left
>Just bam, one fluid motion
>With an internal sigh you get back to the combing for anything
>You do try to back out again once or twice just to avoid rumors, but apparently the other guards are enjoying the chance to tease you over it
>Fine then
>you begin combing through the fairly long back hair, though really that's fairly easy compared to the other spots
>The stomach fur is easy too
>Through all of it, you note that she does have a fairly toned body, but seriously, you're not trying to be skeevy
>It doesn't help that she's periodically trying to lean into you through it all
>She also seems to be trying to show off to the other lions in the room odly enough
>Weird flex but ok
>eventually you get done with the last of the front side of her, ignoring a few jeers from the crowd of watchers that you wouldn't take her bra off
>you're just about to put the comb away before Lupa speaks up again
>"nah nah nah Mr. Anon. This was suppose to be a full body trim. You got her legs left. & hurry up will ya? We got like 20 other girls to get to"

>within moments you were on your back
>you felt something fluffy...around your ears?
>oh shit
>yeah well she fell on you alright
>& in the process you were now using her inner thighs as a pair of ear muffs
>With her crotch shoved right in your face, pressed right against your nose
>she you can't breath
>You try to push her off but no dice
>you tap on her thigh to try to get her to get off you but-
>is she grinding on your face now?
>The room exploded into a cacophony of cheering & whooping
>You only heard it through muffled sounds of course
>She was rolling her hips now
>"whoops! Sorry about that officer Anon, i think i slipped"
>holy shit lady get off
>You had lioness muff sitting on your face & she wasn't fucking getting up
>Grinding down on your face & rolling her hips, it didn't take a genius to figure out what she was doing
>oh shit your nose is wet
>You try to shout up at her but with a muffled voice, all you get back from her is a chuff
>"sorry officer what was that? I can't understand you. I think i twisted my ankle"
>she was straddling your face right now & you couldn't get her off of you
>what's that smell?
>the other officers mean while tried to figure out what just happened & get a control on the situation
>The inmates were shouting & whooping
>They were being shouted at the get against the wall
>You couldn't see any of this of course
>Lupa didn't miss a beat though
>Tossing the clippers onto the counter she rushed the woman
>you had a few moments between staring up at the grinning lioness & a view of her cream & graying fur colored cleavage & seeing a sudden blur of a grey furred wolf that bull tackled her to the ground
>hey you can breath again
>you cough a bit now, being able to breath, you sit up & wipe your face off with your sleeve
>oh
>it's wet
>Well. That just happened
>wait
>you're not done here yet
>you quickly get to your feet as you see Lupa pinning the lioness woman to the ground
>surprisingly they put up very little of a fight
>Lupa seems fairly pissed
>"You earned yourself a trip to the box bitch!"
>Her & another officer (what you assume to be a Kodak bear) are pinning her to the ground & handcuffing her
>"You ok Officer anon?"
>beyond a sore elbow from smacking on the ground, you're actually ok
>You're not too sure on how you feel on being molested just now.... Wait would that be molestation or what?
>You don't really know what to call that
>You look over to the lioness &... Oh wait, her ankle actually does look twisted
>was that actually an accident?
>you point it out to Lupa & with a few paused moments, you can practically see the gears turning in her head & she doesn't look entertained
>You suggest getting her to the infirmary
>"whoa hey that was an accident i swear"
>The lioness actually speaks up now
>"the chair spun, that totally wasn't my fault"
>she still has that grin, even as she stares up at officer Lupa
>Lady You're not helping your case here
>You feel conflicted
>on one hand you're pretty sure she just tried to get you to eat her out
>& on another hand, she actually does have a twisted ankle from the looks of it
>Nah she wouldn't be crazy enough to try something like that
>right?
>"Seriously, I slipped there. I didn't even lay a finger on him, you all saw"
>She's still not fighting against the officers though at least
>They move to stand her up & the moment she gets on that foot, sure enough, she lets out a string of expletives
>She quickly drops to the ground, dead weighting it
>raising her left leg in the air, you manage to see a bone seemingly jutting out to the side
>yeah that's a sprain... Maybe it's out of socket? Either way her foot is Fucked from the looks of it
>"hey cut the shit & stand up"
>Lupa, chill seriously
>"I can't, my fucking foot hurts"
>"i said stand up"
>Lupa hooks a hand under her armpit & pulls her up to her feet again
>Yeah the lioness isn't really able to stand on that foot
>can't even put any of her weight on it really
>she nearly stumbles at this as Lupa draws her club
>"I'm not playing these games with you. I said stand up!"
>Lupa chill out, seriously
>You move over & help the lioness stand for a moment
>Sure you kinda wanna slap her for what just happened but cooler heads prevail
>ok Lupa, look. Her ankles fucked up. You & another officer can take her to the infirmary & get her ankle checked, & file the report later. You insist that it was infact a accident & no real harm was done
>besides, the group's got like 20 anthros to give fur trims out to
>Lupa looks pissed but relents after thinking on it
>"Ffffffine. Take her to the infirmary, take Officer Tetrerra with you."
>You sigh & nod as Lupa takes the cuffs off her
>officer Tetrerra, the bear woman is idly scratching herself.
>The two of you make eye contact & she simply shrugs
>You prop up the lioness & pass her clothes to her
>She puts her shirt on easy enough but it takes a few tries to get her pants on without her swearing bloody murder under her breath
>from there, you half expect the anthro bear gaurd to help you walk & prop up the lioness...
>but she simply leads you to the infirmary & doesn't bothering offering help
>Well, time to do your best impression of a crutch
>Helping her stand, you take her arm around your shoulder & begin to walk
>It's actually quite the distance too
>The bear lady has already seemingly lost interest in you two as she simply walks on towards the place you're going
>the lioness however is still fixated on you though
>There's that grin of hers again
>"I do love me a man in a uniform"
>Seriously, don't push it
>"pfft I'd rather deal with you than the mut"
>isn't she injured? Where'd that go?
>she isn't really doing much but limping on it though, so you choose to ignore it
>She's heavier than you expected
>She doesn't look fat, though being much taller (& in better condition from the looks of it) you're not all that surprised
>Maybe you should hit the gym sometime
>it doesn't help she's leaning into you so much
>she has a tendency to try & rest her tits on your shoulder, instead of walking straight & it's not hard for you to notice
>You clear your throat a few times to try & get your point across, though this seemingly just encourages her more
>You briefly ponder the idea of dropping her if she doesn't stop but your decide against it
>eventually you all make it to the infirmary as the bear officer, Tetrerra, opens the door for you
>As she does, she doesn't even really wait for you & just walks on in
>a few moments later she's talking to the nurse & you're helping the lioness into a infirmary bed
>You end up helping her swing her leg over the side & get her up in place
>with that, you're satisfied you did your job
>"oh what's wrong officer anon? Leaving so soon? I thought we could pick up where we left off"
>Yeah haha very funny, Don't push it
>She makes another of those odd chuff sounds
>"playing hard to get will get you everywhere with me officer"
>You ignore this & insist the nurse will take care of you mam
>"Please, you can call me Arya, officer Anon"

>being held in a completely submissive position
>she's breastfeeding you
>she teases your dick at the same time
>you feel powerless yet safe
>she coaxes out a "mommy" whimper from you
>you're completely under her spell

>Be anon
>In a neighborhood with no female anthros
>Think you've finally hit the fucking jackpot, after witnessing many of your fellow male buddies getting raped and being forced into early fatherhood by waifurs and other female anthros you think you're safe
>Cute human girl even starts flirting with you
>Then one night you wake up at 2 in the morning and see a GODDAMN PORTAL TO HELL
>Out steps this Amazonian Hellhound
>"Hey there kiddo, my heats been pretty bad
>She's got you pinned to the bed
>"Think you can help me out and fuck my heat away?"
>You beg and plead but it's no use.
>"Virgin huh? Well get ready cause that cherry is as good as gone."
>The rest of the night is you getting fucked by a hellhound.
>By the time morning comes she leaves, but not before giving you a smile and a wink.
>"See ya around lover boy, us hell hounds mate for life."
>In laymen's terms, your absolutely fucked.

Hard to port
>In addition to helping the crew work off their heat cycles you made yourself useful getting to grips with the ships sensor systems, the wolves seemed to enjoy a male helping out
>Although they wouldn't hear of you doing anything too risky like going near the reactor core or space walking
>Sex with the others was totally different to Alpha
>It was just helping a friend out, there was gratitude but no love, calming their bodies without the need for chemical suppressants or renting a slave boy
>Now when Alpha got intimate it was intense devotion on another level!
>She'd slather you in affection, ratcheting up the pleasure till it overwhelmed your body and mind, leaving an exhausted sweat drenched quivering wreck in her wake
>Every time
>Even as her glowing belly gradually swelled with the first litter
>Your heart was hers and no others, as hers was yours, forever
>But it wasn't all snuggling among the stars and messy mating
>While Alpha's mark gave you a share of her status and a lil passive protection from other anthros, Doc was still protesting your freedom
>"How can you be so reckless! Taking our breeder to a mercenary bar? What if it was kidnapped or worse, damaged? I'm a doctor not a magician"
>Doc meant well, she was just...utilitarian. To her it made no sense for a male to do anything but breed
>Still she was a damn good medic, quickly yanking out the darts that peppered Beta's body then dressing the wounds
>...And to be fair, Beta had started the fight...
>The port seemed relaxed enough for you to join the girls for once
>It was a lazy feline town on a dusty sun blasted rock. Various cats wondered around. There was a tigress playfully painting stripes on her pet human in sun cream, till she noticed a pack of wolves rolling up and retreated inside
>All you needed to do was kick back in a bar looking rough while Alpha went upstairs to talk business with a panther
>Which was no problem at all
>Piling into a corner booth you got squished snug with the pack, first round on Beta, empty glasses stacking up one after another
>Your sisters encouraged you to try various cocktails. Excited that you finally joined them for a party. It was only a sip from each different colored drink but it soon added up
>Now it was your round!
>But you had no credits!
>Undeterred by this a pair of helping paws got you up onto the table as very merry wolves stuffed money into your clothes, chanting "Your round! Same again!"
>Waddling over to the bar to put in the order got a good laugh from the lemur behind it, she lent over picking a handful of bills from your body
>"Oops one too many, sweet stuff"
>Winking she slid the extra credit into your pants and set about mixing
>At this point a leopard on the stool beside you decided it was safe to make a move
>Her tail casually snuck under your top, curling around your chest to gently hold you in place
>"Mreow, hey there cutie, come play with a pretty kitty"
>Obviously that was a terrible idea but as you politely declined and tried to unhook her tail it wrapped around your arms instead
>"Oh come on sugar dick! Strutting around here then not giving kitty her cream? I'll double whatever those dogs are paying"
>Once again rejecting her you flashed the mating marks on your neck
>Knowing exactly what they represented she gave a jealous snarl
>"Urgh mutilated by mutts, i only fuck clean humies not flea bit-"
>An empty bottle sailed through the air cracking the cat clean over the head, followed by howls of cheer from your booth
>Beta had quite the throwing arm
>Out cold the leopard began to fall off her perch towards the tiled floor. Foolishly trying to catch the big cat you wound up cushioning her fall with your smaller body
>Other feline patrons didn't take kindly to this. Not one bit. The jazz music stopped with the sound of a whole lot of guns cocking
>Fortunately you were not the target and almost no one carried lethal weapons in dom universe, after all, you can't dominate the dead
>Unfortunately that meant most anthros were packing various poison darts, stun guns and other painful devices
>Flipping their table, sending shot glasses everywhere your pack dropped into a defensive square. A hail of darts filled the air. Plinking off walls, smashing bottles, dropping felines, making a huge mess of the joint
>The lemur barkeep yanked you over the counter into some hard cover
>"Head down handsome. Armor plated"
>She smiled and tapped the bar, clearly no stranger to these kind of events
>"I err, im gonna need the rest of that money from you though, sorry babe"
>You couldn't really argue with that and helped her unpick the cash from your clothing
>A stun grenade went off, shaking the room with a deafening blast
>A comforting yet annoyed voice came through the ringing in your ears
>"LADIES! REALLY!? WHERE IS MY MATE?"
>Seeing you peak out from the pin cushioned bar Alpha ran to you, still quite agile this early into pregnancy, whining in relief and lapping your face
>The panther scratched her head, seemingly doubting the arrangements that had just been made upstairs
>"Yo, Alph...You sure you don't want that yeen run? Pays 4x alive, 2x dead...buys a nice quiet den for the pups"

>meeting up with your childhood friend after several years since you moved away
>she's grown utterly enourmous and maybe more frisky than the last you wrestled together
>though she still likes chatting about anime

>graduate
>try to get more skills in customer service
>find an ad about servicing
>anthro shark boss makes me sign the necessary papers
>walk to the training room.
>it is just a bed with shackles
>turn around and she has full dominatrix setup
>before I can protest she has me already collared, leashed, gagged and tied to the bed
>only time when she removes the gag is either when she forces her long tongue down my throat or makes me eat her out.
>get my pelvis bruised by monsterous breeding

>Red Riding Hood was invented by human mothers as a cautionary fable to their sons to stay aware from anthro women
>the Big Bad Wolf devouring the young human was actually a euphemism for the loss of virginity

Anon the prison guard
>Arya huh?
>Stop making my job harder Arya
>You don't say it out loud though go figure
>Well. Ok. Arya. Well like you said, the nurse should be more than able to take care of her from here
>You've got work to get back to
>The nurse will get her ankle settled
>"Don't forget to cuff her to the bed"
>Huh?
>Oh yeah the nurse, right
>turning around & sure enough, there she is. A honey badger? Yeah you're pretty sure at least
>What's her name badge say?
>Dr. Honee
>Not gonna drop any puns here
>"so, what did you bring me officer.... Anon?"
>She reads your badge as well, before turning back to face Arya
>You explain how Mrs. Arya here slipped on a chair &... Uhh... She either sprained her ankle or popped it out of socket
>Not sure which, but the bone's jutting out
>She moves over to the grayed lioness & places a hand on their ankle looking it over
>"Yeah it's dislocated alright."
>Is it serious? You've popped in your shoulder back in place before
>She of course shakes her head
>"A dislocated ankle usually is very unstable. Your foot is generally pulled outward, but the joint does not pop back into place as a shoulder might. Ususlly with the aid of nurses, we'd positions the foot in the ankle joint and holds it in place while a cast is applied. But I'm the only one here today"
>She gets one of those straps that you generally see used for pregnant women, the ones used for elevating legs
>She lowers it with a winch & places it under the felines calf before raising it back up
>"looks like I'll have to settle for you"
>wait. You're totally not qualified for that
>"ehh it's easy. Besides, if anything goes wrong, we've got insurance"
>You & Arya both share a look that doesn't show confidence
>"First up, pain killers for the kitty here."
>She goes across the room & grabs a cup & unlocks & relocks a cabinet with pills in hand
>oh shit right
>You do click a pair of handcuffs to the bed frame & the lion's (other) leg
>almost forgot that part
>"swallow this"
>They pass a small red pill to Arya & with the water in hand, throws it back & gulps it
>You take the cup back & set it on the counter
>"you're not gonna just slam it back in place like you might with a shoulder. You're gonna need a splint & cast once we align it, so don't expect to be going out to the yard any time soon"
>Arya makes a few Sounds that clearly indicate a lack of happiness
>"Seriously? I can walk with a cast"
>"Seriously, no you can't. It'll be maybe a week, not like it's permanent"
>Dr. Honee moves to a little mini fridge (opened with a key of course) & pulls out an ice pack
>Makes sense
>placing it to the side, she rolls up the pant leg & looks over the foot
>"hold her leg still please"
>it's kinda in a strap already but ok
>The Doctor Begins tilting & turning the ankle this way & that way, with her palm over the jutting bone point
>"Closed reduction is a pain in the ass if you ask me, but it's better than cutter her open to set it by force"
>Then you hear a click sound & you feel her leg muscles tense up. Hard.
>Just as her leg tries to kick, you manage to hold it against your chest & prevent the doc from getting a clawwed foot to the jaw, & the foot broken any further
>You were raised like a foot off the ground
>Holy shit she has strong legs
>then the doc pulls you towards her end
>"Hold her foot right there. Don't let out move, right there, ok? I need a minute"
>Sure enough you take her foot in hand once again
>the way she took your hand to it, you have her toe beans in hand
>oddly soft
>"*chuff* officer of I didn't know better I'd say You like playing with my feet"
>she does know you can just let her foot go & fuck up her ankle evenfurther right?
>You take a deep breath & sigh
>Dr. Honee comes back soon enough
>Two thin slabs of plastic, in the shape of anthros weird non-human feet
>it's not that weird, but what ever
>some cotton padding in hand too
>Oh it's a splint, right
>"Alright, let me take that paw back from you"
>You ask if there's anything else for you to do at this point
>"yeah, place the splint on the hock please. Keep it under her knee, & wrap the straps near the midpoint & ankle"
>uhh human relevant terms?
>"oh for the love of... Hock is the ankle arch, midpoint is basically the shin. & i hope you know what a knee is"
>"leave space open at the top hock joint by 2 inches & by two inches at the bottom hock joint, align it & wrap the velcro. Just don't get her fur caught in it"
>uhh shit right Ok
>Oh wait it fits in place pretty easily
>of course it does, it's suppose to, duh
>You of course flatten out her fur along her ankle (earning a slight hiss from Arya in the process) before fitting the splint in place
>A couple velcro straps later & it's holding fairly easily
>The doc then let's go unceremoniously & grabs the ice pack, placing it on the ankle
>"congrats, you're a trained professional now"
>fucking hooray
>she then goes & grabs what looks like a oversized boot-flip flop hybrid
>"put that on & I'll go get the wheelchair"
>wheelchair? God damn it
>You take the boot & fit it over their splint & fit it under her toes
>well she could probably "walk" on it now but apparently they're getting a wheelchair
>Shit you're gonna have to walk her aren't you?
>"Man, a woman could get use to this kind of attention"
>You don't even have a walkie on you to ask where to take her
>& where the hell did officer Tetrerra go?
>uhh right the doc, where are you suppose to take her?
>"Huh? Stock ward I guess? Take her to the t.v. room or something. Take her back to their cell block later or something"
>"shit, can't i just sit in this yard?"
>on a fucked foot? No probably not
>wait, Which way is that?
>"on the library's hall can't miss it"
>...ok
>& there's the wheelchair
>Welp. You unlock their cuffs & then with a bit of lifting, you help this kitty
>You thank the doctor for their time before heading back in your way
>giving her a helping hand, you get the lioness into the wheelchair with a slight heft
>sure she's bigger than you, but you're not a total weakling
>thus she's in the chair
>& with that you begin walking her down the halls once again, closingb the door behind you
>at this point Arya is simply leaning on her armb resting her palm under her chin watching the hell in half interest,before occasionally glancing over her shoulder at you
>you of course areb only paying half attention to her at this point as you try to remember just where the hell to go to get to the library wing
>it was left at the brown pillar then a right from that big window that looked like it had a face print in it... No right at the brown pillar, the brown stain towards the ceiling? Wait that's more beige than brown. Maybe red? Uhh sand stone? Fuck it it's brown.
>good, it's looking familiar at least
>Past J-Block & through the check point
>Hey there's the library, cool
>Ok past the library and-
>Wait since when was Arya holding onto your hand?
>Over her shoulder, she has her hand on yours
>Gently clasping the back of your hand, she's not really looking at you, nor is she having that big ol cocky look
>you clear your throat a bit at this, & it only is really answered by a slight squeeze on your hand
>it goes on like this for a bit longer thanyou're really comfortable with before she simply lets her hand slide off
>ok? What was that about?
>You're still walking either way & looking for the tv room
>uhhh past the library? In the same hall. That's a load of information thanks doc
>You then decide to simplify it & ask Arya where it is
>"Fuck if I know, they never gave me t.v. time"
>thanks for contributing
>Peaking in the door sites, you either walk past what looks like a few offices, a meeting room, a room with a bunch of chairs in a circle & a room with just a table & two chairs
>Seriously where the fu- oh there it is
>T.v. room, big ol sign & everything
>you roll up & sure enough, doors open.
>there's a pair couches & even a few old lazy-goy© recliner chairs
>A ping pong table is off to the side
>oh hey, also a small group of prisoners are here & another officer, A... Lynx you think
>"here to take over? About time, i gotta hit the bathroom"
>huh? Wait what? Uhh no you're just here to drop off Arya &-
>She's already jogging past you, not even hesitating
>Hold on you're not assigned over here right now, you gotta get back to-
>Wait where the fuck did that officer go?
>Shit she's far down the hall
>...ok
>well you wheel Arya over to the couch area & ask where she wants to go
>"what ever, any where"
>The other prisoners in the room are all watching soam old soap opra
>Days of our 9 lives or something
>Jesus that's old
>You wheel her up to a empty spot & after you go to stand pretty much where the other officer was
>you do manage to look at the local clock though
>oh hey, you've got like an hour left
>Honestly, you hope the lynx chick doesn't take long, you need to get back to the others & figure out you're actual schedule
>"hey officer Anon?"
>You're pretty sure this isn't how things are suppose to be run either, like, usually they got officers in pairs right?
>"hello? Hey boy toy, talking to you"
>maybe you're just too new to have the hang of it yet, maybe you'd get use to it
>"dude, are you even listening?"
>wait, do you get assigned a desk? You're full time but they didn't say you had a set time sheet or not
>"Hey!"
>huh?
>oh shit people are talking to you
>What did Arya want
>"what you don't like me now? & here i thought we had something special"
>She makes a fake pouty face, obviously enough
>"Come watch tv with us, shit's boring"
>You blink a bit
>Oh. Tv. Right.
>Then you do notice, these other prisoners are all looking at you too, with verying degrees of interest
>mostly felines with 3 of them being... Jaguars? Yeah jaguars.
You think on it for a moment, before taking a seat on a coach near an arm rest
>There's not as many claw marks on the rests as you'd expect there'd to be
> The cushion however look like they've been replace a dozen times over though
>you realize this is probably a fairly dumb idea to sit with them, but you figure they don't want to lose t.v. privileges
>they probably won't do anything... Probably
>so. Is This what they usually watch?
>"it's the only thing that's ever on. One of those wolf bitches broke the old remote & can't change it no more"
>That was one of the jaguar women speaking up
>Just change the channel on the tv &- oh. The tv has coverings.
>to keep the inmates from fucking it up?
>It's a "flat screen" tv. Maybe one from the 2010s with a cable box on top of it
>roughly a 40' you'd guess
>But yeah, on the tv is just some old drama network with what looks like old reruns.
>You'd probably see the three stuges or leave it with Mrs. Beaver if you watched long enough
>regardles you're sitting there on the couch as you watch tv with the inmates, from time to time scanning the room of them all to make sure they're not doing anything stupid
>Same count as before
>beyond the occasional long glance that is usually followed by some variant of a chuff or purr, they look incredibly bored
>maybe you could bring in an old universal remote you have around your place
>wait, would that be allowed?
>maybe?
>you can't think of any reason why not
>it would make tv time a little less shit at least
>from looking around, you don't notice much to the room
>It's just a small Room with a tv, a couple couches & chairs in front of it & a ping pong table in the corner
>it doesn't look like there's any balls though
>Maybe they lost them?
>after making another intetnal note you are brought back to reality to the lioness known as Arya plopping down awkwardly next to you
>she was hopping on one foot
>wouldn't it have been easier to just stay in the wheel chair?

>be friends with spotted hyena since a young age
>he's bigger than you and kinda rough, but reigns it in when he sees how easy it is to hurt humans
>still very cuddly and protective
>hang out a lot through the years
>visit each other's family/sleep over often enough
>his mom is huge and scary looking, but is very sweet and also protective of you too
>his family keeps sniffing you all the time though
>get into all sort of shenanigans
>trips to the lake to swim are really fun and spotted hyenas really love playing in the water
>even skinny dipped one time with him and his siblings
>years later and still friends when puberty rolls around
>friends is even bigger than you now
>he also grew tits and big hips/ass?
>turns out hyena friend is a female spotted hyena
>you were a dumb kid who knew nothing of spotted hyena sexual dimorphism or such
>teenage years are now very awkward with your friend acting the same way but more aggressive/assertive in general
>she still wants to cuddle up to you, wrestle you, and give friendly licks
>this is a very confusing time for you
>friend still gets bigger, guess she takes after her mother who you learn from research is the matriarch
>high school is very weird
>hugs from her are very different with your head being swallowed by her cleavage
>puberty wasn't that kind and you're kind of short
>she doesn't mind since you easily fit in her lap
>social ladder/school social standing makes even less since for you since your friend is on the football team and up their with the jock types, but hangs around you
>you were bullied a couple of times, but that never lasted long when she caught wind and made sure that stopped violently and immediately
>end up falling in with her and the other hyenas
>became a typical metal head with the one most likely to blame falling on your friend's mother for having classic metal playing at her house all the time
>hormones and teenage experimenting is really weird with a female spotted hyena friend
>masturbating together while watching a porno is weird
>spotted hyena porn is... interesting you find out
>end up checking each other out due to differences
>she's bigger than you in every way and seeing her fingering and stroking her pseudopenis is very weird and kinda hot
>she's not at all shy being around you naked while you're awkward about it
>her tits and black nipples look nice
>next thing you know she has tackled you into the couch and starts frotting against you, guess the porno got her too riled up
>now that is a very interesting feeling combined with her fur
>when she starts licking and nibbling on your neck, face, and lips you're making all kinds of noises she likes
>catches you in the middle of a moan and shoves her tongue in your mouth and down your throat
>like you said, she's bigger than you in every way
>that tongue is very big, long, and thick
>probably looks like she's trying to eat your head from the side
>your balls and her pseudo testes are touching and rubbing together
>does that mean this is gay?
>things start to feel weird downstairs when it feels like her pseudopenis is shrinking?
>turns out it was retracting into her and then one final big hump against you thrusts you inside her
>this pushed the both of you over the edge
>she collapses onto you and covers you completely with her body
>you're both panting heavily, but eventually you both get your second wind with you hardening back up inside her and her grinding starting back up
>unfortunately you're both blue balled when her mother walks in
>there needs to be a word that describes beyond how awkward for this situation is
>her mother is being a pretty good sport about it, but still being a bitch by busting both your balls
>she figured this would happen eventually with how her daughter was dragging a cute boy around all the time
>this time when and the way she calls you cute makes you tingle weirdly and blush
>you remember the research you did on spotted hyenas
>though she does make you both wash the "tainted" couch

Oh silly anoness. Why would I need more than one human good boy to take care of when I already have one with all the sweetness my canine heart can handle. 
Besides. The woods are no place for my sweet boy. 
I’m thinking of moving to the suburbs with him to raise pups and little humans with him~. I wonder if our sons will have his hair and my eyes... hmm

How do you treat broken humans?

You cuddle them evey time they looked anxious, depressed, and shy.

My human is always shy though.

Then give him some more babies. That always seems to cheer mine up. Especially when I have him hold his sons. They look just like their papa~

>human males are shy and reclusive
>till you mate them
>then they blossom into ever more virile father's with each batch of kids
>large families are pretty normal
they are so happy and fulfilled as husband's. I don't even know why humies hide away

They need help and a guiding paw to gently nudge them in the right direction. I suspect years of social engineering has made them complacent to the thought of not being able to find a female to reproduce with... the poor dears... having what you thought you never would have suddenly offered to you on a silver platter can give you some serious “too good to be true” syndrome. It’s our duty to demonstrate that we’re being sincere

>humans exploring space
>tech is better, but not that much
>still in bulky space suits
>aliens that look like big anthros come across us
>they're friendly and bring the crew to their planet/one of theirs or one of their stations
>notice the aliens seem to be mostly female or female dominant
>the big alien anthros find the shorter creatures interesting and are curios about them with their bulky suits obscuring them completely
>the little things do their tests and so adorably excited about our alien tech
>they finish their tests and deem it's safe to take off their unwieldy suits
>we're all so curious what they look like
>they start taking them off and we all notice immediately they have no fur!
>no claws, horns, spines, or any protective armor on their skin
>and they are even smaller without those large suits covering them
>and they look so soft and vulnerable
I-I-I want to protect them and maybe chase the poor helpless little things around~
>and then it really hits all us when we catch their scent
>male, they're all male
>how could their species females let precious males do such a dangerous job as space exploration
>what if they died?!
And then they learn there's a whole planet of vulnerable furless males and just how many available males there are. And they get thinking decadent thoughts like each female could have their own male they didn't have to share.

>go into anthro wedding store

Sounds wholesome desu. Anthros proposing to you first with a garter would be great.

>then one night, at the top of the hill over looking the town she presented you with a small box

What are human/anthro pornos like? Like,what's the dialogue like?

>"make me a single father!"
>"human women don't do anything for me anymore!"

Humans are NOT sluts

What are they doing in pornos then?

Re enactment/ametuer videos of purity surrender are a popular porn category.
"BandBreakers" is a huge site
Videos that manage to capture close ups of garter rips and their first toe curling, eye rolling, paw squeezing orgasm to an anthro pussy get millions of hits.
No words are needed for that moment. The whines of overwhelming pleasure humans emit say it all.
Real virgins are left in quite a messy state from their first time, the pro actors can often be identified at this point as they usually won't be utterly KO'd during the tongue bath aftermath.

Lovingly being fucked into a stupor by their wives. Most anthro female on human male porn videos are done by loving spouses. Yes, even the gangbangs. Most people put a marriage clause in the porn document, that's why you usually see men getting fucked by the same female or species.
Even if it's solo, I promise you his wife is probably touching herself off camera.

Remember to hold your human tight. And make sure to press his face into your chest so he breathes in your scent.

Remember that cuddling for longer periods of time help your scent linger more

Humies enjoy ear rubs just as much as any anthro but can find tongue baths unusual at first
Start with some neck and face licks then work over them as they relax into it

>thought he was ugly, used to wear a hoodie and mask whenever he went out

Let them become obsessed with you and reward their obedience.

hummie males are pretty easy to tame
just keep their belly full and balls empty and in a few weeks they won't know why they ever tried to live any other way.

we want cuddles too...


And we want to give you them
But first you need to be a good boy
Take off those silly clothes, our bodies are all the warmth you'll never need from now on

oh...yes ma'am!

There, that's better, don't you agree?
I don't even know why humans hide there cute bodies
Our fur is the only covering you need, get nestled in deep, darling
Smells wonderful doesn't it? Soft, warm and deep. I keep well groomed for you ya know
I knew you were a good boy, I'll sort your release papers after you've gone to sleep
You'll be safe with me

>be me
>born blind
>turn of age
>get provided a service anthro
>she is gentle
>never abuses me
>always careful
>never tried any funny business
honestly anons I don't see the problem
you guys are probably overreacting

Humans shouldn't be allowed to wear clothes. I don't know why it hasn't been made illegal already. It's the right of anthro women to gaze at human bodies for as long as we want. If a human wants to hang out at my house, I'm making him take his clothes off first then hiding them away somewhere. He can have them back when he leaves.
Odds are good he's staying the night and won't want to leave me once I'm done with him, but still.

>"They don't got fur. They'll get hypothermia or get sick in general. You radical human abusers make me sick"

>LOL LETS GET THEM SICK AND DIE OFF

Just make them stay at home with their waifurs. What have they got to do outside? Get a job? The only things human boys are good for are done in the kitchen and bedroom.

>Not valuing your humans as equals
>Not wanting to do more than just fuck with them

As I said last time, you're all a bit rape-happy.
That can cause some serious distress due to the high chance that the humie doesn't want to be forced into it.
Show them some love and affection first, and they'll come after you.

If you like sissy cry boys that's fine but just who are you to tell two consenting partners how to make out?
Sure there are bad girls out there but my mate comes to me begging to be bound and claimed by his jungle queen.
That's a bond of love and trust that cannot be forced.

Hey, boy. I can help get the fuzz off of you. But this could get me in some trouble, so it's a lot to ask, and I'll need a favor in return. A life long favor, you could say.
How about it, boy? You interested in getting to know me better?

>Ywn get tangled up with the furry crime lords
Got a lotta cops snooping around.
But my pretty boys will take care of them, won't ya sugar dick?
Yeah they'll keep those dogs busy all night.
So you better be at the docks when my yayo comes in.
Who cares if the yeens know about it?

A trap within the context of this thread would be a human male dressed as an anthro.
Humans would absolutely be cheer leaders for their team and get fucked in the locker room after the big game.

Ooh, I like this idea. For male uniforms I expect them to be form-hugging and revealing. I'm a degenerate though so I can enjoy either. Either way, I'd like to be on the cheer squad and attract the attention of the captain, and prove myself the best in the squad at making the team happy.

>Spectators think humie cheer leaders are just for show
>Actually important for boosting your team and throwing their opponents off balance
>Have to make your routine sexy enough to draw attention but not so much that you get tackled and fucked in front of a thousand cheering fans
>Have friends and rivals from other teams
>Give the girls comfort if they lose
>Get carried off as a trophy and wild after party sex when they win
>As alpha leader your strictly the captain's boy
>Takes forever to clean her scent off when you make out after training
>But you have to do it so as not to ruin her game
>Besides she loves reapplying it all over you, you've been licked in places you never thought possible

>be college/high school human
>get recruited/lured by the sports team to wear the mascot uniform
>end up getting gangbanged in the locker room by the team after every game, win or lose. They like it if you keep the animal helmet on.
>they're also rougher if they lose.
>the coach and her assistants get in on it too after practice. They also throw you into the locker room to help the team cool down as well.
>team grumbles a bit because sloppy seconds, but deal with it because team hierarchy and the knowledge that they themselves get first dibs every won game

>Be human male in world with anthros
>Anthros go into heat at separate times
>You usually avoid being alone with big anthros, but you have a chart with heat periods so you should know which ones to avoid at certain times
>You also have certain warning signs so you know when to avoid them
>Some days you run from any room with a lion chuff
>Occasionally you have to avoid the smell of hyenas
>Horses showing off certain parts means you have to book it now
>A bird sprucing up around her place means avoid that area at all costs unless you want to live there
>It's always something

>Go into store to buy a calendar
>Two racks of them, human and anthro versions
>Human ones have this years pin up girls, color coded breeding seasons and a list of ways to please various different anthro species
>Anthro ones are just a list of different sex positions to try each week and 12 of the years goodest boys showing off various human erogenous zones each month

Day 19 of invasion
> Be Sergeant Greg "Sarge" Mansfield of the Emperor's most vaunted Imperial Guard.
>Be assigned to backwater prisoner established colony by the Administratum after years of front-line service
>Be assigned to Outpost 13, the bottom of the bottomless pit in regards to worst place to be stationed
>The Commissar drank constantly, and was swift to find any source of booze and confiscate it.
>He'd come up with inane punishments, only understandable thanks to years of listening to your drunk squad-mates.
>His cadet was worse, a damnable sociopath who got off on shooting people...for any reason.
>Somehow Commissar Drunk kept him in line, if only barely, and you somehow managed to keep the boys from offing him
>IT would have been worth it, a small, heretical voice argued...a unfortunate accident...but temptation was to be resisted.
>Then there was that damned, asine, techpreist, assigned to Outpost 13 because anywhere else would result in his death.
>Only he was sanctified to fix anything, lest the machine spirits be displeased, and anything you fixed, well, best get the litanies right.
>But somehow, you and the boys made things work, despite the entirety of the galaxy doing its best to prevent it.
>Outpost 13 became a horrible home, but you knew there were worse places to be.
>And then the damned Tyranids showed up, bringing back memories of that ill-fated struggle.
>You still had nightmares from that Emperor forsaken planet, which had long been reduced to a lifeless husk of itself.
>Now, it was going to happen all again..and there was nothing you could do about it.
>But the Emperor protects, and even if you were to die, you be at his side.
>As dawn started breaking on Outpost 13, the boys had looked to you for guidance.
>The situation had passed grimdark long ago, but Outpost 13 had ingrained you all with a dark sense of humor.
>Then that dammed vox unit had delivered something that would shake an Imperial Fist.
>Since when did the Tyranids demand someone surrender?
>They should have overrun this base days ago with their numbers...not treat it as mostly unimportant.
>Then the attack came in earnest, and they started punching holes in the walls, as though they somehow knew the doors were wired.
>After a minute, you and the rest of the boys had been forced into the indoor motor-pool.
>As expected, the damned Carnifex tore the door open, allowing gaunts to pour into the room.
>They were shredded by fire from the heavy stubber, and you could feel the combat stim starting to kick in.
>Then the stubber was enveloped by what looked like white sticky goop which rapidly harden into webs.
>The damned warrior strides in like it owns the place, and your vision begin to tinge with red.
>You roar, lifting the only missile launcher you had access to and sending a krak missile at it.
>It managed to dodge the missile, turning and watching as it struck the Carnifex in the knee.
>The roar was almost deafening, but so too was the amount of gunfire in the enclosed space.
>You broke your stubber on a gaunt's face, spattering yourself with gore, as you reached for your backup weapon.
>A meter long wrench that was often used to adjust the techpriest, to be precise.
>Bellowing, you charge forward through the gaunts, each swing of the wrench sending them flying.
>Seconds later, you're before the Warrior, which looms over you by a good two feet.
>Thing has the nerve to smile at you, and despite the fact it's the size of an Astartes, you don't care.
>You didn't care that you were hopelessly outclassed
*ping*
>You didn't care that you were going to die
*clang*
>You didn't care that the thing had boobs
*ping*
>You just wanted to wipe the smile off the fraking things ugly face!
*catch*
>The wrench came to a jarring halt in one of the Warrior's hands, the tool bent and covered in blood
>As for the Tyranid warrior, it was missing a few teeth and the chitin shell was chipped in a few spots...
>And it was still grinning, even as it bent down to look you in the eye, a rumbling chuckle in its chest.
>Idly, you notice it's grabbed you balled up fist in one of the other hands it has free.
>The overly long tongue draaggs up your face and neck, the hing purring like the engine on a chimera.
"Yessss....you will do."
>theabsolutefrak.face
>Then you go flying across the room and through he doors to the tech-priest's workshop.
>Fortunately, you still have plenty of combat stim running through your blood, though that doesn't help with matters.
>Tyranids weren't supposed to talk...or have boobs.
>You can both hear and feel the thing approaching, along with the sounds of your men being slaughtered.
>Wait a moment, that doesn't quiet sound like moans of despair and meat being ripped apart...are they having an orgy out there or something?
>You do your best to suck air back into your lungs and stand up.
>The tech-priest kept his workshop dimly lit, light from the cogitator screens and various devices being the only light.
>Numerous chains dangle from the ceiling, and a pair of heavy duty servitors are tucked against a wall.
>Getting back on your feet, you spot a workbench with a few items on it, brightly lit by the lamp.
>It's then that the door comes off its hinges as the warrior steps in, her eyes drinking in your form.
>You're lifted into the air like a toy, level with the thing's drooling maw.
>Still purring like an engine, she slathers your face with her hot, slimy tongue, forcing it into your lips.
>You can;t close your teeth fast enough, and it slide down your throat, making you gag.
>One of its hands starts fondling your junk, and you realize just what she's after, and you redouble your struggles.
>It amounts to little, as the Tyranid warrior had more arms and is more woman than you could ever handle.
>Despite the fact she is a foul Xenos, the warrior is giving you an expert hand-job, but you're not getting hard for some reason.
>After a minute of this, the Tyranid grunts in frustration, breaking the kiss and lifting your crotch to eye level.
>She grumbles, before bringing you close and taking a good sniff, as if trying to puzzle out the problem.
"It it broken?"
>Inwardly, you hope not, because Xenos or not, you'd be more than a little stiff at this point.
"You won;t violate me Xenos scum," You growl, "Besides, I prefer actual women to whatever twisted mockery you kind have created."
"Oh?" The warrior says, her Gothic heavily accented, "This one is superior to your females in every way possible."
>Before you can argue, your head is shoved firmly between her breasts, the soft flesh spilling over your shoulders and sealing you in.
>Sound from the outside world is muffled completely, permitting you to hear the heavy breathing of the Tyranid warrior
>Her pulse sounds strange, as though there is more than one heart thumping away in her chest.
>She's using her upper arms to both immobilize your own and keep your head between her boobs.
>The lower ones are gripping your ass in a manner that can be summed p as the word "Mine."
>She's also using them to grind you against her lower lips, which leak a thick, hat, and sticky fluid while flexing slightly.
>Pious servant of the Emperor or not, no man should be soft under this much feminine assault, so why are you...
>It hits like a power-fist: the combat stim is directing your blood-flow to your muscles, and away from your groin.
>Once it wears off, the damned Xenos will violate you to her heart's content...not good.
>She's also getting frustrated with the lack of stimulus, hell, she even makes a whine, only for it to stop short, replaced by a growl.
>You are yanked from between her breasts, inhaling great gulps of air, while the Tryanid squirms for some reason.
"Wha's a mattah," You say, "Can gettit up?"
She squints,"What did you do to yourself human?"
"Neva."
>She heaves you against a workbench, before turning around and presenting her ass...one that would be the envy of many Imperial nobles.
>You're still out of breath from the breast smothering earlier, you can;t move in time before you're buried within it.
>You try to force it off you, our fingers sinking to the second joint in fat, but the steel cables that are her muscle tell all.
>Tyranid warriors can weigh in at a metric ton, and even if this one is on the petite side, you can't force her away.
>Her drooling cunt is pressed firmly against your lips, and her rocking smears it across your face
"Lick or suffocate...the choice is yours human."
>her damn tail drapes over your skull in an effort to drive you further in, the creak of muscle audible.
>You have to escape before you run out of oxygen, or before the combat stim wears off.
You hand fumbles across the workbench, looking for something, anything to use to try and get her off.
>She slaps her ow ass-cheeks, the concussive wave jarring your brain and breaking your focus.
>A bit of her fluid enters your mouth, the sweet substance sending heat flooding through your face, and then southwards.
>You dick gives a slight twitch, something the warrior makes a note of.
"Ah, so it does work," She coos, "It just needed...convincing."
>Another slap, the concussions and lack of oxygen pushing you to desperation, your body seizing up.
>Your hand brushed against a button, and without hesitation you push it.
>There is a whirring and clacking sound from the far side of the room, as the servitors boot up.
"MEAT DETECTED....SPECIES...TYRANID...TYPE...WARRIOR...SUBDUE."
>The Tyranid turns, gasps, and moves away, freeing you to gulp down what air you can while struggling to your feet.
>She seems terrified of the servitors lurching toward her from the shadows, but that might be oxygen deprivation.
>You examine the remote a little more carefully, as well as whatever else is on the workbench
>It seems to control the overhead lift assembly, with an added button for the servitors.
>There is also something that can only be described as a power-dildo, with a note "short battery life, needs improving"
>Third...by the Emperor everyone thought the tech-priest had destroyed it.
>It's a modified missile launcher, but with a servo-skull warhead for sending long range messages...you could notify command.
>Still,you wish you had something of value to send to command, other than Outpost 13 being overrun.
>Wait...
>You give the power-dildo a good look...and recall that Tyranid warriors are synapse creatures...
>If killing one of them sent the lessers into a frenzy...this was heretical, but given you were damned anyway...wouldn't hurt to check.
>One thing is certain however, she is terrified of the servitors...trying to remove them from her arms but also trying to avoid hurting them.
>She was also babbling like a civilian in a chaos war-zone, nearly close to tears.
>Well, given that said servitors used to be good friends of yours at one point, you understood the horror of their dead expressions.
>Damned tech-priest had really rubbed it in.
>The three of them were beneath the series of chains and hoist equipment, it looked fairly heavy...
>You glance down at the remote and find the right..ah, there's the button.
Cling*
"WARNING"
*Crash*
>Huh, that actually worked, the Warrior is pinned, and conveniently ass up and relatively unharmed.
>You heft the power dildo and a length of chain, before turning it on.
*BZZZZZZZZZZ*
"What are you doing? What happened to those people? Get this off of meeeEeEh?!"
>She's leaking like a faucet, and just a brush off the power dildo makes her let out a shrill cry, her legs twitching.
>Oddly human too...you shake your head and decide to get on with this...heresy.
"No," She actually has the audacity to beg, "Not like this, I'm supposed to pin you down, you're human...how did you?"
"Listen well xenos," You say, "You and your foul kin might have defiled my men and damned them to a fate worse than death...but you haven't beaten us.
"So, even if you have victory today, I will make it as bitter as possible. Now, let's see if my theory holds true."
>She makes some strange chittering noise and you start to apply pressure and penetrate her with the power dildo.
>Her efforts to remain silent fail, her moan escaping between clenched teeth and deep enough to vibrate your ribs.
>You hear movement, and spot a few hormagaunts entering the room...they seem to be slightly out of it
>Just give a little push...and they buckle at the knees, and you wince at the sound of talons scraping the rockcrete floor.
>Hopefully those chains hold.
>You ease the power dildo in and out, ignorign the warrior and focusing on the reactions of the gaunts.
>As predicted, they squirm with increasing intensity, along with the warrior's growling and thrashing.
>You flip the power-dildo into high power, and slide it in as far as it can go into the clenching cunt of the Tyranid.
>The Warrior raises her head in silent scream as she locks up, twitching and thrashing as she climaxes.
>All of the gaunts go rigid with their own, mewling and chiping, a few of them begin to masturbate.
>Hell, you even hear the Carnifex outside roar...damn that has some range to it.
>Well, with that confirmed, you best deliver that message to high command, might do them some good.
>There is the sound of metal straining, and you turn to see the Tyranid warrior pulling on her restraints, one of the chains coming apart.
>You heft the missile launcher and run out off the storage room, and come across the remains of your men's last stand
>Hard to spot most of the boys, given that they're buried under a number of gaunts...or impaling them.
>In the other room, the Tyranid warrior cries out again, and every gaunt in the room follows suit, twitching madly
>There's no time to waste however, you've got to get to the roof of the compound, and get that message out.
>Jim and Dwayne had briefed you on the Servo Skull Launchers functions, to it was easy to activate the thing.
"Please select message destination."
"General Powerstache."
"Recording initiated after the *beep*"
"This is Sergeant Greg Mansfield of outpost 13. This is probably all manner of heretical, but I think I've found a weakness in the enemy."
>You dash up the stairs, the servo skull shifting to keep your face in view.
"I was able to pin down a Tyranid Warrior inside the tech-priest's workshop...found something I can only describe as a power dildo."
>Second floor has a few gunners pined down by gargoyles, their eyes tracking you as you move across the room to the ladder.
"I'm not sure that you've been informed that the Xenos are...very female, and perhaps a bit to human for anyone's liking."
>Look's like the 'nids set off the mines up top, if the bits of blood dribbling down were any indication.
"They seem to have the singular goal of defiling us through...explicit means sir, but this can be a weakness if exploited correctly."
>You shoulder the launcher and begin to climb, taking care not to slip. Outside, the Carnifex lets out another wail of pleasure.
"The manual states that killing the big ones send the little ones into a frenzy or even outright kills them. As stated earlier, I was able to incapacitate a warrior."
>You finally reach the top, only to hear numerous metallic snaps, and the most sulfurous swearing to leave a woman's mouth.
"I found that inducing...ah hell, I got her to orgasm, every guant in the building and the Carnifex outside came too."
>You stare at the Servo Skull, before giving it a short salute.
"Not sure I have any other information of value, Outpost 13 is overrun, consider this our final message. The Emperor Protects."
"End recording."
>With a beep, the servo-skull locks into flight position, and you aim in the general direction of High command.
>Hopefully, they get this in time.
*Fw-WHOOSH*
>You have about three seconds to enjoy watching that thing sail off into the distance before numerous pricks lace your body.
>Moments later, your arms turn to jelly, and a pair of Gargoyles land next to you. They looks a little flushed.
>You're flown back to the motor-pool, where one very pissed off warrior is waiting for you, her eyes partially glazed over.
"You'll wish you'd just given in human."
>She lifts you into the air by your legs, spreading them as you come face to face with the power dildo.
*Shloorp*
*BZZZZZZZZZ*
>She takes hold of the power-dildo as though it were a dagger and raises it high overhead, the target obvious.
>You can't even clench your backside, let alone grit your teeth, in preparation for what was to come.
*BZZZZzzzzzzzzttt....*
>Both of you stare at the power dildo, and you thank the Emperor the tech-priest did not solve his battery problem.
>It's then you land square on your back upon one of the utility vehicles, the Tyranid leering at you, taking in shaky breaths.
"You've managed o outwit, overpower, and have a better run of luck than me, human, have any idea how arousing that is?"
>She hoists both of your legs into the air, while her other hand guides your rock-hard erection inside.
>Her walls grip down like an iron fist in a wet, hot velvet glove, drawing a gasp from your lips
"I just know our offspring will be powerful and able leaders...doesn't that excite you?"
>You do your best to look away, overcome with shame that you hadn't even had a chance to deny them your body.
>Another of her hands grips your head and forces you to look at her, er expression gleeful.
"I want to watch as your eyes roll back into your skull and your tongue loll out of your mouth."
"I want to see it when you break!"
>Her hips slam into yours, her internal musculature seemingly designed to milk you dry...but still, you do your best to resist
>You're not sure how long you last, but she smashes her hips against yours and does a grinding rolling combination.
"Why resist, why not just give in? You only delay the inevitable."
"That's what the guard does best, Xenos..."
>Her motions intensify, and why you do delay her prize, she all but sucks it out of you when you climax.
>Along with a good part of your soul, you assume.
>For moment, you lie there, panting, struggling to understand why such a horrible thing felt so good.
>Then she molests your mouth and throat with her tounge, moaning in delight.
"We're just getting started sergeant, I want to see.You. Break!"
~~~~~~~~
>General Cornelius Rupert had watched the recording loop for several iterations before hitting the pause button on the cogitator.
>For a while, he sat in silence, the ambiance of his private study broken only by muted intercom messages.
>Then, his mustache began to twitch, and a smile broke out on his face.
"So, that's what you want, you want the D."
>He grinned feraly, leanign over the pic-screen displaying the second floor of the outpost.
"Very well Xenos, you'll get the D, but it's going to be on our terms."
>He began to laugh, as a new tactical plan began to form.
>He might just be able to buy enough time for naval reinforcements to liberate this planet.

So what are the chances of me becoming a shark attack victim because I happen to suffer from occasional nose bleeds?

If she acts kindly and offers you a handkerchief you should be careful. She will use the scent and follow you to your home so you can't escape from her strong arms.

She would? Wouldn't she already be able to smell my blood?

Well it is either of the two scenarios
1.If she is hungry she will most likely to tackle you to the floor and fuck you until you can't feel your legs.
2.If she is smart she will lend her handkerchief to you and wait for a while before giving you the chase. With blood she won't forget the smell as she tracks you down. The door your house will be flying of the hinges and you will be pounded against bed over and over again. The benefit of this scenario is that nobody can disturb you so she can make sure your swimmers makes her pregnant.
I hope you didn't accept her kindness... Otherwise you are going to become familyman with a large family (the horror!)

I've entertained the idea for a story where a young human gets captured by a band of raider anthros who kill his family and take him as a rape slave. Weeks a later an anthro lady knight wipes out the bandits at their camp and finds a naked, starving, very battered human huddle up in a corner, eyes dead and face blank. The main focus of the story would be less on the rape itself, and more on the human healing and finding love with his rescuer.

Would buff anthros be against impregnation for a while? They would lose their gains, and be unable to lift four months in.

Well the main reason for gains is to claim human and breed.
Losing gain is part of the process but hitting the weights continue after several children. Husband and kids still need strong protection.

If you come across 2 or 3 horny anthros at once, are they more likely to fight over you or share?

Really depends on the context of the situation. Friends and family share. Same species or some species who coexist with each other do that too. If somebody corners and tops you alone then she will not share.
But if you are not claimed and someone realizes that, then anthro women starts forming unusual alliances. Rat Car-mechanic silently shares the information of unclaimed man to the businesslady fox woman who is on her break.
Why? Because two of them have better chanses at getting you, and in the public spaces sharing with an other is still better option than take the risk and let you slip through her fingers.

Anthros have the courtesy to leave you alone if another girl got to you first.

Unless it's a human girl, in which case they view it as a good deed to take you as quickly as possible.

I like it if the human gf is abusive. The thought of her bf cucking her with some big amazon anthro and him being convinced to leave his abusive relationship with her after is hot to me.

Remember to prepare for the coming anthro invasion. You wouldn't want to be married off to their soldiers or high ranking politicians, would you?

I couldn't think of a greater honour than marriage to my miniature liberator.
Freed by her strength I will fulfill my duty to the gods as a life giving breeder and a devoted husband.

Would nazi waifurs be cruel to humans?

Depends on how much you resist, both physically and ideologically, what species she is, and what her occupation is. Despite what some might think, the higher her rank, the less cruel she will be most likely, not more, this is because they have, generally speaking, taken the aim of being more civilized more seriously.
I don't have any specifically Nazi waifurs to post but I do really like military waifurs in general

>WINKED.com puts out a new film

Okay, so we have:

HOGGED -- pigs
BURNED -- dragons
WINKED -- equines
HOWLED -- dogs/wolves

BURROWED - foxes
POUCHED - marsupials

Doggos complained about not being lumped in with the species they descended from, so it was changed to HOWLED.
As for foxes, there's a second site, YIFFED.com that competes with BURROWED, and a third site, OUTFOXED.com has sprouted up lately.
SHEARED (?) -- sheep/lambs/goats
PECKED/HENPECKED -- birds
PUSSYWHIPPED -- cats

CHOMPED - sharks

LEASHED -- Dogs/Wolves with a BSDM tendency
MILKED - Bovines that are serviced/milked

Note: Geese no longer upload to PECKED and instead use HONKED.

>new film on CHOMPED.COM has anon get kidnapped by 2 muscular sharks while out surfing
>they take him to a cave and take turns breaking his pelvis and his mind

Dragons could also be hoarded.
>Videos of dragons showing off their hoards
>They are walking the camera person around, showing off their gold and gems
>They point out the age and make of the best stuff
>Then they show their favorite treasure, the centerpiece to their hoards
>Often these are men who are in cages, or leashed to a pipe or pole wearing enticing clothes
>The rest of the video is them bragging about how great their catch is, pointing out his good points
>Some show off their man's willpower by wrestling them to the ground and violating them and yet they still don't give up
>Some like to show how obedient their man is by having him do embarrassing and sexually provocative poses for the camera
>Yet others dress their men up, showing how certain clothes can really bring out his sex appeal

Excellent point.
Dragons would be both BURNED and HOARDED.
Don't forget about snusnu.com, though: Muscular female anthros of all species dominating human males!

On a scale of 1-10, how addictive would your waifur’s musk be?
1 being not at all and 10 being if you don’t get a deep whiff of her strong musk at least once a day, you start to become an anxious mess as you feel more and more vulnerable without her musk around

i wouldn’t want to be a neurotic mess, but in an ideal scenario my waifur would greatly enjoy shoving her pussy in my face and letting me smell her all the time, so I wouldn’t be deprived of her comforting scent particularly often. in which case 10

That’s more what I was going for.
You get addicted to her musk because you associate it with safety and comfort she provides, and if you don’t smell her, you lose that feeling of comfort. You would only go into a panic in cases of extreme deprivation and stress.

>He agrees, oblivious of the consequence that is to come. The masterplan she has to make him hers, once and for all.

>Want a waifur to take care of me since abused
>But at the same time dont want to admit it since only faggots say that

>''It's a shame how human women treat their men''
>''It's okay, anon. There's no need to be afraid anymore. Just come into my arms and let me take care you.''

>waifurs don't judge you for being subby and wanting to be held and taken care of
>waifurs don't think any less of you for having your bad days, for crying when you're sad or stressed, for not always being at your best
>you will never have a waifur

I need a waifur to hold me, to pour all of the love I have pent up into her and to have her love me back, 
to hold her and kiss her and cry into her fur, being able to be vulnerable and close to a lover. 
Don't get me wrong, I think about having raunchy sex with my waifur, but I find myself thinking more about just holding her and being able to let out my emotions, 
and more recently I fantasize the most about just being able to kiss her deeply, over and over again.

So, to expand further on my writing ideas.
I was thinking of writing a slice-of-life story with a good amount of survival horror mixed in.
It'd take place in a world of anthros where humans are either extremely rare or mythical. 
Our protag would arrive, and eventually find himself an apartment to stay at. 
He'd get to meet all the characters and roommates and uncover the mysterious creatures that haunt the sleepy, small town and the force behind them.
Also there would be yeena GF.

>Yeen roommate: "Sis, I'm beginning to seriously believe your freaky occult shit with all these run ins."
>Anon dressed as wolf: "Yeah. I almost got dragged into a dumpster."
>Yeen sister: "I have an idea why these things are happening to you. I think a human is watching over you."
>Roommate: "Huh?"
>Anon: "What?"
>Sister: "That's right. They are said to be guardian spirits of the home who catch the attention of evil creatures. They attract evil spirits, but they weaken them as well, and focus their attention away."
>Anon: "R-really?"
>Roommate: "Anon keeps getting attacked by them, are you saying he's a human?"
>Sister: "No! Humans are intangible! Although he could be possessed by one. Has he been keeping the house clean? Helping with cooking?"
>Roommate: "Yeah, but he's between jobs."
>Sister: "Nonesense! He must be possessed. As long as you keep him safe, the human should keep you safe. However, you can improve on its power to weaken the monsters."
>Roommate: "How?"
>Sister: "You must have sex with him! Preferably around a magic circle with me chanting hymns from this book."
>Anon: "What!?"
>Roommate: "Damn it, I told you I'm not into your voyeur fetish! Anon, we're leaving."
>Sister: "Come back! B-but the monsters! Humans protect you! They are also spirits of fertility and gain power through sex! I won't look, okay! You just need to have sex with him! Have sex with the possessing human!"

>Yeah, I'm gonna take my human to the old town road I'm gonna ride him 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my human to the old town road
I'm gonna ride him 'til I can't no more~

You start to sweat buckets knowing your pelvis is in danger of being destroyed.

I want to spend like a week or two off with my mare gf, nearly bedridden as shes bounced on my cock so hard so often that my pelvis is bruised. 
When she's done forcing all the cum out of me and drenching me and the bed in her juices, 
she lays next to me, whispering sweet nothings and telling me that I'm a good boy til we are both ready to go again.

Hah. I was planning on having one or two occult characters, wouldn't be the yeen though. The cryptids wouldn't just be bothering Anon however.

Fair enough, here's a list of characters I've thought up so far:

1. Southern Belle boar, chubby but with a sweet disposition. Is a big motorhead, and does well with machines in general. Has attachment issues, and hides her scars well.
2. Ring tailed lemur and a weeaboo to boot. The community leader of sorts. Has a messiah complex, and is missing part of his tail due to an 'accident'. Also a good artist.
3. Older Irish Elk doe, does have small antlers. Was a praticing chemist but stopped working in a lab after an accident left her injured. Has to use braces and a cane in order to support herself. Practicing pagan, may or may not be a witch and has unusual knowledge of things happening around the community.
4. A big moa boy, actually the runt of his family and has some issues there. Used to be a sportsball player, but after a choice encounter he can't perform professionally. Took up weightlifting to cope.
5. Gila Monster and a former member of a crime syndicate that used to/still does operate in the town/city. A total-hardass and cuss but he means well. Covered in scars, wont talk about what made him leave. Huge western fan and paternal figure to 6.
6. A younger girl who grew up an Orphan. Never adopted. Has issues with forming friendships and showing affection among other social things. Extremely gifted with technology. The youngest of the characters.
7. Big and ethnic Lioness. She had family in the country but lost them due to an encephalitic fever that she survived, but not unscathed. She has troubles with speech as a result. Massive guilt-issues and learning medicine as a result of said guilt.
8. Metalhead Brown-Polar bear mix. Used to be with a rich family but was disowned and kicked to the curb. Has troubles expressing his emotions. Afraid of being seen as crazy.
9. African fire and Red-Eyed crocodile skink mix from Louisiana. He's a bit of an oddball. Big into occultism, voodoo, hoodoo and other things. Mostly thanks to his grandmother and father. Unusually persuasive but has a deep, irrational fear of alot of things stemming from a traumatic encounter.
10. Former dancer who lost her feet tona cryptid and was cut loose by her manipulative parents. Has some trust issues and paranoia. Has taken up zoology and is learning to dance again with her prosthetics.
11. A Colugo E-boy who struck it good by becoming a moderately popular streamer. Grew up extremely poor, and so is image/wealth obsessed. Hates seeing other people poor, so he does more than he should.
12. Jaguar girl scientist who used to be involved with the same company as 3. Got involved with some shady business that nearly left her dead and made her mute. Speaks using sign language or a text to speech program that 6 helped design. Paranoid about everyone's safety and is afraid to make noise.
13. Big mare, training to be a professional cook and runs a little baking service for some extra dough on the side. Probably the most well-adjusted, though unlike the other's she's lost practically everything she used to hold dear. A bit aloof and afraid to make strong friends because of it.
14. A chimpanzee bro. Big into the vidya and all that guy stuff. Substance abuse problems from attempting to cope with am abusive upbringing and a near death experience when he tried to escape said abuse.
15. 15. Former park-ranger she-wolf. Was removed from her post with disability and payments from the park-service after a chance encounter. She's okay physically but she's so afraid of the woods now, that being near a tree or other long, tall objects is enough to unnerve her.
16. The yeen GF, big tomboy and a workout buddy with 4. Secretly a massive skinny(furry). Acts bullyish and tough from her upbringing, but really wants someone she can drop the facade around.

So. After a bit of thought I've come up with some new cryptids with all your suggestions.
1. A cephalopod-like creature that has the visage of a toothed catfish. Prefers to stay in the shade and out of open areas
2. The Midnight Man. Only comes out after midnight and goes away come sunrise. Dislikes light, and will retreat if visible and being looked at by someone.
3. The Many. A group of shadowy people that vary in size, intention and ferocity. They come out often when it's cloudy, foggy, or otherwise greyscale outside.
4. The Klaxon. Think a tyrant from RE mixed with bigfoot and then a siren. Primarily sticks to wooded areas, though it'l range outside it. It's the beast that mauled the retired park ranger wolf. Can mimic things it hears almost perfectly.
That's it so far. Still need a minimum of four more.

>anthros are a sort of feral/tribal animals style
>animal planet shows like steve irwin/jeff corwin shows like usual
>but they keep using interns as bait to lure lusty feral anthros to get them on camera, tag them, relocate them, etc
>intern being half hung in the ocean by a crane after given some Viagra trying to bait shark anthros
>intern tied to a pool slathered in honey waiting to attract a bear anthro
>lowering a naked intern down a sewer manhole to be pulled up with a rat women clinging to him
>etc

>she breaks off the hug and asks you to put your maid outfit back on
>you're not super into it, but you're also not not into it; and it makes her smile, and she always tells you you're cute
>you get dressed again and you both go downstairs
>home made crock pot meal, mutton and vegetables, a little peppery just the way she likes it
>talk about sports team
>talk about new hiking trails opening up in the park
>talk about movies coming out
>dinner is done, you do the dishes
>come out of kitchen only to get grabbed and pulled onto the couch
>cuddling and movies, head half buried in her chest fluff, hear her breathing and heart more than dialogue
>must have fallen asleep, 'cause you wake up being carried into the bedroom
>find your way out of clothes
>little spoon, no need for blankets
>world is soft fur, perfume, her breathing
>blissful, content, fall asleep again

Hey cryptidanon How about a huldra Girl, they are known to stalk Human men, they are very evil and deranged/obssesive they have no spine just a Big hollow Dark Hole on the back

I like this idea. Anon initially thinks he's found love, but she starts to get more and more possessive until it inevitably leaks to the others.
Then him, Sabdh(the irish elk doe) and Elijah(the occultist skink) have to help him banish or otherwise get rid of her before she kills him.
Unlike other cryptids, Anon can't see her hollow back. But the anthros can see her for what she is.

>The huldra puts a hand to Anon's chin and smiles at him
>"Hello there handsome."
>Anon returns the smile
>"Hello, beautiful."
>An axe being carried by the yeen girlfriend is slammed into the huldra's back
>"Like hell I'm going to lose my chance at a human boyfriend!"
>"Noooo! I will kill you one day for this! Anon, you better watch you back!"
>"Holy fuck, you saved me! How did you know that she was a spirit?"
>"Huh, spirit? Uh, I mean I thought I saw some strange black gas leaking out of her back. You would do the same for me, right?"

So I've been placed under house arrest for breaking quarantine, even though I'm an essential worker.
But the thing is, she insisted I was to be placed under house arrest at her place.
She can't do that, can she?

>"Yes, I'm fucking sure." It comes out more irritated than you wanted it to. But it's the absolute truth. Stupid fucking socialite parents and their stupid fucking parties.
>The shark didn't deserve it though. She's a family friend. Probably just trying to be nice.
>Alicia. That's her name. It's been a few years. She was overseas studying for a phd or something, just came back to the states a little while back.
>"Sorry. Didn't mean to snap." You apologize. "Could you at least close the door?"
>She steps into the room before closing the door behind herself. Sits down near you, not next to you, gives you your space.
>"What's wrong Anon?" She must have been in France. She picked up some of the accent.
>"I hate parties."
>"Why?"
>You pause your game, look at her to explain, and try really hard not to stare at the cleavage that looks like it's trying to leap at you.
>"Because I'm an introvert. I don't like crowds of people. I especially don't like crowds of anthros because you're all so touchy feely and friendly and usually ignore personal space. There's too much noise, and too much going on. It leaves me stressed out, tense, and exhausted. Shit, I'm all tense just thinking about it going on in the next room."
>She sits there quite and pensive for a moment. You can see the gears moving.
>"Maybe I can help? If you'll let me?"
>That has your interest. "Whatcha mean?"
>She gets up and offers you her glass of wine. "Drink some."
>You're not really a wine person, but it can't hurt, so you down some of it. She moves behind you and her hands are at your shoulders.
>"Zut alors! You were not exagerating. You are nothing but knots."
>Strong but soft fingers work deep tissue. It's maybe three seconds and you're turning into putty. You don't get touched much, and alcohol hit an empty stomach, so you're already feeling a little warm.
>"I'll stop if you want me to."
>"Don't you dare."
>You forget the game, you saved a few minutes ago anyway. You drink the rest of the wine and put the glass down.
>Between the alcohol and the hands at your back the world is falling away. This is probably the nicest thing that's happened in months.
>"Anon, take off your shirt and lay down, face down."
>You don't even think about it. You just do it. You're not going to do anything that would stop this warm feeling.
>She straddles your backside, knees on either side of your hips. Her hands are working up and down your spine, seeking out points of tension and banishing them with expert and gentle care.
>Unexpected hot breath is at your neck, right next to your ear. She's whispering to you, firm breasts pressed into your back, hands resting on your upper arms.
>"You know Anon, I've had a crush on you for the longest time. It's why I'd never miss a party that gets thrown here. I never found the courage to do anything about it though. I was afraid you'd be taken when I came back from studies. I was happier to learn you were still single than when I earned my degree."
>You really don't know what to say about that. Seriously? This is a woman who could have her pick of folks, and she has a crush on you?
>"Bwa? Huh?" It's about the most intelligent thing you can say given your brain is currently stripping gears.
>"You were never afraid of me. You always used to boop my nose. And you smell delightful." She's nuzzling your neck, and then there's a kiss, warm lips pressed to your skin, and it might as well be electric.
>Goose bumps cascade out across your body from that one gesture.

>A word lodges in the spinning gears of your brain and catches your attention. "Afraid? Why would anyone be afraid of you Alicia?"
>You can't see how your question makes her smile, or how her heart lifts a little with it. It's that innocent approach to everyone that she loves. "Because I'm a seven and a half foot tall predator with a mouth full of razor sharp teeth?"
>"There are a lot of those."
>"Oui. But most of them do not have the reputation of using their teeth on their mates, nor are their dark whispered rumors of adult cannibalism."
>Whoa. Okay. This is new, and sobering. You wiggle, and manage to turn yourself over while still under her. "Cannibalism? The hell? Why would anybody think that?"
>"You do not know?"
>"News to me."
>Her face gets a little sad, and you can hear the hesitation in her voice. She doesn't want you to hear this. Not from her. But it would be worse if you looked at all the aweful things on the internet.
>"Tiger Shark pregnancy is... a gruesome affair. Many eggs get fertilized. Only one survives. The others get eaten by their siblings."
>The silence is dreadful.
>DocBrownsomeseriousshit.jpg
>You have no idea what to say to that.
>So you boop her nose.

>get a female ferret roommate
>didn't realize the extra paperwork for filling out rent with her included a heat partner form
>find out later down the line when she goes into a heat and kicks your door down you're legally required to fuck her
>due to ferret female's fucked biology not fucking/orgasming during their heats can kill them
>worried about your work, but since you're a legal heat partner work can't do shit due to it being government handled
>pretty stocked about it the paid leave and all sex you can want
>except it's more sex than you can want
>like a lot more
>didn't know how dangerous weasel females in heat are
>feel like you're going to die by the end of the first day
>learn ferret heats can last for weeks
>good thing the heat partner gig comes with medical and life insurance because you're going to need it to cover dehydration, exhaustion, all the bites and scratches, and most likely a bruised or broken pelvis

>Day 24 of Invasion
>Working for the mechanics had a few downsides, but it was a living that you;d come to accept.
>Sure, there were hazardous conditions, hours were long, and pay was modest, but it was a living.
>The constant jeers from the numerous tech-priests about the weakness of flesh was demeaning but...tech-priests hated all meat-bags equally
>There were benefits to working for them however, nothing ever stayed broken down for long.
>That, and in the event of invasion, the ore processing plant had a few squads of Skitarii and several servo-turrets.
>Good thing too, because a bunch of Tyranids had decided to come and attack the place.
>The din of battle roared around you now, as you and your fellow workers sought cover.
>Somehow, the Tyrnaids had started pouring up a cooling intake pipe leading to a nearby lake.
>They also knew how to use det-packs for some reason or another, and were pouring in.
>Oddly, they were behaving a lot differently than what you were told to expect.
>For one, you'd spotted a tide of Gaunts to run into a room, only to scramble out, lumbering servitors in pursuit.
>Then there was a really big one, with a set of boobs that probably generated their won gravitational pull.
>Finally, they seemed more interested in capturing people alive for some reason, he more lethal ordinance aimed at defenses.
"THAESE AHH MOY MAHSHAYNS!"
>You look across the room to see Ned "Ironjaw" Kelly, kicking all kinds of Xenos ass.
>Of all the tech priests here, he was one of the nicer ones, opting to replace his fleshy bits only when they broke.
>Bit obsessive when it came to the equipment in the plant, regarding it his babies or something.
>Now he'd donned a suit of what could only be called servo-armor and was laying into the 'nids
>You resumed running along a catwalk, trying to figure out where exactly an evacuation point was, or if there was one.
>Probably the landing pads, that's where you were running now, panting and gasping.
>On a higher walkway, a coworker screamed as a flock of Gargoyles descended on him.
>Up and away he went, bits of his clothing raining down, his screams cutting out suddenly.
>Your feet pound across the metal grating, head swiveling frantically to identify any threats to your existence.
>Tyranids consumed entire worlds, even if you did get out of the facility alive, you;d die a horrible death.
>You weren't that desperate, not just yet, you were going to get out of here alive.
"Warning, emergency shutdown protocols in effect. Please turn equipment off and proceed calmly towards the exits."
>Throne-dammed automated messenger, proceeding calmly towards the exits was not the optimal strategy in these circumstances.
>Great, you've been around the Cogboys long enough you're starting to think like them.
>You spot a lift shaft a hundred feet from you, and break into a sprint, it should take you to an upper level.
>One with access to the landing pads, and hopefully covered by the servo-turret defenses.
*Slam*
>Hope dies with that noise, as something invisible lands on the catwalk a few yards away, metal buckling under the weight
>Slowly, it becomes translucent, then fully viable, pale pinkish skin with dark pink/moderate purple armor.
>Its upper limbs are long, looming above it in the air as it stalks towards you, twitching slightly.
>The mouth is covered with writhing, drooling tentacles, and its...her breast are bigger than your head.
>You're not sure on whether you should be frightened or horny, leaving you with a very confused boner.
>Matters are not help by the Tyranid bouncing her boobs and making a come hither gesture.
"01000110 01010101 01000011 01001011 00100001"
>A heavy weapons servitor slams down in front of the Tyranid, causing the catwalk t buckle heavily.
>Your ribs ache after being slammed into the rail, but the 'nid's attention is on the heavy bolter the servitor carries.
>She pins it to the catwalk with a lightning fast movement of her upper arms, but the Servitor is not dissuaded.
>There is a burst of bolter-fire that tears into the supports of the particular section of catwalk.
>The 'nid's eyes widen and she gives a small shriek as they plummet downwards.
>Praise the Emperor, now, to clear the gap.
>Somehow, you barely manage to clear it, nearly falling into the abyss yourself, grunting and swearing as you pull yourself up.
>You pull a length of rail free to use as a bludgeon, better than using your fists for something like that.
>Right, the cargo lifts. you hit the call button and the barred entrance opens, revealing a waiting car for you to take.
>You smack the button for the level you need, sighing slightly as the doors close.
>Oddly enough, a hymn to the Omnissiah begins to play from a static-y speaker...
>You're almost to the correct level when the whole lift rocks, and metal squeals somewhere above you.
>The lift is stuck between levels, another maintenance catwalk below, a heavy freight line above.
>There's a loud static squeal, and the music stops playing.
"Hy, cahn someone geeve me a hahnd weeth thiiies Tyrynid Guahd? She's a biieht haefty t' hahndle on moy own heah!"
>Well, Ironjaw seems a little to occupied to fix the lift.
"Oi, come bahck weeth moy suhvao-trousahs yah dahmned Genstaylah!"
>Before you can move, the door to the lift is pried open by a very familiar set of forelimbs.
"Stop running, I don't want you tired out."
"...You...talk?"
"Oh, trust me," She coos, "There's no need for words human, not for what I have in mind."
>You're about to retort when an ominous stomping noise starts getting louder and shaking the lift.
"MAAANNNN!"
>Incoming Carnifex with immense bouncing boobs and copious drooling.
>You throw yourself to the floor away from the door the moment she collides with the upper part of the lift.
>There is an un-fathomable series of metallic rending noises, flailing limbs, and Xenos screaming.
>It ends with the smaller Tyranid doing her best to hold the chain keeping the car up.
>Then the Carnifex grips the chain, and gives it a yank.
>There is a loud clink, and a collective "Oh Shit!" moment, before you rocket downwards.
>Good news, you're getting away from the Tyranids.
>Bad news, you're plunging to your death!
>You manage to fist the E-brake just in time, the car screaming to a halt moments before it could hit the bottom of the shaft.
>With a grunt, your roll out of the lift, and onto your back in the dusty lower level, gigging hysterically.
>After a minute, you get up and have a look around the sub-level you stopped at.
>It's deserted, machinery in various states of shutdown, and a large hole burrowed in the wall.
>Probably how some of the Tyranids got into the place. You begin to search for a weapon...and freeze.
>Floating a foot off the floor is a rather serpentine Tyranid with tentacles for hands, and a tentacle covered mouth.
>She purrs, pressing her hands, and by extension of arms, her boobs, together, batting her eyelashes at you.
>This is all accompanied by an expulsion of pink hearts from the vents on her back.
>It might have fallen under the description of cute if you weren't so hopped up on adrenaline.
>You turn to run, only to hear a giggle from the Tyranid, before several slender warm fleshy things wrap around your body.
>Your arms are bound, one slips around your mouth, neck and down the front of your shirt, and the last one around your waist.
>A moment later, you're yanked up against something rather warm and sturdy.
>Your head is nestled between her flesh, and your legs held against her tail by a pair of small limbs.
>Her tentacles on your arms wrap tightly around your chest, and constrict alongside the one around your waist.
>You grunt into the tentacle around your mouth as air is forced from your lungs, slowly but surely.
>Spots are starting to dance in your vision, the tentacle around your neck not quiet strangling you.
>She giggles, her mouth coming near to you ear, her breath hot on your neck.
"Now human, do me a favor," *inhale* "Breathe."
>With that, the tentacles loosen your hold, allowing you to take in great gulps of air...from the very dense cloud of spore now around you.
>It's too late to do anything as you inhale sweet warm air in a desperate attempt to get some oxygen.
>Within seconds, your body goes from exhausted, to warm, to hot and sweaty, the heat surging south.
>Some oily substance is secreted from the tentacles, soaking into your skin, leaving you overly sensitive to every touch.
>Pink haze obscures both your vision and mind, and when it clears a bit, your face to face with the Venomthrope.
>Your clothes are gone, and the tip of your dick was pressed against a flexing pair of hot and wet lips.
"Go ahead human, you want this, You need this."
>Weakly, you thrust your hips, only for her lower limbs to force you inside.
>Muscular ridges grip on your member tightly, pulling you deeper.
>A very shameless noise leaves your throat, your brain a little too far gone to think rational, if at all.
>Mindlessly, you try to thrust deeper into whatever wonderful place you found yourself.
>Your body is pressed against that of the Tyranid, her breast engulfing your head, her heart(s) thumping in your ears.
>Inside her, you penis comes into contact with a tight ring of muscles it struggles to get past.
>With a grunt, you manage to get through it with a small pop, the ring clamping behind your glans.
>You make a muffled scream as the head encounters dozens of little bumps that jostle and brush against it.
>It's too much...and the ring prevents you from pulling out of there.
>Overwhelmed by sensation, you more or less explode, white overtaking your senses and your body going into spasms.
>Her body goes into overdrive, sucking away at your dick as though trying to extract every last drop, your brain, and your soul for good measure.
>It's too much, it won;t stop.
>After an eternity, you feel a prick at the base of your neck, and everything kinda becomes numb and distant.
>You're really tired for some reason, and gently, a nipple is pressed against your mouth.
>The last conscious thought you have is that the nectar flowing into your mouth taste good.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
>The Venomthrope sighed in relief as the human passed out, still suckling away.
>She was fairly certain she'd botched something, human males weren't supposed to cum that hard and that long...were they?
>A bit of nearby hive-chatter came from nearby, causing her to turn with some amusement.
OhfuckthatwashotImclosesoclose
>A translucent and masturbating Lictor was not far away, leaning on her forelimbs for support.
fuckfuckImgonnagonnauahfuhisuhgiuthgiusfijsiejgoit
>Voyeurs, the lot of them.
>Then she noticed the Carnifex, somehow upside-down in the lift shaft.
Helpisstuckneedsoemhumanfuckneedout
>Well, that happened.
>Suddenly, a door on the far side of the room burst open, and a Genestealer ran out and into the entry tunnel
Madhumanafterme
>A moment later, the wall the door was attach to exploded out, revealing a Tyranid Guard with a human riding her.
"Fahstah, aftah thaht trousah staylin waench!"

>Hopefully the planet would become saner after the takeover.

>"what do you think of kids?"

>After the anthro invasion they start to indoctrinate the kid's by pushing their agenda in to the schools and cartoons.

>"Anthro women shouldn't be allowed inside schools, much less teach. How do I know that wolf bitch isn't going to molest my son?"

>That just it Karen you don't know nor can you stop me or my fellow anthro's sisters you saggy forehead paper thin lip pancake ass haven bitch don't get mad just because you female humans have the sex appeal of a public toilet and personalities of vindictive she devils and little Johnny gets the urge to walk on the wild side and gets a taste of what a real female is you know that old saying once you go furry you'll leave that human girl in a hurry.

"It all matches. Trust me."
>Highmountain tauren female

"You don't need to be from the Skyhorn tribe to join the mile high club."

"Are you fixin' for a vixen?"
"Everything has its use. I could think of a couple for you." (Reference to "Remember, everything has its use", one of the click quotes of generic vulpera NPCs.)

>you have shot down many advances and proposals
>you live a simple but honest life
>during one of the days where you visit the church to help out since they helped you the time of their need.
>that day, you meet with a beautiful wolf anthro in military uniform.
>you and her both have eyes lock to each other, you regain conscious you quickly looked away and talk to the caretaker.
>you asked,
"Who is that?"
"You don't remember, she used to play with you and the others when you were young."
"Wait, what was her name?"
"My goddess, 4 years not living here and you forgot the person who is like a sister to you."
"Lately there has been lots of stress and mental fogs in my head."
"Dear, don't be hard on yourself. Her name is Luna, Luna Mondjager. Now go and greet her you ditzy man."
"Alright, Ma'm."
>you awkwardly walked to her.
>she just standing there attentively.
"Hi, Luna"
"You remember me all those years" with a smile and eye of cheerfulness
"To be honest, I didn't actually. You changed so much."
"No worries at least you remember me. You changed also. You become such handsome."
"You are beautiful also."
>the alarm on your watch goes on.
"Well, look at the time. I need to go now. Its good to see you again. Tell your mom I said hi.
"Wait, how can I contact you?"
"Ask the caretaker for it. She got my contacts."
>Your working at your dead-end job as usual. The la vie la plus belle restaurant where the rich come to fine and dine.
>This job pays good but the experience of working here is just bad.
>Everyday rich anthros just grope you like every time you pass. It never stops. It was surprising for you at first and but its just become blander and you don't even enjoy it any more of the thought.
>Your fellow workers help you out as they can without causing problems.
>You can't make any complaint. What are you going to do if you get fired? You will go back to working 2, 3 jobs and be paid less and have a massive amount of debts and unable to pay rent.
>This is Friday so, I just have to hold on to like a little bit more.
>Around 9:30 pm, the VIP reservation has arrived.
>You were specifically requested to serve them.
>The group who arrived were military anthros with their uniform.
>It was Luna and her mom and those must be her mom's friends. 1 german shepherd, 1 Doberman, 1 Crow, and 1 Shark.
>All of them female.
>The german shepherd asks the receptionist for their table.
"Yes, please follow the waiter, Madam."
"Right this way please, Madam"
As you guide them to the VIP floor.
In the elevator, Luna said, "Anon, you work here?"
That when her mother started to freakout.
"Anon?"
"Yes, Miss Litz.."
"Anon, the kid who I played chess and checkers."
"...."
"Its good to see you again, boy. Look at you all now a handsome."
She ruffles your hair.
The shark lady starts to put a hand on Miss Litz.
"So, this is the kid that you constantly talk to us about. told you about the five constant factors of war and tactics like the shock troops and the commando was from him? When he was just 7?"
The German shepherd and the Doberman chimes in.
"Interesting and he is quite the handsome man."
"Why didn't you join the military? You could have become a strategist. No frontline, of course. We are not like those Umera Republic lesbians. Allowing men to face the horror of war. Disgusting."

>anon lives in LA, traffic is terrible as usual
>realizes he can cut through Toontown to save time
>however, Toontown has become a dangerous place for single young men ever since the internet was invented
>literal thousands of wacky, horny toon girls sprung up from imageboards and had to be corralled into the city
>Anon weighs his chances and peels out for the Toontown Tunnel
>Steels his nerve and barrels through the red curtain, shielding his eyes from the technicolors
>At first, everything is fine
>birds singing, flowers singing, pretty much everything singing
>thinks maybe he’ll get through fine
>but then he looks in his rearview mirror
>a stampede of girls is closing in on his meager ‘93 Tercel

>Stops the car on a dime, sending girls flying
>reaches under seat and pulls out ACME brand Imitation Anon, made mostly of TNT and cannonball bombs

More wholesome shark anon incoming
>And like a switch, the atmosphere returns to something cozy and comfortable.
>”So, to totally change the subject, why the wig?”
>She shrugs, and you try not to pay too much attention to how certain things bounce with the gesture. “For the same reason as the make up, or the crimson dress. Fashion.”
>”Hair on sharks is fashionable?”
>”This year.” She stops straddling you and lays on her side next to you. It's a graceful movement, and the whole of her body is in your personal space, but you're certainly not complaining. It's pretty nice really. You still don't grasp why on Earth she'd have a crush on you though.
>And as if the thought were a signal her hand alights on your bare chest and a single finger plays over your skin, idly drawing random shapes over it.
>This is officially more than you can experience without certain reflex actions happening. Actions that begin to become apparent in your crotch and the flush coming to your cheeks.
>She smiles, knowingly, and you're not sure if it's just because she's a shark, or if there is something purely predatory there. “Would you like me to stop?”
>You swallow, nervous, aroused, uncertain, but not wanting to get off the ride just yet. “No.”

>species that are heavily tied into certain holidays
>either hate that time due to their species connection to it or lean as far into it as possible or even more
>reindeer during the christmas season
>comes out literally jingling in bells
>mistletoes all over even on her antlers

Apocalypse Waifur
really depends on the Apocalypse
Mad Max desert world seems to suck for everyone especially anyone furry and not nocturnal.
Nuclear winter would be kind of cozy with a furry predator.
Zombies, could be fun in general if the virus doesn't effect anthros and shes protecting the last human dick shes found in the collapsed society.

what about an I Am Legend scenario?
>all anthro women get infected with some virus that causes them to start spread the virus to other anthro women
>anthro males steal some spaceships or some shit and take the human females to fuck off to some space colony and die.
>as the virus progresses, the anthros start to stay in dark places during the day and hunt for the remaining human males.
>nobody knows where they get taken to, but the leading theory is to get killed and eaten in infected nests
>all forms of harm seem to do nothing to them, shoot them and they keep running, cut them in half and they will be out of it for a minute at most before waking up and dragging themselves to their other half then almost magically reattach themselves.
>eventually get captured by them and prepare for your death as they take you underground to their nest.
>When you get there though, your jaw drops as you look around.
>the infected have formed a sort of civilization and are farming weird growing mushrooms.
>and what's more, almost every infected seems to be paired with a living human male

>be human
>survive the zombie apocalypse
>set up shelter out in woods
>found a ham radio setup in a house
>commandeer it and figure out how to use it to find other survivors
>finally hear a voice one day

An anon in the last thread asked me to paste all of the wholesome shark stuff. Here's the latest tidbit. I'll post the whole thing to my pastebin here : https://pastebin.com/sjAnH7ZB (dead link)
>”Do you want more?”
>The word drops out of your mouth before you realize you've said it. “Yes.”
>Her smile broadens, and you're certain something predatory lurks within. It doesn't abate your arousal in the slightest. In fact, it might just be adding to it.
>She catches a nipple between a finger and thumb and squeezes. It isn't quite enough to be painful, but catches you by surprise.
>Her eyes grow large when you suck in a quick breath and it escapes your lips in a low whine.
>Your hands shoot to your mouth and you cover up in embarrassment. Cripes! You sounded like a girl.
>She captures both of your wrists in the hand that isn't molesting your chest and pulls them away from your mouth, over your head, and pins them to the mattress.
>”Oh no no no Anon. You won't be denying me those luscious sounds.” She looks you straight in the eyes with an intensity you aren't used to seeing from anyone, ever. Her tongue runs over her lips, slowly, like she's savoring something. “They're beautiful.”
>To say you're flustered would be an understatement. And impossibly, your cheeks flush a deeper shade of red. But you don't try to fight the hand holding both of yours.
>And you don't hold back when she pinches your other nipple. Harder this time. It hurts. It hurts good. And you whine again, freely, underneath this amazon of a shark that's taking some obvious degree of joy in making you squirm.
>It goes on like this for a while. Her exploring your body with her hand, and mouth while you're pinned by her other hand, and her legs that have wrapped around yours. Every time you make a new sound she marks the spot and plays with it. To your relief though she doesn't tickle you, at least not on purpose.
>She has you panting and sweaty without having even removed your pants yet. Pants that are straining to keep a raging hard on contained. Pants that are showing a wet spot of your excitement. Something no one has ever made happen. But then no one has ever engaged in this much joyous foreplay, treating you like the best toy in the world.
>Your earlobe is caught up between her lips gently sucked on and released.
>Breath and a whisper are at your ear again.
>”I am so sorry Anon. I have you all worked up, but I can't do anything to give you release.”
>Before you can voice your confusion or protestation her hand comes down over your belly. You hadn't noticed, but she'd been moving it in only one direction before. Now she drags it in the opposite direction, and it feels like sharp sandpaper.
>”Shark skin is wonderful for water. Not so good for touching others' skin. And I have no gloves with me.”
>She releases your hands, and pulls you bodily on top of her, your back to her front. The firm flesh of her breasts is pressed into your shoulders. You can feel the hard nubs of her nipples. She's definitely getting off on all this.
>”I've always wanted to watch though. Would you do that Anon? Would you let me watch you pleasure yourself?”
>Her voice must have gotten an octave lower with those words, and it's like liquid sex poured in your ear, full of desire. One of her arms has come over your chest, holding you tightly to her body. You can feel her other arm behind you, below your ass.
>You're eyes go wide with the realization of where her hand is and what she's doing to herself with it.
>No way you could say no.
>Your hands rush to peel away your pants, revealing underwear with a large moist stain in front. They quickly strip that last garment away to free your cock, bouncing in time with your pulse.
>She whines a bit behind you upon seeing your organ, you can feel her hand move a bit harder in her crotch.
>You want to just stroke and blow immediately. You want relief from this crazy horniness she's whipped you into.
>But she's getting off on watching you. And that's fucking amazing, and you do NOT want that to end.
>So you grasp your shaft with your hand and move it slowly. Tease yourself. Thrust into it. Flex your legs. Move your hips. Moan like some cheap whore. Put on a show.
>It's almost enough to drive you insane. You've edged before, but this is something else. This is almost torture. Forcing yourself not to reach peak and blow a load.
>It's her. Behind you. That's what's keeping you in control. Feeling her hand getting more frantic in her crotch. Hearing her whine out her own pleasure because of your show.
>Somehow that's even better than getting yourself off.
>Then her voice hits your ear. “Cum for me Anon. Cum for me right now!”
>That's all it takes. A few more strokes at her command and you're blowing a load all over yourself, up your chest and on your stomach. You grunt out some sort of inarticulate primitive animal noise with the release.
>You feel her tense up behind you, her hand stops moving, and the arm that has you pinned to her chest pulls you so tight you almost can't breathe for a few seconds. Even if it weren't for that, you'd know she just had her own orgasm by the sound she hisses out between clenched teeth.
>Both of you lay there, tangled up in each other, breathing heavily and just soaking in the warmth of the others' body in a haze of endorphins.
>She nuzzles your neck. “You are coming over to my house for dinner tomorrow night. Dress well for me? I think you'll clean up beautifully.”

>have depression
>disguise your pain with self deprecation
>everyone laughs at your jokes and jabs at yourself
>not knowing how serious you are when you say you hate yourself
>anthro coworker has enough
>corners you alone and tells you she's sick of hearing you talk shit about yourself
>cups your cheek in her hand and tells you if you won't be kind to yourself than she will
>you just stand there dumbstruck for what feels like eternity, staring into her loving eyes
>then the dam breaks
>your lip trembles as tears come streaking down your face
>she just takes you into her arms and lets you bury your face into her fluff as you finally release years of pain that have been bottled up for far too long

ever heard of Kappas?
>hang out in rivers
>strong and fast in the water
>lose their strength if the dish on their head gets dry
>also has a desperate desire to reach inside a boy's hole for the boy's soul

You guys were talking about waifurs in a apocalyptic scenario in the last thread how about one in the Metroverse.

>rats, opossums, foxes, rabbits, and other species that hide underground/in urban tunnels
>or animals get mutated into humanoid ones that end up majority female and compatible with humans
>cue lusty mutants raiding human settlements for desperate to breed and claim a mate

>You happen to live and work down in the metro and the faction that rules with an iron fist K.A.R.E.N. run by women they tell everyone that the only safe place is in the metro and there's nothing left on the surface but desolation radiation and bloodthirsty mutants.
They only tell half the truth the mutants are animals changed by the radiation into anthros mostly female because of the radiation messing with there DNA. the faction does there best to spread fear and propaganda and even silence anyone who has interest of going to the surface.
With the help of there onions guard and fuckboy comandos they also try and kill any anthros who get too close to the metro. The anthros are desperate to find males to breed with because they fear there species will die out because of a lack of males. 
One day you get caught up some events and you find out the truth. Now you must escape the metro before the tyrannical faction has a chance to capture you.

id like to see one set in the s.t.a.l.k.e.r. universe.
>running away from mercs in jupiter
>manage to avoid becoming wurm fud by hiding in the bushes
>got shot a couple times in the legs though
>all of a sudden the sky starts to darken
>blowout soon fellow stalker.ogg
>start half limping half crawling to a drainage pipe you see a small ways away
>collapse a few yards from the pipe as blood loss takes hold
> sky starts to turn red as lightning streaks the sky all around you
>start trying to crawl to the pipe in a desperate attempt to avoid being kicked from the zone
>only a few feet from the pipe, you can crawl no more
>as your vision fades and you hear the wave of psychic doom approach closer and closer, you see a set of glowing eyes looking from the pipe with a curious glint
>You get waken up by a soft sensation that feels like its encompassing both your body and mind
>your eyes begin to adjust to the dark and slowly you make out the details of some large furry creature, holding you?
>the creature holding you seems to be holding an artifact of some sort to the wounds on your leg while gently running its claws through your hair.
>then as you look around to get a look at her, you hear a feminine voice in your mind say something your still blood deprived brain can't quite comprehend further than a gentle and seemingly loving tone.
>your vision fills with static for a second, and all of a sudden there are multiple clones of the creature all around you, petting your body and looking loving at you.
>they all look like someone took a psydog and gave it a human body, tits and all
>before you can react much, you see a little bit more static in your vision as a calming sensation flows from your head to the rest of your body in waves of bliss
>you feel more comfortable than ever before, and then you hear that voice again in your mind, or rather, multiple of the voice.
>each voice seems speaks words of encouragement to you in a near motherly tone
>"everything is going to be okay", "you are far stronger than you thought", "you have such a kind soul", "i will keep you safe"
>as the voices praise you further and the sensations begin to bounce around your body, you snuggle back into her fur and slowly drift off to a peaceful sleep in her strong arms.

"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY ABOUT MY BOYFRIEND YOU LITTLE DYKE?! ILL FIND OUT WHERE YOU LIVE AND THE BEAT THE SHIT OUTTA YOU, YOU TINY TITTY HAVIN', SWAMP PUSSY STINKIN' CUNT LICKING LESBO VIRGIN!"

>'he looks like the kinda boy who fucks yeens'
>you personally think it's funny and don't really mind
>your gf is very protective of you though, and every time the chat starts lewding you she goes ballistic and starts screaming threats into the camera
>afterwards she drags you into the bedroom and fucks you extra hard, to reaffirm that you're hers

"C'mere, I'll tell you what, we wolves are very monogamous, we mate for life, or in other words we only have on sexual partner in our lifetime. 
I have been watching you since middle school and when our hands touched yesterday when opening the door to 2nd period class that sealed the deal and now I can only be with you.
What? Why would I lie about something about this, that is totally how our wolven customs work. Dude trust me. Anyways, That's beside the point. 
Now look: I like you and I want you. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. The choice is yours."

>have to go to specialty stores to find human clothes now
>otherwise risk clothes with all manner of holes and such for tails, spikes, wings, etc
>always have over enthusiastic anthros wanting to "help" you with clothes
>just end up getting groped a bunch or they get you in lewd clothing and then molested

>somehow get sent back in time, to another/alt dimension, center of the Earth, the lost world, etc
>the place has ancient mammal species
>turns out they were a lot bigger then expected
>you may be an evolved mammal species, but your male scent is more than enough to entice big prehistoric female mammals wanting to snu snu you
>seems like they're targeting you even more aggressively for some reason
>exotic scent easy to find?
>they can smell good advanced genes they want to be passed onto their young?

>When lost humans like me have to find a lost human shelter
>Once inside, it's protected from anthros
>Warm beds, private rooms
>Comfy stuff

>have wolfbro roommate
>feels good to hangout with another dude
>he acts as a good shield against dick crazy anthro women
>he can get a little weird sometimes though
>keeps asking you why you aren't dating anyone
>keeps asking you what like in a woman
>whenever the two of see an anthro woman, whether in real life or on tv, he always draws your attention to her asks if you'd tap that
>last night he jokingly asked you if he could suck your dick
>although you're not entirely sure if he was joking
>"I mean we're roomies, so it's not really gay when you think about it"
>you're pretty sure it's gay

What about a big, domming insect GF? Think about how comfy that could be if she's the silk-making or eusocial kind
>spider GF makes love while you're in a silk cocoon/sleeping bag, gives you sensual massages with her pedipalps.
>Bee/wasp GF that's a big homemaker. Goes out and works, come back and does chores. When she's not working she's breeding with you constantly.
>Rhinocerous Beetle GF who despite being strong enough to push cars around lets you top in bed. Carries you around whenever she wants to cuddle
>Giant moth GF who acts like a big blanket when cuddling so she can have all your warmth.
>Ant/Termite GFs who constantly breed with you and start a colony with your seed.
>Xeno insect GF who is huge into bondage using her own resin. Loves to roleplay with her 'breeding stock'.

The last one sounds like it could be an interesting prompt to a story.
Anon gets abducted/kidnapped/rescued/whatever by a zerg-like race. Now constantly breeds to give his genes whenever needed.
There's also a big, domming GF of the upper hive caste. Which anon is a part of, since he's reproductive.

I want my human rights.

>the riots start
>anthros are tranquilizing, grappling, tasing, kidnapping, and mate pressing men.
>all over human rights
>after all is over, a population boom rocks the nation.
>single fathers are using programs left and right.
>a new generation of boomers is born and the cycle repeats.

>an alien race of giant insects who would takeover and subjugate other planets and kidnap males of other races for viable breeding stock to help expand their colony
>Over hundreds of thousands of years, they have expanded their colony across an undiscovered part of the galaxy
>Humans eventually discover them
>insect aliens find out humans have have strong genes and would make stronger offspring for the colony
>alien insects start attacking human spaceships and kidnapping human space colonizers
>they would try not to hurt their kidnapped humans, but would at least strip them of most of their freedoms as their new purpose is specifically breeders

>bug hive aliens make contact and ally with humans/Earth
>they're like bee/ants/etc with hives mostly being females led by a queen/breeding caste and a handful of males being born for breeding purposes
>suddenly all these female bug aliens now are interacting with many humans males when before they'd be lucky to even see a male in their whole life
>all that exposure to male pheromones, even if alien, start to have an affect on the lower castes
>their bodies being flooded with chemicals to change into breeder castes or partial changes into breeder lower caste sort of hybrids
>when humanity accidentally the whole hive into horny breeders
>even worse their instincts make them just as overprotective of human males as their own minority of males
>Earth/humans get put in pretty much protective custody of the bug aliens whether we like it or not

>Take over planets with life to basically serve as a form of gene-bank. Barren planets as essentially tyranniformed and used as a source of biomass and other materials.
>Aliens discover Earth and invade as usual. Humanity is subjugated and cities/towns are converted into organic hives
>Life flourishes as technology is practically all organic now, so is energy. This serves to provide an ample 'zoo' for them to collect new genes for evolution
>Human genes particularly desired for intelligence, endurance and other qualities
>Aliens have some concept of husbandry. Humans both male and female are taken, so as to conserve a pure 'breeding population'
>Spread out across the fleets and the species territory, not many humans are left back on Earth
>Guys spend most of the day busting fat ropes in breeders, queens or being milked by drones. Are assigned human girls to breed and produce children with.
>Enrichment is provided so as to ensure breeding-stock is stress-free and continues to produce gametes at a desirable rate

What happens if a human gets raped by an anthro, but it isn't the 'oh haha I'm getting raped by a sexy animal woman oh nooooo hope I don't coom haha' kinda rape? What if it leaves him traumatized and with a phobia of anthro women?

If anon is not already engaged, force the rapist to be his wife and comfort him for the rest of his life, bear his children if she doesn't already, and always be there for him and be loyal. She is now fully responsible for what she has done to anon and must provide support for his trauma, else she will be killed, this is now her only chance at freedom and life again. And if Anon does not get better by a certain time period, or he rejects him, then the waifur will be promptly executed. Justice, victim support, and rehabilitation done in one swing.

>Be male human
>Have a hobby of looking at fine jewelry and gems, although you never can afford them
>While browsing a store, you hear the ring of a bell signifying the entrance of a new customer
>It's a large dragoness covered in rings, necklaces, and other assorted finery
>She raises an eyebrow at you, making you realize you are staring, and you quickly go back to looking at the display cases
>You become increasingly nervous as you hear her steps head to you, and a looming shadow covers you
>"Lila, I've come to check on how things are going."
>The lizard behind the counter raises her head and smiles at her
>"Oh, everything is going well, lots of customers these days boss, and stealing has gone down. Any reason you felt like visiting now of all times? This isn't your usual schedule."
>"I'm glad. Now, I've been told a gem of particular interest has been passing through my stores and I kept missing it."
>Her large breasts sway enough that you need only look at her shadow to see as she seems to look around
>"But now I think I've finally found it."
>Her breasts weigh down on you, and you feel yourself sweating
>You try to find a way to move, but you're in a little alcove by a wall and another case, leaving you stuck
>"Really?" the lizard gives a mischievous grin. "What's so special about it?"
>"It's the same type of gem that my mother prized dearly. You know how I've talked about it with you before? We shared pictures, and I think it's just perfect."
>"Oh, yes, I know the one. You were raving about it, how could I forget?"
>You begin to panic until you see the worker take out a key, removes a mannequin head on a shelf and the false wood behind it to reveal a safe
>With some fiddling it is opened, and you see a box containing the most beautiful sapphire you've ever seen in your life
>The dragoness puts a hand over your shoulder and bends over a bit to get a closer look, increasing the pressure on your head
>"Truly marvelous. Now I finally have the perfect place for them."
>The lizard stands out her toes as she hands the dragoness the box
>"Now I have another thing-"
>You've had enough of this
>"Um, excuse me, miss? Could I move?"
>"Oh! Sorry. It seems that I've been bothering one of our patrons! Apologies."
>With a step back, you get some breathing room and have the chance to move to a more open space
>You switch over to a display case with a golden choker
>It seems to make light glint off of it, and the small engravings practically shout 'look at me'
>Which only makes the empty space in the middle stand out all the more
>Despite your eyes being focused elsewhere you still hear the conversation
>"Hmm, how about that one? Modified, please."
>"You mean you want one of those from the back?"
>"Yes. You know the size, but keep it blank for now."
>The employee seems to call for someone else, and you hear as another door is open and shut, but this time without the characteristic jingle of the front door
>Soon the door opens again, and you hear the sound of rattling metal
>"Yes, this is what I expected. They employ such wonderful craftsmen. Is the size right though?"
>"How about you try it?"
>"I think I will."
>The feeling of something clamping against your skin makes you jump, but any attempt to move is stopped by some forcing tugging you back
>Turning around, you see the dragoness with a chain in her hands, almost certainly connected to the choker on you
>"Yes, it's just the right size."
>"What are you doing?" you ask, tugging against the chain
>"Dear, did you think I wouldn't notice you in my shops?"
>"I was just looking!"
>"Yes, and not buying anything. I've worked in this business for a long time, and in my stores there are three things. Workers, customers, thieves... and products."
>You try to open it, but it seems to be firmly locked
>"I was concerned that you might be a thief when I first went through the cams, but you never seemed to steal anything from any of my stores."
>She softly picks up your hand, and starts caressing it
>"If you don't buy anything, you don't steal anything, and I know I never hired you, you must be a product."
>"I-I-what are you going to do to me?"
>"Hmm, what am I going to do to you? A better question to ask is what have you been doing to me? I had a private investigator follow you to make sure you weren't up to anything, and found out how you were a cashier at some small store. Surely you couldn't afford anything here. So I've been watching you, getting to know you, and I must say, I really like what I saw."
>"What? I'm sorry, I know, but if I can't buy them can I at least look at them? At least let me pretend I have money?"
>"Nothing wrong with that. I will admit, perhaps learning about you from recordings may have been a little uncouth. Like you, I fell in love with something through a screen, but unlike you, I'm done window shopping. I want to buy," she breathily whispers in your ear
>"Now I could easily buy up that little stand you call a shop and force you under me,"
>She lifts up the ring you saw in the box, and carefully guides it through the hole
>"Or you could accept me. All this jewelry belongs to me, and I know you have an eye for these things. Most of all, you really bring out the beauty in them. Just let me polish you,"
>She gives a long lick against your neck
>"And all of this can be yours. You want to know what my mother always used to tell me about my human father? 'when you polish them just right, they sing'."

>as you finish your daily deodorization routine you note that you're runny low and need to go on a shopping trip.

>you'd met her some 15 years ago when her parents moved into the neighborhood and you two had made fast friends.
>while the two of you grew older she became increasingly large even for an anthro while you stayed almost the same height and weight.
>because you were tiny even for a human she stuck close to you throughout middle and high-school saying she “needed to keep her little buddy safe”
>it's probably why you developed such a crush on her, she actually cared about you and was just some lust crazed maniac.
>you've been wondering how to ask her to be your girlfriend for a long time now.
>it's not like you were afraid of rejection you got along so well that you might as well have been dating but the time never seemed right to ask her and you were the only man she knew besides her father.
>maybe you were just scared of taking things to the next level or maybe wanted to remain pure just that little bit longer and make it all the sweeter when you gave yourself to her.
>after graduation her parents had decided to move back to the old country but she had wanted to stay here and continue her education in a local collage.
>Your parents offered to take her in when they found out about that, didn't even charge her rent they saw her as their own daughter due to you two spending almost every free moment with each other the last 15 years
>as you walk out of your room and into the kitchen you see Arayna's massive 245cm body slightly hunched over the stove cooking.
>that was one major bonus to having her here, almost all the furniture was designed with anthros in mind after all cooking is dangerous and therefore no job for a man better just let one of his wifes handle it.
>as she hears you come in she turns around and greats you with a “oh my anon if you wear a hoodie that's any baggier you'll end up looking like a circus tent”
>”you know you don't have to hide away so much” she continues “if any nasty women give you any trouble I'll take care of them”
you chuckle light heartedly and reply “I have no doubts that you will but I prefer avoiding conflict when possible if they don't know I'm a man they won't try anything.
”plus” you continue “I've been wearing large baggy clothes since middle school so I'm used to it”

>Not knowing said four daughters have their own dominant streak that they either use as a face in public which quickly melts away into awkward submission or an awkward yet cute attempt at domming when alone in the bedroom, or just to spice up the bedroom by using their height and strength to their advantage when with their respective anons
Also Anna was supposed to be a serial killer from the get go. The original post talking about the idea a long while back in /hmofa/ in April 2018 says as much.
>Is it wrong if I having a yearning to make [spoiler:lit]a serial killer anthro who has an unhealthy obsession with a human? She doesn't speak a single word and her reasons for murder are extremely vague, but one day she doesn't kill one particular human but instead kidnaps him for keeping. She then keeps him locked away in a house, most likely her own, to which she returns each night to "love". Problem here is that there will be absolutely 0 love here, at least from the human's side, and the whole thing will end in a downer note no matter what: either with the killer getting away with it, the human getting away and possibly dealing with the killer, or the most stupid ending of all: he eventually enjoys it and doesn't want to leave.[/spoiler:lit]
>Another problem is that it seems more fitting of a thing to make around October.

I like this passage from the Godfather. Would be better if it was genderswapped and anthro'd.
>The first time he had marked her up, he’d been a little worried. She had gone right out to Long Beach to complain to her mother and father and to show her black eye. He had really sweated it out. But when she came back she had been surprisingly meek, the dutiful little Italian wife. He had made it a point to be the perfect husband over the next few weeks, treating her well in every way, being lovey and nice with her, banging her every day, morning and night. Finally she had told him what had happened since she thought he would never act that way again.
>She had found her parents coolly unsympathetic and curiously amused. Her mother had had a little sympathy and had even asked her father to speak to Carlo Rizzi. Her father had refused. “She is my daughter,” he had said, “but now she belongs to her husband. He knows his duties. Even the King of Italy didn’t dare to meddle with the relationship of husband and wife. Go home and learn how to behave so that he will not beat you.”
>Connie had said angrily to her father, “Did you ever hit your wife?” She was his favorite and could speak to him so impudently. He had answered, “She never gave me reason to beat her.” And her mother had nodded and smiled.
She told them how her husband had taken the wedding present money and never told her what he did with it. Her father had shrugged and said, “I would have done the same if my wife had been as presumptuous as you.”

Do one for Luca

>Brasi took Filomena up the stairs to a bedroom. In the bed was a young pretty boy who looked Human, his face painted, his hair red; and with a belly swollen like a sow. The poor boy was so frightened. When he saw Brasi he turned his head away in terror, yes terror, and indeed the look of hatred on Brasi’s evil face was the most frightening thing she had ever seen in her life. (Here Filomena crossed herself again.)
>To make a long story short, Brasi left the room. Two of her pack assisted the midwife and the baby was born, the father was exhausted and went into a deep sleep. Brasi was summoned and Filomena, who had wrapped the newborn child in an extra blanket, extended the bundle to her and said, “If you’re the mother, take her. My work is finished.”
>Brasi glared at her, malevolent, insanity stamped on her face. “Yes, I’m the mother,” she said. “But I don’t want any of that race to live. Take it down to the basement and throw it into the furnace.”
>For a moment Filomena thought she had not understood her properly. She was puzzled by her use of the word “race.” Did she mean because the boy was not anthro? Or did she mean because the boy was obviously of the lowest type; a whore in short? Or did she mean that anything springing from her loins she forbade to live.

>beat someone to death
Unless she's descended from the Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail bunny, I some how doubt she'd be able to do that.

Do you not see how big she is? Not just in stature but also musculature she's big even for a grown human man, and that's not even mentioning her legs, she could pop watermelons like grapes, imagine what an anger-fueled kick from her could do to someone.

Do you think ugly would be speculative and probably something only other anthro women / men find ugly but to human standards at worst hits passable? Say a boar woman?

>Musclefat boar soaked in sweat humping a poor humie into the mud

Also apparentally cats protected Pharaohs from snakes and stuff.
>cats are still kinda dumb but also big and strong to keep humans safe from snakegirls
>mostly because they liked being rewarded and treated as superior

I’m good with that
>cats are the only thing foolhardy enough to square up to snake people in ancient times, since they don’t know any better and got upset they kept trying to kick them out of sun nap spots
>turns out snakes aren’t really tough, and cats might not be lion sized, but they still pack mean punches and bites
>realize it makes people like them, feed them and cheer for them, and treat them like gods
>and so the first pharaohs were made in the anthro world

Whenever they get a partner they always like to feel that they're dominating him through pure force of will, even when the reality is hes pretty willing and enjoying
>thinks shes punishing you by forcing you have sex with her

>most cats have trouble finding jobs, do to simply not having the attention span or smarts to hold one
>but they don’t realize this because they usually get a sugar daddy or mommy that fulfills their every whim, usually a childhood friend or would be co-worker
>they just think they’re being served and worshipped, the only issue being their “servant” is gone from the house for long periods of time
>this is why a growing majority of young cats is getting into bondage, to try to keep their future hubbies from disappearing all day when they could be spending that time as their seat cushions and such
I love the idea of egotistical idiots who don’t realize everyone is humoring their delusions of grandeur. Like finding your cat gf stuck in the garbage can cause she tried to grab a plate of food she smelled in their, or trying to join you in the bath and running out crying cause they got wet

So are these cats naturally smug and prideful, or do they just tend to become like that after being pampered and served by their partners?

Not him, but I imagine all cats are prideful, but house cats are smug while 'feral' cats are ornery and see the house cats as high class fools who got lucky. Both might dominate you, but feral cats are much more crass about it, and more likely threaten you with violence. 
A feral turned house cat however would probably be really protective of you and try to help you when she can, and would be very careful not to hurt you during sex.

Kinda both. Being demanding is what makes people give them more.

That makes me imagine a greentext about an alley cat who slowly turns into a house cat who still thinks she's the tough gangster/ delinquent she used to be, even though her now decadent and pampered life style has led to her gaining quite a few pounds and turning soft.
But, she actually is right and any one who thinks they can take her honey and future litter dady away from her just because she got a bit fat and lazy is going to end up in the hospital

What do you do?

I might also be willing to do something with a rat girl. Maybe not a porno, but I'd like other suggestions.

What's wrong with the porno shoot setting? Anyway here's another idea

Adding some scenarios of my own:
>Anon is kidnapped by not-Skaven and becomes a rat-breeder. Pumping litters into rats.
>Anon escapes from abusive human GF. Gets taken in by a rat gangster and her crew of female rats.
>Zootopia-like setting. Anon is seen as a bit of an 'ugly', but finds companionship with one or more 'ugly' creatures.

You and a couple of your friends go out to celebrate since you only have a month left before you graduate high school you go out to the local restaurant and then go catch a movie.
>Some time passes and your all walking back from the movies and one of them is saying with a little worry in there voice that it's getting kinda late and that we should hurry home.
>You roll your eyes as the other reminds you of how their parents have always told them to be back home before eight o'clock.
>You tell them that yours and their parents are always trying to scare you and your friends with stories about how the local biker gang of mongolian female snow leopards are out on the prowl at this time for young unaware guys like ourselves.
>You tell them with a chuckle were practically grown men why should we be scared of a bunch of cats they can't be that bad.
>It's gotten a bit darker as your walking one of your friends watch beeps eight o'clock and you all hear off in the distance the rumble of motorcycles and loud music playing.

I kind of have this as an idea but I'm no writer
I guess the bikers would catch up to them anon and his friends would take off into a back ally where his friends would think there traped but anon notices there's a small spot in the fence they can squeeze through anon tries to pull it wider for them to get through.
Anon is the last one to try and get through but gets pulled back into the ally the others are yelling for him but he tells them to run and the head biker yells out to the other girls looks like we got ourselves some entertainment.
He gets kidnapped the girls go cross country with him and are put on a wanted list on there journey they come across rival and ally bikers some try and us and abuse him or take him but the girls usually come to the rescue at first he thinks there just sex-starved brutes but he slowly starts to find out that there really kind at heart and just want a sweet guy in their life.

It's a well known fact sharks can smell blood in the water from miles away, but did you know that shark anthros can do the same with the pent up cum in your balls? Just the same way as you don't want to go into the ocean with an open wound, you also don't want to go swimming if you've refrained from release for a few days. Make sure you drain those nuts before you get in the water, or you may have something other than seaweed touch your leg.

do not listen to this anon's advice all antros can smell if you've masturbated, and if you don't clean extremely well some of the residue will attract them. I swear ore and more anthros are coming on here to try and trick people.

But, if you don't smell of sex, anthros will often think you're pent up and will sometimes attempt to trap you in a dark alleyway or somewhere private for a reach around or any other way to relieve you. They might even try to full on rape you and claim you for themselves if they think you're single.

yeah and if you smell of sex but don't smell of an anthro they will know you've verile and single. Plus the smell of male seed will send them into heat. I've had to run away from too many of them to let myself smell again.

>“Six it is then,” your mother smiles as she gets to work setting up six small candles at each corner of the cake.
>Megan giggles and runs out of the kitchen to join her sisters and the pile of presents. You hear Amanda call out for Sally, who briefly looks back to the living room. She turns back to stare longingly at the chocolate cake before reluctantly leaving to join her sisters. Now alone with your mother, you ask, “You need any help?”
>“No, dear, just gotta get all of the candles in... Figured I’d either use them all now or have some left over for next year.”
>“You know, you didn’t have to get... Well, everything I put on the list.”
>“Oh hush,” she says, turning back to look at you. “It was no big deal, and I wanted to spoil my little honey buns.”
>“Yeah, but... Well, thank you,” you say. You hold back your worries about them becoming bratty as they grow up, especially if she insists on continuing to do this. Just last Christmas she got each daughter three gifts each, clothes separate, and now she looks to be upping the ante with four each.

>Waifur rapes you and keeps you as slave, gets to know you and later feels bad about doing it. She wants to prove dearly that she doesn't see him as a possession. Wants you to go rough on her in sex and basically do what ever you want to show that she is giving him control. Kind of hard to do based on how in shape and large she it. It is basically her forceing her self in the most vulnerable position she can think of while you pound her wildly.
>Anon betrays anthro best friend and rapes her during youth. Years later she finds him, now larger and "gently rapes him" saying that now that we can both heal together. (She always loved him, but was sad that he had to resort to rape and leaving; more the leaving part than the actual rape). Anon repents for his sins and the anthro finally gets what she wants "Anon".
>Anon goes into depression and starts developing bad habits like substance abuse and suicidal thoughts, eventually gets convicted from apartment. Co-Worker and long time friend takes him into her apartments. After weeks of living there, the anthro starts taking measures to make sure anon doesn't' kill himself or takes drugs. Makes him sleep in the same bed, bath together, groom each other, etc. Eventually starts to force him to relax every now and then via naked spooning and handjobs as he sits in her lap, all with dubious consent from anon. The sexual acts only escalate from there.

How about dominating waifurs without the rape part. Why not a gentle femdom gf or wife? Who cares about you and will pin you to the bed, but also protect you from anything and cuddle you every night. The thing about a lot of these stories is the anthro seeks the main enjoyment for herself and often sees her partner as lesser. When, in my opinion, sometimes her striving for mutual pleasure and fun for both parties sounds very nice while still being on top. Forgive small rant, just kinda sharing ideas, not trying to attack any fantasies.

Thanks. It actually got me thinking of what a truly matriarchal hyena society might look like. What do you think:
>wealth is usually only passed down to female offspring
>marriage is basically enslavement of the male in exchange for support, protection, and breeding rights
>marriages are often arranged by the mother of the bride, choosing from willing suitors
>males are selected mostly for economic potential
>wives are legally responsible for the actions of their husbands
>wives are permitted to use corporal punishment on their husbands (within reason)
>husbands can sue their wives for abuse or infidelity, large financial damages and divorce (ie escape) if desired
>males can be compelled into marriage if they engage in a sexual relationship, consensual or otherwise
>if the male is already married, his wife can be sued

funny thing is spotted hyenas are more complex than that and it'd actually be simpler if it was just a strict matriarchy
>rank is hereditary from mother in birth clan
>loss it when you leave to join another
>majority of males leave even if they're high ranking from their mother
>rank has no bearing on mate selection for females
>there's even a matriarch who keeps going to the same lowest ranked male to breed
>size is also not always tied to rank so you get monsters that can have triplets and all survive and she's not even a matriarch
>males will form small side clans together along with being part of a normal clan
>average hyena clan be 50+
>each hyena has their own unique call signal
>higher ranking clan members can have favorites they protect from other clan mates lower than them
>etc

>move to another kingdom after yours gets raided or you get tired of the nobles stabbing each other in the dicks and common people like you getting dragged into more small wars
>try your luck with one of those beastkin kingdoms
>the land is ruled by the Firemane clan
>be new lowly peasant trying to start anew
>giant of a spotted hyena woman walks up decked out like a tribal queen

>get carried off into the wild and get struggle snuggled to an inch of your life

Poll anon here with the results
The most popular seem to be:
-Rat Gangsters, where rescued abused Anon becomes their 'team dad/husband/fuckbuddy'
-Nocturnal/Creepy/Big-Hand Anon(your hands are fine by the way Anon). Finds love in a nocturnal anthro.
-A POFG fusion. Anon is this world's human equivalent of a wolf-dog, and is acquired by an anthro mare for studding purposes
-Anon becomes the husband of a bunch of anthro druids
And lastly, as a bonus. I will write the southern boar UFB short story.
I'm taking suggestions on all of these ideas, so if you have an interesting thought, or want to see something. Shoot it my way.

Also, to expand further upon my /PoFG/ idea. Anon arrives in the furry world, and being much larger, stronger and intelligent than the domestic humans he's thought to be a wild-species.
They run some tests, find out he's a 'wolfdog' according to this world, and given that he's very intelligent he's not suited for regular ownership, or being 'released to his kin'.
He gets adopted by a mare who runs a sanctuary for those sorts of humans, either wild ones that were 'tamed' or domestic ones that need special needs.
While Anon stays there, she finds out just how smart and exceptional Anon is. Which brings attention to him, which leads to studies and studding. The mare spoils him a bit because of this, so she makes sure damn well that Anon knows she's the one in charge.
Which often involves lots of sloppy, sex involving her horse-pussy and making sure Anon knows she's the Alpha of the farm.

>Cumming in a rabbit's pussy
>All done by her shiftshaping and morphing

Any boy who tells their anthro girl size doesn't matter is lying. Big ones are great for snuggles.

Assuming you mean tails, I'm in a bit of a pickle.
>Fav anthros are dobies
>Not a very big tail at all.
>Similar anthros have big bushy tails.
>E.g. Huskies and German Shepherds
>They can wrap around a waist and are soft, but don't have much weight to them.
>Snake and shark tails, heavy, can wrap around the whole body, and lean against them.
>Ice-cold to the touch, not soft, not fluffy.

Would a shark gf breastfeed me? I don't know what shark milk tastes like.

Some sharks are viviparous, so it's not out of the question for them to breastfeed. It'd probably be very thick and concentrated, depends if they still passively osmoregulate through their skin using urea concentration and other zoological bullshit that'll probably go over most people's heads.
Imagine drinking cream. That's your answer.

>Had two wolves as neighbors in my street

Uh oh, the day of reckoning has come. Anthros have invaded and have captured 99% of our planet on Day 1. Now they set their sites on the final human base. Roll for your fate
>Odd singles: you die a brave and valiant death on the battlefield

Too angry to die or be raped, you now lead a one man counter-attack against them, ready to take back your home and of course, to RIP and TEAR.
