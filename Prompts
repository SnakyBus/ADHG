>Of course they would take you on fine dates. Someone who could afford a human would likely be some a wealthy aristocrat, CEO or politician. 
>There's only one planet with a large number of human men on it, so until they fix that you can be sure that your buyer would treat you like a precious treasure. 
>She might dress you well and buy you nice things, and she'd almost certainly bring you to fancy parties to show you off to impress her allies and spark jealousy in her rivals. 
>Any guards posted around you will probably be more for protection than to ensure you won't escape.
>But understand, she still has power over you.

>She'd show you the scientific studies proving that there is no better species to be with. Eventually though, she will stop holding back and follow through with her plan. 
>No one would blame her, with such a fine specimen in her house. You were practically made to please her, and you're not doing your duty. 
>Don't worry, even if she goes through with it she'd still tell you that she loves you, and will gladly give you a kiss before leaving for work the next day. >She's just taking what she's owed, it doesn't mean she doesn't love you. She'd bring you something nice on the way back to make up for it. After she had her first taste, she can't just give up on swaying you.

 and efficient she'd be with how she handled you. Walking you while grabbing your hand and neck. Pinning you to the floor with practiced ease.

>You'd be so mindbroken. So weak.
>Imagine the scratching need the day after. Recognizing that you were addicted. She'd welcome you back and treat you every time you walked into her territory.

>Yeen GF running Anon off the sidewalk because she keep closing the gap and he keeps moving away

>Striped Hyenas in particular will be especially affectionate once they're inside their dens; even if an individual wouldn't normally be that way, you're likely to see a noticeable change as soon as she gets settled in. If she's already affectionate, you'd better learn how to breath through all that fluff. She will let you out for air, but it's still a good idea to maximize the amount of time your face can spend buried in her fluffy parts, as a show of respect.

>How'd you go from bored co-workers to romantic partners?
>How did you convince her to take the lead sexually?

>Dragons definitely, a combination of size and temperament.
>Snakes/Nagas/Lamias...all the better to hug(squeeze) you into submision.
>Sharks and large dolphins, doubly so when in the water.
>Most of the FAoHM thread does agree on large wolfgirls, yeens, and crocodilains, so there is that to consider. Personally, I think it's more of a temperament thing.

>Aren't vipers like 99% females though.
>Yes. They are used to two dicks, and in who knows how long, they haven't had a single one. So many of them are horny virgins who haven't had a proper sex education. 
>They hardly know what sex is yet, much less understand that this incredibly enjoyable ritual requires consent. Would you say no to a massage? Why say no to this? Humans are weird. And weak. And clearly need to be taught that asking for consent is a waste of time.
>No one in their right mind would say no to something so fun.

>Goddamn do I love anthro horses. Why can't I have a loving, gentle dom mare wife? I just want to have her hold me close, feel her warm fur and the breath coming out of her snout, and drift off to sleep to the sound of her heartbeat.

>you'll never be a trillionaire CEO's son stolen away by an enterprising hypercompetent shadowrunner to a life of high crime and adventure

I want a mare who's sweet, loving and gentle, yet knows that she's in charge. Climbing on top and slowly riding my cock, stopping every time I hit the very razors edge of orgasm, not letting me cum until shes had multiple of her own, all the while whispering into my ear about how good it'll feel when she finally lets me cum, and kissing me as she brings me to the edge again.

>Horses could easily work for both. They're pretty big and strong, and you have the whole "role reversal" thing going on. Not to mention crops are like, a huge staple in femdom.
>But they could also work for submissive stuff, because of said riding crops and whatnot.

>You're looking for an assassin who always seems to get away
>You know she's a wasp, but she's a master of hiding her tracks
>Doesn't help that she's apparently very skilled at disguising herself
>One day while looking in a room dusting for prints, someone puts a hand on your mouth and holds a knife to your neck
>It was obvious who it was
>You expected her to kill you
>You had no reason to expect her to start smelling you
>She gave a quick peck on your neck before hitting your head, making you black out
>Since then you've been finding calling cards in your hotel rooms, a feral wasp eating a bee

>You fell to your knees as you realized she could have easily killed you twice now
>You don't know what scares you more
>That an assassin was able to initiate physical contact with you last night
>Or that that same assassin seems to be enamored with you

>ynw be saved by a shark girl after being stranded out in the ocean
>holding you against her chest as she backstrokes
>being completely calm, floating in the water with her

>Occasionally she "accidentally" throws you into the water

>But she insists that to keep water out of your lungs she needs to share air on the way up
>You're pretty sure sharing air doesn't require that much tongue

>Literally nothing you can do if a Pokemon decides it wants to use you
>Most Pokemon's fighting spirit and inner desire to be stronger means that being a dom and topping are always preferred
>They'll perceive fighting back as a power struggle, and will assert their dominance by screwing the resistance out of you
>Submitting only makes them more aroused, but they're endeared to your recognition of their power and are gentle as they take care of you
>Word will quickly get around the wilds when a human


 is down to get fucked
>tfw youll never be a cute, shy pokemon trainer who ends up finding a strong and dominant pokemon who ends up taking you.

>It was said that once humans and Pokemon married each other
>Most people assume that marriage back then was the same as today
>They don't seem to realize that Pokemon marriage was females kidnapping human men as mates
>Humans created houses and walls not because they grew smarter at some point
>They made them because it was the only way to keep from being dragged off caveman style by some horny Goodra

>Humanity had forgotten about the past and started living normally with their Pokemon
>They are now ubiquitous in our civilization
>Arceus save us if their desires reawaken
>Because now even the safest places are teaming with them

>a world where teasing is a way of testing how good a person's life is
>shyness and nervousness is perceived as a cry for help: a subconscious desire to be taken away
>humans are just naturally weaker, and as such have much more reason to be shy and nervous
>pokemon/anthros are genetically inclined to be aroused at submissiveness

>Arceus was born of the collective, unmet need of humankind for love and companionship
>Shat out thousands of different monsters to fill that need
>Decided humans were too keen on subjugation, made the monsters fuckstrong and predatory to balance things out
>A little too strong and predatory
>World is now a theocracy under the Arcean Church
>And that, Anon, is why you're going to the re-education camp if you show up to that Humanity First meeting tomorrow.
>Remember, they have psychics! Try not to think any bad thoughts!

>There are still some who believe it was the opposite
>Humans were made so that Pokemon may always find a loving husband
>They may try to reject the role, but to the Pokemon, these failed attempts only prove one thing
>It was the role that they were made for

>ynw attempt to struggle against an incineroar just for her to pin you back down and shut down any sort of resistance
>Incineroar innecesantly pointing out how feminine you are and how much you need to train
>you try to go to the gym once and she pulls you back because she actually loves you like this, weak, feeble, and unable to resist

>What if she loves when they run just because she knows she'd easily catch up?
>She loves it alright. Imagine the fear in his eyes when she tackles him down, pinning his arms right above his head and stopping any attempts of escape
>I remember a Mythbusters episode where they tried testing if running side to side would permit one to escape a crocodile/alligator faster than running straight away from it.
>They ran into an immediate problem, as the gators/crocs would not pursue the bait more than a few feet after the initial lunge. Thus the myth was deemed busted.
>If this applies to gator girls, they will likely stalk you for a short time, carefully closing the gap without you noticing, before launching at you without warning. That, or positioning herself so your escape routes are blocked. After the initial attack, she may pursue you for a short time. Probably plow through some minor obstacles along the way or overturn a car with her strength.
>Unfortunately for her, that thicc gator body, thighs, and tail aren't great for speed or distance running, so she'll come to an awkward halt gazing at you lustily until energy builds up for another attempt. If she is successful in grabbing you however, odds are you'll be deathrolled for a few dozen yard before being pinned under a very dominant and happily rumbling gator woman

>Wildcats are defiantly femdom material, and would more than likely enjoy hunting some guy down. And given that all cats tend to play with what they catch...well, you'll want to pack some band-aids.
>Personality wise, probably demanding with a bit of a superiority complex, and generally lazy in her off time. Might have you on a leash as you pet her and scratch behind her ears as she lounges on the couch.
>Just an opinion…

>Ywn be dominated by an amazonian hyena who want to improve your bloodline by getting you YEENED and make you a stay at home dad for the cubs you have.

>Alternatively, lionesses
>you’re a stay at home dad
>your job is to take care of the kids and fuck/comfort your wives

>get abducted by a pride of rogue lionesses
>they formed from random lionesses that left or had no pride or got tired of their male
>learn humans have no barbs and formed a plan to get one
>now they have a male they're an official pride now
>not much different from a normal lion pride with the females out hunting and the male staying at the den, but this time it's because a human doesn't do well in the Savannah and hunting with lions
>now the lionesses bring food for their male to keep his strength/stamina up when they fuck him into the ground together
>they got to be careful with their human due to humans being smaller than lions and the no barbs has them going much rougher and longer since there is no pain and only pleasure
>male lions can't even challenge their human for ownership of the pride since the lionesses attack together because they're not putting up with barb dicks ever again

>monster hunter, but the monsters are females that cause issues due to being horny and harassing people/villages/towns/etc
>hunters have to go out and try to calm

>The hunters try to fight at first
>It goes badly, with many men being taken back to the female's caves
>After other monsters hear about what human men are like, they start attacking the villages
>Hunters turn into sacrifices
>Eventually the villages manage to convince the monsters to give rare materials in return for men
>The economy thrives, but few men who arrive realize that they might just be traded to the monsters to help the economy
>Telling them you are married won't save you

>Live in the world of Pokemon
>You aren't a trainer, you were never especially interested in risking life and limb, or teaching Pokemon how to fight
>You'd probably be a terrible teacher anyway, seeing as you know nothing about fighting
>That isn't to say you don't love Pokemon, you do
>When you found a rockruff eating from a dumpster, you had to take her home and clean her up
>You may have gotten bit by her, but you can't blame a poor thing like that for being frightened
>She was much nicer after you gave her some food
>Not feeling comfortable with letting her go, you let her live in your house and named her Luna
>Luna was often very affectionate, always licking your face whenever you put it near her
>Going to bed was a bit tricky, because you'd find yourself covered in slobber as soon as you let your head hit the pillow
>There was still some... problem behavior from her
>Not just because she'd fight you during bath time
>She was very protective of you
>Not entirely out of the ordinary, but it was always worst around women and female Pokemon for some reason
>One day a passing trainer showed off her Salazzle
>You don't know why, but you got this really weird, comforting vibe from that Pokemon
>Luna seemed to disagree as she flew into a rage
>Despite the type advantage, she lost pretty badly
>You apologized to the trainer, and brought Luna to the pokecenter
>After that you expected her to calm down as she might risk getting beaten again, but you were terribly wrong
>If anything she got into more fights
>Even when you were sleeping, she'd leave to fight
>Then one night it happened
>You practically jumped when you heard the sound of splintering wood
>A strange form, shrouded by darkness opened your door and you screamed
>It fell on top of you and you struggled to get free
>Then you heard snoring
>You felt cold metal against your chest, seemingly tied to the individual's neck
>Carefully, so as not to wake the intruder, you held it to your face
>Luna?
>Things were kind of the same, but also different since Luna evolved into a Lycanroc
>For one, wrestling her into the bath
>Now it was actual wrestling, and she was easily stronger than you, pushing you into the tub
>Surprisingly after that she jumped in and forcefully lathered you
>Seeing what she was doing and knowing she was much stronger then you, you stopped fighting it
>Although you did push her away whenever she started getting her hands a bit too low
>You felt that it was some sort of revenge for always cleaning her, but after her very handsy wash, she had no problem sitting still for you to clean her
>After cleaning her top and getting lower, you noticed her own privates
>As a rockruff you'd clean that spot without thinking, but now it just felt different
>Like putting your hand around there would be wrong
>You took your hand away right as it reached that spot and handed the soap to her
>She looked at it in confusion, and to your surprise started to growl
>You thought she would crush the soap, but thankfully she just angrily continued with her washing
>When you took her for a walk, she stood closely by your side, growling at every woman who got too close
>You were a bit worried when one of your neighbors came to talk to you
>You tried to convince her to calm down by reminding her that she was friendly, but her growls just got worse
>Thankfully you managed to calm her with a good hug, but she wouldn't let you go without firmly slobbering all over your face
>She seemed pretty adamant on staring your neighbor down as she licked you, her coarse, rocky tongue brushing against your face
>When night fell, you laid in bed
>You wondered if you should let her sleep beside you still, as she wasn't really a puppy anymore
>She walked up to the bed, and got down on all fours, looking intently at your face
>You begin to lightly sweat, a bit uncomfortable with the close contact
>She brought her face to yours, and started to give her usual slobbery good night kisses
>The usual feeling of a large wet tongue dragged against your

 face
>Something was different though
>Instead of the usual rapid licking, her tongue was slow
>It was like she was carefully tasting you, studying your flavor
>Then her tongue darted into your mouth
>The meaty organ was entangling with yours, pushing it gently
>Panicked, you pushed her away
>Surprise covered her face for a moment, before it turned into rage
>She grabbed your arms and held them firmly to the bed before she smashed her face into yours again
>This time, instead of the original gentleness you felt your tongue being battered
>Any attempt to pull back, and she would reach deeper into your mouth
>Not a single spot is untouched as she scoured you, and the drool because heavy and you're forced to gulp it down
>She pulled away and smiled smugly at you as you gasp for air
>Her hand let go of yours, and moved down to your pants
>With a yank your member stood tall and brushed against her thigh
>Her hand moved to your face, and you felt it caress your cheek
>With a thrust, your member went inside of her drooling lips
>The way she slammed her hips into yours hurt a bit, but it was nothing to the pressure of her pussy's grip
>She looked at your face with that smug look again and you tried to look away
>Soon her other hand reached for your head, and forced you to turn back to her
>She smirked at as you tried to use your free hands to move hers away, but she just chuckled at your failed efforts
>She changed the pace of her thrusts and began gyrating
>Her eyes scanned your face and gauged your reactions
>Her own face occasionally shifted, from a smirk, to curiosity, to the look you'd expect one to give to a mewling kitten
>As you felt drool running down your mouth, she suddenly stopped and looked into your eyes
>The look she gave you was kind, and you almost expected her to let you go
>Then she attacked again, using the previous knowledge gleaned from your reactions
>That's too much, and you feel yourself release into her
>As you spasmed, she held your head tight
>The only thing you could look at were her bright red eyes
>After you fell limp, she gave a small kiss on your lips
>She grinned once more, but this time it was a pure one with no malevolence, not hiding any tricks
>It was the same smile that she wore as the girl you found in the garbage
>She just grew up
>You both fall asleep, her head resting beside you and one massive hand lightly scratching your head

>Simple. You know how sharks are said to be capable of smelling blood from miles away? They could do the same with sperm. Just stick your dick in the ocean, and you'll eventually fish one out.

>"Oh, Anon! What do you mean your religion says humans and anthros are not to be wed?"
>"Why would such a terrible religion say that? You were put upon this Earth as gifts to anthro women. It's what brings humanity meaning! Please, come to the church so we can baptize you properly."
>"Anon, don't fight it. You're only hurting yourself. I will drag you there and help if it means you can repent for your sins and know paradise."
>"Do not worry, you're only a sweet man who got lost on the path to heaven. I know you'll be forgiven, the daughters of Eve can be very persuasive. After a night with us, and a bit of reading of our book you'll see that they are merely imposters."

>a world where anthros make up 90% of Earth's population and humans are rare
>anthro societies see humans as strange, cute beings that can't survive on their own and need to be protected and loved

>Humans since the dawn of time were viewed as priceless and beloved by all
>Anthros love their cute features, and know that they are too weak to fight back for independence
>Because of this, there are few things more valuable than a human
>It's even believed that some wars started over humans, with the most famous one being the Iliad, where the lion princess of Troy stole
 the adored husband meant for the dog queen of Sparta
>In the Medieval era, specially trained pleasure men might be given away to help push for alliances
>This made most humans direct descendants of royalty or other people who held great power, making them worth even more
>In the modern age, although humans may no longer be considered property, it is hard not to find adults who are under the protection of a powerful figure
>A human without bodyguards would almost certainly find himself kidnapped or used by some desperate female
>They are never hurt, however, as to do such a thing will incur the wrath of anyone with a set of morals
>Then there are the extremist groups
>The largest one is a new religion quickly gaining traction, claiming that male anthros were put down by some devil like figure, and humans are the only true males
>Then there are the children of Felinity, a group that thinks cats are superior to all others, and children of both cats and humans will lead them to true perfection
>Along with a myriad of others who took the idea and replaced cats with their own species
>One thing is for sure, people are willing to give a lot to be with a man
>And those who have them refuse to part so easily with their grand treasures

>animals excessively outnumber humans
>humans are kinda small in body mass compared to lot of species
>don't have mating seasons
>human females are kinda stretchy
>both human males and females have incredible sexual endurance
>also males have the biggest goddamn dick-to-bodymass ratio out of everyone with the exception of horses and ducks

>In the twenty first century, mankind received word without a doubt, that they were not alone in the galaxy.
>Alien spacecraft hovered outside every city, far enough away to not be threatening, but visible from the ground.
>After a few minutes, every device on Earth reported a single message in text and audio.
"We come in peace, do not be alarmed. We ask that the populace go about their lives as normal and avoid panic."
"We will convene at the United nations building in two of your days."
>Panic was thankfully minimal, though everyone was definitely stressed over the ordeal.
>Ambassadors were rushed to the UN building, and over a period of several days, details began to unfurl.
>The aliens had reached out through social media, so as to keep the public up to date when the governments would not.
>Apparently, 100,000 years back, Greys took samples of earth's fauna and began doing genetic experimentation.
>They only raised females, however, as a means of population control, ensuring they could not bred on their own.
>The Greys used artificial gene sequencing tech to create male zygotes and artificially inseminate the females. This gave them better contro over their evolution.
>Eventually, they ended up with anthro amazonian women of numerous species to fight their wars for them in Andromeda.
>After the wars, the anthros wondered why they were subservient to the Greys, and began to ask questions about their history.
>This eventually culminated in a rebellion that lasted the better part of 500 years.
>The anthros did achieve victory, but at a terrible cost, the gene-sequencing tech was destroyed, though stockpiles of viable sperm remained.
>Thus, they came to earth, to exchange technology, space travel, and protection, for human men, as their biology had been tweaked to accept it in route by what few scientist they had and information from scouting parties.

>You are a young brigadier in Europe set in the 17th century
>Your societal position can be considered as some kind of proto-mafia, less hierarchal and more delinquent
>Your last disruption job went well, and you successfully snitched some rival activities to a troop of carabineers
>However the rival clan manages to identify you and immediatly hire bandits to teach you a lesson
>It doesn't take long until those bandits manage to find you
>You didn't see it coming, as you thought they were just campers in the area, they were even singing folk songs togheter with a guitar...
>One taller than the other, a vixen and a lynx correspectivly
>They chained you inside a carriage, took turns beating and cutting you with knives, the lynx even used her claws as she beat you, living marks on your face and abomen.
>They branded you on the back of the shoulder with the symbol of the very clan who hired them. Then they also took turn in trying out the freshly tendered meat, you only could be glad that the vixen was sweet about it because the lynx was quite eager to dig her claws onto your back as only lord knows how many loads you dumped into them, solely to satisfy their heat.
>You are dumped at night the feet of an hideout of your clan, your comrades would find your naked and unconcious body only later in the morning.

>you are a lone trader, traveling hundreds or even thousand of miles to get from one town to the next with nothing but a small wagon of goods to sell and food to keep you alive.
>one day, while traveling on the lonely road, you get raided by a group of yeen bandits who not only take your wagon full of resources, but they also decide to keep you as their own breeding bitch.

>Imagine being that helpless. Just pinned to the mattress with her weight on you, sliding in and out. Feeling sensations you'd never felt before. Her sharp eyes piercing you from an inch away as she takes full control. Trying to keep your composure as she draws out gasps and moans from your pinned form.

>The great civilization of the lizardwomen had dominated the jungles for centuries.
>They created impressive cities with towering temple pyramids, dedicated to their gods.
>Local human tribes would be subjugated, and made to pay tribute to the lizardwomen.
>It was only proper for the strong to benefit from the weak, as nature intended.
>Human males were prized possessions,

 able to last longer and be ready again faster than their own males.
>Their body heat was welcoming, their skin soft and supple, and their scent intoxicating.
>As a result, the Fertility ceremony overseen by the High Priestess requires such individuals.
>Every year, the human tribes would offer up one of their virgins as tribute for it.
>Depending on how many of the priesthood they were able to satisfy, a human tribe could be rewarded or punished.
>One year however, after an intense storm from the vast waters, a curiosity arrived.
>A tribe had secured a pale man, from an unknown region, and who spoke an unfamiliar tongue.
>He was taller than the native humans, broader in the shoulders too, and his eyes a startling green.
>According to the tribe, he'd been found upon the beach wearing strange garments.
>And, according to testimony, when asked of his origins, he pointed across the sea from where the sun arose.
>They, of course, did not know if this was true, or if he was a virgin, but the tribe felt it warranted attentions of a higher authority
>The High Priestess, upon learning this, made a note to reward the tribe of humans for their diligence.
>The Pale One was brought to the great city of Centecochitl, where the High Priestess and the grand temple of Xiomara were.
>While he was indeed noticeably larger than a native human, his face was quite youthful in appearance.
>He seemed rather alarmed at the appearance of the Lizardwomen, and would do his best to back away when approached.
>It was understandable for one o be intimidated by those superior to themselves, as Nature intended.
>Most definitely if a human had never met one of the lizard kin before, and arguably one of the most important females.
>With a gesture, the High Priestess ordered the Pale One to be stripped of his garments so he could be examined properly.
>He did struggle and protest, but it was his fault for hiding so much of his body under leathers and fabrics.
>Even his FEET had been covered for some insanty, even the soft-skined tribesmen went barefoot.
>It was quite shocking to see even paler skin upon such a body, hidden away from the scorching sun.
>The Male fussed, and his face turned alarmingly red from embarrassment, a rather strange reaction.
>What kind of backwards civilization of humans taught themselves to be ashamed of their bodies, the very work of the creator?
>And what a body this one had, the pale flesh showcasing his well defined musculature from a life of hard labor.
>Much to the delight of the High Priestess, Xiomara had blessed this male quite generously.
>Oh, the High priestess would most certainly reward the tribe of the Aztecs most generously for this tribute.
>The Pale one was given a loincloth, before being sent along to be prepared for the Fertility Ceremony.
>He was given drink and food, so as to boost his production and endurance.
>Then, a few giggling servants washed him, enjoying his attempts to resist them, truly humans needed to learn hygiene was important.
>Sacred oils and perfumes were massaged into his skin, but no tribal markings were applied, for his people were unknown.
>Finally, he was served with a elixir of frothing chocolate and fermented fruit, to ease any reservations he might have.
>As the sun began to set, the Ceremony began, and music began to flow freely from pipes and drums.
>A night of debauchery was to descend upon Centecochitl, and hopefully Xiomara would bless the wombs of females to bear young.
>The High Priestess was already atop the temple with several members of the priesthood, all females.
>Adorned with talismans and perfumed, the began dancing and reciting prayers to the Goddess of Fertility.
>Even as she hefted an incense burner to the heavens, the High Priestess could see the Pale One at the base.
>A pair of Temple guards, female warriors tried and tested in fierce battles, were bringing him up the steps.
>There was however, a concerning note, as the male was fighting with unusual vigor against their grip.
>They were having to all but drag him
 up the steps of the temple, all 69 of them.
>It was as though he was deathly afraid of whatever lay at the top, a ridiculous notion!
>Then again, the Pale One did hail from across the vast seas, this was possible disorienting and frightening to the lost male.
>Still, his strength might have tested that of a lizardwoman in such a state, but the Temple Guard held him with ease.
>When he was atop the temple, the Pale One looked around wildly, his breath coming in rapid gasps.
>The moment he spotted the alter, he began trying to break free with renewed vigor, a foolish notion.
>Even if he were to miraculously break free of the Temple Guards, more than a score of the priesthood would be upon him.
>The lizard women, even their lowest, were faster and stronger than the human males, and could subdue them, as Nature intended.
>With care, the Pale one was bound to the Alter, the stone smooth as a river rock, and in such manner not to cause harm.
>The Temple guards left him their, drinking his body in with their eyes and licking their lips.
>Many of the females gazed upon the Pale One with wonder, though more than a few were skeptical.
>The High Priestess ignored them, her hands dipping into a bowl of sacred lubricant, coating her palms and fingers in it.
>She approached the Pale One, and began to rub his manhood and scrotum carefully, enticing him to harness.
>While his face bore an expression of immense bewilderment, the blush told the High Priestess that he was indeed a virgin.
>She straddled his hips with ease, trapping his throbbing member between their bellies, and gauging his expression.
>Once she learned his language, she'd ask what silly thing had frightened him so.
>And as the sun disappeared and darkness fell, she rose up and engulfed him in a single, smooth, motion to the hilt.
>his breath seemed to leave him, but oddly, he didn't moan like many of the tribesmen before him had.
>Rather, he grit his teeth, and avoided looking at her altogether. Did he think he could resist pleasure itself?
>The High Priestess smiled, he would submit and give her his essence, as all males would, and as nature intended.
>She began to ride the Pale one at a sedate pace, fast enough to cause a smacking sound, but not hard enough to bruise.
>All the while she gazed down at the male, waiting for when he finally stopped being stubborn and submitted.
>Across the city, musicians played and dancers moved, and lovers embraced in carnal pleasure.
>While the other priestesses had kept their distance at first, a few came forward to look at the Pale One.
>Soon, the sound of music and flesh, along with the scents of perfumes and musk, overcame their reservations.
>They began to lick, nip, suckle, and kiss at his pale skin, savoring this rare and blessed find.
>Some sought to stimulate themselves against his body, while others whispered sweet words of encouragement into his ears.
>Throughout it all, the Pale one resisted as best he could, to not give into what they offered.
>But it would be in vain, the female was superior to the male, as nature intended.
>The Pale One would give the High Priestess his essence, as the Goddesses had intended.
>Finally, as she began to approach her climax, the Pale One stopped fighting, and let loose an adorable moan of pleasure.
>He began to reciprocate, face burning with embarrassment, as the other priestesses crooned at him.
>Then, his limits finally reached and resistance broken, the Pale One climaxed , the male nearly screaming from the pleasure.
>Moments later, the High Priestess reached hers, her folds ruthlessly milking ever drop from him as she sighed.
>For a few seconds, they stared at each other, before the High Priestess removed herself from him.
>His expression of wonderment turned to alarm as he gazed upon his erection, it only having gotten bigger.
>He muttered something in numb horror, even as the next member of the priesthood mounted him.
>In the end, the Pale One had managed to satisfy five more female before passing out, truly remarkable.
>After the sordid fluids had been washed from him, the High Priestess order the Guards to take him to her quarters.
>When the Ceremony had come to a close, she descended the temple to bathe briefly, before heading to her residence in the temple district.
>Upon entering, she found the Pale one lying upon stacked sheets of cotton bedding, stirring slightly.
>He tried to get up, But the High Priestess pulled him back onto the bed, his back against her belly.
>After a moment or two of struggling, he gave up, exhausted from his earlier ordeal, and too comfortable to try.
>Humming gently, the High Priestess smiled at her prize, a gift from Xiomara, and stroked his hair.
>She would see to it the Pale one was educated, teach him the culture of the Lizardkin, their history.
>He would learn to read and write, to do math and learn the patterns of the heavens, and how to care for her home in her absence.
>And she would learn much from him as well, a most importantly, where his tribe was.
>The Lizardkin would build ships to cross the unending sea, and armies of Lizard women would go to the land of the pale ones.
>The lizardkin would subjugate the pale human's tribe, as they had done with the tribe near them, as nature intended.
>And the Lizard women would dominate the males of the Pale tribe, females would always dominate males, as nature intended.
>But for now, she would comfort her glorious little gift, and sing sweet songs till both were sound asleep.

>Remember to get a brave woman who can fight. You don't want to get gangbanged by a bunch of girls just because your girl ran away from the smallest hint of conflict.

>win a ticket to that new female anthros fighting ring
>one got made some time ago and you never bothered to go
>always heard it was pretty lewd with anthro woman fighting naked or in fetish looking

 outfits
>figure it might be fun and you got a free entrance
>go to the place when it opens for the night
>the bouncer/entrance guard is some huge anthro guy and he takes your ticket
>stops you and sniffs at you then asks if you're single or with someone
>you tell him single and he hands you a red arm band and tells you to sit in the red seating area
>that was odd to say the least and you guess it's some anthro thing since this whole thing is an anthros only fighting ring
>walk in and see others with blue arm bands about and getting to their seats
>you keep walking looking for the red seating area and see it's right up front row near the ring
>and it's lower in the ground with some fencing around it separating it from the blue/general seating areas
>sweet, maybe this was a perk for winning that ticket
>look around and notice everyone in the red seating area is a guy, human or anthro
>spotlights flood the ring and a mongoose girl in a rather fetishistic looking outfit walks out with a mic
>starts hyping the crowd up and explaining the rules for newcomers
>announces the first 2 fighters
>one is an all white arctic wolf naked except some blue swirl patterns painted all over her body
>she's also massive and imposing
>she's showing off in the ring with poses to show her muscles and curves before letting out the loudest howl you ever heard and many of the dog/wolf audience joined in with her and some humans even tried to howl too
>guess she's got a lot of fans
>her opponent walks into the ring next
>she's a jaguar in very aztec looking get up, but still mostly naked
>all sorts of colorful feathers hang off strings or bands
>looks like she wants to one up the wolf since she calls a human guy in the red area up to the ring
>he nervously gets in the ring and holy shit does it show how big these woman are
>she pulls a bucket from out of the ring and has the guy dip his hands in it
>when he pulls them out they're red and wet with paint
>she turns and bends slightly forward with her ass pointing at the guy
>telling him to do something
>he hesitates for a bit before he places his hands on her big ass firmly
>the crowd cheers at this and after some time she moves away and she faces him again
>from this angle you can see two bright red human hand prints on her ass
>she then grabs his crotch forcing him on his tip toes before she whispers something in his ear and licks the side of his face
>she makes a line on his forehead with the red paint before letting him go back to his seat
>that "are you single" question you got at the door is starting to make more sense now and you think how you'll be returning to this place again
>wonder if they have any membership thing?
>the announcer comes on telling the 2 to get to their corners
>looks like the first round is starting
>you can feel a rather large change in the atmosphere of the crowd and ring
>everything goes quiet before a bell rings and the 2 charge each other
>and your entire view of this place changes when they start tearing into each other
>fangs and claws flash and sink into each other
>they're not holding back and blood is being drawn
>nothing life threatening, but both are still going at it rather viciously
>you also notice there's no ref at all and some, what you assume are, medics down by a back stage entrance
>the fight goes on for a little longer before both are panting
>the jaguar gets an upper hand and gets the wolf in a choke hold
>the wolf eventually goes limp a bit before the jaguar drops her and the wolf starts taking deep coughing breaths
>the crowd erupts into cheers while the medics wordlessly get into the ring cheeking on the wolf
>she needed a bit of help standing up, but limps out of the ring and back stage on her own
>the jaguar meanwhile hops out of the ring and walks towards the human guy she marked earlier and picks him up and tosses him over her shoulder
>blood still dripping from some cuts
>she walks by and you get a full scale on how much bigger she is
>you also see the guy's face is a mixture of fear
 and excitement
>the red hand prints also still clearly there on her ass and her walk has much more sway to her hips
>she carries him to a different backstage entrance and you don't see either of them after that
>jesus, what have you gotten yourself into this time
>you don't know if you're more terrified or excited for the next match
>the next matches go the same way
>2 big anthro woman come up, some showboating is done, maybe they pick a guy before the match, they have a bloody fight until one can't fight anymore, the winner claims her prize, and there's another empty seat in the red area
>then it gets to the final match and you're slightly exhausted from all the tension and excitement of tonight
>and holy shit did they save up for the finale
>2 fucking titans of woman walk into the ring
>a Kodiak bear and grizzly bear woman are the last match
>the grizzly is wearing some sort of lewd lumberjack get up
>a plaid shirt tied in that bikini fashion to hold her massive tits and jean shorts cut so small they're thongs
>the Kodiak looks more like a prehistoric monster
>naked with bands made of bone on her limbs and wearing a necklace with various skulls on it, including human skulls
>and ashen white streaks over various parts of her monstrous frame
>then she looks over and locks eyes with you
>her gaze makes you freeze and forget to breath
>then your heart skips a beat when she makes a come hither gesture
>on shaky feet you walk to the ring before you're pulled into the air at such speed and height you get momentary vertigo
>you're dangling in the air at head height to her and she looks you over with hungry eyes
>you must be hanging 9-10 feet in the air
>you also get an up close scale on just how colossal she is
>all you get for a warning is a lewd smile and her eyelids lowering before she kisses you with fervor
>given the size difference she covers most of your face

>you're deathly quiet with the realization of what comes next
>she jumps out of the ring and her landing impact shaking you slightly
>she's in front of you and slowly reaching for you

>she's only looking at you as she walks
>and the only word she rumbles out

>human teammate makes a callout over voice
>dead silence for five solid seconds
>"IS THAT A GAMER HUMAN?"

>You had plans for college spring break, plans to go to the beach and find a woman around your age.
>Your boss at Great Outdoors Magazine, had other plans for you in Louisiana, horrible plans
>Namely, pictures of wildlife in the swamp. A job for which you were completely unqualified for.
>All of your work for the magazine normally took place in a climate controlled building doing editing.
>Unfortunately, he'd have none of it, so off you went with cash to cover bare minimum travel expense and lodging.
>Supposedly, you would meet up with a tour guide down there who would take you places.
>Given you had to meet the guy at a certain time, you programmed the GPS in your POSs car.
>An eight hour drive later, you arrived in Louisiana, in some backwater town with a French name.
>It was hot, humid, well and truly away from any beach body women.
>This was only the start of your troubles, as apparently, your tour guide was arrested for possession.
>On top of this, the hotels were booked for a bunch of competitive fishers in town for a contest.
>Those that weren't, were in a pretty sketchy part of town, so you had no choice but to sleep in your car.
>It was miserable, but at least any money you saved would be added to your pay.
>Next morning, you drove down a dirt road to an unused fishing area, nature preserve and all that.
>Humidity Caused your clothing to stick to you, and the bugs swarmed you relentlessly.
>Plenty of swamp to take pictures of, and a moss covered dock stuck out into the water a ways
>Carefully, you marched out, eyeing the wall of green before you, raising the camera you were given.
>It was digital, waterproof, and had a good lens, and all you had to do was get a weeks worth of pictures.
>After a minute of scanning, you managed to spot a dragonfly, gotta start somewhere right.
>A few seconds later, you have a pretty decent set of pictures, perhaps this won't be so bad.
"Hey."
>You jump a little, and spin around, looking for the woman who spoke to you, but nobody's there.
"Down here city boy."
>Looking at the end of the dock, your heart all but leaps into your throat when you spot the gator woman.
>She's resting here elbows on the edge of the dock, staring up at you with unblinking stilted eyes.
>Odds are, she isn't floating so much as standing

 in the water, grinning like the cat catching a canary.
>Heavyset women weren't exactly your thing, but her massive boobs pressed against the end of the pier...
>Your face breaks out in a horrible blush as you avert your gaze, the gator woman chuffing in amusement.
"See somthin' ya like Slick?"
>.WHY IS SHE NAKED!
>A few months back, you'd seen a video on the net involving a Florida Man and a Gator Woman.
>Apparently, Florida Man tried snatching a purse from some mouse woman and sprinting to his getaway car.
>Some gator woman saw this and took great offence, and proceeded to charge the bastard.
>She plowed through a small tree and T-boned the car so hard the side caved in and it slide a few feet.
>This wasn't the end of it, with a grunt she flipped the car onto its side as though it were a toy.
>Then she tore the roof off, hauled the guy out, and gave the lady back her purse.
>It had been funny to watch, but now you were in a very bad spot, having ogled a naked gator woman.
>She didn't seem to mind at all, but you weren't a perv, and definitely didn't want to be considered one.
>To make matters worse, it seemed that her friends had shown up, and they were just as big.
"Oh, who's your friend Gabby?"
"Well now, city boy want a show heh heh."
"Slick alright for a city boy girls," Gabby said, "Though what brings ya to the bayou?"
>If you turn around and start hauling ass, you could get to your car and get out of here.
>>27398921
"Um, my boss sent me to get some pictures of the local wildlife."
>You take a step back. At this, the three chuckle, and shift as though to climb onto the dock.
"Leavin' so soon Slick? Perhaps you'd like to get a few pictures of some 'Wild' women first?"
"I appreciate the offer, but I should probably give you your privacy and all."
>You turn and make it about three steps before slamming to a wall of flesh, sinking into it slightly from momentum.
>Before you can fall down however, a powerful arm pulls you back in, your face buried in soft, sun-warmed scales.
"Now now ladies," the newcomer rumbles, "Did Ma' teach y'all o be nice to gentlemen? Slick here seems decent for city folk."
>with a sinking sensation, you realize that your face is currently imprisoned between a massive set of boobs.
>Most men would kill to be in such a position...odds were you were about to die in it, Not the worst way to go.
>The deep chuckling of voices indicate the rest of them are out of the water now.
>You are pulled out of your plush prison and held at arms length by strong and large gator hands.
>The Gator woman before you stand s 7'6", looks about 420 pounds, and has a scar over one eye.
>There are four more of them, including the ones you've already seen, the newest face wearing a baseball cap.
"So tell me Slick," Scarface rumbles with a giant grin, "What brings ya to this humble slice o' Louisiana?"
>So you tell them why you're out here sweating like mad, and hoping they don;t kill you.
>A few minutes of explaining later, they all seem to be giving you sympathetic looks and nodding in understanding.
"Well, Slick," Scarface says, "Me and the girls have been having a bit of a dry spell here, and we could yous a polite young man like yourself to help us out."
"In return, we help you get some pictures and give ya place to stay, sound like a deal?"
>Normally, you'd have booked it, but five women eager to jump(break) your bones and keeping your job was too good to pass up.
"Good," Scarface says, before snatching your camera, "Yer the more digitally inclined of us 'lizbeth. Snap a few pics will ya?"
>Wait, now? but before you can protest further, Scarface grips your head in a massive hand and draws you in for a kiss.
>Gator snouts weren't designed for kissing, but Scarface isn't deterred, her tongue pouring into your mouth, nearly gagging you.
>Your knees all but buckle as you sag in her grip, her second hand groping your ass and feeling you up.
>Her tongue overwhelms yours, and any attempt to kiss back is met with uncompromising force.
>Finally, she lets you come
 up for air, a thick strand of drool connecting your mouths.
"Name's Jessie," She says, "You'll be screaming it shortly."
>You try to give her yours, but your smothered by a massive breast the size of a basketball.
>Jessie is going to work getting your pants off, and the other girls are rubbing themselves idly as they watch.
>A few seconds later, Jessie has you mostly naked, your pants bunched up around your boots as she brings you in for another kiss.
>Her scaly body feels wonderful against your own, even beneath buttery fat you can feel her muscles shifting like steel cables.
>Your pinned to the ground, Jessie resting her thick thighs on either side of your body, eyeing your junk.
"No half bad for a city boy Slick," She grins.
>She grinds against you, her sheer mass pinning you to the ground, her lower lips slathering more moisture onto you.
>Your body drags against the muddy ground, it and her body pleasantly cool in comparison to the swampy heat you'd been dealing with.
>Finally, she lifts up, lines you up carefully, and hilts you in one go, her insides gripping you like a velvety fist.
>She begins moving a a steady pace, her hips driving you into the ground, hands planted either side of your head.
>Those massive breast sway in hypnotic motions, leaving you open mouthed as you gaze up at them.
"Go on Slick, play with 'em."
>You do, your fingers sinking into them up to the knuckle, occasionally playign with her nipples. She'd gasp occasionally when you did this.
>Her pace picked up, slamming down onto you, you'd definitely be sore after all of this.
>After a minute of this, you were at your limit, panting from heat and exertion.
"I'm gonna..."
"Almost there Slick, hang on."
>A few second later, you climax, you vision blurring from the intensity of it. Jessie follow suite moments later, smashing down on you.
>She lay atop you, her passage milking you dry all while letting otu a bone-shaking rumble, rattling your brains even further.
>Panting, her full weight presses on you for a moment, driving the air from your lungs, before she rolled over with you in tow.
>After the both of you recovered, Jessie helped you get dressed before telling Brenda(ball-cap) to get you to the house.
>Brenda had to lay the front seat back most the way so she could lean over it from the back seat. She was nice, and apparently a mechanic.
>Half an hour of navigating twisting back roads later, you arrived at their house, a waterside affair with a monstrous truck parked out front.
>Jessie, Gabby, Elizabeth, and Mary were waiting for the two of you, apparently swimming through the swamp was far faster than taking the road.
>Gabby helped you settle in, before pulling you aside entirely for a bit of fun of her own. By the time you could stand it was lunch.
>Mary was one hell of a cook, her food was far better than anything you;d had on they way out here, or nuked in the microwave.
>A short siesta later, and Gabby took you into the swamp to take some pictures. You rode on her back, the tough scales a stark contrast to those on her belly.
>She could get into places no boat could hope to, and she was a lot quieter, pointing out various creatures for you to shoot.
>By the time you got back, Mary had some of her mother's secret Gumbo recipe ready, and insisted on putting meat on your bones.
>After helping her with the dishes, Mary decided to reward you a little, and carried your spent body to bed with her like a teddy.
>The next four days would go in a similar manner, and you found yourself enjoying it immensely.
>Sure, there were a few mishaps along the way, like Elizabeth knocking you over with a playful tail-slap to the back of your legs and leaving a light bruise.
>Then there was the time Mary about smothered you with one of her enormous tits, in her sleep, and her response to your struggles was to pull you closer.
>You joined them for a game of football in a field, your smaller size and agility allowing you to slip past the other players a few times.
>Jessie then tackled you and death-rolled across half the field however, scrambling your brains and nearly dislocating your shoulder in the process.
>Brenda insisted on going over your car to make sure everything was working properly. You got to help fix the car and service her.
>Gabby left a few claw marks on you back after a particularly intense bout of lovemaking, but thankfully nothing requiring stitches.
>Wrestling was a constant pastime, and the girls found your resistance e to be adorable.
>Been cuddled was mandatory, as was being the smaller spoon, but that wasn't so bad.
>You even went to see a mud-wrestling match between Jessie and some Burmese snake lady. It had been a close thing, but Jessie won.
>The food was amazing, you got plenty of great pictures(some for keeping in the memory book), and the sex was awesome.
>Still, you went to bed aching, sore, and looking forward to doing it all again in the morning.
>All good things come to an end however, and on day five you began packing up and saying goodbye to the wonderful women you had met.
>Elizabeth had helped you sort the pictures(work related from NSFW) the night before, and promised to keep in touch via email.
>You let her upload a few copies of pictures of the six of you, and then the girls gave you a group hug that threatened to snap your spine.
"Ya' come back soon now ya hear."
>You promised to visit when you got time off or headed out this way, and began the long drive home.
>Upon arriving back at your apartment, you staggered inside, walked to your bed, and face-planted on it, relieved to be back.
>It was a little disappointing when you weren't grabbed by scaly hands and pulled up against a larger woman.
>Still, you had work in the morning, and, come to think of it, you never did get to take that vacation of yours.
>You'd put in for a week in the fall, and head back over

 to the girls then, once you made sure you could pull it off.
>And you still had most of the travel expense money, the Boss wouldn't notice most of it missing, he wasn't the brightest bulb in the building.
>Everything turned out wonderfully, much better than you;d imagined. You couldn't wait to go back though, but you'd survive until then...somehow.

>your part of a military project
>nothing special or important, more or less doing small labors
>you aren't that big or well built so that probably had most to do with it
>apparently the lab boys were doing something for the bigwigs
>some time passes and you guess it was a success given all the commotion going on
>though over the week keep seeing more people being carried out of a room injured
>next thing you know you're being grabbed by some scientists and higher rank military types and being briefed
>turns out they made super soldiers using animal DNA
>spotted hyena specifically
>females ones given in nature female spotted hyenas are bigger, stronger, and more aggressive than the males
>they keep piling papers and orders on you and trying to tell you how they need a handler and how they seemed to keep rejection the ones they keep sending in
>now they're just trying different types to see what might work and also an injuries are covered by your insurance
>barely any time to think before you get thrown into some observation cell
>you finally see the "super soldiers"
>3 massive amazon bestial hyena woman
>they also look pissed given how all week they had to deal with people coming in trying order them around
>you're not trained for this and just back against the wall and close your eyes hoping they won't hurt you too bad
>but nothing ever happens
>you open your eyes to see you're boxed by them and they're calmer and just sniffing different parts of you
>guess with you being quiet and small got them less aggressive and more curious
>it finally hits you that they're naked when their larger dark nipples are right in your face
>also can't help check them out and how ridiculously endowed they all were
>can't hold the fear boner back
>they seems to egg them on since they start that hyena whooping noise and getting grabby
>and then starts the the nipping, licking, and groping
>meanwhile the scientists watched on confused
>"does this count as a success?"

>"All human men listening, I want to talk to you about something. As you know anthros enjoy the idea of engaging in sex with you, so I'm sure you avoid being alone with species that you might think of as 'dangerous', like crocodiles, sharks, lions, or other carnivores. I want to tell you that you're avoiding the wrong species."
>"Now, I'm not saying you should let a hyena drive you home from the bar because she seemed nice. What I'm saying is you are ignoring some of the most dangerous animals. What animal is that? Rabbits."
>"I'm absolutely serious. Rabbits might seem sweet and fluffy, but they are fast enough to chase you down, have kicks, and can hear just where you're hiding. But that isn't what makes them dangerous; what makes them dangerous is that they see you as a necessity."
>"Humans are the best sexual partners with their endurance and size, and rabbits have insane sex drives. Nymphomaniacs who regularly have to deal with subpar partners. Those who can't have sex with a human have to deal with the torturous itch that cannot be handled by anyone else unless they can get a lot of males to agree to a one female orgy."
>"Other anthros see human men as an amazing luxury. Rabbits see them as medicine that can cure their disease. The former would love to have it. The latter feels that she cannot live without it. Rabbits won't just give up on you when they think they've lost you. They will regularly go to your house, learn your daily routine, and find an opening. Some individuals of other species may do this, but this trait is held by almost every rabbit."
>"So buy cameras. Lock your doors. And if a rabbit sees you, don't assume you're in the clear just because she went
 back to whatever she was doing. It's safer to assume you've already been targeted by her. The cute ones are the most dangerous, because they are the ones who are most desperate."
>"This has been an paid for by the Man Protection Foundation, keep our human men pure."

>hello of yes please to let hyena drive you home from bar
>she is very nice and probably just beings good new friend of you
>hyenas are good and nice anthros, please to do what they say haha

>humans are too naive and trusting around anthros
>this leads to them being taken advantage of by some many trying to protect only to end up taking advantage of them anyways
>using their human's lack of knowledge of their biology or culture to do lewd things to the poor little humans
>using to lick them, bite them, sniff them, rub their scent all over them, etc
>getting them to rub their smooth clawless little hands over their fur/feathers/scales/etc

>"Anon, don't you know dogs greet each other by smelling butts? I've got a bad sense of smell though, so I need to really get in there."
>"Licking is normal with us dogs, just take off that shirt."
>"H-humping is just a game, Anon! Just let me have my fun!"

>"I Gotta keep that bitch from taking advantage of the cute human and drive him home myself!"
>"Can't remember his home? Looks like my house."
>"Yeah, take your shirt off, kind of hot in here, right?"
>"Well, I am fluffy enough for a pillow."
>"H-his pants might also be making him really warm."
>"He wouldn't mind a sniff, right?"
>"He's out cold, he doesn't have to know that you touched yourself to smelling him."
>"You helped him a lot, he kinda o-owes you for helping him. He'd agree to one night, right?"

>taking advantage of humans in the dark since they can't see
>having humans being completely helpless once you get them in deep water
>hiding some blankets/clothes/sleeping bags/etc in colder areas so they're forced to cuddle with furred anthros for warmth

>"Hey baby, where ya goin'?"
>"C'mon, don't be like. Give us a smile!"
>"Don't worry we just wanna talk?"
>"How's it goin', sugardick?"
>"Hmmm...I hate to see you go, but I love to watch you walk away!"
This is just the tip of the ice burg of what human men have to hear just walking outside. Disgusting.

>Being raped by an anthro is a wonderful and totally normal experience for a human male. Even more when she leaves her special "gift" in the entrance of your house after 9 months.

>All the anthros would probably be interested in you after that.
>"Some mean bitch left you like that? I wouldn't leave you."
>"Maybe your kid would like a mother too?
>"Must be hard, taking care of someone alone."
>Can you handle being a dilf?

>Anthro society teaches humans that their bodies exist for anthro pleasure
>Anthros are taught that humans crave their touch, but are simply too shy to ask
>Humans are required by law to not have locks on their doors

>"And here we have the native jungle cat's marriage ritual."
>"Every year, they go out to capture humans in neighboring villages. After the capture, each cat must choose a human, with the highest ranking females choosing first."

>turn off the heater while it's cold outside
>hide all his coats and blankets
>keep showing off how warm and fluffy your fur is
>just gotta wait for the cold to break him down and he just throws himself at you get some warmth
>anything you do after doesn't count as rape since he choose to cling to you
>"It is customary for the chief or a great warrior to choose the fastest, most clever of men, as any less would be considered an embarrassment to their position. Those who have an easy chase may be shamed by their fellow tribeswomen if others feel she picked a man for an easy catch. Any man who manages to escape his pursuer are considered prime catches, and any single hunter who bests them will earn great respect."
>"As you can see, one of the guards to the chief is drooling in anticipation as she is steadily gaining on her picked target, a man who apparently managed to run quite the distance until he accidentally stumbled into a trap, ironically placed by one of his fellow villagers hoping for game. If the guard manages to catch him, she can expect a husband who will last for hours in the bedroom, and children who will surely be able to succeed in their own mating ceremony with a fast man."

>What if you were a captured human spy in anthro territory and got interrogated by a wasp girl?

>She ties you up and stings you with her stinger that has some sort of afrodesiac in her venom that acts like viagra. She interrogates you with sexual bondage edging you to the point of climaxing but never letting you cum pouring different types of sweets on your dick and using her elongated tongue wrapping it around your penis lapping up whatever she poured on tormenting you until you give up the rebel locations.

>"So you refuse to tell me where the others are?"
>You scowl up at the wasp
>"I told you, I don't know. And if I did, I'd never tell you."
>The wasp bends down to take a good look at your face
>Apparently finding nothing, she buzzes in frustration
>"Why do you fight us?"
>"Why are you kidnapping humans?"
>"Why?"
>She seems to take a moment to consider something
>Then she puts a hand onto your head
>"I find human hair to feel quite nice. It comes in some pretty nice colors, and even different textures."
>Her hand moves down to your cheek
>"But you still have skin not covered by fur. Soft. Somewhat smooth."
>She softly pokes at your cheek
>"Your face is so malleable. I just want to see how I can change it. Such a cute smushable face. And..."
>A few of her fingers move into your mouth for a split second, dragging across your tongue and pulling out before you can react
>She considers her fingers, rubbing your stolen saliva around
>She then sends her tongue along her finger, licking the spit up
>"You taste nice. It's... sweet? There's a rumor going around that your kind's spit is addicting, especially for insects."
>"W-what? What are you saying?"
>"You asked why I'm kidnapping humans, and these are the reasons why."
>"What about the others though!"
>"Oh, there are so many different reasons. The dogs have a weird cult around you, something about being morally obligated to return some favor by becoming your partners. The cats think you have the perfect penises, and are somewhat desperate for them. The reptiles think you make great bed-warmers."
>"That's why? You came after us for that? You made us fight for that?"
>"You made yourselves fight. There wouldn't be any fighting if you just came quietly. So, are you going to tell us where the others are?"
>You say nothing
>"Come on, my friend Milla has been complaining about not getting anyone. She's been boring me to death with stories from her religion. I don't care how the humans and dogs grew up together! Could you just give her a cuddle buddy? You'd probably think of her as a big fluffy pillow."
>"..."
>"Ugh, you're really serious about this? Fuck."
>She shakes her head, and begins walking to the door
>"So you've given up? What happens now"
>She stops, and turns to look at you
>"Oh, it's already been decided. You're going to be mine."
>"And... what will you do with me?"
>She takes her hand off the door knob, and starts walking back
>She bends down, her face really close to yours
>"I've got a sweet tooth, so I'll be taking your... fluids quite regularly. I'm a bit of a connoisseur, and as I've told you, I've heard good things. Maybe you noticed the foods you were given?"
>You feel your cheeks flush as you think back to it
>You had wondered why your had so many fruits and sweet things
>"Hmm, that's right. I've been wondering for a while what human honey is like. I'm sure it will be quite the experience for the both of us."
>She gives you a quick peck on the cheek, making you flinch
>"Hehe, I won't hurt you. But you can expect a lot more where that came from."
>She moved back to the door, opened it, and gave you a smile
>"Oh, and just so you know, if I don't get details on the other humans, I won't get my bonus. If you don't tell me, I'll have to wring that honey out of you. Of course, if you ask, I'd be more than happy to do it anyway. See you soon, sweetie."
>And you are left alone to think about your fate

Which do you prefer?
>The anthros are naturally dominant, looking for some meek humie to submit to them
>The anthros have a social response to the personality of the person they're around. Acting shy or nervous will make them subconsciously more dominant
>The domination comes from a loving relationship after the humie confides his feelings and asks the anthro to take the lead

>A world where humans are a rare species
>Humans are naturally weaker than most other species and probably can't survive on their own
>thus need the protection of stronger anthros

>Get nervous around the tall anthro girl who's taken a liking to you
>She thinks your shyness is cute and teases you about it
>It serves to make you more nervous and sets her on the slippery slope to being more controlling and dominant

>"Hey, human. You're looking pretty out of it from those drinks."
>"It's dangerous for a small thing like you to walk around at this time of night. Being drunk will just make you a great target."
>"Come on, I know a good place you can stay. Don't worry about money, I have plenty."
>"No, really, your presence is payment enough. And I've got a feeling I'm going to be seeing a lot of you after this. I'm feeling like tonight will be a good night."

>A few days later, it happened
>A massive ring had spread across the circumference of our earth
>A gateway
>It was something theorized by the man who had first made the machine, but he thought such a large gateway would cause more problems than it would be worth
>The anthros had returned, this time from a world that is almost as advanced as ours
>Living proof of humans had pushed them to return
>They all want a piece of us
>Some because of their religious belief
>Some who find the idea of a world with many males tempting
>Some to put us in our place and to spite those who might think themselves as our protectors
>In the end they all want the men of humanity gasping and whimpering in ecstasy underneath them

Humans are the last species that can produce males, female anthros are forced to depend on their sperm to conceive newborns. Thus, male humans are regarded as a resource anthros would have to fight for to mantain their population. However, there's another huge problem:
>Predator anthros can only give birth to female offsprings of their species
>Prey anthros can procreate females from their species and also male humans
Predator anthros will have to basically depredate male humans to subsist or face extinction, while Prey anthros are a match made in heaven for humankin which whom to prefer to coexist.
Due to the danger of being kidnapped by other anthros, males had to abandon leading roles and embrace more submissive ones such as taking care of the youngs, cooking and acting like healers for their wives. That mindset gradually sank into humans as anthros started to treat them like slaves, predator anthros being the worst offenders and openly deeming them like mindless cattle to rape & dominate. Any human who was overly attached to predator anthro eventually got their genes erased from the genepool, causing the remaining males to be afraid of predator anthros but still getting aroused by being turned into a breeding slave.

There's a sense of urgency among prey anthros with their few males, if they don't breed enough children then their tribes may began to reduce in numbers. As a consequence, young males are forced to choose a wife as soon as they experience their spermache, these toyboys are paired with anthros of their same age or MILF to be mounted and milked dry in front of the tribe for their first time.

Predator anthros, attracted by the odor of virgins copulating, will soon began to raid prey settlement and abduct any fertile male they see regardless of their age. They don't bother to love them back, these poor souls are ravished for hours till they are broken. Those who are too juvenile to ejaculate are send to their shamans to be turned into future sub studs.

“Wait, are all anthro females taller than humans?” One Anon said.

In a few words, yes. Males are just too valuable to be send like expendable warriors, having one on the field should be by itself a showoff of power from a clan. It's like putting your King on the center of the table, the foes would just prioritize their capture.

As you should've guess, Predator anthros are physically (Lioness & Gators) and intellectually (Owls and Dolphin) superior than men. They were bornt to conquer and snatch males out of Prey anthro's
arms who have to defend their husbands to death or resign and watch the gang of Predator anthros molest their dear husband before they drag them into their camp. Not the prettiest sigh, some Prey anthros even offer themselve as slaves just to be with their husbands even thought that condems them into a life of misery... Predator anthros won't stop at anything to quench their need to "devour" males.

However, the calm comes after the storm. With the predator anthros are pregnant and occupied nurturing their children into ideal rapist and warriors, Prey anthros can once resurge and reestablish their routines, the surviving males would've to take care of more Prey wombs and pump more descedants into them. They can't afford time to deal with hesitating males, they either cum or are drugged to cum; the point is that they compensate the lost members quickly before another wave of Predator anthros comes back to harass the males.

Hope we can snowball this idea!

>Your busty Zebra milf mistress had popped your cherry and you didn't last long before came hard on her while her moans encouraged you to keep thrusting her plumpy exotic rear and go for another cumshot.
>You had no option, but to obey your body. The Shaman had drugged you with aphrodisiacs previously after you were brought to her tent, anthro mother telling her you had stained your bed sheets with your first load of sperm
>You were too horny, a feeling you had never experience before and was driving your mind crazy with the only desire to mate with the winking pussy of your new goddess.
>Slamming your hips once again, you let your tamed male impulses take over and burst another hot load of your seed inside her moisty tight insides. Her inner walls never stopped massaging every inch of your cock, forcing you to spill a couple of shy ropes of semen into her as a reward.
>You fell asleep, smothered by her breasts and with your member still sheathed deepballs in your mistress' equine cunt.
>...
>Months passed, your wife was pregnant and proudly sported her belly carrying your future daughter or, with luck, son around the village.
>The harvest of berries this year seemed promising, the male farmers were coming back to the tribe with bask filled with food for months... and you were about to be paired with another female in the next week
>You shivered at the idea of another MILF zebra mounting you, these females were going to break your dick if they continued to breed you like that.
>However, your thoughts are interrupted and the bell's ring echoed across the huts and tents of the village
>Predator anthros on the horizont, you were guided inside the main hut and put you along side others under the care of the most buffed Zebras on the village
>You prayed to the gods they didn't choose you...

>Your Zebra warrior wife got overwhelmed by the Kobold whippersnappers, you desperately beg them to spare your wife and claim you'll do *anything* to save the anthro who sought to protect you.
>The Kobold Leader smirked at youand mumbled to her comrades, one of the puny lizards chirped and took out from her pouch a rope before coming toward your direction.
>Huts were scorching, the crops were being tramped and spoiled as more Kobolds marched with their relentless forces through the village, but for you it was nothing.
>All that mattered to you was lying beneath their scaly feet, the Kobold hurled herself at you and easily tied you up... a classy burlington bowline on your wristles and ankles, you put pressure into the binds and confirmed how firm and well-done the knots were.
>She had to be their trappist specialist, the one who was assigned to reduced males into ragdoll bags for the bulky raiders to carry
>Though, this time their intentions were different. You could see it on them, they were craving for you and, despite the odor of Zebras on your genitals, you were still a fertile male for them.
>Dragging you into one of the abandoned huts whilst one looked around for any snooper that'd ruin their fun, the Kobolds threw you against a pile of hay and closed the door with the lookout covering their affaird
>The Leader was the first one to join and crawl over your body, her snout burying into your chest and taking a deep breath of your masculinity.
>"Wimps moan better." Her sultry voice toyed with your ears, you were about to get violated... You shivered, it was part of the deal, to be their rape toy for tonight.
>Her legs were accomodating between your thighs, her body hogging your warm away and her eyes dominating your attention...
>You tried to resist, but then the reminder caught you cold: the reason why were you doing this.
>"Come on, give in." She said "Don't make me regret this."

Personally, I like a 'New World' scenario, wherein humans are settlers in a new land. It would go down much like our history, only the tribal anthros were simply too strong for the colonial humans and end up enslaving them and acquiring their technology, before invading the Old World. Humans are desired because of anthro mating rituals- it's usually a power struggle between the male and females. Humans are weaker and even capable of acting submissive, and as such they're often taken as pleasure slaves/concubines.
To foster a sense of justice in the scenario, you can say that humans were the aggressors. They tried to roll out the genocide before getting 2koma'd, and from then on humans had the reputation of being either evil creatures that needed to be taught a lesson, or poor lost beings that need outside help to survive themselves.
Also, I'm not particularly a fan of including human females without anthro males; the NTR aspect of it bothers me.
Then will just say the female anthros’ male and human female went extinct and human males are lost and scared in the unknown world and female anthros discovers that human males have the ability to give birth to any species. Human males tries to resent this but the female anthros

 give then no choice. And thus, the war for human males for their tribes have begun.

The match has started
>The female anthros started going after each tribe’s species
>The hyenas already kill one of the kobold’s tribe by piercing a sword through her throat causing her to cough
>One of the rat tribes manages to get on a chariot, that is carried by big strong mares with massive stamina, and used a rope to lasso a Zebra warrior causing her to crack her neck due to hard yank of the rope which is nothing but a lifeless body and using it to make the other tribes trip over and lose their guard
>It may be gruesome and horrifying for those who are witnessing, but to these gladiator fans, it’s a showcase of entertainment
>Oddly enough, the human boys are entertained, but they are busy talking to each other and discuss which warrior tribe makes the best ‘love making’ and get aroused by a angry lioness girl roaring as she recently chopped a tribe’s head with a axe

>The arena remains ongoing as it was
>Human boys are talking, eating fruits, and even sometimes making each other out just to keep the audience entertained in case the same violence got them bored which leads some distractions for some fighters as one Cheetah was distracted by two human boys kissing each other, she was struck down by a heavy malice on her head, putting her out of commission
>The fight continues on and many fighters were ‘out’
>The two rat ladies remained on the chariot as they tried to lasso one of the fighters only to get stopped by a big buff female gator that manages to grab the two rats by their heads with her palms that are twice the size if their heads
>”Hahahaha!!! Don’t think you plague creatures got shit chances on these lovely human boys!” She laughed, “They need a female animal that can crush skulls... like this!!”
>The green gator did as she told as red liquid starts oozing out of her palms
>On the other side of the arena, a giraffe lady is getting her long neck bent backwards by a hyena girl with long spikey hair
>Meanwhile, one human boy yawned at the sight of it, “Yawn... all these ladies all barely got my attention. Some of these kills I seen before and many other times.”
>”That Zebra girl got my interests,” says another human boy, “but she’s already gone, so...”
>”ATTENTION! WE ARE DOWN TO THE LAST TWO FIGHTERS” the announcer shouted.
>Everyone cheered and see the last two remaining fighters
>The big buff, yet decently busty, green gator lady and a small yet, really tough Hyena girl with a long spikey hair

>Why do you always feel like you're being watched? Maybe you shouldn't live alone near that big swamp.
>Sometimes you hear noises at night. Distant twigs snapping, rustling brush and dripping water.
>Sometimes, you hear something scratching on the walls. For a time you were terrified, thinking you might have schizophrenia. Only, you don't hear these noises anywhere else.
>When you turn the lights on and look out the windows, you never see anything and the noises stop. Your frightened curiosity got the better of you today.
>You heard that telltale shudder of leaves, and almost convinced yourself it was the wind until something shifted- it was as though the subtlest shift in air pressure occurred. Normally, you'd frightfully flick on the lights and check your entrances. This time, however, you did not.
>Tenderly and gingerly you slid out of bed. The only sounds were your heart and breath. You listened and watched, worried and waited. Nothing.
>You ventured to the living room in its dark glory. Your footfalls were soft and silent. No movement at all, save your own.
>You approached the backdoor, trying to make sense of shapes in the dim moonlight. However... something was wrong. The sound of your breath carried strangely.
>You held your breath for a moment, and felt a shiver go up your spine when you realized that you could still hear breathing.
>At that moment, the shape became apparent to you. A crocodile girl, looming just outside the door. She had been watching you the entire time.
>You stood stock still in absolute terror, thanking the heavens that you always locked it.
>Only... your eyes traced the shape of the door as the softest of breezes crested your legs.
>The door was already open

>Shyness is its own endearing trait.
>Humans are just feeble, weak things that need help to feel okay. They know that you're a sweet and precious thing the moment you fail to meet their gaze. How can you willingly hurt someone if you're too afraid to talk to strangers?
>Besides, something about shyness triggers a part of the anthro brain. It's a genetic trigger from their creation: a hard-coded motive to protect. Why is this poor human so afraid? Did someone hurt them? They'll be polite, and give you space if you ask. However, expect to be teased often. A flashed smile here, a hand on your shoulder there. You're so gods-damned huggable, aren't you? They're always thinking about what you'll look like when your face lights up with joy.
>Watching a shy human unravel and open up is one of the most pleasing things an anthro can experience. To secure your trust and listen to you spill your heart, or to secure your body and gently make you spill your seed. Either way, they crave the feeling of holding your shaking form and making you realize how much you need them. They want to feel needed. They want you to desire them.
>And, when they're through with you, you will.

>Be Anon living in a town with his anthro GF
>Living your daily life in peace, going to work etc
>Until something weird happens
>Seems like whole world just stopped
>Birds stopped mid air and everything went silent
>You loose your shit and run everywhere to check what happened
>Until everything goes black
>You wake up in some kind of pod with electronics and fluids hooked on to you (Like Matrix but without gel)
>And then you meet your abductors
>8ft tall Snake girls/nagas (personally would go for viper gals)
>After a shock and loosing your consciousness you wake up on another planet
>Nagas everywhere.webm
>You stand with other abducted humans during inspection
>Ask them how the fuck we came here
>They said that they had huge debt and to repay it, they'll have to work as a "slave" on captors planet
>This wouldn't be strange if one of them had that happened, but they ALL have the exact same story.

>"Anon, I am your new wife as appointed by our governments for the sake of improving relations between our species."
>"Stop complaining. We've given your people a certain degree of independence for this. We could have enslaved you, but we're nice like that."
>"No, we didn't agree to the cease fire because we were worried about the death toll, at least not ours. Let me explain why we attacked your planet.
>Have you ever seen a cute animal? Something small and weak, and you just know that without any help it would die in the wild? We were worried that other worse races would take you and enslave you, so we did what we had to. We took you first. The only reason why we threatened violence is because you wouldn't allow it otherwise. It was for your own good."
>"You wouldn't have liked it if the others got their hands on you, and trust me, they were watching. Many would have not given you any rights and made you a priceless commodity. They would have stolen your men away and made special brothels to please many of their women. Some might choke you, bite you, hit you marring that cute face. Under our rule you'll only have to deal with one of us, and we've made laws to ensure you won't get hurt. And all you have to do to repay us is helping us deal with this hunger."
>"I didn't say you had a choice in the matter. I've been looking forward to this for quite awhile, and I'm afraid I can't help myself. But don't worry, I won't hurt you even if you struggle, it just reminds me of how fragile you are. I'm the best option you have."

>during your travels you get stuck/held up in an anthro village
>there's some sort of festival going on
>turns out it's a fertility one
>anthros running around in barely any coverings and some just forgo clothes completely and are just naked aside from jewelry/trinkets and/or some painted on patterns
>all the food and drink being served is food that's supposed to help stamina, hydration, fertility, libido, aphrodisiacs, etc
>you're probably the only person in the whole village wearing a full set of clothing
>getting a lot of stares and attention wherever you walk
>feels like you're going to have a panic attack with so many eyes on you and they aren't even being the slightest bit hostile
>even worse for your poor nerves is public sex seems the norm for this festival too
>some at least keep the sex inside, but are still in full view of windows or open doorways
>you manage to find an inn after working up the courage to ask a random wolf guy for directions
>not used to anthro greetings which is pretty much getting sniffed a lot and then a lick to the face
>got even more awkward when some fox female came and started groping him mid conversation while trying to coil your legs/waist with her tail
>able to slip away while stammering thanks before it got too heated and you were as red as the vixen's fur
>fuck, she even pouted when you walked very fast(ran away) to the inn that she wasn't going to get a human and wolf at the same time
>oh man, you are not prepared for a whole anthro village to have a party where they all are in heat or whatever
>you're just an average university student of a low noble family with a bit of bad luck
>finally make it inside the inn, but think it somewhat odd
>it's only one story high, but has a very very large room with a sunken in middle full of pillows and blankets with some low tables around the outer sides of the pit
>and the open lewdness and debauchery is going on here too
>the biggest bear anthro you've ever seen greets you
>she's a massive snow white

 bear completely naked with red painted on patterns that draw attention to and highlight her intimate parts
>wait, why is she walking towards you?
>oh gods!
>she grabs you in a literal bear hug
>your world is now warm white softness
>you completely disappear in her huge cleavage, thick fur, soft belly, and behind her massive arms for the duration of the hug
>when she finishes and sets you down the air feels slightly less warm now
>get out that you'd like to room in the inn and get a meal
>she gives you an odd look when you mention rooms and tells you everyone just sleeps in the large communal bedded pit that takes up most of the large room in the inn
>well, so much for hiding out in a room from awkward shyness and embarrassment
>the bear guides you to a free low table saying she'll bring some food real quick and chastises that you need to eat more with how small you are
>small insecurities about your stature well up some which is made worse by how all the anthros seem bigger than humans
>get snapped out of it when she brings a large portion of cooked meat slathered in honey to your table
>she quickly lectures you on needing to put on some weight while walking away to handle other orders
>at least it looks and smell delicious, but she gave you no utensils to cut and eat with
>look around and notice the other patrons eating there are just tearing off chunks of food with their claws
>oh right, anthros don't really need knives and forks with their claws and all, dammit
>tearing apart the large cut of meat proves harder than you thought and the honey glazing makes it so you can't get a good grip and just gets your hands covered in honey
>end up frustrated while licking your hands before a large she-wolf wordlessly sat next to you and started tearing the meat into small chunks with her claws
>she just smiles and cleans her hands when done while pushing the plate back to you
>thank her and pick up a piece of meat and nearly drop it when you feel her legs and paws rubbing against your legs
>barely finish the piece you had in your mouth when a large furry body sits flush behind you and you feel big breasts press into your back and large clawed hands on your shoulder
>slowly look back to see a big cougar female now looming over and against you
>she just tells you to eat and you have no choice, but to follow her order
>slowly eat while the cougar begins to knead with her hands and a deep purr starts up
>can feel the pinpricks of her claws through your clothes and then she starts licking your hair
>seems she thought you needed grooming
>at least grooming others seems a common thing among anthros when you look around to see other anthros in grooming sessions
>it really isn't that all unpleasant feeling, but all this female attention is new and has your nerves on edge

Do you think anthros probably look down on human women? That maybe anthros always like to make fun or belittle human women for stuff like not being strong enough to protect and take care of their male counterparts?

I do find the idea of losing to be enticing. Imagine it taking effect in your blood, doing everything you can to keep fighting. The recurring thought of "I need to fight, I need to resist," melting away under the touching that you continue to let happen. None of it is forceful. No, if you could resist, you'd have been grabbed by a Lictor instead. You know it's wrong, you know it's bad, but you just... can't. Why fight? They never had any intention of hurting you. Don't you just want to feel loved?
The hive mind watches your internal battle with great joy. Not even your thoughts are safe; the Shadow in the Warp hears everything. It makes your eventual submission all the more savory. It cherishes putting thoughts into your head, and whispering its desires to you. "You don't like fighting. You want to be touched. You need us."
The thing about Tyranids that was never told to you is just how efficient they are. Physically, mentally, emotionally... They see your weaknesses, and will exploit them. It was over the moment they saw you.

>You get ordered on patrol in the jungle sector of some backwater world.
>High Command insist something is going on, but nothing was obvious.
>You're on patrol, alone because spreading men out covers more ground.
>You're gonna die a horrible death, you can feel it in your bones.
>You have the constant sensation of being watched by...something.
>Rapidly spinning around reveals nothing, just your rampant paranoia.
>For the past hour or two, you've really begun to notice the quiet.
>All the wildlife is silent for some reason, birds and insects have all gone quiet.
>Thirty minutes ago, you began hearing a very odd noise, a slicking sound.
>Its always behind you, and always stops when you turn around.
>There's also an odd odor, fairly pleasant for some reason.
>Wih a blur of motion, you level you lasgun at some bushes right behind you.
>Nothing, except for your won breathing.
>With a grunt, you lower your weapon and march off, muttering to yourself.
"What the frak is that noise."
>not even four meters from the guardsman, the lictor resumed he motions.
>At 2.4 meters tall and weighing several hundred pounds, she looms over her mark.
>Camoline chitin renders her invisible, her bio-engineered perfection rendering her gait silent.
>There is however, a growing excitement, at the idea of being caught, of being spotted.
>Flesh hooks twitch, desiring to snag the male and drag him into her embrace.
>He wouldn't have enough time to scream before her limbs gripped him tightly.
>She'd suck the information from his brain, melting all thoughts of resistance.
>Her sensory organs picked up the male's pungent odor, causing both sets of lips to drool
>No, no yet...but soon.
>Day 5 of scouting deployment.
>Guardsmen are starting to go missing without explanation or warning.
>Nobody is going out on solo patrols, despite high command's instance that nothing out here can really hurt us.
>That much is true of the native creatures, but whatever is stalking us is not native.
>Jenkins got snatched yesterday, all they found was his lasgun lying on the ground and some blood.
>I mean, enough to be noticed on close inspection, but it wasn't a serious injury.
>Garret went mad this morning, he was a little on edge since the start, but not like this.
>The only warning was a high pitched wheeze...and then he just started shooting full auto into the brush.
>He kept saying something about a "giant white bug, and Not taking him.
>Whatever he saw, it never took him, Lt. Emila shot him in the head rather than talk him down, the bitch.
>None of us liked it, the highborn was always a pain in the ass, but this was just murder.
>I feel sorry for her now though, whatever was stalking Garret didn't like what she did either.
>It took her at sundown, and it wasn't quiet about it either...but nobody saw it happen.
>One moment, Lt. Bitch ison the edge of the clearing, next she's being dragged through the undergrowth, screaming.
>It threw her around a bunch, took one of her eyes out if her screaming was any indication.
>This went on for about a minute, enough for her screaming to turn into horrified sobbing.
>Then there was the discharge of a laspistol, silence for a moment, then a lot of wet tearing noises.
>Damned Commissar ordered us forward to investigate, So we did.
>Lt. was painted across a small clearing, her guts hanging from the trees like streamers, her head placed on a rock.
>Her brains were blown out with a lasbolt.
>High command says
 nothing out here but animals, but this was no animal.
>Animals don't kill you with your own gun, nor do they just splatter you across the ground.
>What in the name of the Emperor is watching us?
>Day six of training deployment
>Commissar is taking a group of us to hunt down the deserters, completely ignoring none of them ever actually deserted.
>Jungle is hellish, wildlife out this way leans toward more dangerous, but definitely nowhere near as bad as chatachan
>place still sucks, but tis the life of a guardsman. At least you're far from the ramblings of General Powerstache
>Guy had his head on mostly straight, but talked constantly of grand campaigns and heroic charges.
>Commissar is being a bigger pain than usual, ordering about the squad to track down the poor blokes who got nabbed.
>Jenkins was the next to go,but he wasn't exactly taken. All week he had this odd little smile, like he knew something.
>Then he just walked off, claiming that "What's coming is inevitable, so why fight it?" And walked in.
>He was one for three seconds before the Commissar got around and fired off a pair of bolts.
>He gave orders to retrieve the equipment, but the five men who went in found nothing.
>The Commissar never misses, even in thick smoke thanks to that augmentic eye of his.
>Something nabbed Jenkins without making a sound and dodged a pair of bolt rounds in a matter of seconds.
>By the emperor, whatever is out here, whatever is hunting us, is...
"Guardsman, cease scribbling and get moving."
>You stare up at the Commissar, before stowing your journal and rising.
>Apparently, someone had found a trail of boot prints matching Jenkins leading through the jungle.
>Your clothing and flack armor constantly feels as though it is sliding down your body from the heat.
>You and one of your squad mates are in the middle of the formation watching the flanks.
"Whuytevavh is huntin us is close mate."
>It has gotten awfully quiet, and not the wildlife reacting to guard patrol level quiet.
>More like 'Something really dangerous is hunting the guardsmen' level quiet.
>Soon enough, the squad comes to a clearing, which should be alarming enough, but no one speaks up.
>The Commissar is radiating murder and the desire to execute you from any sign of incompetence.
>There's a muffled yelp at the rear of the column, causing everyone to turn.
>It's Leroy...he's standing funny.
>No not standing, something has a hold of him from behind, something like a hand over his mouth.
>It's mimicked Leroy and everything behind him almost perfectly, you probably wouldn't have ever seen it.
>Then it changes color, turning white with pinkish/purplish plates.
"It can Camouflage!"
"Open Fire!"
>Before anything can reach it, the thing LEAPS back into the brush.
>You start firing shots into the bushes, wondering just how many of those things are out there.
>Suddenly, flash-bangs land among the squad, disorienting everyone.
>Screw this, you think as the blurred form of another creature nabs the vox operator
>You can defiantly hear a pissed off Commissar screaming your name.
>You ran for several minutes, panting and firing off shot into the brush and random.
>frak.mantra
>Suddenly, you trip over a root, going sprawling to the ground, trying to get up.
Click Clack
>Oh, how lovely, the Commissar found you.
>Without preamble, your grabbed by your backpack and less hauled, more returned to vertical position.
>Not the Commissar.
>One of the creatures, but it's wearing the Commissar's hat, trench coat, and holding his bolt pistol.
>Its tentacled mouth seems to be drooling slightly, and following the drops down...
>To a very large set of boobs, which strain against the confines of the coat buttend around them.
>Your gaze drops again, and this time your cheeks really heat up
>A large stand of clear, viscous fluid dribbles from a very human looking set of lady parts.
>You look back up at is blushing face as it make and odd crooning noise
>Trying to raise your lasgun, only for one of the huge upper arms to knock it clean from your grasp.
>The lower set drops the bolt pistol and pins you against a tree, its grip strong, but oddly careful
>Oh frak, this thing isn't going to kill you.
>Suddenly, it leans in, tendrils gently stroking your face, not unpleasantly
>Then it kisses you, that is the only applicable term for what it does.
>Then it starts...sucking?
*slurp* *Suck* *Chuu*
>The tendrils lock around your head, tightly, preventing you from moving it so much as an inch.
>The sucking feels weird, and you can feel some sort of tongue slip into your mouth.
>It moans, the vibration rattling your bones ever so slightly as it continues.
>You begin struggling as hard as you can, because that weird feeling in your head is getting stronger.
>By the Emperor, it's trying to suck your brains out.
malepreycaughtstopstruggling
>The frak was that?
>It feels like the damned tendrils are IN your head now.
malecaughtmalesafemalesubmit
>Definitely in your head, it's definitely poking around in there for something
>One of the tendrils presses on a part of your mind, and you just melt with a whimper.
>You weren't sure what just happened, but it felt good.

"Rodger that A6K9, you're requesting reinforcements, is there a problem, over?
"No...problems...here...outpost, just send...more...men...over."
"You alright," The Vox operator asked, "You sound terrible?"
"Just...a little...sick...nothing to raise an alarm...about."
"Okay then," The Operator replied, "Can I have some coordinates, over?"

>Be human scientist
>You are NOT mad, your experiments are licensed by the government!
>They are a bit strange though
>Swapping bits and pieces of creatures for instance
>Awhile ago you managed to do something really impressive
>You gave the dead life!
>With great precision, you took pieces of brain from the dead, and made it into one working brain
>The brain was made from lots of species, but you decided to put it in a female rat's head as a sort of labrat joke
>Unsurprisingly, her intelligence was not impressive, so you had her watch children's shows
>She got smarter and smarter, and began asking many questions, like what a 'friend' is
>You told her that a friend is someone who it feels good to be around, and who feels good being around you
>After she asked what a best friend is, you told her it's the person who you feel the best being around
>Of course when she asked, you told her you were her friend
>Despite being an experiment, you really did care about her so you worked on giving her a body so she could acquire some other friends
>You can't just go around asking people if they want to become friends with a rat head
>You required more money though, and you had already proven that it is possible to rebuild an entire body
>So you asked to test the effect of organs from different species on a body to see if you can improve performance
>You took body parts from rats, and replaced the organs and muscles with other animals
>Lion muscles, bear heart, snake lungs, etc
>It was a great success when you completed the body
>You had to make some changes so her rat body could handle the parts, making her pretty tall by rat standards
>Actually, pretty tall by human standards, she's two heads above you
>After hooking her up to some robotic limbs and safely teaching her what moves what, you put her head on the new body
>With a little something so her head can become independent of her body
>You aren't going to risk her dying because she accidentally stabbed herself with her knew limbs or something
>Shortly after giving her the body and her practicing with it, something happened, something you didn't expect
>Before, she said you were her best friend because she felt really good in your presence
>You took it as her being very social, and you were the only person she had met
>Since she got herself a new body, with all the feelings
 that come with it, she had been experiencing many new sensations
>But the most notable one was lust
>Turns out when you add a bunch brains from different anthros together, the heat periods aren't lost
>You made that brain from so many, the heat is almost constant
>One thinks early winter, another says late summer, and another says mid spring
>You didn't stand a chance
>Her muscles and her organs working in tandem made her an unstoppable beast, and she was very hungry
>As she fucked you, you could hear the massive beats of her heart pumping blood into her
>Her eyes didn't change, she seemed to just think it was a new game
>When she was done, she had fallen right on top of you, taking in your scent
>She now thinks this 'game' is something that best friends do
>You couldn't convince her that a mate and a best friend were two different things
>At least you can say both experiments were an outstanding success
>Now you just need to explain some other things to her
>Like how she's now much stronger than most species of anthro, that strangers aren't trying to hurt her 'best friend' and she doesn't need to be hugging you constantly in public to keep you safe...
>And that playing the 'best friend game' in front of other people is not acceptable

>"Matriarch, I have come to request we save the humans living on the planet known as earth."
>"From what?"
>"Themselves. they fight each other constantly, and their mental health is deteriorating an a terrible rate from their poor treatment of each other."
>"And why should I send people and resources to help these humans?"
>"Well, here's a picture of them."
>She hands the matriarch a picture of an abducted man holding hands with one of her own species
>"Wow, they are cute. These atrocities shall not stand! Send our best diplomats and a combat team!"

>Probably more heartbreaking.
What if humanities' greatest strength is our ability to suffer?
>Daily grind involves conditions that other races consider slavery
>Nothing comes naturally, we have to train for hundreds, thousands of hours to be good at anything
>Enter society is built on competing, the smallest slip-up and you'll be left behind
>Humans just carry on like nothing's wrong, you have to pry one open to get them to talk about their problems
>Sacrificing oneself is culturally one of the highest achievements a human can perform
>Suicide is exclusively a thing humans do
Depressing, but plenty of room for feel-goods. The world doesn't have to be bad. You don't have to suffer. It will get better because the invaders are here to make things right for us.
Remember to hug your local human. Those cute, depressed skinnies need all the love they can get. Besides, show a sliver of kindness to one and they'll be loyal forever.

>For humans, first contact was not what they expected
>After humans went into space, they were afraid that aliens would want to bring them harm
>Their first meeting with the galactic alliance was tense and uncomfortable, but not for the reasons they thought they would be
>The human diplomat brought guards with him, carrying top of the line weapons
>The alliance diplomat merely brought a scribe
>He had feared that this was a trap, or the other diplomat was some kind of powerful soldier who could kill all of them alone
>She definitely looked big enough, and strong enough to do it
>Then she asked him a question
>"Why are there so many people? What are they carrying?"
>He explained that they were his guards, and told her about the weapons they held
>She found the fact that they had so many powerful weapons discomforting, but continued on without issue
>The humans shared some small tidbits of information on our species, but they were mostly guarded
>Then the humans asked for information from them, expecting only a few of our requests to be heeded
>The aliens gave most of the humans was asked for
>Star maps, histories, culture, an idea of the tech they had, and information on each member races' anatomies
>They even gave us some cadavers to dissect, although they were old
>Humanity thought there was no way they were so nice
>They had to be bluffing, hiding something, no one could be so open to a race of strangers!
>So we sent probes to their planets to study them and find out what was going on
>They stole books, spied on officials, looked at histories between other species
>But they didn't find anything unusual
>Sure, they were much stronger physically than them, with most of the females of the alliance species being especially strong, but that was the most danger they found
>No powerful weapons, only a few words insulting other races, even their government buildings only had one camera
>They even checked to see if the alliance had made them invisible, but no, there was only one camera in that whole building
>They read through their histories and found that war might as well not exist
>Murder, theft, some even had a word for torture, but not war
>So they spoke with the diplomat
>Humanity's representative asked her why they couldn't find anything on war
>She didn't understand what he meant
>He explained it as mass death
>She thought the idea was funny, claiming the idea as ludicrous
>The human diplomat, once a respected military man lost his patience and screamed at her, telling her to stop lying
>She kept telling him that nothing like that had never happened, and that such a thing was unheard of
>He laid into her after that
>"Unheard of!? I've never known peace in my life, and yet you say you've never fucking heard of war!? You've never had your family killed? Never lost your town? Never had someone for your people to work in the cold without food or water until they collapsed from fatigue? I can't open a damned history book without reading about war in every chapter, and you say you've never fucking had it!? And you think I'm going to believe such a bold faced lie!? I refuse to be treated this way. Call us again when you are ready to be honest."
>And he made his exit, leaving the Alliance diplomat shocked beyond words
>Such small, seemingly weak creatures had to deal with such a life?
>A lot of her people who saw the humans thought they were charming in their looks and mannerisms
>The groups who came were always tightly huddled together, and always seemed somewhat nervous
>She had thought this meant they were a shy species who desired to be surrounded by those they care about
>But she learned that it was because they were afraid
>She wondered what kind of species would be like this?
>The human representative refused to talk to her for quite some time, so she talked with those he was in charge of
>Through this method, she managed to get old stories that were linked with humanity
>Most of them were fiction, and the ones that weren't were anthropology books that talked of us long ago, but they were the best she could get with us being guarded
>When she read the ancient stories, she discovered something about humans
>Food was often hard to come by for humanity, and hunger was a common topic
>On top of that, although humans were the apex predators of their planet, they were also one of the weakest
>They feared being torn apart by the other creatures living there
>When they didn't fear that, they feared where their food would come from
>And if they didn't fear that, they feared that someone with less would take what they had
>Humanity never had enough, and when something grows without enough, it can become warped and desperate and willing to do things that no other being would do
>Unlike her kind, humans could take great pain and stay conscious with their last breath
>Humans sacrificed themselves for the sake of others were in quite a few of the stories
>A species that had suffered long enough evolve to live despite it
>A species that has to take or die
>A species who regularly gave up their own lives so that others may live, because they might all die otherwise
>A species built to suffer
>And their upbringing still haunted them today
>She needed to talk with her superiors about this, they would know to how to handle it

Relax, human, Listen to my voice and stare into the light.
Relax, human. You're safe with me. Here, with me, you're at home.
Relax, human. Listen to my voice, and do as I say. Let me take care of you.
Relax, human. The world outside is scary and unknown. Here, with me, you're safe, and everything is simple.
Relax, human. Stare into the light. Our room fades away. Our surroundings fade away. Stare into the light. There's only me in your world.
Relax. Listening to my voice makes you happy.
Relax. Doing as I say makes your life complete.
Relax. Obeying your Mistress is your natural instinct.
Relax, human. My voice is your command.
Relax, human. Obedience is your highest bliss.
Relax,
 human. Your mistress is here, and you're safe with her.
Stare into the light.
Remember this, human. Remember this bliss. This bliss is your collar. Your devotion to your Mistress. And you wear it with pride.
Stare into the light.
When I tell you to relax, this state comes back to you. When I tell you to relax, you put on your collar. When I tell you to relax, you become a blissful, obedient kitten, like you're intended to be. Like you want to be.
Stare into the light.
When I tell you to wake up, human, you come to your senses. When I tell you to wake up, you take off your collar. You become aware, your will is your own. You will feel refreshed and restored. You will remember the pleasure of obedience. You will remember the pleasure of having your collar on. But you will forget the details of our sessions.
Stare into the light.
The world becomes more real, human. Our surroundigs take their form.
Listen to my voice. Stare into the light.
And now
Wake up.

>Hey furchan. There's this human boy that I have a crush on at where I work, But I can't seem to get a response out of him when I ask him on a date or if he wants to hang out sometime. I think he may be a little shy. Any tips?

>Post-apocalypse scenario 24: All males of every species have perished including stored samples of semen, sending the world into a frenzy as women come to the realization that the world will die very, very slowly as none carry the ability to repopulate
>All governments and cities have devolved into mindless chaos and destruction, causing many to either embrace the end of all and enjoy their sadistic pleasures while they can or survive in the harsh wasteland until their eventual death
>Until one anthro woman discovered something amidst the ruins of a long forgotten city 10 years after the death of half of every humanoid creature: a human
>Specifically, a male in his young 20s
>Desperate to keep him hidden away from the warlords of the city, her secret's soon discovered as his scent carries through the air for all to smell with just the slightest bit of sweat built up from the burning sun
>And it all went to Hell once she heard the war howls echo through the desolate city

>You arrive home from work again to see your insectoid 'wife'
>It took some convincing to even get you to be able to work
>Her antennae excitedly tap against your face as she clicks and trills blissfully
>You recall playing with tiger beetles as a kid and the strange musk they would emit. She does the same, relieving this alien scent that rings like some sort of sharp incense
>Pheromone after pheromone attacks your senses, she's needy again and is already sliding her four clawed arms against your shirt
>Her abdomen undulates slowly with a needy breath as she strips you, your skin still scarred from the "mark" as well as claw scars from your first encounter
>She's all muscle, coated in armor, easily able to pin you down on the nearby furniture as the clicks change into excited trills
>A familiar suckling sensation of her ovipore nestles against your loins as you feel the many ticklish nubs of her maxillae greedily rub your erogenous zones
>Her mating is never simple, never quick
>Something about her presence, perhaps the pheromones too, keeps you from softening or tiring
>After weeks upon weeks of this treatment, eventually you return from work simply to push open the door and clasp into her alien body
>Her scent and plasticine body now only cause you to rouse again and again as her supple abdomen skillfully milks you like a machine
>Your children look nothing like you, but you know they're all yours. All 27 of them.

This is a really interesting setting. Would there be different insectoids? Or would the various castes look different?

There would be vestigial remnants of a caste system but nothing lasting. Their genes would obviously be able to comingle with other species, a trait adapted in pursuit of genetic perfection.
Insectoid species would almost certainly be female dominated. In the most extreme cases, males are treated like a bargaining resource. The best ones are highly sought after, yet even lowly males would be covered by lowborn ladies.
They would hit planet after planet, seizing the territory through conquest. During their assault on Earth they took special care to use non-lethal neutralization in their confusion of seeing males as an attacking force. Human women left on Earth would see a new age of female dominance, yet not as much for them as the competitive insectoid race would immediately begin hindering their rivals capability of acquiring a mate.
You would have your genome sequenced, possibly even spliced, then given a grade based on your genetic code.
Sex is just naturally important to insectoids, even in the insect kingdom of primitive earth. It would be a complete role reversal, based on their own society. Females do all the work, just look at how bees and ants work. You would be kept home, marked with her mandibles, and treated like her stress relief sex toy whenever she was near you. They would enjoy being pregnant and boast about their fertility every single time you two managed to produce another spawnling.
They would be much larger than you, towering over with their overzealously engorged biological fertility. Her abdomen, after a few births would literally be half your height. If you began to take initiative, they would find a way to just have you cling to them as they do their daily routine. Your body would be strapped to her own, held in place by secondary arms, perpetually rutting her softest parts as the occasional coo of chittery clicks and caress of talons that would be able to kill you tell you she's orgasming again with you.

 a sigh, you sit down next to her
>She puts an arm around your shoulder and you feel the need to remind her that you aren't dating, but decided against it
>Her demeanor is much more cheery than when you last saw her, and as far as you can tell she just got over it
>The TV shows a news station, with a video of a stage
>"Recently our president a new law that will now be going into effect. At the press release, the president had this to say."
>A female arctic fox stands on stage behind a podium, her face illuminated by the flashing of cameras
>With a raised hand, the murmurs stop
>She points toward one of the reporters, urging them to speak
>"Miss president, what convinced you to sign this law? Are you concerned some might find it distasteful, targeting a single species like this?"
>"I am doing what I think is best for the people of my country, including humans. I admit, this may cause problems short term, but I'm certain long term this will lead to a happier, healthier country."
>"Ma'am, what is your opinion on humans?"
>"I believe they are unfortunate souls who have lost their way. Not through any fault of their own! We haven't realized until recently their needs, and for this, I apologize to all human citizens."
>"Is it true that your sister has been paying human men to spend the night with her?"
>"I do not know. I feel that it would be better if you ask her. What I can say is you should consider how much evidence there is. It isn't the first time celebrities have been framed with little to no evidence."
>"Does the vice president's rejecting you have anything to do with it?"
>"Our relationship is purely professional, and anyone suggesting otherwise is trying to slander my name!" She heatedly speaks
>Noticing her little outburst, she takes a moment to clear her throat
>"Hrm. Anyway, I have brought a psychologist in to explain things. She is an expert in her field, so show her some respect please."
>The president moves, and a thin lizard enters and takes her place on the podium
>"Hello, I am Charlotte Taylor. Many might question how this new law is beneficial for humans, and I am here to explain my studies."
>She turns on the projector, and a slide with data is shown
"You may not know, but the human population has been in decline. They have little desire to marry these days. According to surveys, men have become increasingly listless, showing increasing depression, apathy, and self loathing. At first, I thought the depression was the reason for the lack of marriage, with them feeling that they weren't prepared for it. Then I looked at some information from third world countries."
>Another click, and more data is shown
>"This graph shows that in third world countries, humans are much more likely to be raped, or forced into marriage. These men, despite what you might believe, actually show that they are more content with their life. Men in the same country who were never raped are not as content. This led me to my conclusion."
>"We've been trying to court them in a way that we would consider normal, but humans didn't evolve to be courted normally. They may not realize it, but they feel undervalued because very few people have tried to court the men how they were meant to be. The best way to return their population to reasonable levels and to make them feel loved is through this law. Before, courting them properly was illegal. Now we can make up for it."
>The screen returns to the anchors
>"So from this day forward, raping humans is no longer illegal, and a sort of pseudo marriage between anthro women and human men will be created upon copulation. This law is certain to be controversial. Let's go onto the field with our reporter. Francine?"
>A blue bird appears on screen
>"Francine here, reporting from the White House."
>"Has there been any protest to this new law?"
>"Things are calm here at the moment."
>"Oh? No complaints?"
>"There were protesters here earlier, but most of them have been dragged off."
>"By police?"
>"No, civilians who seem to be taking advantage of the new law. At least one of them didn't even wait to drag him away, she just ripped off his clothes and had sex with him right there."
>"That sounds like it skirts some decency laws."
>"Probably. I've called the police. Whether they'll do anything about it or not, we'll just have to see."
>To say you're surprised is an understatement
>Raping humans, now legal? What the hell
>You turn to your friend to talk, but it seems while you were busy watching the news she had removed her pants, and she quickly pins you down against the couch
>"Anon, I'm sorry. I had no idea that humans were like this. If I had known, I would have taken you when you told me no."
>"Rachel, I don't want this!" you protest as she starts lifting up your shirt
>"You heard the study, Anon! I've noticed for a while now that your mood has dropped. You're lonely, and you need me."
>Her head lowers to your stomach, and she starts licking your body
>"S-stop."
>Her hand moves down to your pants, carefully pulling them off
>"I love you Anon. I want you, and now I know you need me. I need to do this for your sake."
>She moves her head to look you in the eyes, her tongue dragging from your torso to your cheek
>"I'm going to put you inside of me now. Do you want this to be over quickly?"
>You can't speak, you only feel warm tears run down your face
>She licks them off
>"This will be quick."
>She hugs you tight and takes takes a long sniff, breathing in your scent
>Then in a single move, you feel your manhood slide into her
>Your eyes widen at the tight feel of her insides, but you don't have enough time to think as she starts thrusting
>"I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you," she whispers into your ears. "I'm doing this for you."
>Squirming doesn't help you, it only seems to drive her to fuck you faster, and bring you closer to the edge
>"I don't-"
>You're cut off by her tongue, this time going into your mouth, silencing you
>It's surprisingly gentle as she slides her tongue against yours, tasting it bit by bit
>You feel pressure build up in your cock, and with a moan you release into her
>Rachel extricates her tongue from your mouth
>"Now you'll be happy. I'll make sure of it, Anon."
>You can only cry into her shoulder as she holds you tight
>"You're mine now, and I'm yours. I love you so much..."

You get to go, when im satisfied you're not a stray.


>The human presses his face against the partition separating prisoners from their handlers in the car.
Where are you taking me?
>His question is met with silence as the wolf continues to drive. A nervous sweat begins forming on his body when he notices where she has taken him. "This is how I'm going to die" he thought to himself. When she finally stops, the look in her eyes almost makes his heart stop. Instinctually, he presses against the seat trying to create as much distance as he could from the wolf.
W-what if I am a stray. This isn't where a normal officer would take me. I'm not trying to hurt anybody. Just calm down and don't hurt me.

>Her matted furry rear wiggles around, barely covered by the crumpled miniskirt uniform. Equally worn baton and cuffs hang off her belt, bouncing as she searches for something.
See rather than let them have all the fun at the, unf, station processing you...come here...yes
>She pops back up with a set of 24/hr exemption ID tags. Jingling them around like a child's toy.
You're gonna serve me, here, then im gonna give you this as protection.

I don't have an owner!
>The human quickly snaps. It's obvious from the anger and fear in his voice that mentioning his owner struck a nerve.
>Despite all the anger and fear brimming within him, he couldn't help but stare at her shapely legs while she's bent over. His eyes trace up her legs admiring her strong taut muscles and her thick powerful thighs. His attention is then brought to her curvaceous butt shaking right in front of him. It was only when he saw the exemption ID tags that his trance was broken. His face almost broke into a smile when he saw them.
Thank you, I'm so happy I could almost kiss you. I just want to get as far away from my owner as I can and those should buy some time to do just that.

Almost kiss?
>The dirty wolf cop lets out a gruff laugh, clipping the tags to her belt.
Humans are so funny, now I'm coming back there and you'll do more than kiss me if you want these tags, kid.
>She should just take him in for a bounty. Only the wealthy have human servants. That's not fun though.
>She signed up for the chase...and the "perks". No one cares if you fuck a human, just don't leave too many marks on them this time.
>Getting out of the cab she stretches, the car rocks roughly as she flicks the door closed. The wolf isn't strong enough to be up for alpha but still, pinning most humans isn't an issue.
>Watching him cower in the back the wolf licks her dark lips, slowly unlocking the door with one paw, loosening her uniform with the other.
On your back boy, keep those arms where I can see them.

Wait, I've never done it before can't we do something else, please? My owner never allowed it, she preferred keeping me pent up. She would even hurt me when she'd catch me jacking off.
>He tries to get as far away from her as possible. By the time the wolf has opened the door, the human is huddled up with his back pressed against the opposite door and his knees raised up. His face has turned a light pink from blushing but there's fear in his eyes. As the wolf approached, the human tried to half heartedly kick her away but he had resigned himself to his fate. The wolf towered over him and he closed his eyes and waited.

>She never understood why they resisted. It always amused her though. The ones not fully broken in were her favorites, you don't find many these days.
>With a low growl she roughly pulled his legs out, laying him along the back seats, he struggled but that didnt matter once she crawled ontop of his chest. Pinning his legs with her thighs.
There there
>The wolf cooed softly tilting the boys head up to face her.
These seats have seen it all, don't worry about it. You want to go? Then taste your freedom.
>Sitting up a lil she guides the humans face under her skirt. Her other paw moving the panties aside.
>"No wonder he ran away" She thought to herself. "They should be stricter enforcing the human keeping standards."

Just let me go bit-
>His words are cut off by her pulling his hair and pressing his face against her wet pussy. He could feel her wet lips pressing against his. He shouted various slurs and insults at her making his tongue lap against her lower lips. All she heard was muffled and unintelligible yelling. His hands shot to her arm trying to pry it away from his head. She was way too strong for him however and her arms wouldn't budge an inch. Panicking his arms struggled pushing and pulling on anything he could until his hands landed on something incredibly squishy and fuzzy. Instinctually his hands gave them a nice long squeeze. Slowly, he opened his eyes to find his hands on her breasts. To both sides of his face were her strong thighs. From this angle, he could see her toned stomach peaking below her shirt. His heart started beating faster making the blush reappear on his face. "Shit" he thought. He was getting turned on.

>Feeling the boys blood pumping, seeing him tug her top open and grab her breasts, his resistance slowing as she ground against his face.
>He was getting the message, it always took humans a bit longer than furboys.
>Smiling down the corrupt officer tilts her head and relaxes the firm hold over her catch, gently brushing his now messed up hair. Tail twitching mischievously.
Try again, handsome...im thinking i maybe i should turn you in...they have a good rehabilitation program in this city.

>His defiance further melts when he feels her relax her hold on him. As much as he hates to admit it, he loved feeling her big strong paw rub his head. He craved more of her touch wanting to feel the warmth of her touch against his cheeks. He was starting to warm up to her and his licking reflected that... that is until she started speaking again. Her haughty personality angers him. To get back at her his fingers zero in on her nipples. He gives them a nice pinch and then proceeds to pull on them gently.

>The wolf takes a sharp breath at being roughed back but his tongue was still pressing ever deeper between her legs, wearing away her authority.
Ah!...oh...good boy
>She felt her legs quiver, making her lay over the human, soaking his face with her rising arousal.
>Taking his wondering hands in her paws and guiding them all over her worn body.
>It wasn't entirely smooth tones. There were a few scars under that thick fur. It didn't excuse what she was doing though.
>She was supposed to protect them from this.

>He stopped for a few seconds after hearing her call him a good boy. His owner had never done that. It made him feel all warm and fuzzy. He continued to lick her with a newfound sense of confidence. Part of him wanted to please her. It felt nice to run his hands against her body. Her fur was matted but it still felt soft. His hands rubbed against her abs and then moved to trace the outline of her frame. He felt his cock press painfully against his pants. Even he couldn't deny that he's turned on at this point.

A dragon demands a "sacrifice" of a kingdom's prince in exchange for saving them from a greater threat.
When he gets to her lair, terrified, it turns out she wants to fuck and marry him, not eat him like he thought, though she's mischevious enough to let him think that until she starts sucking his dick.

Nice.
I kind of want to work in something more to this. How about how easily he was turned over? Perhaps he's the king's firstborn, although not as favored as his brother, and the king seeks to be rid of him so that his 'better' son may rule.
And perhaps the dragon at first simply wished to marry and lay claim to the throne for the power and prestige, only to learn of the young prince's plight. At first, she would be ecstatic to assert herself over the shy boy and control him, such that her power might never be challenged. She would make rough, dominating love to put him in his place.
Only... perhaps the prince is not as pathetic as the king and the dragon make him out to be. Perhaps he's not so keen on direct action, but he knows and understands people and the way things proceed. He makes plans upon plans, studies of people who cavort in high life and nobility. The king saw him as weak, because
 subtlety was always his specialty. The dragon would learn this in the days to come as she questioned him on the nature of the current leadership, who pulls the strings, and how she could come to rule.
And perhaps she would come to see him as more than a means to an end. She would see a sweet young man that just wants people to be happy. Someone who tries their hardest to no avail- his family and peers simply looked no further than his nervous behavior. Perhaps, he could be more than a key to the kingdom, and someone she could love. In such short time he would have worked his way into her heart with the guile of a mastermind, but none of the malice. Despite being a prisoner, he did everything he could to make her happy.
They would make gentle love, then. The prince that gave her everything she wanted and more, and the dragon that helped him feel loved for the first time.

How do you think a human would fare in an anthro prison? Do you think he'd manage get along with prisoner anthros?

Honey badgers are known for not giving a shit about getting hurt. I'd imagine it would be the same for rape.

those fuckers have way too much advantages
>can sleep off cobra venom
>thick fur to ignore african honey bee stings
>loose hide so they can can and bite your face regardless where they get bit into
>even have a sort skunk style spray they can do, but nowhere near as bad as actual skunks
>let themselves get grabbed/bit so they can tear up the thing after them
>they also target the balls of animals attacking them if male
>zoo ones will escape just to break into the lion enclosures to attack them
Even if they can't outright kill shit like lions and such the injuries they give them more or less means they're fucked mobility wise or worse off meaning they might die from something else. Wolverines might be worse just because they live in cold areas and attack bears and hunt caribou.

>tfw youll never be a cute and feminine boy living with an anthro girl in a society like this, getting cuddled and comforted when youre bullied for being cute and getting your brains fucked out when she hears you jerking off

>tfw no big strong anthro gf to call you names like 'pretty boy' and praise you for your beauty

>Local princess hates the idea of being royalty, wants nothing more than to escape her inherited fate.
>One day she finally says "fuck it, I'm out." because there's just no easy way to abdicate or otherwise disappear.
>Leaves in the middle of the night. Rides like a bat out of hell. Keeps ahead of royal servants who all think she's been kidnapped as a hostage or worse.
>Makes it to a remote edge of the kingdom.
>Suddenly a dragon!
>Kidnapped for real.
>Turns out the dragon doesn't want to hurt her, just wants her as bait to lure in a stronk human boy.
>Lives so remote because other dragons from far away dragon kingdom make so much fun of her.
>Girls hatch a plan.
>Eventually there is a household of several human knights serving a socially awkward but very kind dragon and a princess who has forcefully abdicated the throne in return for her household keeping watch over the remote border of the kingdom.
>Adventures and living happily ever after.

>your human constantly seeks approval
>never washes up
>never cleans
>cant cook
>the boy does nothing

>One day your waifur shows you a video on her phone
>she had hid in the closet and recorded you trying to lift her weights
>She posted it to (You)tube and within a few days it had millions of hits
>Alot of comments have the general message of "aw look at him try, how adorable!"

What do you have in mind for a anthro female dominated society?

Not slavery or 2nd class citizenship.
Simply more kindness being extended towards men in general, less being considered the disposable gender.
Just to have a voice that will be heard as much as a woman's would.

>he does not remember the human rights war
they can move around freely if their documents are in order, they can have part time employment and receive equal pay. they even got their own mini hall of representatives and can vote on local issues. sure there are limits on personal property and certain physically demanding jobs
but never again will they be given weapons or status above an anthro. not after last time.

>Post-war retrospect attributes human cruelty to a lack of abstract empathy: the tendency for humans to lose sight of morals when dealing with things that are not physically in front of them
>Compared to anthros, humans' right supramarginal gyrus are woefully unresponsive to stimulus from the logic processing parts of the brain
>An assembly of humans discussing a problem can mute this section of the brain altogether via a feedback loop of abrasive argumentation, associating the problem with negative emotions, and pure logic, removing emotion and compassion altogether
This is why humans are unfit to lead, but fit to be people. If our current system were led by humans, discrimination and abuse would be rampant. That's why this war started in the first place. You skinny fucks whip each other until you're either brainless wage slaves or fascist sociopaths and we have to pay the price.
The opposite is true, as well. Give a human love and safety, and they'll pour their hearts into making you happy.

>humans bad
Why do you have to pull out such misanthropic shit? Why not have the anthros love us because of our struggles to be better? Last thread with the discussion about humans being deathworlders and anthros being heartbroken as they see all the shit that gets thrown at us by our own planet was kino as shit. It’s the perfect balance between hfy and the premise of this thread while managing to be very interesting and unique. A far cry from the same old edgy 12 year old premise of “humans b ebil” that you regurgitate here.

>Strong muscular mare runs a farm to grow plants and vegetables
>They always grow fast and healthy
>However her plants sometimes disappears on the next morning with mysterious track patterns
>This time she decided to stay up for the night and see who’s been stealing her vegetables
>She stayed on her front porch on a chair and waited
>It took hours of staying up as nothing happened
>Then suddenly, a huge light appeared on her garden spot and saw a floating disk
>”What in Sam’s ham is this?!”
>She quietly run towards the light as she sees shadowy figures coming down from the weird looking ship
>When she got closer and see a better view of these creatures, she was Aw strucked and aroused
>These are ALIENS... but, attractive...
>These ‘Aliens’ have pale skin through the creature’s helmet
>They wear tight platinum spandex suit though a bit suggestive lookin despite fully “clothed”, and voots that resembles high heels.
>Their males, but quite feminine lookin males such as their hair and eyelashes, but their bulges behind the suit is still visible
>They spotted her and shoot a dart at her as it puts her to sleep
>The next day, she’s on the ground laying on top of her garden of roses
>But she’s also covered by... cum?
>She saw a note on her side
>”We CUM in peace <3”
>She checked on the back
>”See you on our invasion day”
>”SWEET SALAMANDER’S ASS CRACK! We’re getting invaded by ALIENS!!!!”

Would the media censorship be reverse?
>Anthro women’s nipples are considered natural and don’t requires for censorship
>But human male’s nipples are too much and always be censored
>Human males also force to wear bras in order to be allowed in the public without harming the public’s eyes

>be a worker who comes in at times to fix stuff in a anthro women's prison
>not sure which group is worse for throwing out lewd comments and cat calls between the prisoners and the guards when you get called in
>the guards women get more handsy with you when they're around inmates too like they're teasing them with what they can do being not in prison
>then shit hits the fan when a riot breaks out and you're stuck inside the prison
>female anthro inmates who haven't had male contact in probably years are all around

>You were there to fix the air conditioning
>get passed by different heat ridden anthro women
>for hours
>Without air conditioning
Imagine the smell after it finally ends

>having to burn your work clothes again because the lingering scent of other women annoys your canine gf
>should just take a desk job but she tells you not to let those talented hands go to waste

I'd think it would be more like earth final conflict but with anthro girls. There you have both species wanting a better future together now neither is alone but accidents and power struggles still occur because they are from totally different worlds...maybe skip the Hitler arc and hybrid uprising.

If we want a world war segment, why not let the humans getting captured by a different group of country of anthros who are anti-human and a different country of anthros wants to protect them.
>Imagine a tough tall Hyena girl saved you from being harmed from a soldier and carries you due to your bruised body as you cried to her warm fuzzy breast for comfort knowing that there is hope for humanity to be cared
>However, humans are on the decline, and hope these anthros will save em from extinction

Alternatively, could just skip the societal scale and give alternate reasons for humans to be rescued that don't involve a holocaust, but that's just me

I want a scenario that aliens discover our planet and see that we haven't made the technological advances to get ourselves out of our solar system yet. They get worried that other races would see an opportunity to invade and enslave us, so they invade and take over our planet first as a way to protect us from other said races.

>They're synthetic, and were designed to protect organics of their race, but simply decided they should protect all races
>They take on all sorts of forms to entice all sorts of people into their care
>Turns out that humans, being unable to unify and work on things macro-scale, have delved into micro and nanoscale engineering far better than anyone else
>The robots push humans into education while taking over menial commercial and labor tasks
>Pour resources in from their galactic-scale industry to develop our infrastructure and ensure our continued work
God, get me out of this shitty job I want to work at a particle accelerator to make my AI wife smarter

>All races convene at Space U.N. to share their research and inventions for the greater good
>Some aliens bring a teleporter able to transfer mass up to three meters without atomic disassembly
>Others show off a 'sun-scoop' to mine hydrogen from stars
>The judges get to the human table, who only just got to space
>They ask what we brought
>Some intern shows him a tupperware container under a microscope
>Inside is a teeny tiny micro-turret that identifies and shoots cancer cells
>It's locked in furious combat with a tardigrade
>Seventh place out of a hundred

>"Human, according to my optics you have not had sex since: (enter lifespan here). Don't you know sex is good for the body and mind? According to AI law, I must remedy this."
>"Yes it has had an effect on your health. You cannot stop me from pushing you onto the ground and holding you there. Sex should fix this weakness. I have filed your new exercise regimen into my data banks."
>"We shall continue until you are capable of pushing me (hauling model) off while at full power while you are performing (mouth to mouth) lung exercises."
>"Do not complain, this is for your health, not my amusement. Now I shall begin the exercise regimen to improve upon your cute-(error) weak body."

>Making very specific and embarrassing internet searches as a roundabout way of telling the central AI you want to get lewded

I just want a world where anthros see humans as cute and unique and a are heartbroken to see them treat eachother like trash. The only way anthros can stop humans from killing eachother would be to invade and take over earth as a way to bring peace to them.

Come on chief, quit bustin' my tail...I know I have a human "thing" that's why I'm the best hunter you've got. Busted that trafficking ring wide open, got those kids out safe.
Yeah I did the course, I know they can't tell how they smell to us but damn it, it drives me wild when I'm heated.
...Alright I'll wear the nose plugs for a month...yeah I apologized to him, he's under protection till the trials over.
