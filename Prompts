>Striped Hyenas in particular will be especially affectionate once they're inside their dens; even if an individual wouldn't normally be that way, you're likely to see a noticeable change as soon as she gets settled in. If she's already affectionate, you'd better learn how to breath through all that fluff. She will let you out for air, but it's still a good idea to maximize the amount of time your face can spend buried in her fluffy parts, as a show of respect.

>How did you convince her to take the lead sexually?

>Dragons definitely, a combination of size and temperament.
>Snakes/Nagas/Lamias...all the better to hug(squeeze) you into submision.
>Sharks and large dolphins, doubly so when in the water.
>Most of the FAoHM thread does agree on large wolfgirls, yeens, and crocodilains, so there is that to consider. Personally, I think it's more of a temperament thing.

>They hardly know what sex is yet, much less understand that this incredibly enjoyable ritual requires consent. Would you say no to a massage? Why say no to this? Humans are weird. And weak. And clearly need to be taught that asking for consent is a waste of time.
>No one in their right mind would say no to something so fun.

>Goddamn do I love anthro horses. Why can't I have a loving, gentle dom mare wife? I just want to have her hold me close, feel her warm fur and the breath coming out of her snout, and drift off to sleep to the sound of her heartbeat.

I want a mare who's sweet, loving and gentle, yet knows that she's in charge. Climbing on top and slowly riding my cock, stopping every time I hit the very razors edge of orgasm, not letting me cum until shes had multiple of her own, all the while whispering into my ear about how good it'll feel when she finally lets me cum, and kissing me as she brings me to the edge again.

>Horses could easily work for both. They're pretty big and strong, and you have the whole "role reversal" thing going on. Not to mention crops are like, a huge staple in femdom.

>One day while looking in a room dusting for prints, someone puts a hand on your mouth and holds a knife to your neck
>It was obvious who it was
>You expected her to kill you
>You had no reason to expect her to start smelling you

>But she insists that to keep water out of your lungs she needs to share air on the way up
>You're pretty sure sharing air doesn't require that much tongue

>Literally nothing you can do if a Pokemon decides it wants to use you
>Most Pokemon's fighting spirit and inner desire to be stronger means that being a dom and topping are always preferred

>Word will quickly get around the wilds when a human


 is down to get fucked

>They are now ubiquitous in our civilization
>Arceus save us if their desires reawaken
>Because now even the safest places are teaming with them

>a world where teasing is a way of testing how good a person's life is
>shyness and nervousness is perceived as a cry for help: a subconscious desire to be taken away
>humans are just naturally weaker, and as such have much more reason to be shy and nervous

>There are still some who believe it was the opposite
>Humans were made so that Pokemon may always find a loving husband
>They may try to reject the role, but to the Pokemon, these failed attempts only prove one thing
>It was the role that they were made for

>ynw attempt to struggle against an incineroar just for her to pin you back down and shut down any sort of resistance
>Incineroar innecesantly pointing out how feminine you are and how much you need to train
>you try to go to the gym once and she pulls you back because she actually loves you like this, weak, feeble, and unable to resist

>What if she loves when they run just because she knows she'd easily catch up?
>She loves it alright. Imagine the fear in his eyes when she tackles him down, pinning his arms right above his head and stopping any attempts of escape
>I remember a Mythbusters episode where they tried testing if running side to side would permit one to escape a crocodile/alligator faster than running straight away from it.
>They ran into an immediate problem, as the gators/crocs would not pursue the bait more than a few feet after the initial lunge. Thus the myth was deemed busted.
>If this applies to gator girls, they will likely stalk you for a short time, carefully closing the gap without you noticing, before launching at you without warning. That, or positioning herself so your escape routes are blocked. After the initial attack, she may pursue you for a short time. Probably plow through some minor obstacles along the way or overturn a car with her strength.
>Unfortunately for her, that thicc gator body, thighs, and tail aren't great for speed or distance running, so she'll come to an awkward halt gazing at you lustily until energy builds up for another attempt. If she is successful in grabbing you however, odds are you'll be deathrolled for a few dozen yard before being pinned under a very dominant and happily rumbling gator woman

>Wildcats are defiantly femdom material, and would more than likely enjoy hunting some guy down. And given that all cats tend to play with what they catch...well, you'll want to pack some band-aids.
>Personality wise, probably demanding with a bit of a superiority complex, and generally lazy in her off time. Might have you on a leash as you pet her and scratch behind her ears as she lounges on the couch.
>Just an opinion…

>Ywn be dominated by an amazonian hyena who want to improve your bloodline by getting you YEENED and make you a stay at home dad for the cubs you have.

>Alternatively, lionesses
>you’re a stay at home dad
>your job is to take care of the kids and fuck/comfort your wives

>get abducted by a pride of rogue lionesses
>they formed from random lionesses that left or had no pride or got tired of their male
>learn humans have no barbs and formed a plan to get one
>now they have a male they're an official pride now
>not much different from a normal lion pride with the females out hunting and the male staying at the den, but this time it's because a human doesn't do well in the Savannah and hunting with lions
>now the lionesses bring food for their male to keep his strength/stamina up when they fuck him into the ground together
>they got to be careful with their human due to humans being smaller than lions and the no barbs has them going much rougher and longer since there is no pain and only pleasure
>male lions can't even challenge their human for ownership of the pride since the lionesses attack together because they're not putting up with barb dicks ever again

>monster hunter, but the monsters are females that cause issues due to being horny and harassing people/villages/towns/etc
>hunters have to go out and try to calm

>The hunters try to fight at first
>It goes badly, with many men being taken back to the female's caves
>After other monsters hear about what human men are like, they start attacking the villages
>Hunters turn into sacrifices
>Eventually the villages manage to convince the monsters to give rare materials in return for men
>The economy thrives, but few men who arrive realize that they might just be traded to the monsters to help the economy
>Telling them you are married won't save you

>Live in the world of Pokemon
>You aren't a trainer, you were never especially interested in risking life and limb, or teaching Pokemon how to fight
>You'd probably be a terrible teacher anyway, seeing as you know nothing about fighting
>That isn't to say you don't love Pokemon, you do
>When you found a rockruff eating from a dumpster, you had to take her home and clean her up
>You may have gotten bit by her, but you can't blame a poor thing like that for being frightened
>She was much nicer after you gave her some food
>Not feeling comfortable with letting her go, you let her live in your house and named her Luna
>Luna was often very affectionate, always licking your face whenever you put it near her
>Going to bed was a bit tricky, because you'd find yourself covered in slobber as soon as you let your head hit the pillow
>There was still some... problem behavior from her
>Not just because she'd fight you during bath time
>She was very protective of you
>Not entirely out of the ordinary, but it was always worst around women and female Pokemon for some reason
>One day a passing trainer showed off her Salazzle
>You don't know why, but you got this really weird, comforting vibe from that Pokemon
>Luna seemed to disagree as she flew into a rage
>Despite the type advantage, she lost pretty badly
>You apologized to the trainer, and brought Luna to the pokecenter
>After that you expected her to calm down as she might risk getting beaten again, but you were terribly wrong
>If anything she got into more fights
>Even when you were sleeping, she'd leave to fight
>Then one night it happened
>You practically jumped when you heard the sound of splintering wood
>A strange form, shrouded by darkness opened your door and you screamed
>It fell on top of you and you struggled to get free
>Then you heard snoring
>You felt cold metal against your chest, seemingly tied to the individual's neck
>Carefully, so as not to wake the intruder, you held it to your face
>Luna?
>Things were kind of the same, but also different since Luna evolved into a Lycanroc
>For one, wrestling her into the bath
>Now it was actual wrestling, and she was easily stronger than you, pushing you into the tub
>Surprisingly after that she jumped in and forcefully lathered you
>Seeing what she was doing and knowing she was much stronger then you, you stopped fighting it
>Although you did push her away whenever she started getting her hands a bit too low
>You felt that it was some sort of revenge for always cleaning her, but after her very handsy wash, she had no problem sitting still for you to clean her
>After cleaning her top and getting lower, you noticed her own privates
>As a rockruff you'd clean that spot without thinking, but now it just felt different
>Like putting your hand around there would be wrong
>You took your hand away right as it reached that spot and handed the soap to her
>She looked at it in confusion, and to your surprise started to growl
>You thought she would crush the soap, but thankfully she just angrily continued with her washing
>When you took her for a walk, she stood closely by your side, growling at every woman who got too close
>You were a bit worried when one of your neighbors came to talk to you
>You tried to convince her to calm down by reminding her that she was friendly, but her growls just got worse
>Thankfully you managed to calm her with a good hug, but she wouldn't let you go without firmly slobbering all over your face
>She seemed pretty adamant on staring your neighbor down as she licked you, her coarse, rocky tongue brushing against your face
>When night fell, you laid in bed
>You wondered if you should let her sleep beside you still, as she wasn't really a puppy anymore
>She walked up to the bed, and got down on all fours, looking intently at your face
>You begin to lightly sweat, a bit uncomfortable with the close contact
>She brought her face to yours, and started to give her usual slobbery good night kisses
>The usual feeling of a large wet tongue dragged against your

 face
>Something was different though
>Instead of the usual rapid licking, her tongue was slow
>It was like she was carefully tasting you, studying your flavor
>Then her tongue darted into your mouth
>The meaty organ was entangling with yours, pushing it gently
>Panicked, you pushed her away
>Surprise covered her face for a moment, before it turned into rage
>She grabbed your arms and held them firmly to the bed before she smashed her face into yours again
>This time, instead of the original gentleness you felt your tongue being battered
>Any attempt to pull back, and she would reach deeper into your mouth
>Not a single spot is untouched as she scoured you, and the drool because heavy and you're forced to gulp it down
>She pulled away and smiled smugly at you as you gasp for air
>Her hand let go of yours, and moved down to your pants
>With a yank your member stood tall and brushed against her thigh
>Her hand moved to your face, and you felt it caress your cheek
>With a thrust, your member went inside of her drooling lips
>The way she slammed her hips into yours hurt a bit, but it was nothing to the pressure of her pussy's grip
>She looked at your face with that smug look again and you tried to look away
>Soon her other hand reached for your head, and forced you to turn back to her
>She smirked at as you tried to use your free hands to move hers away, but she just chuckled at your failed efforts
>She changed the pace of her thrusts and began gyrating
>Her eyes scanned your face and gauged your reactions
>Her own face occasionally shifted, from a smirk, to curiosity, to the look you'd expect one to give to a mewling kitten
>As you felt drool running down your mouth, she suddenly stopped and looked into your eyes
>The look she gave you was kind, and you almost expected her to let you go
>Then she attacked again, using the previous knowledge gleaned from your reactions
>That's too much, and you feel yourself release into her
>As you spasmed, she held your head tight
>The only thing you could look at were her bright red eyes
>After you fell limp, she gave a small kiss on your lips
>She grinned once more, but this time it was a pure one with no malevolence, not hiding any tricks
>It was the same smile that she wore as the girl you found in the garbage
>She just grew up
>You both fall asleep, her head resting beside you and one massive hand lightly scratching your head

>Simple. You know how sharks are said to be capable of smelling blood from miles away? They could do the same with sperm. Just stick your dick in the ocean, and you'll eventually fish one out.

>"Oh, Anon! What do you mean your religion says humans and anthros are not to be wed?"
>"Why would such a terrible religion say that? You were put upon this Earth as gifts to anthro women. It's what brings humanity meaning! Please, come to the church so we can baptize you properly."
>"Anon, don't fight it. You're only hurting yourself. I will drag you there and help if it means you can repent for your sins and know paradise."
>"Do not worry, you're only a sweet man who got lost on the path to heaven. I know you'll be forgiven, the daughters of Eve can be very persuasive. After a night with us, and a bit of reading of our book you'll see that they are merely imposters."

>a world where anthros make up 90% of Earth's population and humans are rare
>anthro societies see humans as strange, cute beings that can't survive on their own and need to be protected and loved

>Humans since the dawn of time were viewed as priceless and beloved by all
>Anthros love their cute features, and know that they are too weak to fight back for independence
>Because of this, there are few things more valuable than a human
>It's even believed that some wars started over humans, with the most famous one being the Iliad, where the lion princess of Troy stole
 the adored husband meant for the dog queen of Sparta
>In the Medieval era, specially trained pleasure men might be given away to help push for alliances
>This made most humans direct descendants of royalty or other people who held great power, making them worth even more
>In the modern age, although humans may no longer be considered property, it is hard not to find adults who are under the protection of a powerful figure
>A human without bodyguards would almost certainly find himself kidnapped or used by some desperate female
>They are never hurt, however, as to do such a thing will incur the wrath of anyone with a set of morals
>Then there are the extremist groups
>The largest one is a new religion quickly gaining traction, claiming that male anthros were put down by some devil like figure, and humans are the only true males
>Then there are the children of Felinity, a group that thinks cats are superior to all others, and children of both cats and humans will lead them to true perfection
>Along with a myriad of others who took the idea and replaced cats with their own species
>One thing is for sure, people are willing to give a lot to be with a man
>And those who have them refuse to part so easily with their grand treasures

>animals excessively outnumber humans
>humans are kinda small in body mass compared to lot of species
>don't have mating seasons
>human females are kinda stretchy
>both human males and females have incredible sexual endurance
>also males have the biggest goddamn dick-to-bodymass ratio out of everyone with the exception of horses and ducks

>In the twenty first century, mankind received word without a doubt, that they were not alone in the galaxy.
>Alien spacecraft hovered outside every city, far enough away to not be threatening, but visible from the ground.
>After a few minutes, every device on Earth reported a single message in text and audio.
"We come in peace, do not be alarmed. We ask that the populace go about their lives as normal and avoid panic."
"We will convene at the United nations building in two of your days."
>Panic was thankfully minimal, though everyone was definitely stressed over the ordeal.
>Ambassadors were rushed to the UN building, and over a period of several days, details began to unfurl.
>The aliens had reached out through social media, so as to keep the public up to date when the governments would not.
>Apparently, 100,000 years back, Greys took samples of earth's fauna and began doing genetic experimentation.
>They only raised females, however, as a means of population control, ensuring they could not bred on their own.
>The Greys used artificial gene sequencing tech to create male zygotes and artificially inseminate the females. This gave them better contro over their evolution.
>Eventually, they ended up with anthro amazonian women of numerous species to fight their wars for them in Andromeda.
>After the wars, the anthros wondered why they were subservient to the Greys, and began to ask questions about their history.
>This eventually culminated in a rebellion that lasted the better part of 500 years.
>The anthros did achieve victory, but at a terrible cost, the gene-sequencing tech was destroyed, though stockpiles of viable sperm remained.
>Thus, they came to earth, to exchange technology, space travel, and protection, for human men, as their biology had been tweaked to accept it in route by what few scientist they had and information from scouting parties.

>You are a young brigadier in Europe set in the 17th century
>Your societal position can be considered as some kind of proto-mafia, less hierarchal and more delinquent
>Your last disruption job went well, and you successfully snitched some rival activities to a troop of carabineers
>However the rival clan manages to identify you and immediatly hire bandits to teach you a lesson
>It doesn't take long until those bandits manage to find you
>You didn't see it coming, as you thought they were just campers in the area, they were even singing folk songs togheter with a guitar...
>One taller than the other, a vixen and a lynx correspectivly
>They chained you inside a carriage, took turns beating and cutting you with knives, the lynx even used her claws as she beat you, living marks on your face and abomen.
>They branded you on the back of the shoulder with the symbol of the very clan who hired them. Then they also took turn in trying out the freshly tendered meat, you only could be glad that the vixen was sweet about it because the lynx was quite eager to dig her claws onto your back as only lord knows how many loads you dumped into them, solely to satisfy their heat.
>You are dumped at night the feet of an hideout of your clan, your comrades would find your naked and unconcious body only later in the morning.

>you are a lone trader, traveling hundreds or even thousand of miles to get from one town to the next with nothing but a small wagon of goods to sell and food to keep you alive.
>one day, while traveling on the lonely road, you get raided by a group of yeen bandits who not only take your wagon full of resources, but they also decide to keep you as their own breeding bitch.

>Imagine being that helpless. Just pinned to the mattress with her weight on you, sliding in and out. Feeling sensations you'd never felt before. Her sharp eyes piercing you from an inch away as she takes full control. Trying to keep your composure as she draws out gasps and moans from your pinned form.

>The great civilization of the lizardwomen had dominated the jungles for centuries.
>They created impressive cities with towering temple pyramids, dedicated to their gods.
>Local human tribes would be subjugated, and made to pay tribute to the lizardwomen.
>It was only proper for the strong to benefit from the weak, as nature intended.
>Human males were prized possessions,

 able to last longer and be ready again faster than their own males.
>Their body heat was welcoming, their skin soft and supple, and their scent intoxicating.
>As a result, the Fertility ceremony overseen by the High Priestess requires such individuals.
>Every year, the human tribes would offer up one of their virgins as tribute for it.
>Depending on how many of the priesthood they were able to satisfy, a human tribe could be rewarded or punished.
>One year however, after an intense storm from the vast waters, a curiosity arrived.
>A tribe had secured a pale man, from an unknown region, and who spoke an unfamiliar tongue.
>He was taller than the native humans, broader in the shoulders too, and his eyes a startling green.
>According to the tribe, he'd been found upon the beach wearing strange garments.
>And, according to testimony, when asked of his origins, he pointed across the sea from where the sun arose.
>They, of course, did not know if this was true, or if he was a virgin, but the tribe felt it warranted attentions of a higher authority
>The High Priestess, upon learning this, made a note to reward the tribe of humans for their diligence.
>The Pale One was brought to the great city of Centecochitl, where the High Priestess and the grand temple of Xiomara were.
>While he was indeed noticeably larger than a native human, his face was quite youthful in appearance.
>He seemed rather alarmed at the appearance of the Lizardwomen, and would do his best to back away when approached.
>It was understandable for one o be intimidated by those superior to themselves, as Nature intended.
>Most definitely if a human had never met one of the lizard kin before, and arguably one of the most important females.
>With a gesture, the High Priestess ordered the Pale One to be stripped of his garments so he could be examined properly.
>He did struggle and protest, but it was his fault for hiding so much of his body under leathers and fabrics.
>Even his FEET had been covered for some insanty, even the soft-skined tribesmen went barefoot.
>It was quite shocking to see even paler skin upon such a body, hidden away from the scorching sun.
>The Male fussed, and his face turned alarmingly red from embarrassment, a rather strange reaction.
>What kind of backwards civilization of humans taught themselves to be ashamed of their bodies, the very work of the creator?
>And what a body this one had, the pale flesh showcasing his well defined musculature from a life of hard labor.
>Much to the delight of the High Priestess, Xiomara had blessed this male quite generously.
>Oh, the High priestess would most certainly reward the tribe of the Aztecs most generously for this tribute.
>The Pale one was given a loincloth, before being sent along to be prepared for the Fertility Ceremony.
>He was given drink and food, so as to boost his production and endurance.
>Then, a few giggling servants washed him, enjoying his attempts to resist them, truly humans needed to learn hygiene was important.
>Sacred oils and perfumes were massaged into his skin, but no tribal markings were applied, for his people were unknown.
>Finally, he was served with a elixir of frothing chocolate and fermented fruit, to ease any reservations he might have.
>As the sun began to set, the Ceremony began, and music began to flow freely from pipes and drums.
>A night of debauchery was to descend upon Centecochitl, and hopefully Xiomara would bless the wombs of females to bear young.
>The High Priestess was already atop the temple with several members of the priesthood, all females.
>Adorned with talismans and perfumed, the began dancing and reciting prayers to the Goddess of Fertility.
>Even as she hefted an incense burner to the heavens, the High Priestess could see the Pale One at the base.
>A pair of Temple guards, female warriors tried and tested in fierce battles, were bringing him up the steps.
>There was however, a concerning note, as the male was fighting with unusual vigor against their grip.
>They were having to all but drag him
 up the steps of the temple, all 69 of them.
>It was as though he was deathly afraid of whatever lay at the top, a ridiculous notion!
>Then again, the Pale One did hail from across the vast seas, this was possible disorienting and frightening to the lost male.
>Still, his strength might have tested that of a lizardwoman in such a state, but the Temple Guard held him with ease.
>When he was atop the temple, the Pale One looked around wildly, his breath coming in rapid gasps.
>The moment he spotted the alter, he began trying to break free with renewed vigor, a foolish notion.
>Even if he were to miraculously break free of the Temple Guards, more than a score of the priesthood would be upon him.
>The lizard women, even their lowest, were faster and stronger than the human males, and could subdue them, as Nature intended.
>With care, the Pale one was bound to the Alter, the stone smooth as a river rock, and in such manner not to cause harm.
>The Temple guards left him their, drinking his body in with their eyes and licking their lips.
>Many of the females gazed upon the Pale One with wonder, though more than a few were skeptical.
>The High Priestess ignored them, her hands dipping into a bowl of sacred lubricant, coating her palms and fingers in it.
>She approached the Pale One, and began to rub his manhood and scrotum carefully, enticing him to harness.
>While his face bore an expression of immense bewilderment, the blush told the High Priestess that he was indeed a virgin.
>She straddled his hips with ease, trapping his throbbing member between their bellies, and gauging his expression.
>Once she learned his language, she'd ask what silly thing had frightened him so.
>And as the sun disappeared and darkness fell, she rose up and engulfed him in a single, smooth, motion to the hilt.
>his breath seemed to leave him, but oddly, he didn't moan like many of the tribesmen before him had.
>Rather, he grit his teeth, and avoided looking at her altogether. Did he think he could resist pleasure itself?
>The High Priestess smiled, he would submit and give her his essence, as all males would, and as nature intended.
>She began to ride the Pale one at a sedate pace, fast enough to cause a smacking sound, but not hard enough to bruise.
>All the while she gazed down at the male, waiting for when he finally stopped being stubborn and submitted.
>Across the city, musicians played and dancers moved, and lovers embraced in carnal pleasure.
>While the other priestesses had kept their distance at first, a few came forward to look at the Pale One.
>Soon, the sound of music and flesh, along with the scents of perfumes and musk, overcame their reservations.
>They began to lick, nip, suckle, and kiss at his pale skin, savoring this rare and blessed find.
>Some sought to stimulate themselves against his body, while others whispered sweet words of encouragement into his ears.
>Throughout it all, the Pale one resisted as best he could, to not give into what they offered.
>But it would be in vain, the female was superior to the male, as nature intended.
>The Pale One would give the High Priestess his essence, as the Goddesses had intended.
>Finally, as she began to approach her climax, the Pale One stopped fighting, and let loose an adorable moan of pleasure.
>He began to reciprocate, face burning with embarrassment, as the other priestesses crooned at him.
>Then, his limits finally reached and resistance broken, the Pale One climaxed , the male nearly screaming from the pleasure.
>Moments later, the High Priestess reached hers, her folds ruthlessly milking ever drop from him as she sighed.
>For a few seconds, they stared at each other, before the High Priestess removed herself from him.
>His expression of wonderment turned to alarm as he gazed upon his erection, it only having gotten bigger.
>He muttered something in numb horror, even as the next member of the priesthood mounted him.
>In the end, the Pale One had managed to satisfy five more female before passing out, truly remarkable.
>After the sordid fluids had been washed from him, the High Priestess order the Guards to take him to her quarters.
>When the Ceremony had come to a close, she descended the temple to bathe briefly, before heading to her residence in the temple district.
>Upon entering, she found the Pale one lying upon stacked sheets of cotton bedding, stirring slightly.
>He tried to get up, But the High Priestess pulled him back onto the bed, his back against her belly.
>After a moment or two of struggling, he gave up, exhausted from his earlier ordeal, and too comfortable to try.
>Humming gently, the High Priestess smiled at her prize, a gift from Xiomara, and stroked his hair.
>She would see to it the Pale one was educated, teach him the culture of the Lizardkin, their history.
>He would learn to read and write, to do math and learn the patterns of the heavens, and how to care for her home in her absence.
>And she would learn much from him as well, a most importantly, where his tribe was.
>The Lizardkin would build ships to cross the unending sea, and armies of Lizard women would go to the land of the pale ones.
>The lizardkin would subjugate the pale human's tribe, as they had done with the tribe near them, as nature intended.
>And the Lizard women would dominate the males of the Pale tribe, females would always dominate males, as nature intended.
>But for now, she would comfort her glorious little gift, and sing sweet songs till both were sound asleep.

>Remember to get a brave woman who can fight. You don't want to get gangbanged by a bunch of girls just because your girl ran away from the smallest hint of conflict.

>win a ticket to that new female anthros fighting ring
>one got made some time ago and you never bothered to go
>always heard it was pretty lewd with anthro woman fighting naked or in fetish looking

 outfits
>figure it might be fun and you got a free entrance
>go to the place when it opens for the night
>the bouncer/entrance guard is some huge anthro guy and he takes your ticket
>stops you and sniffs at you then asks if you're single or with someone
>you tell him single and he hands you a red arm band and tells you to sit in the red seating area
>that was odd to say the least and you guess it's some anthro thing since this whole thing is an anthros only fighting ring
>walk in and see others with blue arm bands about and getting to their seats
>you keep walking looking for the red seating area and see it's right up front row near the ring
>and it's lower in the ground with some fencing around it separating it from the blue/general seating areas
>sweet, maybe this was a perk for winning that ticket
>look around and notice everyone in the red seating area is a guy, human or anthro
>spotlights flood the ring and a mongoose girl in a rather fetishistic looking outfit walks out with a mic
>starts hyping the crowd up and explaining the rules for newcomers
>announces the first 2 fighters
>one is an all white arctic wolf naked except some blue swirl patterns painted all over her body
>she's also massive and imposing
>she's showing off in the ring with poses to show her muscles and curves before letting out the loudest howl you ever heard and many of the dog/wolf audience joined in with her and some humans even tried to howl too
>guess she's got a lot of fans
>her opponent walks into the ring next
>she's a jaguar in very aztec looking get up, but still mostly naked
>all sorts of colorful feathers hang off strings or bands
>looks like she wants to one up the wolf since she calls a human guy in the red area up to the ring
>he nervously gets in the ring and holy shit does it show how big these woman are
>she pulls a bucket from out of the ring and has the guy dip his hands in it
>when he pulls them out they're red and wet with paint
>she turns and bends slightly forward with her ass pointing at the guy
>telling him to do something
>he hesitates for a bit before he places his hands on her big ass firmly
>the crowd cheers at this and after some time she moves away and she faces him again
>from this angle you can see two bright red human hand prints on her ass
>she then grabs his crotch forcing him on his tip toes before she whispers something in his ear and licks the side of his face
>she makes a line on his forehead with the red paint before letting him go back to his seat
>that "are you single" question you got at the door is starting to make more sense now and you think how you'll be returning to this place again
>wonder if they have any membership thing?
>the announcer comes on telling the 2 to get to their corners
>looks like the first round is starting
>you can feel a rather large change in the atmosphere of the crowd and ring
>everything goes quiet before a bell rings and the 2 charge each other
>and your entire view of this place changes when they start tearing into each other
>fangs and claws flash and sink into each other
>they're not holding back and blood is being drawn
>nothing life threatening, but both are still going at it rather viciously
>you also notice there's no ref at all and some, what you assume are, medics down by a back stage entrance
>the fight goes on for a little longer before both are panting
>the jaguar gets an upper hand and gets the wolf in a choke hold
>the wolf eventually goes limp a bit before the jaguar drops her and the wolf starts taking deep coughing breaths
>the crowd erupts into cheers while the medics wordlessly get into the ring cheeking on the wolf
>she needed a bit of help standing up, but limps out of the ring and back stage on her own
>the jaguar meanwhile hops out of the ring and walks towards the human guy she marked earlier and picks him up and tosses him over her shoulder
>blood still dripping from some cuts
>she walks by and you get a full scale on how much bigger she is
>you also see the guy's face is a mixture of fear
 and excitement
>the red hand prints also still clearly there on her ass and her walk has much more sway to her hips
>she carries him to a different backstage entrance and you don't see either of them after that
>jesus, what have you gotten yourself into this time
>you don't know if you're more terrified or excited for the next match
>the next matches go the same way
>2 big anthro woman come up, some showboating is done, maybe they pick a guy before the match, they have a bloody fight until one can't fight anymore, the winner claims her prize, and there's another empty seat in the red area
>then it gets to the final match and you're slightly exhausted from all the tension and excitement of tonight
>and holy shit did they save up for the finale
>2 fucking titans of woman walk into the ring
>a Kodiak bear and grizzly bear woman are the last match
>the grizzly is wearing some sort of lewd lumberjack get up
>a plaid shirt tied in that bikini fashion to hold her massive tits and jean shorts cut so small they're thongs
>the Kodiak looks more like a prehistoric monster
>naked with bands made of bone on her limbs and wearing a necklace with various skulls on it, including human skulls
>and ashen white streaks over various parts of her monstrous frame
>then she looks over and locks eyes with you
>her gaze makes you freeze and forget to breath
>then your heart skips a beat when she makes a come hither gesture
>on shaky feet you walk to the ring before you're pulled into the air at such speed and height you get momentary vertigo
>you're dangling in the air at head height to her and she looks you over with hungry eyes
>you must be hanging 9-10 feet in the air
>you also get an up close scale on just how colossal she is
>all you get for a warning is a lewd smile and her eyelids lowering before she kisses you with fervor
>given the size difference she covers most of your face

>you're deathly quiet with the realization of what comes next
>she jumps out of the ring and her landing impact shaking you slightly
>she's in front of you and slowly reaching for you

>she's only looking at you as she walks
>and the only word she rumbles out

>human teammate makes a callout over voice
>dead silence for five solid seconds
>"IS THAT A GAMER HUMAN?"

>You had plans for college spring break, plans to go to the beach and find a woman around your age.
>Your boss at Great Outdoors Magazine, had other plans for you in Louisiana, horrible plans
>Namely, pictures of wildlife in the swamp. A job for which you were completely unqualified for.
>All of your work for the magazine normally took place in a climate controlled building doing editing.
>Unfortunately, he'd have none of it, so off you went with cash to cover bare minimum travel expense and lodging.
>Supposedly, you would meet up with a tour guide down there who would take you places.
>Given you had to meet the guy at a certain time, you programmed the GPS in your POSs car.
>An eight hour drive later, you arrived in Louisiana, in some backwater town with a French name.
>It was hot, humid, well and truly away from any beach body women.
>This was only the start of your troubles, as apparently, your tour guide was arrested for possession.
>On top of this, the hotels were booked for a bunch of competitive fishers in town for a contest.
>Those that weren't, were in a pretty sketchy part of town, so you had no choice but to sleep in your car.
>It was miserable, but at least any money you saved would be added to your pay.
>Next morning, you drove down a dirt road to an unused fishing area, nature preserve and all that.
>Humidity Caused your clothing to stick to you, and the bugs swarmed you relentlessly.
>Plenty of swamp to take pictures of, and a moss covered dock stuck out into the water a ways
>Carefully, you marched out, eyeing the wall of green before you, raising the camera you were given.
>It was digital, waterproof, and had a good lens, and all you had to do was get a weeks worth of pictures.
>After a minute of scanning, you managed to spot a dragonfly, gotta start somewhere right.
>A few seconds later, you have a pretty decent set of pictures, perhaps this won't be so bad.
"Hey."
>You jump a little, and spin around, looking for the woman who spoke to you, but nobody's there.
"Down here city boy."
>Looking at the end of the dock, your heart all but leaps into your throat when you spot the gator woman.
>She's resting here elbows on the edge of the dock, staring up at you with unblinking stilted eyes.
>Odds are, she isn't floating so much as standing

 in the water, grinning like the cat catching a canary.
>Heavyset women weren't exactly your thing, but her massive boobs pressed against the end of the pier...
>Your face breaks out in a horrible blush as you avert your gaze, the gator woman chuffing in amusement.
"See somthin' ya like Slick?"
>.WHY IS SHE NAKED!
>A few months back, you'd seen a video on the net involving a Florida Man and a Gator Woman.
>Apparently, Florida Man tried snatching a purse from some mouse woman and sprinting to his getaway car.
>Some gator woman saw this and took great offence, and proceeded to charge the bastard.
>She plowed through a small tree and T-boned the car so hard the side caved in and it slide a few feet.
>This wasn't the end of it, with a grunt she flipped the car onto its side as though it were a toy.
>Then she tore the roof off, hauled the guy out, and gave the lady back her purse.
>It had been funny to watch, but now you were in a very bad spot, having ogled a naked gator woman.
>She didn't seem to mind at all, but you weren't a perv, and definitely didn't want to be considered one.
>To make matters worse, it seemed that her friends had shown up, and they were just as big.
"Oh, who's your friend Gabby?"
"Well now, city boy want a show heh heh."
"Slick alright for a city boy girls," Gabby said, "Though what brings ya to the bayou?"
>If you turn around and start hauling ass, you could get to your car and get out of here.
>>27398921
"Um, my boss sent me to get some pictures of the local wildlife."
>You take a step back. At this, the three chuckle, and shift as though to climb onto the dock.
"Leavin' so soon Slick? Perhaps you'd like to get a few pictures of some 'Wild' women first?"
"I appreciate the offer, but I should probably give you your privacy and all."
>You turn and make it about three steps before slamming to a wall of flesh, sinking into it slightly from momentum.
>Before you can fall down however, a powerful arm pulls you back in, your face buried in soft, sun-warmed scales.
"Now now ladies," the newcomer rumbles, "Did Ma' teach y'all o be nice to gentlemen? Slick here seems decent for city folk."
>with a sinking sensation, you realize that your face is currently imprisoned between a massive set of boobs.
>Most men would kill to be in such a position...odds were you were about to die in it, Not the worst way to go.
>The deep chuckling of voices indicate the rest of them are out of the water now.
>You are pulled out of your plush prison and held at arms length by strong and large gator hands.
>The Gator woman before you stand s 7'6", looks about 420 pounds, and has a scar over one eye.
>There are four more of them, including the ones you've already seen, the newest face wearing a baseball cap.
"So tell me Slick," Scarface rumbles with a giant grin, "What brings ya to this humble slice o' Louisiana?"
>So you tell them why you're out here sweating like mad, and hoping they don;t kill you.
>A few minutes of explaining later, they all seem to be giving you sympathetic looks and nodding in understanding.
"Well, Slick," Scarface says, "Me and the girls have been having a bit of a dry spell here, and we could yous a polite young man like yourself to help us out."
"In return, we help you get some pictures and give ya place to stay, sound like a deal?"
>Normally, you'd have booked it, but five women eager to jump(break) your bones and keeping your job was too good to pass up.
"Good," Scarface says, before snatching your camera, "Yer the more digitally inclined of us 'lizbeth. Snap a few pics will ya?"
>Wait, now? but before you can protest further, Scarface grips your head in a massive hand and draws you in for a kiss.
>Gator snouts weren't designed for kissing, but Scarface isn't deterred, her tongue pouring into your mouth, nearly gagging you.
>Your knees all but buckle as you sag in her grip, her second hand groping your ass and feeling you up.
>Her tongue overwhelms yours, and any attempt to kiss back is met with uncompromising force.
>Finally, she lets you come
 up for air, a thick strand of drool connecting your mouths.
"Name's Jessie," She says, "You'll be screaming it shortly."
>You try to give her yours, but your smothered by a massive breast the size of a basketball.
>Jessie is going to work getting your pants off, and the other girls are rubbing themselves idly as they watch.
>A few seconds later, Jessie has you mostly naked, your pants bunched up around your boots as she brings you in for another kiss.
>Her scaly body feels wonderful against your own, even beneath buttery fat you can feel her muscles shifting like steel cables.
>Your pinned to the ground, Jessie resting her thick thighs on either side of your body, eyeing your junk.
"No half bad for a city boy Slick," She grins.
>She grinds against you, her sheer mass pinning you to the ground, her lower lips slathering more moisture onto you.
>Your body drags against the muddy ground, it and her body pleasantly cool in comparison to the swampy heat you'd been dealing with.
>Finally, she lifts up, lines you up carefully, and hilts you in one go, her insides gripping you like a velvety fist.
>She begins moving a a steady pace, her hips driving you into the ground, hands planted either side of your head.
>Those massive breast sway in hypnotic motions, leaving you open mouthed as you gaze up at them.
"Go on Slick, play with 'em."
>You do, your fingers sinking into them up to the knuckle, occasionally playign with her nipples. She'd gasp occasionally when you did this.
>Her pace picked up, slamming down onto you, you'd definitely be sore after all of this.
>After a minute of this, you were at your limit, panting from heat and exertion.
"I'm gonna..."
"Almost there Slick, hang on."
>A few second later, you climax, you vision blurring from the intensity of it. Jessie follow suite moments later, smashing down on you.
>She lay atop you, her passage milking you dry all while letting otu a bone-shaking rumble, rattling your brains even further.
>Panting, her full weight presses on you for a moment, driving the air from your lungs, before she rolled over with you in tow.
>After the both of you recovered, Jessie helped you get dressed before telling Brenda(ball-cap) to get you to the house.
>Brenda had to lay the front seat back most the way so she could lean over it from the back seat. She was nice, and apparently a mechanic.
>Half an hour of navigating twisting back roads later, you arrived at their house, a waterside affair with a monstrous truck parked out front.
>Jessie, Gabby, Elizabeth, and Mary were waiting for the two of you, apparently swimming through the swamp was far faster than taking the road.
>Gabby helped you settle in, before pulling you aside entirely for a bit of fun of her own. By the time you could stand it was lunch.
>Mary was one hell of a cook, her food was far better than anything you;d had on they way out here, or nuked in the microwave.
>A short siesta later, and Gabby took you into the swamp to take some pictures. You rode on her back, the tough scales a stark contrast to those on her belly.
>She could get into places no boat could hope to, and she was a lot quieter, pointing out various creatures for you to shoot.
>By the time you got back, Mary had some of her mother's secret Gumbo recipe ready, and insisted on putting meat on your bones.
>After helping her with the dishes, Mary decided to reward you a little, and carried your spent body to bed with her like a teddy.
>The next four days would go in a similar manner, and you found yourself enjoying it immensely.
>Sure, there were a few mishaps along the way, like Elizabeth knocking you over with a playful tail-slap to the back of your legs and leaving a light bruise.
>Then there was the time Mary about smothered you with one of her enormous tits, in her sleep, and her response to your struggles was to pull you closer.
>You joined them for a game of football in a field, your smaller size and agility allowing you to slip past the other players a few times.
>Jessie then tackled you and death-rolled across half the field however, scrambling your brains and nearly dislocating your shoulder in the process.
>Brenda insisted on going over your car to make sure everything was working properly. You got to help fix the car and service her.
>Gabby left a few claw marks on you back after a particularly intense bout of lovemaking, but thankfully nothing requiring stitches.
>Wrestling was a constant pastime, and the girls found your resistance e to be adorable.
>Been cuddled was mandatory, as was being the smaller spoon, but that wasn't so bad.
>You even went to see a mud-wrestling match between Jessie and some Burmese snake lady. It had been a close thing, but Jessie won.
>The food was amazing, you got plenty of great pictures(some for keeping in the memory book), and the sex was awesome.
>Still, you went to bed aching, sore, and looking forward to doing it all again in the morning.
>All good things come to an end however, and on day five you began packing up and saying goodbye to the wonderful women you had met.
>Elizabeth had helped you sort the pictures(work related from NSFW) the night before, and promised to keep in touch via email.
>You let her upload a few copies of pictures of the six of you, and then the girls gave you a group hug that threatened to snap your spine.
"Ya' come back soon now ya hear."
>You promised to visit when you got time off or headed out this way, and began the long drive home.
>Upon arriving back at your apartment, you staggered inside, walked to your bed, and face-planted on it, relieved to be back.
>It was a little disappointing when you weren't grabbed by scaly hands and pulled up against a larger woman.
>Still, you had work in the morning, and, come to think of it, you never did get to take that vacation of yours.
>You'd put in for a week in the fall, and head back over

 to the girls then, once you made sure you could pull it off.
>And you still had most of the travel expense money, the Boss wouldn't notice most of it missing, he wasn't the brightest bulb in the building.
>Everything turned out wonderfully, much better than you;d imagined. You couldn't wait to go back though, but you'd survive until then...somehow.

>your part of a military project
>nothing special or important, more or less doing small labors
>you aren't that big or well built so that probably had most to do with it
>apparently the lab boys were doing something for the bigwigs
>some time passes and you guess it was a success given all the commotion going on
>though over the week keep seeing more people being carried out of a room injured
>next thing you know you're being grabbed by some scientists and higher rank military types and being briefed
>turns out they made super soldiers using animal DNA
>spotted hyena specifically
>females ones given in nature female spotted hyenas are bigger, stronger, and more aggressive than the males
>they keep piling papers and orders on you and trying to tell you how they need a handler and how they seemed to keep rejection the ones they keep sending in
>now they're just trying different types to see what might work and also an injuries are covered by your insurance
>barely any time to think before you get thrown into some observation cell
>you finally see the "super soldiers"
>3 massive amazon bestial hyena woman
>they also look pissed given how all week they had to deal with people coming in trying order them around
>you're not trained for this and just back against the wall and close your eyes hoping they won't hurt you too bad
>but nothing ever happens
>you open your eyes to see you're boxed by them and they're calmer and just sniffing different parts of you
>guess with you being quiet and small got them less aggressive and more curious
>it finally hits you that they're naked when their larger dark nipples are right in your face
>also can't help check them out and how ridiculously endowed they all were
>can't hold the fear boner back
>they seems to egg them on since they start that hyena whooping noise and getting grabby
>and then starts the the nipping, licking, and groping
>meanwhile the scientists watched on confused
>"does this count as a success?"

>"All human men listening, I want to talk to you about something. As you know anthros enjoy the idea of engaging in sex with you, so I'm sure you avoid being alone with species that you might think of as 'dangerous', like crocodiles, sharks, lions, or other carnivores. I want to tell you that you're avoiding the wrong species."
>"Now, I'm not saying you should let a hyena drive you home from the bar because she seemed nice. What I'm saying is you are ignoring some of the most dangerous animals. What animal is that? Rabbits."
>"I'm absolutely serious. Rabbits might seem sweet and fluffy, but they are fast enough to chase you down, have kicks, and can hear just where you're hiding. But that isn't what makes them dangerous; what makes them dangerous is that they see you as a necessity."
>"Humans are the best sexual partners with their endurance and size, and rabbits have insane sex drives. Nymphomaniacs who regularly have to deal with subpar partners. Those who can't have sex with a human have to deal with the torturous itch that cannot be handled by anyone else unless they can get a lot of males to agree to a one female orgy."
>"Other anthros see human men as an amazing luxury. Rabbits see them as medicine that can cure their disease. The former would love to have it. The latter feels that she cannot live without it. Rabbits won't just give up on you when they think they've lost you. They will regularly go to your house, learn your daily routine, and find an opening. Some individuals of other species may do this, but this trait is held by almost every rabbit."
>"So buy cameras. Lock your doors. And if a rabbit sees you, don't assume you're in the clear just because she went
 back to whatever she was doing. It's safer to assume you've already been targeted by her. The cute ones are the most dangerous, because they are the ones who are most desperate."
>"This has been an paid for by the Man Protection Foundation, keep our human men pure."

>hello of yes please to let hyena drive you home from bar
>she is very nice and probably just beings good new friend of you
>hyenas are good and nice anthros, please to do what they say haha

>humans are too naive and trusting around anthros
>this leads to them being taken advantage of by some many trying to protect only to end up taking advantage of them anyways
>using their human's lack of knowledge of their biology or culture to do lewd things to the poor little humans
>using to lick them, bite them, sniff them, rub their scent all over them, etc
>getting them to rub their smooth clawless little hands over their fur/feathers/scales/etc

>"Anon, don't you know dogs greet each other by smelling butts? I've got a bad sense of smell though, so I need to really get in there."
>"Licking is normal with us dogs, just take off that shirt."
>"H-humping is just a game, Anon! Just let me have my fun!"

>"I Gotta keep that bitch from taking advantage of the cute human and drive him home myself!"
>"Can't remember his home? Looks like my house."
>"Yeah, take your shirt off, kind of hot in here, right?"
>"Well, I am fluffy enough for a pillow."
>"H-his pants might also be making him really warm."
>"He wouldn't mind a sniff, right?"
>"He's out cold, he doesn't have to know that you touched yourself to smelling him."
>"You helped him a lot, he kinda o-owes you for helping him. He'd agree to one night, right?"

>taking advantage of humans in the dark since they can't see
>having humans being completely helpless once you get them in deep water
>hiding some blankets/clothes/sleeping bags/etc in colder areas so they're forced to cuddle with furred anthros for warmth

>"Hey baby, where ya goin'?"
>"C'mon, don't be like. Give us a smile!"
>"Don't worry we just wanna talk?"
>"How's it goin', sugardick?"
>"Hmmm...I hate to see you go, but I love to watch you walk away!"
This is just the tip of the ice burg of what human men have to hear just walking outside. Disgusting.

>Being raped by an anthro is a wonderful and totally normal experience for a human male. Even more when she leaves her special "gift" in the entrance of your house after 9 months.

>All the anthros would probably be interested in you after that.
>"Some mean bitch left you like that? I wouldn't leave you."
>"Maybe your kid would like a mother too?
>"Must be hard, taking care of someone alone."
>Can you handle being a dilf?

>Anthro society teaches humans that their bodies exist for anthro pleasure
>Anthros are taught that humans crave their touch, but are simply too shy to ask
>Humans are required by law to not have locks on their doors

>"And here we have the native jungle cat's marriage ritual."
>"Every year, they go out to capture humans in neighboring villages. After the capture, each cat must choose a human, with the highest ranking females choosing first."

>turn off the heater while it's cold outside
>hide all his coats and blankets
>keep showing off how warm and fluffy your fur is
>just gotta wait for the cold to break him down and he just throws himself at you get some warmth
>anything you do after doesn't count as rape since he choose to cling to you
>"It is customary for the chief or a great warrior to choose the fastest, most clever of men, as any less would be considered an embarrassment to their position. Those who have an easy chase may be shamed by their fellow tribeswomen if others feel she picked a man for an easy catch. Any man who manages to escape his pursuer are considered prime catches, and any single hunter who bests them will earn great respect."
>"As you can see, one of the guards to the chief is drooling in anticipation as she is steadily gaining on her picked target, a man who apparently managed to run quite the distance until he accidentally stumbled into a trap, ironically placed by one of his fellow villagers hoping for game. If the guard manages to catch him, she can expect a husband who will last for hours in the bedroom, and children who will surely be able to succeed in their own mating ceremony with a fast man."

>What if you were a captured human spy in anthro territory and got interrogated by a wasp girl?

>She ties you up and stings you with her stinger that has some sort of afrodesiac in her venom that acts like viagra. She interrogates you with sexual bondage edging you to the point of climaxing but never letting you cum pouring different types of sweets on your dick and using her elongated tongue wrapping it around your penis lapping up whatever she poured on tormenting you until you give up the rebel locations.

>"So you refuse to tell me where the others are?"
>You scowl up at the wasp
>"I told you, I don't know. And if I did, I'd never tell you."
>The wasp bends down to take a good look at your face
>Apparently finding nothing, she buzzes in frustration
>"Why do you fight us?"
>"Why are you kidnapping humans?"
>"Why?"
>She seems to take a moment to consider something
>Then she puts a hand onto your head
>"I find human hair to feel quite nice. It comes in some pretty nice colors, and even different textures."
>Her hand moves down to your cheek
>"But you still have skin not covered by fur. Soft. Somewhat smooth."
>She softly pokes at your cheek
>"Your face is so malleable. I just want to see how I can change it. Such a cute smushable face. And..."
>A few of her fingers move into your mouth for a split second, dragging across your tongue and pulling out before you can react
>She considers her fingers, rubbing your stolen saliva around
>She then sends her tongue along her finger, licking the spit up
>"You taste nice. It's... sweet? There's a rumor going around that your kind's spit is addicting, especially for insects."
>"W-what? What are you saying?"
>"You asked why I'm kidnapping humans, and these are the reasons why."
>"What about the others though!"
>"Oh, there are so many different reasons. The dogs have a weird cult around you, something about being morally obligated to return some favor by becoming your partners. The cats think you have the perfect penises, and are somewhat desperate for them. The reptiles think you make great bed-warmers."
>"That's why? You came after us for that? You made us fight for that?"
>"You made yourselves fight. There wouldn't be any fighting if you just came quietly. So, are you going to tell us where the others are?"
>You say nothing
>"Come on, my friend Milla has been complaining about not getting anyone. She's been boring me to death with stories from her religion. I don't care how the humans and dogs grew up together! Could you just give her a cuddle buddy? You'd probably think of her as a big fluffy pillow."
>"..."
>"Ugh, you're really serious about this? Fuck."
>She shakes her head, and begins walking to the door
>"So you've given up? What happens now"
>She stops, and turns to look at you
>"Oh, it's already been decided. You're going to be mine."
>"And... what will you do with me?"
>She takes her hand off the door knob, and starts walking back
>She bends down, her face really close to yours
>"I've got a sweet tooth, so I'll be taking your... fluids quite regularly. I'm a bit of a connoisseur, and as I've told you, I've heard good things. Maybe you noticed the foods you were given?"
>You feel your cheeks flush as you think back to it
>You had wondered why your had so many fruits and sweet things
>"Hmm, that's right. I've been wondering for a while what human honey is like. I'm sure it will be quite the experience for the both of us."
>She gives you a quick peck on the cheek, making you flinch
>"Hehe, I won't hurt you. But you can expect a lot more where that came from."
>She moved back to the door, opened it, and gave you a smile
>"Oh, and just so you know, if I don't get details on the other humans, I won't get my bonus. If you don't tell me, I'll have to wring that honey out of you. Of course, if you ask, I'd be more than happy to do it anyway. See you soon, sweetie."
>And you are left alone to think about your fate

Which do you prefer?
>The anthros are naturally dominant, looking for some meek humie to submit to them
>The anthros have a social response to the personality of the person they're around. Acting shy or nervous will make them subconsciously more dominant
>The domination comes from a loving relationship after the humie confides his feelings and asks the anthro to take the lead

>A world where humans are a rare species
>Humans are naturally weaker than most other species and probably can't survive on their own
>thus need the protection of stronger anthros

>Get nervous around the tall anthro girl who's taken a liking to you
>She thinks your shyness is cute and teases you about it
>It serves to make you more nervous and sets her on the slippery slope to being more controlling and dominant

>"Hey, human. You're looking pretty out of it from those drinks."
>"It's dangerous for a small thing like you to walk around at this time of night. Being drunk will just make you a great target."
>"Come on, I know a good place you can stay. Don't worry about money, I have plenty."
>"No, really, your presence is payment enough. And I've got a feeling I'm going to be seeing a lot of you after this. I'm feeling like tonight will be a good night."

>A few days later, it happened
>A massive ring had spread across the circumference of our earth
>A gateway
>It was something theorized by the man who had first made the machine, but he thought such a large gateway would cause more problems than it would be worth
>The anthros had returned, this time from a world that is almost as advanced as ours
>Living proof of humans had pushed them to return
>They all want a piece of us
>Some because of their religious belief
>Some who find the idea of a world with many males tempting
>Some to put us in our place and to spite those who might think themselves as our protectors
>In the end they all want the men of humanity gasping and whimpering in ecstasy underneath them

Humans are the last species that can produce males, female anthros are forced to depend on their sperm to conceive newborns. Thus, male humans are regarded as a resource anthros would have to fight for to mantain their population. However, there's another huge problem:
>Predator anthros can only give birth to female offsprings of their species
>Prey anthros can procreate females from their species and also male humans
Predator anthros will have to basically depredate male humans to subsist or face extinction, while Prey anthros are a match made in heaven for humankin which whom to prefer to coexist.
Due to the danger of being kidnapped by other anthros, males had to abandon leading roles and embrace more submissive ones such as taking care of the youngs, cooking and acting like healers for their wives. That mindset gradually sank into humans as anthros started to treat them like slaves, predator anthros being the worst offenders and openly deeming them like mindless cattle to rape & dominate. Any human who was overly attached to predator anthro eventually got their genes erased from the genepool, causing the remaining males to be afraid of predator anthros but still getting aroused by being turned into a breeding slave.
There's a sense of urgency among prey anthros with their few males, if they don't breed enough children then their tribes may began to reduce in numbers. As a consequence, young males are forced to choose a wife as soon as they experience their spermache, these toyboys are paired with anthros of their same age or MILF to be mounted and milked dry in front of the tribe for their first time.
Predator anthros, attracted by the odor of virgins copulating, will soon began to raid prey settlement and abduct any fertile male they see regardless of their age. They don't bother to love them back, these poor souls are ravished for hours till they are broken. Those who are too juvenile to ejaculate are send to their shamans to be turned into future sub studs.

“Wait, are all anthro females taller than humans?” One Anon said.
In a few words, yes. Males are just too valuable to be send like expendable warriors, having one on the field should be by itself a showoff of power from a clan. It's like putting your King on the center of the table, the foes would just prioritize their capture.
As you should've guess, Predator anthros are physically (Lioness & Gators) and intellectually (Owls and Dolphin) superior than men. They were bornt to conquer and snatch males out of Prey anthro's
arms who have to defend their husbands to death or resign and watch the gang of Predator anthros molest their dear husband before they drag them into their camp. Not the prettiest sigh, some Prey anthros even offer themselve as slaves just to be with their husbands even thought that condems them into a life of misery... Predator anthros won't stop at anything to quench their need to "devour" males.
However, the calm comes after the storm. With the predator anthros are pregnant and occupied nurturing their children into ideal rapist and warriors, Prey anthros can once resurge and reestablish their routines, the surviving males would've to take care of more Prey wombs and pump more descedants into them. They can't afford time to deal with hesitating males, they either cum or are drugged to cum; the point is that they compensate the lost members quickly before another wave of Predator anthros comes back to harass the males.


>Your busty Zebra milf mistress had popped your cherry and you didn't last long before came hard on her while her moans encouraged you to keep thrusting her plumpy exotic rear and go for another cumshot.
>You had no option, but to obey your body. The Shaman had drugged you with aphrodisiacs previously after you were brought to her tent, anthro mother telling her you had stained your bed sheets with your first load of sperm
>You were too horny, a feeling you had never experience before and was driving your mind crazy with the only desire to mate with the winking pussy of your new goddess.
>Slamming your hips once again, you let your tamed male impulses take over and burst another hot load of your seed inside her moisty tight insides. Her inner walls never stopped massaging every inch of your cock, forcing you to spill a couple of shy ropes of semen into her as a reward.
>You fell asleep, smothered by her breasts and with your member still sheathed deepballs in your mistress' equine cunt.
>...
>Months passed, your wife was pregnant and proudly sported her belly carrying your future daughter or, with luck, son around the village.
>The harvest of berries this year seemed promising, the male farmers were coming back to the tribe with bask filled with food for months... and you were about to be paired with another female in the next week
>You shivered at the idea of another MILF zebra mounting you, these females were going to break your dick if they continued to breed you like that.
>However, your thoughts are interrupted and the bell's ring echoed across the huts and tents of the village
>Predator anthros on the horizont, you were guided inside the main hut and put you along side others under the care of the most buffed Zebras on the village
>You prayed to the gods they didn't choose you...

>Your Zebra warrior wife got overwhelmed by the Kobold whippersnappers, you desperately beg them to spare your wife and claim you'll do *anything* to save the anthro who sought to protect you.
>The Kobold Leader smirked at youand mumbled to her comrades, one of the puny lizards chirped and took out from her pouch a rope before coming toward your direction.
>Huts were scorching, the crops were being tramped and spoiled as more Kobolds marched with their relentless forces through the village, but for you it was nothing.
>All that mattered to you was lying beneath their scaly feet, the Kobold hurled herself at you and easily tied you up... a classy burlington bowline on your wristles and ankles, you put pressure into the binds and confirmed how firm and well-done the knots were.
>She had to be their trappist specialist, the one who was assigned to reduced males into ragdoll bags for the bulky raiders to carry
>Though, this time their intentions were different. You could see it on them, they were craving for you and, despite the odor of Zebras on your genitals, you were still a fertile male for them.
>Dragging you into one of the abandoned huts whilst one looked around for any snooper that'd ruin their fun, the Kobolds threw you against a pile of hay and closed the door with the lookout covering their affaird
>The Leader was the first one to join and crawl over your body, her snout burying into your chest and taking a deep breath of your masculinity.
>"Wimps moan better." Her sultry voice toyed with your ears, you were about to get violated... You shivered, it was part of the deal, to be their rape toy for tonight.
>Her legs were accomodating between your thighs, her body hogging your warm away and her eyes dominating your attention...
>You tried to resist, but then the reminder caught you cold: the reason why were you doing this.
>"Come on, give in." She said "Don't make me regret this."

Personally, I like a 'New World' scenario, wherein humans are settlers in a new land. It would go down much like our history, only the tribal anthros were simply too strong for the colonial humans and end up enslaving them and acquiring their technology, before invading the Old World. Humans are desired because of anthro mating rituals- it's usually a power struggle between the male and females. Humans are weaker and even capable of acting submissive, and as such they're often taken as pleasure slaves/concubines.
To foster a sense of justice in the scenario, you can say that humans were the aggressors. They tried to roll out the genocide before getting 2koma'd, and from then on humans had the reputation of being either evil creatures that needed to be taught a lesson, or poor lost beings that need outside help to survive themselves.
Also, I'm not particularly a fan of including human females without anthro males; the NTR aspect of it bothers me.
Then will just say the female anthros’ male and human female went extinct and human males are lost and scared in the unknown world and female anthros discovers that human males have the ability to give birth to any species. Human males tries to resent this but the female anthros

 give then no choice. And thus, the war for human males for their tribes have begun.

The match has started
>The female anthros started going after each tribe’s species
>The hyenas already kill one of the kobold’s tribe by piercing a sword through her throat causing her to cough
>One of the rat tribes manages to get on a chariot, that is carried by big strong mares with massive stamina, and used a rope to lasso a Zebra warrior causing her to crack her neck due to hard yank of the rope which is nothing but a lifeless body and using it to make the other tribes trip over and lose their guard
>It may be gruesome and horrifying for those who are witnessing, but to these gladiator fans, it’s a showcase of entertainment
>Oddly enough, the human boys are entertained, but they are busy talking to each other and discuss which warrior tribe makes the best ‘love making’ and get aroused by a angry lioness girl roaring as she recently chopped a tribe’s head with a axe

>The arena remains ongoing as it was
>Human boys are talking, eating fruits, and even sometimes making each other out just to keep the audience entertained in case the same violence got them bored which leads some distractions for some fighters as one Cheetah was distracted by two human boys kissing each other, she was struck down by a heavy malice on her head, putting her out of commission
>The fight continues on and many fighters were ‘out’
>The two rat ladies remained on the chariot as they tried to lasso one of the fighters only to get stopped by a big buff female gator that manages to grab the two rats by their heads with her palms that are twice the size if their heads
>”Hahahaha!!! Don’t think you plague creatures got shit chances on these lovely human boys!” She laughed, “They need a female animal that can crush skulls... like this!!”
>The green gator did as she told as red liquid starts oozing out of her palms
>On the other side of the arena, a giraffe lady is getting her long neck bent backwards by a hyena girl with long spikey hair
>Meanwhile, one human boy yawned at the sight of it, “Yawn... all these ladies all barely got my attention. Some of these kills I seen before and many other times.”
>”That Zebra girl got my interests,” says another human boy, “but she’s already gone, so...”
>”ATTENTION! WE ARE DOWN TO THE LAST TWO FIGHTERS” the announcer shouted.
>Everyone cheered and see the last two remaining fighters
>The big buff, yet decently busty, green gator lady and a small yet, really tough Hyena girl with a long spikey hair

>Why do you always feel like you're being watched? Maybe you shouldn't live alone near that big swamp.
>Sometimes you hear noises at night. Distant twigs snapping, rustling brush and dripping water.
>Sometimes, you hear something scratching on the walls. For a time you were terrified, thinking you might have schizophrenia. Only, you don't hear these noises anywhere else.
>When you turn the lights on and look out the windows, you never see anything and the noises stop. Your frightened curiosity got the better of you today.
>You heard that telltale shudder of leaves, and almost convinced yourself it was the wind until something shifted- it was as though the subtlest shift in air pressure occurred. Normally, you'd frightfully flick on the lights and check your entrances. This time, however, you did not.
>Tenderly and gingerly you slid out of bed. The only sounds were your heart and breath. You listened and watched, worried and waited. Nothing.
>You ventured to the living room in its dark glory. Your footfalls were soft and silent. No movement at all, save your own.
>You approached the backdoor, trying to make sense of shapes in the dim moonlight. However... something was wrong. The sound of your breath carried strangely.
>You held your breath for a moment, and felt a shiver go up your spine when you realized that you could still hear breathing.
>At that moment, the shape became apparent to you. A crocodile girl, looming just outside the door. She had been watching you the entire time.
>You stood stock still in absolute terror, thanking the heavens that you always locked it.
>Only... your eyes traced the shape of the door as the softest of breezes crested your legs.
>The door was already open

>Shyness is its own endearing trait.
>Humans are just feeble, weak things that need help to feel okay. They know that you're a sweet and precious thing the moment you fail to meet their gaze. How can you willingly hurt someone if you're too afraid to talk to strangers?
>Besides, something about shyness triggers a part of the anthro brain. It's a genetic trigger from their creation: a hard-coded motive to protect. Why is this poor human so afraid? Did someone hurt them? They'll be polite, and give you space if you ask. However, expect to be teased often. A flashed smile here, a hand on your shoulder there. You're so gods-damned huggable, aren't you? They're always thinking about what you'll look like when your face lights up with joy.
>Watching a shy human unravel and open up is one of the most pleasing things an anthro can experience. To secure your trust and listen to you spill your heart, or to secure your body and gently make you spill your seed. Either way, they crave the feeling of holding your shaking form and making you realize how much you need them. They want to feel needed. They want you to desire them.
>And, when they're through with you, you will.

>Be Anon living in a town with his anthro GF
>Living your daily life in peace, going to work etc
>Until something weird happens
>Seems like whole world just stopped
>Birds stopped mid air and everything went silent
>You loose your shit and run everywhere to check what happened
>Until everything goes black
>You wake up in some kind of pod with electronics and fluids hooked on to you (Like Matrix but without gel)
>And then you meet your abductors
>8ft tall Snake girls/nagas (personally would go for viper gals)
>After a shock and loosing your consciousness you wake up on another planet
>Nagas everywhere.webm
>You stand with other abducted humans during inspection
>Ask them how the fuck we came here
>They said that they had huge debt and to repay it, they'll have to work as a "slave" on captors planet
>This wouldn't be strange if one of them had that happened, but they ALL have the exact same story.

>"Anon, I am your new wife as appointed by our governments for the sake of improving relations between our species."
>"Stop complaining. We've given your people a certain degree of independence for this. We could have enslaved you, but we're nice like that."
>"No, we didn't agree to the cease fire because we were worried about the death toll, at least not ours. Let me explain why we attacked your planet.
>Have you ever seen a cute animal? Something small and weak, and you just know that without any help it would die in the wild? We were worried that other worse races would take you and enslave you, so we did what we had to. We took you first. The only reason why we threatened violence is because you wouldn't allow it otherwise. It was for your own good."
>"You wouldn't have liked it if the others got their hands on you, and trust me, they were watching. Many would have not given you any rights and made you a priceless commodity. They would have stolen your men away and made special brothels to please many of their women. Some might choke you, bite you, hit you marring that cute face. Under our rule you'll only have to deal with one of us, and we've made laws to ensure you won't get hurt. And all you have to do to repay us is helping us deal with this hunger."
>"I didn't say you had a choice in the matter. I've been looking forward to this for quite awhile, and I'm afraid I can't help myself. But don't worry, I won't hurt you even if you struggle, it just reminds me of how fragile you are. I'm the best option you have."

>during your travels you get stuck/held up in an anthro village
>there's some sort of festival going on
>turns out it's a fertility one
>anthros running around in barely any coverings and some just forgo clothes completely and are just naked aside from jewelry/trinkets and/or some painted on patterns
>all the food and drink being served is food that's supposed to help stamina, hydration, fertility, libido, aphrodisiacs, etc
>you're probably the only person in the whole village wearing a full set of clothing
>getting a lot of stares and attention wherever you walk
>feels like you're going to have a panic attack with so many eyes on you and they aren't even being the slightest bit hostile
>even worse for your poor nerves is public sex seems the norm for this festival too
>some at least keep the sex inside, but are still in full view of windows or open doorways
>you manage to find an inn after working up the courage to ask a random wolf guy for directions
>not used to anthro greetings which is pretty much getting sniffed a lot and then a lick to the face
>got even more awkward when some fox female came and started groping him mid conversation while trying to coil your legs/waist with her tail
>able to slip away while stammering thanks before it got too heated and you were as red as the vixen's fur
>fuck, she even pouted when you walked very fast(ran away) to the inn that she wasn't going to get a human and wolf at the same time
>oh man, you are not prepared for a whole anthro village to have a party where they all are in heat or whatever
>you're just an average university student of a low noble family with a bit of bad luck
>finally make it inside the inn, but think it somewhat odd
>it's only one story high, but has a very very large room with a sunken in middle full of pillows and blankets with some low tables around the outer sides of the pit
>and the open lewdness and debauchery is going on here too
>the biggest bear anthro you've ever seen greets you
>she's a massive snow white

 bear completely naked with red painted on patterns that draw attention to and highlight her intimate parts
>wait, why is she walking towards you?
>oh gods!
>she grabs you in a literal bear hug
>your world is now warm white softness
>you completely disappear in her huge cleavage, thick fur, soft belly, and behind her massive arms for the duration of the hug
>when she finishes and sets you down the air feels slightly less warm now
>get out that you'd like to room in the inn and get a meal
>she gives you an odd look when you mention rooms and tells you everyone just sleeps in the large communal bedded pit that takes up most of the large room in the inn
>well, so much for hiding out in a room from awkward shyness and embarrassment
>the bear guides you to a free low table saying she'll bring some food real quick and chastises that you need to eat more with how small you are
>small insecurities about your stature well up some which is made worse by how all the anthros seem bigger than humans
>get snapped out of it when she brings a large portion of cooked meat slathered in honey to your table
>she quickly lectures you on needing to put on some weight while walking away to handle other orders
>at least it looks and smell delicious, but she gave you no utensils to cut and eat with
>look around and notice the other patrons eating there are just tearing off chunks of food with their claws
>oh right, anthros don't really need knives and forks with their claws and all, dammit
>tearing apart the large cut of meat proves harder than you thought and the honey glazing makes it so you can't get a good grip and just gets your hands covered in honey
>end up frustrated while licking your hands before a large she-wolf wordlessly sat next to you and started tearing the meat into small chunks with her claws
>she just smiles and cleans her hands when done while pushing the plate back to you
>thank her and pick up a piece of meat and nearly drop it when you feel her legs and paws rubbing against your legs
>barely finish the piece you had in your mouth when a large furry body sits flush behind you and you feel big breasts press into your back and large clawed hands on your shoulder
>slowly look back to see a big cougar female now looming over and against you
>she just tells you to eat and you have no choice, but to follow her order
>slowly eat while the cougar begins to knead with her hands and a deep purr starts up
>can feel the pinpricks of her claws through your clothes and then she starts licking your hair
>seems she thought you needed grooming
>at least grooming others seems a common thing among anthros when you look around to see other anthros in grooming sessions
>it really isn't that all unpleasant feeling, but all this female attention is new and has your nerves on edge
>not to mention the she-wolf is still next to you and now has hers legs wrapped with yours

Do you think anthros probably look down on human women? That maybe anthros always like to make fun or belittle human women for stuff like not being strong enough to protect and take care of their male counterparts?

I do find the idea of losing to be enticing. Imagine it taking effect in your blood, doing everything you can to keep fighting. The recurring thought of "I need to fight, I need to resist," melting away under the touching that you continue to let happen. None of it is forceful. No, if you could resist, you'd have been grabbed by a Lictor instead. You know it's wrong, you know it's bad, but you just... can't. Why fight? They never had any intention of hurting you. Don't you just want to feel loved?
The hive mind watches your internal battle with great joy. Not even your thoughts are safe; the Shadow in the Warp hears everything. It makes your eventual submission all the more savory. It cherishes putting thoughts into your head, and whispering its desires to you. "You don't like fighting. You want to be touched. You need us."
The thing about Tyranids that was never told to you is just how efficient they are. Physically, mentally, emotionally... They see your weaknesses, and will exploit them. It was over the moment they saw you.

>You get ordered on patrol in the jungle sector of some backwater world.
>High Command insist something is going on, but nothing was obvious.
>You're on patrol, alone because spreading men out covers more ground.
>You're gonna die a horrible death, you can feel it in your bones.
>You have the constant sensation of being watched by...something.
>Rapidly spinning around reveals nothing, just your rampant paranoia.
>For the past hour or two, you've really begun to notice the quiet.
>All the wildlife is silent for some reason, birds and insects have all gone quiet.
>Thirty minutes ago, you began hearing a very odd noise, a slicking sound.
>Its always behind you, and always stops when you turn around.
>There's also an odd odor, fairly pleasant for some reason.
>Wih a blur of motion, you level you lasgun at some bushes right behind you.
>Nothing, except for your won breathing.
>With a grunt, you lower your weapon and march off, muttering to yourself.
"What the frak is that noise."
>not even four meters from the guardsman, the lictor resumed he motions.
>At 2.4 meters tall and weighing several hundred pounds, she looms over her mark.
>Camoline chitin renders her invisible, her bio-engineered perfection rendering her gait silent.
>There is however, a growing excitement, at the idea of being caught, of being spotted.
>Flesh hooks twitch, desiring to snag the male and drag him into her embrace.
>He wouldn't have enough time to scream before her limbs gripped him tightly.
>She'd suck the information from his brain, melting all thoughts of resistance.
>Her sensory organs picked up the male's pungent odor, causing both sets of lips to drool
>No, no yet...but soon.
>Day 5 of scouting deployment.
>Guardsmen are starting to go missing without explanation or warning.
>Nobody is going out on solo patrols, despite high command's instance that nothing out here can really hurt us.
>That much is true of the native creatures, but whatever is stalking us is not native.
>Jenkins got snatched yesterday, all they found was his lasgun lying on the ground and some blood.
>I mean, enough to be noticed on close inspection, but it wasn't a serious injury.
>Garret went mad this morning, he was a little on edge since the start, but not like this.
>The only warning was a high pitched wheeze...and then he just started shooting full auto into the brush.
>He kept saying something about a "giant white bug, and Not taking him.
>Whatever he saw, it never took him, Lt. Emila shot him in the head rather than talk him down, the bitch.
>None of us liked it, the highborn was always a pain in the ass, but this was just murder.
>I feel sorry for her now though, whatever was stalking Garret didn't like what she did either.
>It took her at sundown, and it wasn't quiet about it either...but nobody saw it happen.
>One moment, Lt. Bitch ison the edge of the clearing, next she's being dragged through the undergrowth, screaming.
>It threw her around a bunch, took one of her eyes out if her screaming was any indication.
>This went on for about a minute, enough for her screaming to turn into horrified sobbing.
>Then there was the discharge of a laspistol, silence for a moment, then a lot of wet tearing noises.
>Damned Commissar ordered us forward to investigate, So we did.
>Lt. was painted across a small clearing, her guts hanging from the trees like streamers, her head placed on a rock.
>Her brains were blown out with a lasbolt.
>High command says
 nothing out here but animals, but this was no animal.
>Animals don't kill you with your own gun, nor do they just splatter you across the ground.
>What in the name of the Emperor is watching us?
>Day six of training deployment
>Commissar is taking a group of us to hunt down the deserters, completely ignoring none of them ever actually deserted.
>Jungle is hellish, wildlife out this way leans toward more dangerous, but definitely nowhere near as bad as chatachan
>place still sucks, but tis the life of a guardsman. At least you're far from the ramblings of General Powerstache
>Guy had his head on mostly straight, but talked constantly of grand campaigns and heroic charges.
>Commissar is being a bigger pain than usual, ordering about the squad to track down the poor blokes who got nabbed.
>Jenkins was the next to go,but he wasn't exactly taken. All week he had this odd little smile, like he knew something.
>Then he just walked off, claiming that "What's coming is inevitable, so why fight it?" And walked in.
>He was one for three seconds before the Commissar got around and fired off a pair of bolts.
>He gave orders to retrieve the equipment, but the five men who went in found nothing.
>The Commissar never misses, even in thick smoke thanks to that augmentic eye of his.
>Something nabbed Jenkins without making a sound and dodged a pair of bolt rounds in a matter of seconds.
>By the emperor, whatever is out here, whatever is hunting us, is...
"Guardsman, cease scribbling and get moving."
>You stare up at the Commissar, before stowing your journal and rising.
>Apparently, someone had found a trail of boot prints matching Jenkins leading through the jungle.
>Your clothing and flack armor constantly feels as though it is sliding down your body from the heat.
>You and one of your squad mates are in the middle of the formation watching the flanks.
"Whuytevavh is huntin us is close mate."
>It has gotten awfully quiet, and not the wildlife reacting to guard patrol level quiet.
>More like 'Something really dangerous is hunting the guardsmen' level quiet.
>Soon enough, the squad comes to a clearing, which should be alarming enough, but no one speaks up.
>The Commissar is radiating murder and the desire to execute you from any sign of incompetence.
>There's a muffled yelp at the rear of the column, causing everyone to turn.
>It's Leroy...he's standing funny.
>No not standing, something has a hold of him from behind, something like a hand over his mouth.
>It's mimicked Leroy and everything behind him almost perfectly, you probably wouldn't have ever seen it.
>Then it changes color, turning white with pinkish/purplish plates.
"It can Camouflage!"
"Open Fire!"
>Before anything can reach it, the thing LEAPS back into the brush.
>You start firing shots into the bushes, wondering just how many of those things are out there.
>Suddenly, flash-bangs land among the squad, disorienting everyone.
>Screw this, you think as the blurred form of another creature nabs the vox operator
>You can defiantly hear a pissed off Commissar screaming your name.
>You ran for several minutes, panting and firing off shot into the brush and random.
>frak.mantra
>Suddenly, you trip over a root, going sprawling to the ground, trying to get up.
Click Clack
>Oh, how lovely, the Commissar found you.
>Without preamble, your grabbed by your backpack and less hauled, more returned to vertical position.
>Not the Commissar.
>One of the creatures, but it's wearing the Commissar's hat, trench coat, and holding his bolt pistol.
>Its tentacled mouth seems to be drooling slightly, and following the drops down...
>To a very large set of boobs, which strain against the confines of the coat buttend around them.
>Your gaze drops again, and this time your cheeks really heat up
>A large stand of clear, viscous fluid dribbles from a very human looking set of lady parts.
>You look back up at is blushing face as it make and odd crooning noise
>Trying to raise your lasgun, only for one of the huge upper arms to knock it clean from your grasp.
>The lower set drops the bolt pistol and pins you against a tree, its grip strong, but oddly careful
>Oh frak, this thing isn't going to kill you.
>Suddenly, it leans in, tendrils gently stroking your face, not unpleasantly
>Then it kisses you, that is the only applicable term for what it does.
>Then it starts...sucking?
*slurp* *Suck* *Chuu*
>The tendrils lock around your head, tightly, preventing you from moving it so much as an inch.
>The sucking feels weird, and you can feel some sort of tongue slip into your mouth.
>It moans, the vibration rattling your bones ever so slightly as it continues.
>You begin struggling as hard as you can, because that weird feeling in your head is getting stronger.
>By the Emperor, it's trying to suck your brains out.
malepreycaughtstopstruggling
>The frak was that?
>It feels like the damned tendrils are IN your head now.
malecaughtmalesafemalesubmit
>Definitely in your head, it's definitely poking around in there for something
>One of the tendrils presses on a part of your mind, and you just melt with a whimper.
>You weren't sure what just happened, but it felt good.

"Rodger that A6K9, you're requesting reinforcements, is there a problem, over?
"No...problems...here...outpost, just send...more...men...over."
"You alright," The Vox operator asked, "You sound terrible?"
"Just...a little...sick...nothing to raise an alarm...about."
"Okay then," The Operator replied, "Can I have some coordinates, over?"
"Send to...previous deployment...area....will rendezvous...there...over."

>They are a bit strange though
>Swapping bits and pieces of creatures for instance
>Awhile ago you managed to do something really impressive
>You gave the dead life!
>With great precision, you took pieces of brain from the dead, and made it into one working brain
>The brain was made from lots of species, but you decided to put it in a female rat's head as a sort of labrat joke
>Unsurprisingly, her intelligence was not impressive, so you had her watch children's shows
>She got smarter and smarter, and began asking many questions, like what a 'friend' is
>You told her that a friend is someone who it feels good to be around, and who feels good being around you
>After she asked what a best friend is, you told her it's the person who you feel the best being around
>Of course when she asked, you told her you were her friend
>Despite being an experiment, you really did care about her so you worked on giving her a body so she could acquire some other friends
>You can't just go around asking people if they want to become friends with a rat head
>You required more money though, and you had already proven that it is possible to rebuild an entire body
>So you asked to test the effect of organs from different species on a body to see if you can improve performance
>You took body parts from rats, and replaced the organs and muscles with other animals
>Lion muscles, bear heart, snake lungs, etc
>It was a great success when you completed the body
>You had to make some changes so her rat body could handle the parts, making her pretty tall by rat standards
>Actually, pretty tall by human standards, she's two heads above you
>After hooking her up to some robotic limbs and safely teaching her what moves what, you put her head on the new body
>With a little something so her head can become independent of her body
>You aren't going to risk her dying because she accidentally stabbed herself with her knew limbs or something
>Shortly after giving her the body and her practicing with it, something happened, something you didn't expect
>Before, she said you were her best friend because she felt really good in your presence
>You took it as her being very social, and you were the only person she had met
>Since she got herself a new body, with all the feelings
 that come with it, she had been experiencing many new sensations
>But the most notable one was lust
>Turns out when you add a bunch brains from different anthros together, the heat periods aren't lost
>You made that brain from so many, the heat is almost constant
>One thinks early winter, another says late summer, and another says mid spring
>You didn't stand a chance
>Her muscles and her organs working in tandem made her an unstoppable beast, and she was very hungry
>As she fucked you, you could hear the massive beats of her heart pumping blood into her
>Her eyes didn't change, she seemed to just think it was a new game
>When she was done, she had fallen right on top of you, taking in your scent
>She now thinks this 'game' is something that best friends do
>You couldn't convince her that a mate and a best friend were two different things
>At least you can say both experiments were an outstanding success
>Now you just need to explain some other things to her
>Like how she's now much stronger than most species of anthro, that strangers aren't trying to hurt her 'best friend' and she doesn't need to be hugging you constantly in public to keep you safe...
>And that playing the 'best friend game' in front of other people is not acceptable

>"Matriarch, I have come to request we save the humans living on the planet known as earth."
>"From what?"
>"Themselves. they fight each other constantly, and their mental health is deteriorating an a terrible rate from their poor treatment of each other."
>"And why should I send people and resources to help these humans?"
>"Well, here's a picture of them."
>She hands the matriarch a picture of an abducted man holding hands with one of her own species
>"Wow, they are cute. These atrocities shall not stand! Send our best diplomats and a combat team!"

>Probably more heartbreaking.
What if humanities' greatest strength is our ability to suffer?
>Daily grind involves conditions that other races consider slavery
>Nothing comes naturally, we have to train for hundreds, thousands of hours to be good at anything
>Enter society is built on competing, the smallest slip-up and you'll be left behind
>Humans just carry on like nothing's wrong, you have to pry one open to get them to talk about their problems
>Sacrificing oneself is culturally one of the highest achievements a human can perform
>Suicide is exclusively a thing humans do
Depressing, but plenty of room for feel-goods. The world doesn't have to be bad. You don't have to suffer. It will get better because the invaders are here to make things right for us.
Remember to hug your local human. Those cute, depressed skinnies need all the love they can get. Besides, show a sliver of kindness to one and they'll be loyal forever.

>For humans, first contact was not what they expected
>After humans went into space, they were afraid that aliens would want to bring them harm
>Their first meeting with the galactic alliance was tense and uncomfortable, but not for the reasons they thought they would be
>The human diplomat brought guards with him, carrying top of the line weapons
>The alliance diplomat merely brought a scribe
>He had feared that this was a trap, or the other diplomat was some kind of powerful soldier who could kill all of them alone
>She definitely looked big enough, and strong enough to do it
>Then she asked him a question
>"Why are there so many people? What are they carrying?"
>He explained that they were his guards, and told her about the weapons they held
>She found the fact that they had so many powerful weapons discomforting, but continued on without issue
>The humans shared some small tidbits of information on our species, but they were mostly guarded
>Then the humans asked for information from them, expecting only a few of our requests to be heeded
>The aliens gave most of the humans was asked for
>Star maps, histories, culture, an idea of the tech they had, and information on each member races' anatomies
>They even gave us some cadavers to dissect, although they were old
>Humanity thought there was no way they were so nice
>They had to be bluffing, hiding something, no one could be so open to a race of strangers!
>So we sent probes to their planets to study them and find out what was going on
>They stole books, spied on officials, looked at histories between other species
>But they didn't find anything unusual
>Sure, they were much stronger physically than them, with most of the females of the alliance species being especially strong, but that was the most danger they found
>No powerful weapons, only a few words insulting other races, even their government buildings only had one camera
>They even checked to see if the alliance had made them invisible, but no, there was only one camera in that whole building
>They read through their histories and found that war might as well not exist
>Murder, theft, some even had a word for torture, but not war
>So they spoke with the diplomat
>Humanity's representative asked her why they couldn't find anything on war
>She didn't understand what he meant
>He explained it as mass death
>She thought the idea was funny, claiming the idea as ludicrous
>The human diplomat, once a respected military man lost his patience and screamed at her, telling her to stop lying
>She kept telling him that nothing like that had never happened, and that such a thing was unheard of
>He laid into her after that
>"Unheard of!? I've never known peace in my life, and yet you say you've never fucking heard of war!? You've never had your family killed? Never lost your town? Never had someone for your people to work in the cold without food or water until they collapsed from fatigue? I can't open a damned history book without reading about war in every chapter, and you say you've never fucking had it!? And you think I'm going to believe such a bold faced lie!? I refuse to be treated this way. Call us again when you are ready to be honest."
>And he made his exit, leaving the Alliance diplomat shocked beyond words
>Such small, seemingly weak creatures had to deal with such a life?
>A lot of her people who saw the humans thought they were charming in their looks and mannerisms
>The groups who came were always tightly huddled together, and always seemed somewhat nervous
>She had thought this meant they were a shy species who desired to be surrounded by those they care about
>But she learned that it was because they were afraid
>She wondered what kind of species would be like this?
>The human representative refused to talk to her for quite some time, so she talked with those he was in charge of
>Through this method, she managed to get old stories that were linked with humanity
>Most of them were fiction, and the ones that weren't were anthropology books that talked of us long ago, but they were the best she could get with us being guarded
>When she read the ancient stories, she discovered something about humans
>Food was often hard to come by for humanity, and hunger was a common topic
>On top of that, although humans were the apex predators of their planet, they were also one of the weakest
>They feared being torn apart by the other creatures living there
>When they didn't fear that, they feared where their food would come from
>And if they didn't fear that, they feared that someone with less would take what they had
>Humanity never had enough, and when something grows without enough, it can become warped and desperate and willing to do things that no other being would do
>Unlike her kind, humans could take great pain and stay conscious with their last breath
>Humans sacrificed themselves for the sake of others were in quite a few of the stories
>A species that had suffered long enough evolve to live despite it
>A species that has to take or die
>A species who regularly gave up their own lives so that others may live, because they might all die otherwise
>A species built to suffer
>And their upbringing still haunted them today
>She needed to talk with her superiors about this, they would know to how to handle it

Relax, human, Listen to my voice and stare into the light.
Relax, human. You're safe with me. Here, with me, you're at home.
Relax, human. Listen to my voice, and do as I say. Let me take care of you.
Relax, human. The world outside is scary and unknown. Here, with me, you're safe, and everything is simple.
Relax, human. Stare into the light. Our room fades away. Our surroundings fade away. Stare into the light. There's only me in your world.
Relax. Listening to my voice makes you happy.
Relax. Doing as I say makes your life complete.
Relax. Obeying your Mistress is your natural instinct.
Relax, human. My voice is your command.
Relax, human. Obedience is your highest bliss.
Relax,
 human. Your mistress is here, and you're safe with her.
Stare into the light.
Remember this, human. Remember this bliss. This bliss is your collar. Your devotion to your Mistress. And you wear it with pride.
Stare into the light.
When I tell you to relax, this state comes back to you. When I tell you to relax, you put on your collar. When I tell you to relax, you become a blissful, obedient kitten, like you're intended to be. Like you want to be.
Stare into the light.
When I tell you to wake up, human, you come to your senses. When I tell you to wake up, you take off your collar. You become aware, your will is your own. You will feel refreshed and restored. You will remember the pleasure of obedience. You will remember the pleasure of having your collar on. But you will forget the details of our sessions.
Stare into the light.
The world becomes more real, human. Our surroundigs take their form.
Listen to my voice. Stare into the light.
And now
Wake up.

>Post-apocalypse scenario 24: All males of every species have perished including stored samples of semen, sending the world into a frenzy as women come to the realization that the world will die very, very slowly as none carry the ability to repopulate
>All governments and cities have devolved into mindless chaos and destruction, causing many to either embrace the end of all and enjoy their sadistic pleasures while they can or survive in the harsh wasteland until their eventual death
>Until one anthro woman discovered something amidst the ruins of a long forgotten city 10 years after the death of half of every humanoid creature: a human
>Specifically, a male in his young 20s
>Desperate to keep him hidden away from the warlords of the city, her secret's soon discovered as his scent carries through the air for all to smell with just the slightest bit of sweat built up from the burning sun
>And it all went to Hell once she heard the war howls echo through the desolate city

>You arrive home from work again to see your insectoid 'wife'
>It took some convincing to even get you to be able to work
>Her antennae excitedly tap against your face as she clicks and trills blissfully
>You recall playing with tiger beetles as a kid and the strange musk they would emit. She does the same, relieving this alien scent that rings like some sort of sharp incense
>Pheromone after pheromone attacks your senses, she's needy again and is already sliding her four clawed arms against your shirt
>Her abdomen undulates slowly with a needy breath as she strips you, your skin still scarred from the "mark" as well as claw scars from your first encounter
>She's all muscle, coated in armor, easily able to pin you down on the nearby furniture as the clicks change into excited trills
>A familiar suckling sensation of her ovipore nestles against your loins as you feel the many ticklish nubs of her maxillae greedily rub your erogenous zones
>Her mating is never simple, never quick
>Something about her presence, perhaps the pheromones too, keeps you from softening or tiring
>After weeks upon weeks of this treatment, eventually you return from work simply to push open the door and clasp into her alien body
>Her scent and plasticine body now only cause you to rouse again and again as her supple abdomen skillfully milks you like a machine
>Your children look nothing like you, but you know they're all yours. All 27 of them.

This is a really interesting setting. Would there be different insectoids? Or would the various castes look different?

There would be vestigial remnants of a caste system but nothing lasting. Their genes would obviously be able to comingle with other species, a trait adapted in pursuit of genetic perfection.
Insectoid species would almost certainly be female dominated. In the most extreme cases, males are treated like a bargaining resource. The best ones are highly sought after, yet even lowly males would be covered by lowborn ladies.
They would hit planet after planet, seizing the territory through conquest. During their assault on Earth they took special care to use non-lethal neutralization in their confusion of seeing males as an attacking force. Human women left on Earth would see a new age of female dominance, yet not as much for them as the competitive insectoid race would immediately begin hindering their rivals capability of acquiring a mate.
You would have your genome sequenced, possibly even spliced, then given a grade based on your genetic code.
Sex is just naturally important to insectoids, even in the insect kingdom of primitive earth. It would be a complete role reversal, based on their own society. Females do all the work, just look at how bees and ants work. You would be kept home, marked with her mandibles, and treated like her stress relief sex toy whenever she was near you. They would enjoy being pregnant and boast about their fertility every single time you two managed to produce another spawnling.
They would be much larger than you, towering over with their overzealously engorged biological fertility. Her abdomen, after a few births would literally be half your height. If you began to take initiative, they would find a way to just have you cling to them as they do their daily routine. Your body would be strapped to her own, held in place by secondary arms, perpetually rutting her softest parts as the occasional coo of chittery clicks and caress of talons that would be able to kill you tell you she's orgasming again with you.

>She puts an arm around your shoulder and you feel the need to remind her that you aren't dating, but decided against it
>Her demeanor is much more cheery than when you last saw her, and as far as you can tell she just got over it
>The TV shows a news station, with a video of a stage
>"Recently our president a new law that will now be going into effect. At the press release, the president had this to say."
>A female arctic fox stands on stage behind a podium, her face illuminated by the flashing of cameras
>With a raised hand, the murmurs stop
>She points toward one of the reporters, urging them to speak
>"Miss president, what convinced you to sign this law? Are you concerned some might find it distasteful, targeting a single species like this?"
>"I am doing what I think is best for the people of my country, including humans. I admit, this may cause problems short term, but I'm certain long term this will lead to a happier, healthier country."
>"Ma'am, what is your opinion on humans?"
>"I believe they are unfortunate souls who have lost their way. Not through any fault of their own! We haven't realized until recently their needs, and for this, I apologize to all human citizens."
>"Is it true that your sister has been paying human men to spend the night with her?"
>"I do not know. I feel that it would be better if you ask her. What I can say is you should consider how much evidence there is. It isn't the first time celebrities have been framed with little to no evidence."
>"Does the vice president's rejecting you have anything to do with it?"
>"Our relationship is purely professional, and anyone suggesting otherwise is trying to slander my name!" She heatedly speaks
>Noticing her little outburst, she takes a moment to clear her throat
>"Hrm. Anyway, I have brought a psychologist in to explain things. She is an expert in her field, so show her some respect please."
>The president moves, and a thin lizard enters and takes her place on the podium
>"Hello, I am Charlotte Taylor. Many might question how this new law is beneficial for humans, and I am here to explain my studies."
>She turns on the projector, and a slide with data is shown
"You may not know, but the human population has been in decline. They have little desire to marry these days. According to surveys, men have become increasingly listless, showing increasing depression, apathy, and self loathing. At first, I thought the depression was the reason for the lack of marriage, with them feeling that they weren't prepared for it. Then I looked at some information from third world countries."
>Another click, and more data is shown
>"This graph shows that in third world countries, humans are much more likely to be raped, or forced into marriage. These men, despite what you might believe, actually show that they are more content with their life. Men in the same country who were never raped are not as content. This led me to my conclusion."
>"We've been trying to court them in a way that we would consider normal, but humans didn't evolve to be courted normally. They may not realize it, but they feel undervalued because very few people have tried to court the men how they were meant to be. The best way to return their population to reasonable levels and to make them feel loved is through this law. Before, courting them properly was illegal. Now we can make up for it."
>The screen returns to the anchors
>"So from this day forward, raping humans is no longer illegal, and a sort of pseudo marriage between anthro women and human men will be created upon copulation. This law is certain to be controversial. Let's go onto the field with our reporter. Francine?"
>A blue bird appears on screen
>"Francine here, reporting from the White House."
>"Has there been any protest to this new law?"
>"Things are calm here at the moment."
>"Oh? No complaints?"
>"There were protesters here earlier, but most of them have been dragged off."
>"By police?"
>"No, civilians who seem to be taking advantage of the new law. At least one of them didn't even wait to drag him away, she just ripped off his clothes and had sex with him right there."
>"That sounds like it skirts some decency laws."
>"Probably. I've called the police. Whether they'll do anything about it or not, we'll just have to see."
>To say you're surprised is an understatement
>Raping humans, now legal? What the hell
>You turn to your friend to talk, but it seems while you were busy watching the news she had removed her pants, and she quickly pins you down against the couch
>"Anon, I'm sorry. I had no idea that humans were like this. If I had known, I would have taken you when you told me no."
>"Rachel, I don't want this!" you protest as she starts lifting up your shirt
>"You heard the study, Anon! I've noticed for a while now that your mood has dropped. You're lonely, and you need me."
>Her head lowers to your stomach, and she starts licking your body
>"S-stop."
>Her hand moves down to your pants, carefully pulling them off
>"I love you Anon. I want you, and now I know you need me. I need to do this for your sake."
>She moves her head to look you in the eyes, her tongue dragging from your torso to your cheek
>"I'm going to put you inside of me now. Do you want this to be over quickly?"
>You can't speak, you only feel warm tears run down your face
>She licks them off
>"This will be quick."
>She hugs you tight and takes takes a long sniff, breathing in your scent
>Then in a single move, you feel your manhood slide into her
>Your eyes widen at the tight feel of her insides, but you don't have enough time to think as she starts thrusting
>"I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you," she whispers into your ears. "I'm doing this for you."
>Squirming doesn't help you, it only seems to drive her to fuck you faster, and bring you closer to the edge
>"I don't-"
>You're cut off by her tongue, this time going into your mouth, silencing you
>It's surprisingly gentle as she slides her tongue against yours, tasting it bit by bit
>You feel pressure build up in your cock, and with a moan you release into her
>Rachel extricates her tongue from your mouth
>"Now you'll be happy. I'll make sure of it, Anon."
>You can only cry into her shoulder as she holds you tight

>The human presses his face against the partition separating prisoners from their handlers in the car.
Where are you taking me?
>His question is met with silence as the wolf continues to drive. A nervous sweat begins forming on his body when he notices where she has taken him. "This is how I'm going to die" he thought to himself. When she finally stops, the look in her eyes almost makes his heart stop. Instinctually, he presses against the seat trying to create as much distance as he could from the wolf.
W-what if I am a stray. This isn't where a normal officer would take me. I'm not trying to hurt anybody. Just calm down and don't hurt me.

>Her matted furry rear wiggles around, barely covered by the crumpled miniskirt uniform. Equally worn baton and cuffs hang off her belt, bouncing as she searches for something.
See rather than let them have all the fun at the, unf, station processing you...come here...yes
>She pops back up with a set of 24/hr exemption ID tags. Jingling them around like a child's toy.
You're gonna serve me, here, then im gonna give you this as protection.

I don't have an owner!
>The human quickly snaps. It's obvious from the anger and fear in his voice that mentioning his owner struck a nerve.
>Despite all the anger and fear brimming within him, he couldn't help but stare at her shapely legs while she's bent over. His eyes trace up her legs admiring her strong taut muscles and her thick powerful thighs. His attention is then brought to her curvaceous butt shaking right in front of him. It was only when he saw the exemption ID tags that his trance was broken. His face almost broke into a smile when he saw them.
Thank you, I'm so happy I could almost kiss you. I just want to get as far away from my owner as I can and those should buy some time to do just that.

Almost kiss?
>The dirty wolf cop lets out a gruff laugh, clipping the tags to her belt.
Humans are so funny, now I'm coming back there and you'll do more than kiss me if you want these tags, kid.
>She should just take him in for a bounty. Only the wealthy have human servants. That's not fun though.
>She signed up for the chase...and the "perks". No one cares if you fuck a human, just don't leave too many marks on them this time.
>Getting out of the cab she stretches, the car rocks roughly as she flicks the door closed. The wolf isn't strong enough to be up for alpha but still, pinning most humans isn't an issue.
>Watching him cower in the back the wolf licks her dark lips, slowly unlocking the door with one paw, loosening her uniform with the other.
On your back boy, keep those arms where I can see them.

Wait, I've never done it before can't we do something else, please? My owner never allowed it, she preferred keeping me pent up. She would even hurt me when she'd catch me jacking off.
>He tries to get as far away from her as possible. By the time the wolf has opened the door, the human is huddled up with his back pressed against the opposite door and his knees raised up. His face has turned a light pink from blushing but there's fear in his eyes. As the wolf approached, the human tried to half heartedly kick her away but he had resigned himself to his fate. The wolf towered over him and he closed his eyes and waited.

>She never understood why they resisted. It always amused her though. The ones not fully broken in were her favorites, you don't find many these days.
>With a low growl she roughly pulled his legs out, laying him along the back seats, he struggled but that didnt matter once she crawled ontop of his chest. Pinning his legs with her thighs.
There there
>The wolf cooed softly tilting the boys head up to face her.
These seats have seen it all, don't worry about it. You want to go? Then taste your freedom.
>Sitting up a lil she guides the humans face under her skirt. Her other paw moving the panties aside.
>"No wonder he ran away" She thought to herself. "They should be stricter enforcing the human keeping standards."

Just let me go bit-
>His words are cut off by her pulling his hair and pressing his face against her wet pussy. He could feel her wet lips pressing against his. He shouted various slurs and insults at her making his tongue lap against her lower lips. All she heard was muffled and unintelligible yelling. His hands shot to her arm trying to pry it away from his head. She was way too strong for him however and her arms wouldn't budge an inch. Panicking his arms struggled pushing and pulling on anything he could until his hands landed on something incredibly squishy and fuzzy. Instinctually his hands gave them a nice long squeeze. Slowly, he opened his eyes to find his hands on her breasts. To both sides of his face were her strong thighs. From this angle, he could see her toned stomach peaking below her shirt. His heart started beating faster making the blush reappear on his face. "Shit" he thought. He was getting turned on.

>Feeling the boys blood pumping, seeing him tug her top open and grab her breasts, his resistance slowing as she ground against his face.
>He was getting the message, it always took humans a bit longer than furboys.
>Smiling down the corrupt officer tilts her head and relaxes the firm hold over her catch, gently brushing his now messed up hair. Tail twitching mischievously.
Try again, handsome...im thinking i maybe i should turn you in...they have a good rehabilitation program in this city.

>His defiance further melts when he feels her relax her hold on him. As much as he hates to admit it, he loved feeling her big strong paw rub his head. He craved more of her touch wanting to feel the warmth of her touch against his cheeks. He was starting to warm up to her and his licking reflected that... that is until she started speaking again. Her haughty personality angers him. To get back at her his fingers zero in on her nipples. He gives them a nice pinch and then proceeds to pull on them gently.

>The wolf takes a sharp breath at being roughed back but his tongue was still pressing ever deeper between her legs, wearing away her authority.
Ah!...oh...good boy
>She felt her legs quiver, making her lay over the human, soaking his face with her rising arousal.
>Taking his wondering hands in her paws and guiding them all over her worn body.
>It wasn't entirely smooth tones. There were a few scars under that thick fur. It didn't excuse what she was doing though.
>She was supposed to protect them from this.

>He stopped for a few seconds after hearing her call him a good boy. His owner had never done that. It made him feel all warm and fuzzy. He continued to lick her with a newfound sense of confidence. Part of him wanted to please her. It felt nice to run his hands against her body. Her fur was matted but it still felt soft. His hands rubbed against her abs and then moved to trace the outline of her frame. He felt his cock press painfully against his pants. Even he couldn't deny that he's turned on at this point.

A dragon demands a "sacrifice" of a kingdom's prince in exchange for saving them from a greater threat.
When he gets to her lair, terrified, it turns out she wants to fuck and marry him, not eat him like he thought, though she's mischevious enough to let him think that until she starts sucking his dick.

Nice.
I kind of want to work in something more to this. How about how easily he was turned over? Perhaps he's the king's firstborn, although not as favored as his brother, and the king seeks to be rid of him so that his 'better' son may rule.
And perhaps the dragon at first simply wished to marry and lay claim to the throne for the power and prestige, only to learn of the young prince's plight. At first, she would be ecstatic to assert herself over the shy boy and control him, such that her power might never be challenged. She would make rough, dominating love to put him in his place.
Only... perhaps the prince is not as pathetic as the king and the dragon make him out to be. Perhaps he's not so keen on direct action, but he knows and understands people and the way things proceed. He makes plans upon plans, studies of people who cavort in high life and nobility. The king saw him as weak, because
 subtlety was always his specialty. The dragon would learn this in the days to come as she questioned him on the nature of the current leadership, who pulls the strings, and how she could come to rule.
And perhaps she would come to see him as more than a means to an end. She would see a sweet young man that just wants people to be happy. Someone who tries their hardest to no avail- his family and peers simply looked no further than his nervous behavior. Perhaps, he could be more than a key to the kingdom, and someone she could love. In such short time he would have worked his way into her heart with the guile of a mastermind, but none of the malice. Despite being a prisoner, he did everything he could to make her happy.
They would make gentle love, then. The prince that gave her everything she wanted and more, and the dragon that helped him feel loved for the first time.

How do you think a human would fare in an anthro prison? Do you think he'd manage get along with prisoner anthros?

Honey badgers are known for not giving a shit about getting hurt. I'd imagine it would be the same for rape.

those fuckers have way too much advantages
>can sleep off cobra venom
>thick fur to ignore african honey bee stings
>loose hide so they can can and bite your face regardless where they get bit into
>even have a sort skunk style spray they can do, but nowhere near as bad as actual skunks
>let themselves get grabbed/bit so they can tear up the thing after them
>they also target the balls of animals attacking them if male
>zoo ones will escape just to break into the lion enclosures to attack them
Even if they can't outright kill shit like lions and such the injuries they give them more or less means they're fucked mobility wise or worse off meaning they might die from something else. Wolverines might be worse just because they live in cold areas and attack bears and hunt caribou.

>tfw no big strong anthro gf to call you names like 'pretty boy' and praise you for your beauty

>Local princess hates the idea of being royalty, wants nothing more than to escape her inherited fate.
>One day she finally says "fuck it, I'm out." because there's just no easy way to abdicate or otherwise disappear.
>Leaves in the middle of the night. Rides like a bat out of hell. Keeps ahead of royal servants who all think she's been kidnapped as a hostage or worse.
>Makes it to a remote edge of the kingdom.
>Suddenly a dragon!
>Kidnapped for real.
>Turns out the dragon doesn't want to hurt her, just wants her as bait to lure in a stronk human boy.
>Lives so remote because other dragons from far away dragon kingdom make so much fun of her.
>Girls hatch a plan.
>Eventually there is a household of several human knights serving a socially awkward but very kind dragon and a princess who has forcefully abdicated the throne in return for her household keeping watch over the remote border of the kingdom.

What do you have in mind for a anthro female dominated society?

Not slavery or 2nd class citizenship.
Simply more kindness being extended towards men in general, less being considered the disposable gender.
Just to have a voice that will be heard as much as a woman's would.

>he does not remember the human rights war
they can move around freely if their documents are in order, they can have part time employment and receive equal pay. they even got their own mini hall of representatives and can vote on local issues. sure there are limits on personal property and certain physically demanding jobs
but never again will they be given weapons or status above an anthro. not after last time.

>Post-war retrospect attributes human cruelty to a lack of abstract empathy: the tendency for humans to lose sight of morals when dealing with things that are not physically in front of them
>Compared to anthros, humans' right supramarginal gyrus are woefully unresponsive to stimulus from the logic processing parts of the brain
>An assembly of humans discussing a problem can mute this section of the brain altogether via a feedback loop of abrasive argumentation, associating the problem with negative emotions, and pure logic, removing emotion and compassion altogether
This is why humans are unfit to lead, but fit to be people. If our current system were led by humans, discrimination and abuse would be rampant. That's why this war started in the first place. You skinny fucks whip each other until you're either brainless wage slaves or fascist sociopaths and we have to pay the price.
The opposite is true, as well. Give a human love and safety, and they'll pour their hearts into making you happy.

>humans bad
Why do you have to pull out such misanthropic shit? Why not have the anthros love us because of our struggles to be better? Last thread with the discussion about humans being deathworlders and anthros being heartbroken as they see all the shit that gets thrown at us by our own planet was kino as shit. It’s the perfect balance between hfy and the premise of this thread while managing to be very interesting and unique. A far cry from the same old edgy 12 year old premise of “humans b ebil” that you regurgitate here.

>Strong muscular mare runs a farm to grow plants and vegetables

Would the media censorship be reverse?

I'd think it would be more like earth final conflict but with anthro girls. There you have both species wanting a better future together now neither is alone but accidents and power struggles still occur because they are from totally different worlds...maybe skip the Hitler arc and hybrid uprising.

If we want a world war segment, why not let the humans getting captured by a different group of country of anthros who are anti-human and a different country of anthros wants to protect them.
>Imagine a tough tall Hyena girl saved you from being harmed from a soldier and carries you due to your bruised body as you cried to her warm fuzzy breast for comfort knowing that there is hope for humanity to be cared
>However, humans are on the decline, and hope these anthros will save em from extinction

Alternatively, could just skip the societal scale and give alternate reasons for humans to be rescued that don't involve a holocaust, but that's just me

I want a scenario that aliens discover our planet and see that we haven't made the technological advances to get ourselves out of our solar system yet. They get worried that other races would see an opportunity to invade and enslave us, so they invade and take over our planet first as a way to protect us from other said races.

>"We shall continue until you are capable of pushing me (hauling model) off while at full power while you are performing (mouth to mouth) lung exercises."

I just want a world where anthros see humans as cute and unique and a are heartbroken to see them treat eachother like trash. The only way anthros can stop humans from killing eachother would be to invade and take over earth as a way to bring peace to them.

Come on chief, quit bustin' my tail...I know I have a human "thing" that's why I'm the best hunter you've got. Busted that trafficking ring wide open, got those kids out safe.

How fucked you would be if you forgot deodorant and had to run to your workplace filled with anthro women?

A dragon or other reptile. Perhaps the relationship would start on even footing, I'd try my best to earn her affection and respect. Then... maybe I'd ask her hold me. To let me feel her stronger arms. I'd love her to accept, but tease me about it. I'd love to hear the smile in her voice, to quench her desire to feel needed.
Maybe the teasing would go a little further, grow a little rougher? Headlocks and sitting on my chest when I'm lying down. We'd laugh, she'd tease me about pushing her off. I'd never be able to, but I'd try.
I'd love to get back at her by sitting in her lap when she least expects it. If she lifted me with ease, I'd melt in her arms.
Gods, would I melt.

Story idea: Human baron have been proposed by a duchess lioness. Can’t reject the proposal since it would be seen as a slight against a higher class noble and she is very insistent on marriage.

Your parents support the marriage. Really they just want out of their basemen... I mean the West-Wing of the mansion.

Psst, hey, hey Anon! A bunch of us guys are gonna stay out past curfew and have a party down at the beach, you in? As far as we can tell, the cops don't patrol that area of the beach, and it's a little lagoon ringed in by a coral reef, so the shark girls shouldn't be able to get in.

It's not the best request, but it's a start.

There was always going to be a power struggle with the anthros and humans.
Some need space to flourish, others want to be led. I think in the end, we will snuggle it out together.

I actually like the idea of a female anthros discovering themselves and realize how kind, over protective, and surprisingly, scared for them when something bad happens to them. Realizing that they aren’t as tough as they are often see themselves to be. Especially when they have no idea how sex works and make a fool out of themselves as the humans giggling and admiring their wife/gf anthro trying her best to figure out on what to do next when on the bed.

>when your grizzly bear gf she puts you into a struggle cuddle with one of her powerful loving hugs

Do you think there are extremist groups in an anthro dominant world? Like for example, a group of humans that reject everything anthro society stands for and wants to create a human ethnostate?

I know this may be embarrassing to ask, but can you um.... Put me in a headlock?

Remember to watch out for predators at your local workplace. You could end up getting ''caught.''

I work with a lot of big cats myself, nothing's happened yet but the amount of remarks i've heard about me is... worrying. they always try to fight over who gets to sit next to me during lunch break, too.
....It's kind of nice, though.

Do they act protective when sat next to you? Maybe, they tease you by rubbing their hand over your thigh and nuzzling your neck?

Yeah. I think i've seen a couple stalking me on my walk back home, but it's hard to tell. a lot of anthro girls do that when you're one of the only human boys in your district. a couple of them have slapped my ass before too, but HR sure won't make it any better. Being a human secretary is rough.

Has your well dressed boss asked for some private time with you? Maybe talked about how you don't have to be harassed at a job and could find yourself living in a nice big house if all things go well?
Maybe she asked about how you feel about kids?

The first one, yeah.
...She's a nice boss, too. i wouldn't mind.
Well, except the having kids thing, i'm not a huge fan.
...But im also pretty sure she could crush my pelvis if she tried.

>There's always the occasional tail tapping your thigh or ass while the women pass through the office or corridors
>Or those that lean a little too closely against you when the elevator's almost full...you can feel them sniffing you in hopes of getting a whiff
>And it was only a matter of time before the CEO had a chance to meet you in person

>More often then not, male humans always get sexually bullied by the higher ups at work, restaurants, at home, and even at public
>Most humans felt like sex toys than actual beings
>This problem can cost depression, bitterness, isolation, and worst of all, suicidal
>Please make sure to donate, and help a human male to regain hope for their son’s future

im not into sissy stuff or being totally passive but i did think that if humans are going to be dedicated healers they could soothe anthros on contact.
like in a straight fight the anthro would beat them to a pulp physically but with their nimble hands, wealth of knowledge and gods guidance humans can actively protect themselves and others, calming anthros by targeting their pressure points.
Those that learn the more...elusive points of pleasure would be highly sought after to provide healing/spa services.
Abusing this knowledge to seek out painful or even fatal points is not permitted. There is too much suffering in the world. To cause more goes against everything they stand for.

A human who has snapped and strayed from the path has the potential to be extremely dangerous, especially since most anthros probably can't wrap their heads around the idea of a human who is actively malicious.

You are just over reacting citizen, that movie caused quit the stir when it first came out and we were inundated with false alerts.
Why there hasn't been a human implicated in such crimes for decades.
The studio responsible has since issued an apology and promised to stick to its usual brand of err, "high brow" low budget human exploitation flicks...

What kinds of controversies and human exploitations? Sex, and bad portrayal?

Well, urm, we did seize a truck of material before it left for stores, e-evidence of course...
I mean, look at some of this stuff:
>"Boys Night 3" - On a hot summers night our boys sneak out to cool off but end up in hot water.
>"The Voreoid" - After finding a UFO a human gets INTO a relationship thats out of this world.
>"Down Deep" - A fur boy and his hummie friend are trapped in a submarine!
Urgh, its all filth! (want one? seeing fur boy work a human is unreal.)

What if the furboi was actually a reverse-trap in disguise trying to get a more casual relationship with the humie without the expectations and concerns befriending an anthro girl in such a society might have?

>"I want rape you, I'm a boy too! Hahaha!"
>"Hey, how about you take off your shirt and pants? I have a penis too so it isn't weird, hahaha!"
>"That human girl isn't right for you, take it from me, I've definitely dated human women and found them all to be terrible! You should try an anthro girl, they are the best! Hahaha!"



Any ideas involving a human supremacist getting taken by an amazonian anthro?

Some anon that that hates hyeniggers online ends up on a work assignment with a migrant from the african savannas and has to decide if FBI statistics are more convincing than big fluffy tits&ass. The amazon misinterprets his shyness and supressed anger as flirting due to cultural differences.
Could develop into anything from a rape scene to awkward romance I guess.

>Be dentist
>All your patients are Anthro women

Hyenas supposedly like it a lot when you touch their teeth and gums.
I doubt they could get off on solely that, but I bet she might pin you down after the appointment and finish the foreplay.

Sometimes your patients nibble on your finger sucking it. They won't let your digit go until they are satisfied.

>Hell, even the roof access was mined and watched by a pair of men, with the rest protecting the interior of the place.
>Still, there's a shtiton of guants, only driven back by blasts from the two flamers the platoon was given.
>One of the men ext to you stumbles as numerous quills strike him in the side and arm, but he doesn't die.
>It's as though his body won;t move on its own anymore...the quills must contain a paralytic toxin.
>The damned smoke is pouring in through the breaches, and your mask isn't easy to see out of already.
"Fall back men."
>You scramble to follow, firing as you run, the guants now advancing under their own cover fire.
>Matt it tackled by several of them and is dragged into their mist, his flailing arms the last you see of him.
>You fall back to the motor-pool with the rest of the men, only for the large doorway to suddenly be torn open by the Carnifex.
>The heavy stubber thunders, scything through a dozen gaunts before it's covered in dense webbing.
>Oh frak that's a big bug.
>Tyranid Warrior steps in, the web cannon clutched in lower claws, the upper ones holding a pair of bone swords.
>It's also got...boobs?
>for a moment all is still, before sarge fires a krak missile at it, and the fight is on.
>It misses the warrior, but hits the Carnifex, which prompts it to roar loudly as the warrior raises its weapon.
>You have your own fight, trying to keep the left flank from collapsing.
>You manage for about ten seconds before a few quills drive into your right forearm.
>Then a hormagaunt leaps on top of you, pinning you to the floor.
>It probably would come up to your chin if it stood upright, and it weighed as much as your field kit, a good seventy pounds.
>You're doing everything you can to keep the teeth and claws off you, this thing is stronger than it looks
>Two more join it, one piing your legs to the concrete floor, the other gripping your helmet and mask.
>It yanks them off, but not before you throw the gaunt pinning your chest to the floor off.
>You're barely able to sit up when one of those spore pods smacks into yoru flak armor, the cloud enveloping your face.
>Warmth builds in your lungs and begins to spread, our body beginning to feel very hot, your face flushing badly.
>The gaunt behind you keeps you propped upright and begins licking your ear, the sensation sending a shudder through you.
>Across the room and through the haze, Sarge is attacking the warrior with a damn big wrench.
>A few gaunts trying to ambush him from behind are accidental victims of the return swing.
>He;s gotten a few good hits on the warrior looming over him, it's missing some teeth.
>It...or she, grabs the wrench and gives him a long lick across his face.
>Sarge is then thrown across the room and into a storage room, the warrior stomping after him.
>A scythe with a finger turns your head, permitting the gaunt to tongue-fuck your mouth in your inebriate state.
>You manage to break free...only to see one of the gaunts...presenting. Your brain just stops.
>Dimly, you can feel the third nuzzling your chest, but the heat and odd sight before you make it impossible to think.
>It isn't that alien looking, hell, its glistening with fluids and twitching slightly as the gaunt wiggles its rump at you.
>The heat in you body heads south, and the pheromones in the air do away with silly notions such as resisting.
>The nuzzler slices open your pants carefully, allowing your erection to fall out, twitching slightly.
>So...hot...need to....need to
>Taking the initiative from you, the gaunt backs into you before sitting down, slipping you inside of its...her...
>Thinking becomes very difficult as ridges of hot, wet, slippery, and muscular flesh envelop you.
>Then it starts moving, as thought trying to drag you further in...causing you to emit all sorts of embarrassing sounds.
>Well, they would be embarrassing, if you had the mental faculties at this point
>Your hands grip the firm backside of the gaunt, trying to leverage enough force to pull out and thrust.
>It chitters happily, squealing at you relentlessly fuck, while the others nuzzle and lick in encouragement.
>You're not sure how long it takes to reach climax, but when it hits the guant's innards go into overdrive.
>Finally, you slip out and land heavily on your back, the cool floor welcoming with the constant heat.
>Then your mouth is being relentlessly tongue-fucked again, and scything talons start to shear through your flack armor.
>The last thing you remember though the haze is gaunts piling atop you for their turn.
>The vox operator sighed as another outpost checked in, reporting a lack of Tyranid activity where there should have been.
>Thy weren't radiating outward in a consistent circle like intel had suggested.
>According to General Powerstache, they were acting like an actual army, moving along points of opportunity and gathering strength.
>He'd pointed this out in his meeting with the Commander of the armored regiment that had just arrived.
>Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge however, didn't see the merit in fortifying and taking time to examine this new threat.
>If they were to behave like an army, she would crush them like the army they pretended to be.
>Her assault would reach them in three days...and odds are most of it would be taken.
"Outpost 13 to command, come in command, over."
>Outpost 13 was infamous for bad comms and infrequent reports, but the Vox operator felt unease at the woman's voice.
"Command to Outpost 13, we read you, status report, over."
"Requesting reinforcements, Tyranids in area...send more men, over."
>A chill shot down the vox operator's spine...he'd heard that line before.
"Negative."
"Send...More...Men."
>The voice had evolved from a sickly sounding person to that of a woman, one with an accent never heard before.
>He cut the channel and switched to command's main channel to deliver the news...Outpost 13 had been overrun.

I want more god of humanity greens. It was so nice and wholesome!

Be patient.
>You are the first generation of humans, made by your Father god with a purpose
>That purpose is to spread love and goodwill among the other species, and to aid those with the power granted by your god
>You are very young, but you were made with the body, power, and knowledge to bear this burden
>Pride wells up in you as you think about how it is your duty to make the world a better place
>With a small compass, you and a small fraction of your brothers head to the land controlled by the goddess of rats and resourcefulness, dressed in the clothes gifted to you by her as a sign of her favor
>And when you arrive to what looks like a burrow, as the goddess promised, her people were prepared to meet you
>The leader stands in front, a beautiful necklace with a fairly large jewel adorning her
>She seems a little shocked to see you
>"rats, we humans have been sent here by my god and yours to aid in whatever way we can."
>The leader blinks a few times
>"Yes, she told us about you. Why are you dressed in such a way?"
>She gestures to the clothes gifted to you
>You thought that the clothes were normal for her kind, but with a closer look it appears that yours are not the same
>Hers was large and baggy with many pockets, while yours were tight and had a few openings to show off skin, including over your navel and chest
>"I was born without clothes, so your goddess gifted me them."
>"Clothes like that? In the middle of winter? You don't find it cold?"
>"You see-"
>Suddenly a shiver runs up your spine, and the warm comfort you once knew is gone
>"It appears your goddesses' magic has stopped working. C-could we come inside?"
>The rat winces, and nods as she turns and begins to lead you and your brothers to one of the burrows
>Upon entering, you see a large gathering of rats sitting at a table, wearing similar clothing to their leader if a bit more ragged and torn
>They stare as well
>You give them a friendly smile and they look away
>The leader takes a seat
>"My fellow people, these are the visitors our goddess told us of in our dreams. The ones who will be bound to us, in her words."
>Another one covered in more than a few knives looks at your group especially attentively
>"We have no need to fear them?"
>"We were told that they are to be trusted, and our goddess has never lied to us."
>"These are completely new creatures who have entered our home, we do not know how dangerous they could be."
>You begin unclasping the parts that are holding your clothes on, and they fall to the ground
>"What are you doing?" the paranoid rat asked, before gawking at you
>"I am showing you have nothing to fear. You see I have no weapons."
>You step toward her, holding your hand out to press against her chest
>"I don't have claws to hurt you. These hands are meant to make you happy."
>Your emotions flow out of you, the specifically the emotion granted to you by Father
>"W-what is this feeling?"
>"Love. This emotion needs at least two to feel, and I wish to share it with all of you. I can help you in many ways, and all I want is for you to feel this way for me. Can you?"
>She holds onto your arm, softly squeezing and rubbing her hands along it
>They go up your arm until it reaches your own chest, her eyes locked so hard onto you that you'd think she forgot about the outside world
>Her hands start heading lower, but just as they are about to reach a specific place you step back
>As your body is out of reach, she seems to regain her lucidity
>"I'm sorry. That place will be gifted to you later, but you aren't ready for it yet."
>"Hey, Adi, you seemed really out of it there. You aren't going soft on us, are you?" another rat chuckles
>Adi glares at her
>"I was checking to see if he was a threat, and it appears he isn't. No weapons are on him, and his body is not strong or dexterous like our enemies. There is dexterity, but I can't see it being a danger to us."
>"So not a threat. Still, you got pretty touchy there."
>You bend over to grab your garments before turning to her
>"I have no problem with it, our bodies were meant to touch and to be touched. I'm sure one of us would be very happy to have you do the same to them."
>She turns her head, a bit of pink can be seen through her fur
>The leader clears her throat, catching your attention
>"What is it that you can do for us exactly?"
>"I'm glad you asked. We've come with powers granted by our god. We can help plants grow, and can create more of you without stressing your god."
>"The winter is always harsh, and it would go against our goddesses' tenants to not use what we can to aid us. And by creating more of us, do you mean like her blessing of birth?"
>"The very same blessing!"
>"And this love, that feeling earlier..."
>"It is a new emotion, one that the goddesses found upon meeting Father. It is our sworn duty to spread it and to feel it ourselves. Right now you are not capable of truly feeling it, so you'll have to settle with this shared emotions. I'm afraid it's but a ghost of how I truly feel though."
>You feel a gentle joy in your heart, and the group react with subtle surprise
>She scratches her chin, her nose twitching a bit
>"That is very interesting. Returning to the topic of the ritual, explain how you do this."
>"It requires a ritual that will change your body after a few days. Then another ritual may be performed that shall allow a child to be created."
>The other rats appear uncomfortable at the prospect
>"To change our bodies that were granted by Fima is not something to be taken lightly."
>You walk closer to the leader
>"These are gifts that can make things easier for her. She won't need to tire herself out creating more followers whenever your numbers dwindle."
>You stand behind her and wrap her in a hug, making her flinch in surprise
>"And it feels very good. I haven't felt it, but your god has apparently. She wants you to feel it too."
>She shivers before grabbing your arm and removing it, making you feel somewhat disappointed
>The leader has a look of guilt on her face before switching back to her neutral countenance
>"I shall allow the ritual, but you shall perform it on the runt of the litter. I do not want a valuable member being tainted if it doesn't work."
>She points to a rat standing by one of the doors wearing a small amount of armor. "You! Get Eyna and bring the clumsy oaf here."
>"Yes ma'am."
>The rat comes back with another, this one tall and gangly
>"Yes? W-why would you call me here? Did I do something wrong again?"
>"No. These visitors have come by Fima's request, and they say there is a ritual to allow the birth of more young. I do not trust them enough to perform the ritual on someone who matters though. That is why you are here."
>"What!? I'm sorry for messing up, I swear it won't happen again!" but her words fall on deaf ears as a few other rats hold her to keep her from running
>"Wait, you want us to perform the ritual here?" you ask the leader, concerned
>"Yes. Is that a problem?"
>"It's just that our god feels these rituals are best done only around those who love each other. The first ritual is a bit personal, and the second ritual, well, it's like you're showing your full self to the other. Are you sure we can't do it alone?"
>"The point of this is to make sure you aren't doing anything funny."
>You feel your face turn pink as you turn to one of your brothers
>"Trit, could you perform the ritual in front of everyone? If that's okay with you?"
>"If it means convincing others of the power of love, I will gladly do so."
>You smile warmly at him
>"Love is worth sacrifice. Men, turn around please. The rats might watch, but I'd still like to give him as much privacy as we can."
>Although you are looking away, you can still imagine what's happening
>Trit walks up to the panicking mouse girl and puts a hand on her cheek
>"Calm down, you won't lose anything in this ritual."
>His aura of kindness gives power to his words, and her struggles lessen
>"What are you going to do?"
>He puts a hand on her chest and a new feeling washes over you, the same that you felt when your Father god explained love to you
>"You feel that?"
>"I-I feel something."
>"That's the feeling Fima feels for my god, and what he feels for her. The pieces of your goddess and my god inside both of us are reacting to each other. This is love."
>"Love..."
>"Do you enjoy feeling this way?"
>"Y-yes, yes I do enjoy this feeling.
>"Do you want to become closer to me, as I do for you?"
>"Y-yes."
>"Are you okay, thinking of me as one of your own?"
>"I'd be okay with that."
>"Than may we share the love that our god and goddess share. I love you."
>And he kisses her
>Slowly he feels the inside of her mouth, and she joins in
>It's a dance, beautiful in its elegance and what it represents
>The feeling of love is powerful, addicting even
>But you feel that love mixed with a slight feeling of...
>Panic?
>You turn around and see them both on the ground, Eyna latched onto Trit, her tongue not so much dancing with his tongue as mashing it
>The guards seem to be worried, but you put up a hand
>"Don't worry, this is part of the ritual. Nothing has gone wrong."
>You have to blush at the sounds Trit is making, only made worse by the fact the other rats seem to be very interested in the display
>His feelings of fear seem to effect your fellow humans, and they can't help but feel the same
>Soon the fear radiating off of all of you is almost unbearable, and some of the rats turn to face you
>Those hungry eyes
>You can't help but think about running, the only thing keeping you in place is your desire to do your duty
>Eventually she removes her tongue, and Trit takes in some deep breaths and a rush of dizziness overcomes him and he falls asleep, the feeling of love still slightly radiating off of him
>Eyna cuddles up closer to him, taking in his scent
>Questions start churning in your head
>Is it supposed to be like a beast devouring prey? Is this supposed to represent the relationship between Father and Fima? Is love supposed to be scary?
>"Is the ritual complete?"
>"Eep! I mean, yes! The kiss! It should be done, and the change should take a couple days. is there a private room? It has been a tiring journey."
>You need to get out of here, away from these hungry eyes
>The leader looks concerned, but you swear you can see some drool on her lips
>"Is everything okay? I'm getting mixed signals from you. Do you need help?"
>Her hand grabs your shoulder and you can't escape, you feel her hunger
>Many hands moving, tearing at your clothes, licking at your skin, feeling of love so thick you can't breathe, you're feeling dizzy
>Drowning, love, coupling, fear, devoured, love, weak, restrained, love, happy, need, no, nononoscaryloveneednonono
>You see only darkness
>"Calm down my son."
>As you hear a familiar voice, your heart steadies
>"Father?"
>"Yes my son. I'm afraid you've fallen unconscious."
>"Uncon... wait! I'm supposed to make a connection with them, I can't do that asleep! I'm sorry for failing you, Father."
>"Do not worry, you haven't sabotaged anything with your display," a more feminine voice speaks
>"Fima? I didn't do anything wrong?"
>"No, you've done well. My people are the paranoid sort, and I think you've just shown them how fragile you are."
>"You don't think they misunderstood?"
>"They are my people, and I've listened to their dreams. I promise you, everything is fine little one."
>"Oh, thank goodness. Still, to fall unconscious and leave my brothers, I'm a little ashamed. I was supposed to be their leader."
>"When I made you the leader, I wanted to make sure you had a great sense of empathy so that you could inspire the same in others. It is nothing to be ashamed of."
>You feel the warmth that you felt when you were born
>But there is uncertainty
>"Is all love going to be like that?"
>"No. Love comes in many different forms. You have more knowledge than any other on the concept, but understand that you are still young and have much to learn. Those who find themselves escecially empty of affection, or who are especially emotional may react in such a way. It isn't the only way to love though."
>"But what about that feeling before I fell unconscious? I could feel something from the leader. It was a hunger that I never felt before. It felt like love, and yet it wasn't. It may have just been because we were frightened by the reaction to the awakening, but it felt scary."
>"When I made you, I made you weak and fragile. The goddesses told me that the world was dangerous, so to send you out with no protection is cruel. Your feelings of fear inspire an offshoot of love, a type of affection that gives others a desire to protect you and willing to fight for you."
>"But I didn't need protecting. At least, I don't think I did."
>"You didn't," Fima interjected. "But when there is nothing to fight and nothing to protect you from, the fighting instincts are directed at you."
>"So they want to fight against me?"
>"Not quite. They just need to let it lose another way, and I can say from experience the second ritual is a great way."
>Doing the second ritual while afraid?
>"I'm not sure can do that. It's very conflicting."
>The rat goddesses' voice gets quiet, like a whisper
>"Don't worry. Just between you and me, your Father felt a lot calmer afterward."
>A feeling of embarrassment seems to pass over you
>"Please don-"
>"Of course he was shivering the entire time while we were doing it, but-"
>"I'm sorry son, but some of your brothers are in need of my advice! Good luck!"
>"Don't freak out when you wake up! You don't want to get them worked up again!"
>What did she mean by-
>You open your eyes and find yourself surrounded by the forms of your brothers and rats, sleeping on the floor
>You're practically surrounded by the fluffy forms, and the way they hold onto you you are certain you couldn't move without waking them
>It takes all you have to not vocalize your distress

For some reason, I want to be calmed down and soothed from having a panic attack due to nervousness.

Guys, I need help. I've been running into this really cute human a lot lately, and any attempt to get him into my bedroom has failed. So I kind of jumped him in a back alley and fucked his brains out.

He mentioned taking me to court before I did it, but I ignored it because you normally get into trouble for raping a human as there is no law against it. Buuuut, it was only after I finished that I saw he had a collar with the mayor's name on it. Am I in trouble?

You will be if hes injured, you didn't just leave him there did you?
If your heat is that uncontrollable you'll need to get help managing it before someone gets hurt.

Like most anthros, hyenas are rarely in heat without pharmaceutical intervention. She'll probably just put you in a submission hold and cuddle you for a few minutes. That's not so bad after a couple surprises. The worst she might do is give a very aggressive blowjob, hyena tongues are quite rough.
If she is in heat, god help you. Pelvises rarely if ever heal properly. You'll be crippled, and you won't be able to get away from her again.
The best thing you can do in that scenario is give her your all. Hyenas traditionally mate from a standing position, so you might be jumping just to thrust. If she puts her paws around your ass and starts lifting, it's all over.

Is wrestling typical of yeens?

Very, any yeen born with siblings is wrestling the moment they can move.
It's a fantastic way to establish and maintain dominance, and it's just plain fun.
Something to keep in mind, dominance in yeen clans is not typically decided by strength but instead by consensus. The stronger wrestler may be forced to concede if they are a lower rank. If scrawny yeen girl starts putting moves on you, it might be wise to let it happen, lest you earn the ire of her older siblings, or her mother.

Rank is actually hereditary in real spotted hyenas as long as they stay in the clan they were born into. But a funny thing is rank has no bearing on mate selection.

>The pack leader's daughter flirts with you whenever you run into each other
>She's spoiled and can throw money around quite easily, although she's very sweet to those she likes
>The lowest ranked female is sick of the way she treats her lessers
>She's strong and cunning, but is treated like some weak moron and has to share her things with all the higher ranks because her mother was of the lowest rank
>She starts forcing you to hand out with her because if the top wants it, it must be good, and mates are the one thing she doesn't have to share
>Not to mention it would really put that bitch in her place seeing that seeing that the lowest ranked hyena beat her at something

>doesn't have to share
I see somebody is unfamiliar with the concept of baiting.
Though it is usually practiced by males trying to foil one another, I imagine something similar could happen when females are courting males instead.
Basically, that higher ranking female is going to get all her sisters and mom's friends to get together and beat the shit out of you, to remind you how weak your prospective mate is.

>Get attacked by rich bitch hyenas
>Low ranked girlfriend comes in and tries to save me
>She's strong but not strong enough to protect me because we're outnumbered
>We both get beat up
>She apologizes for never being good enough and says that I should take up top yeen's offer
>There's no way I'd be with someone who'd tell their family members to hurt me
>And the fact she tried to help me just made me fall in love with her more

What would happen if a humie boi doesn’t need no strong women?

Don't be silly honey, every boy needs a good woman to love and protect him. How can a human live without a pair of big, strong arms to keep him warm and safe? Or a set of big soft tits to lay his head on? Are you feeling okay sweetie? Come here baby boy, let mama hold you. Hush now don't fight it.

I want my gf to be gentle in almost all aspects in our relationship except sex. Like, I want her to protect me and give me warm hugs but also for her to ravage me and fuck me through the bed to the point where I can barely move afterwards.

A human boy needs a woman that'll treat him right. Not rapist ghetto trash.

Imagine being such a boring, stuck up bitch that there would be humie boys that wouldn't want you.
Go back your cocklet "pride master" you fucking cuckqueen.

At least I have an actual pussy and not some fucked up pseudocock. Why would any humie boy wanna fuck some hynnoid shemale?

Uhg, I am not even going to justify that kind of ignorance with a proper response.
How about next time you ask your humie for permission to leave your scent on him, you also make sure he's okay with you MURDERING YOUR OWN CUBS when he innevitably divorces your lame ass.

Can anyone help? I'm currently sat at my local bar and there's to women currently arguing next to me. One's a big panther woman, who looks like she could probably knock someone unconscious with just a slap, and a smaller yeen woman. Both are arguing who gets to take me home tonight (I haven't even consented to being ''taken'') and i'm worried that someone will end up getting hurt if I don't do something.

I'd say make like a shadow when the lights come on, but that might just rile up their predatory instincts. This should limit the injured to just those two as they lay in pursuit
Or inform them that you won't go with someone who lacks maturity and argues like a small child, or even resorts to physical violence like a thug. Hopefully the shame of such accusation will stop the argument.
Do not find a third girl, this will only escalate matters unless she is of sufficient size to take them both on.

Why do the faces of yeens look so adorable?

It's because they are better. Better than any cat or dog.
Your forefathers should have tamed them, but they were too weak, and lazy.
Hyenas lack those flaws, now we are going to domesticate you.

I'd go for yeen girls if they didn't have penis.

Go for them? You won't be going any where.
They're coming for you, and you're going to LOVE it.

[lolnospoilers]IT'S NOT A PENIS YOU BIGOT[/lolnospoilers]

I dunno. You could easily take me and break my body but I'd never submit to that kind of aggression.

What’s with all the anti-furry women protest that’s been appearing lately?

I'm sure it's nothing but a poor humie boys that are just insecure about their secret desire to be loved. No need to worry about it. I'm sure the cops should dispose of them soon with their cuddle squads.

Would you let a scalie tie you up?

If she isn't going to do some bdsm shit, yes.

Once you're in the rope, expect a lot of teasing.
>"You just let people tie you up? How shameful."

>"Can you even relax without your hands tied anymore? Can you even be excited for something without me looming over your defenseless body?"
>"Oh? Did that excite you, my little rope bunny? You're getting close, aren't you?"

"Yea yea can we hurry this up? My cooking shows are on in ten minutes. I think it's a bratwurst episode."

She chuckles, ignoring your complaint and continuing to stroke you.

>"Silence, bottom."

I love sweet, gentle teasing and when a girl calls you good boy and stuff. I wonder if she would give you a tongue bath or let you snuggle and sleep on her lap. Maybe as compensation or reward for letting her completely milk you dry.

It's an interesting dynamic. Nothing makes her happier than feeling your shivers wash away under her touch. She's got a motherly streak. Maybe that's what she likes about you? She puts the light in your eyes. You make her feel appreciated.

Human guy here, if there’s anyone human here, what is the worst kinds of female anthro customers you have to deal with in the human male strip club, the mall, video game shops, etc.
For me it’s the video games and how majority of the gaming shops, and conventions are mostly female anthros. I mean, I get video games are mostly targeted to female anthros, but I get weird looks from the girls when I play the public demo consoles. They spout things like “you like video games?!” and such.
I also hate how majority of the male characters in video games are often the ones that wear skimpy outfit that looks ridiculous and show too much skin and always use for fan service.

What would anthro girl dating profiles look like?

Depends on the site, if it's something like the "heat" app you'd just get locations and pussy pics of anthros that need breeding.
If you want a woman in uniform you'd try serving singles

Is there anything sweeter than popping a humie boy's cherry? The faces and noises they make are so cute. Seeing their eyes rolls back and hearing their cries of pleasure as you milk their cocks for all their worth is pure bliss.

Yes.
Marrying them and doing that on the honey moon.

Hey guys, help me out here. I was hanging out at the bar, and I noticed this smoking hot mare. She saw me glance at her, and then everytime I looked back she was giving me a sultry look. At one point she even opened her legs and flashed me her panties real quick, and I saw they were soaking wet and it looked like she was winking hard beneath them. I swear I could smell her heat from across the room. What do I do? Do I approach her, or do I wait for her to initiate like most human/anthro flirting usually goes? God I hope she comes over.

Is it ok if I take a crack on this “god of humanity verse” green? I think I come up an idea of a evil rapist dragon captures the son’s of humanity and use him as a rape shack but unable to due to the human’s ability to share emotions to one to the other, she begins to feel something.

Sure, always happy to have people add onto things. Actually, when it was mentioned 'there should be an evil god', I thought that sounded like a good idea. I wanted to put it in after the rat story though.

>Humanity worked to bring the races together
>Although pockets of strife and hatred existed, there was a feeling of peace
>Some individuals joined with other races in order to create cities where everyone is welcome
>Some grew into kingdoms with the passing of many years
>Years that, to the gods, might seem like little time at all
>However, to Xerna it felt like ages
>The goddess was important to calming down the young god
>Where the others were close to giving up, she pushed them onward, to try harder
>Those who might not know her would say that this was purely out of kindness, but was not entirely true
>She was not a goddess of kindness or concern, she was the goddess of greed
>When she saw him, she thought of him like a gold statue, gleaming in the sun
>A statue tarnished by misery, and that, in her eyes, was unacceptable
>Years later, although the tarnish had disappeared, she found herself growing restless
>She had worked hard, and she played the biggest part in making him happy (at least she thought so), so why should she share him with those other goddesses?
>She was more powerful than them on their own with a good degree of cunning, and most importantly no one could possibly desire him as much as she did
>So she made a plan, a plan that would hurt in the short term, but would ensure her victory if she is patient
>When her turn to be with him was over, the newly arriving goddess saw the god with a hole in his chest
>The ruby of his heart was mostly there, but a small chunk was missing
>That night, the head priest of humanity was stolen by the priestess representing Xerna
>The priest of Frin, goddess of birds and vision, used her power to find Xerna's priestess
>They watched as the priestess told him to forget about the others, and that he belonged to her
>He was a very kind and loving man who tried to spend time with them equally, as their relationship was to mimic that of their gods
>So it was to their surprise when, despite his struggles and words of loving them all, he had fallen
>His love for her was stronger than his love for them, and he accepted her words
>It broke their hearts to see such a betrayal
>But the priestess while basking in the afterglow, forgetting the powers of the others, had given away her goddesses' plan
>With the piece of heart Xerna stole, she was planning on making a new heart, a heart made from the souls of humans and dragons
>With her people having been imbued with the essence of the god's heart, humans will not be able to resist their charms
>And once she had enough essence of love between humans and dragons, she could make a new heart that would love her
>And with this new heart, she would finally have her prince
>The reaction was quick
>They brought the city together and told the others of Xerna's terrible deed
>Fearful of losing the love of humanity, the others chased every dragon out from the city
>Some of the dragons felt that their goddess was right and made plans to help speed up the construction of the heart
>Others felt that what she had done was despicable, and renounced their faith in her
>But one thing was for sure, for every human in love with a dragon, that was one step closer to the god of humanity falling for Xerna
>It brought a new question into being
>Is it right to love a dragon, when that love might take away love from others?
>That was a question humanity was unsure of how to answer

Well... here goes my green.
“Son’s of Humany Verse: The day when the moon and sun hugged

Any human who lives in an anthro populated area tell me what jobs do humans often go for? I want to move more into my local city for work but i'm worried that humans won't fit the physical requirements.

I know it's part of the whole scent marking thing, but does my waifur really have to put on my boxers and squirt in them? I have to try and hide pairs so that I actually have something clean to wear, because walking around in soaked underwear would get uncomfortable real fast, I'm sure as shit not gonna wear her panties, and going commando under jeans is asking for trouble.

I say go for it man. Even in construction work there is a demand for smaller workers and smaller hands. Some places require more delicate and nimble fingers. Just remember to take care of your work-partner for safety precautions.

Be careful how you go forward. It can be literally slippery slope. First I complained to my gf about my missing pants, but then I decided to give in. She teasingly gave me her own panties as a apology. As joke I smelled them trying to understand why she likes to smell mine, but now I unironically enjoy smelling her panties when she is away.

Be honest, on nights that you're home alone, does anyone else go and grab their waifurs hoodie and wear it all night? Her smells makes me feel comfortable.

the smell literally keeps you safe from predatory furgirls, besides your gf of course

>try to shower
>she slips in and makes sure i can't get her oils off
>always giving me tongue baths while we netflix & chill
>get my own back by jumping her after working out
>sometimes gets moody that i car pool with a wolfgirl and pickup that wet dog smell

>Be home alone, have one of those melancholic episodes in the empty apartment
>Only real highlight of my life is wolf waifur, but she's been gone for a week
>Spot her favorite loose hoodie strewn over the couch
>Slip it on, nestle some pillows and rub the neck of the hoodie against my cheek, lying back and putting Fellowship of the Ring on the TV, but end up dozing off, thinking about waifur about an hour in
>Sleepily wake up to a giggle and familiar warmth enveloping me, as I feel a wet nose peck a kiss on my cheek
>Waifur came back early and has a shit eating grin on her face, cooing about "not knowing I missed her that bad"
>Promises to fix that in a cocky tone, and slips into the hoodie as well, holding me firmly against her body and giggling every time I try to squirm out
>In the end, we ended up watching the entirety of Two Towers that way.

>vipers when they realize how many males are on the planet and they're warmblooded

>The vipers have passed it into law that every single virgin over the age of 23 can be drafted as a state mandated bf

Gonna give this “Sons of Humanity Verse” a try. This time, is about a a member of Xerna’s women. So, I’ll try my best.

>Ever since the day that these frail, skinny, partially naked in loincloth, creatures walked on this realm, I never realize the day I see my sisters having a pleasant conversation with a different tribe who were once our arch enemies, now our friends
>Our friendship is so strong we even help other tribes to built a city with our strength and bond
>A city where everyone is welcome. Where everyone is treated equal. Where everyone can feel love by the god of Humanity
>Especially a specific human
>A human named, Gem
>Gem is like every human that walk among on this realm. Small, fragile, skinny, feminine, yet different from our mostly feminine appearance
>But what sets Gem apart is his, green, emerald eyes. Glittering underneath the sun and even underneath the shades
>Not only that, but he always looks after me when I was helping out the instruction
>healing my wounds when I fell on the stairs
>tells me where to get items to build
>and so much more
>When the city is finally been built, I finally walk up to Gem and hold his hands and stare at his beautiful glittering eyes
>We didn’t say a word
>We knew what we were thinking when reading each other’s mind
>We had to get a room for us to be alone
>As we were on the bed, going at it, I did not take my dragoness eyes off of him. And neither did Gem.
>He didn’t desire me because of my tribe, or my species’ looks
>No...
>He desired me and ONLY me.
>When I felt the aura of him wanting me
>We both climaxed
>I held him with my arms as we enjoy our afterglow
>Everything was going well. For me, Gem, my sisters, and our friends
>... it WAS.
>we had an emergency in the city’s church
>We were told that Xerna and her priest convince the human priest to love Xerna’s tribe and species that they love the Sons of Humanity more than the rest of the other tribes
>They even told us that if any of the god of Humanity’s sons starts making love, or in a relationship with dragons, it’ll bring Xerna be a lot closer to building a new heart, one that will make every single human to be easily fell in love with dragons
>Half of my sisters we’re appalled by everything the news that fed them and beginning to drop their faith on Xerna
>While the other half agrees with their dragoness priest that they love the Sons of Humanity more than any tribe, as they like to believe
>Not long after, the city started chasing every dragon they can find in the city as me and my sisters who rejected Xerna’s motivation stayed inside of the city’s church
>Once every Xerna’s minions have left, my sisters and I stand in front of the main exit/entrance of the city
>We decided to no longer be around a city filled with humanity as it might be too close to completing Xerna’s new heart
>We’ll also spread the awful news and educate other priest to never, EVER, do this behind everyone’s back
>As I about to take off to catch up with my sisters
>Gem started running towards me
>My heart aches and filled with fear as I felt his
>I didn’t even dare to get a inch closer to me
>Tears begin to flow on my scaly cheeks getting thrown into the air of my speed
>I am sorry Gem, I’m really am...

>humans set up a colony on an alien planet
>find some odd little cute reptilian species that are thick as fuck
>pretty sapient too and quite friendly when they realize humans aren't out to hunt them are share food/chase off the big nasty predators
>also start to get really "friendly" towards humans since like dolphins they have a decently high sapience and no sexual hang ups
>the younger part of the human population full of hormones and puberty jumped at the free sex
>course what no one could predict is the little deviant alien lizards is they can get much much bigger
>turns out given good food and long enough protection from the native predators lets them grow to monstrous size
>now they're apex predators that are looking at for their humans
>they're still just as friendly and "friendly" too

>fantasy setting
>plenty of anthro tribes/cities/kingdoms
>human males have gene that reacts to anthros in crossbreeding that results in the birth of larger and stronger anthros of the mother's species
>this leads to kidnappings and raiding for human males being common from anthros
>though a small upside is a human male has no worry of being maliciously attacked with the intent to harm/kill in anthro lands
>granted, unintended harm coming from over enthusiastic anthro females is very common, but at least they feel bad about it afterwards

>tfw no dragoness gf to help you with your looks and self esteem issues

"I'm... conscious of my looks," you say, fidgeting your hands together.
>"Don't you think you're being unfair?" she asks. Her hand trails up your bicep to your shoulder. You swallow. Hard. Her other hand rises, and both find their place on the side of your helmet.
You subconsciously place a hand on hers to stop her, but make no real effort. She's been telling you you're fine for a while, now.
>She hums, tilting her head. "Very unfair, indeed. How do you know how I feel, until I tell you?"
She slowly lifts your helmet, letting your unkept hair loose, soaking her eyes with your image. You look away shyly, trying not to act until she speaks.
>"Goodness," she says, quickly covering your face again. She turns away, fist on her chin and biting her lip.
You laugh nervously, hoping it wasn't a dealbreaker. "S-sorry-" you quickly say, but are cut off.
>"No," she says, "I didn't think you'd be that handsome."
She pulls your helmet off once again, letting it clatter to the floor. Her soft eyes meet yours. Her gaze is soft; there isn't an ounce of the disgust you'd expected.
>"Holy shit. Please, never comb your hair. You're beautiful."
You don't know if you can ever truly come to accept yourself, but with her approval, you think it might just be okay.

>Human male who has been unable to get a girlfriend because a lot of them think his face is ugly
>He joins the army, partially as an excuse to wear a helmet all day
>Whenever a woman asks to see her dashing savior, she leaves him after she sees his visage
>After that he never takes off the helmet where others can see it
>One day he is sent to fight a dragon, but it turns out there's been a misunderstanding and she isn't as terrible as everyone thinks
>She constantly tries to get him to remove his helmet, 'joking' that she might just fall in love with him
>He refuses each and every time
>It just makes her want to find out more and more, and he gets angrier and angrier with her
>He keeps saying that if she sees his face, if she doesn't leave, he will

>Get onto a tiny cargo ship crew
>Only two other guys, pilot & engi
>Pilot has a get rich quick scheme:

>Tells you they loved humans and our vices. Booze, sugary foods, kids toys, all new to them, highly addictive
>Willing to trade ANYTHING for a taste of humanity
>Proposes the three of you load up on cheap rum, cakes and fidget spinners then head out to swindle those alien hotties of their exotic tech
>Easy money. Ain't no one going to bother a ship of pastry
>Its a long trip. Not expected back for several months. Maybe longer since some trouble at the border forced you to take a less traveled route into a black sector
>No big deal, pilot claims, they call it black sector because sensor range is limited but he's a pro
>Catching up on some reading in your cabin when...
>The ship shakes, followed by a sad whine as the power and lights fail. Gravity too!
>You are now floating in darkness with your possessions
>Looking out the window you see a ship pulling along side
>Its not much bigger than your own, covered in dents, mismatching panels and colorful graffiti.
>Pirates!
>The dull thuds of docking clamps echo around the ship
>They are boarding!
>Heavy metal screeches ring out as the airlock is forced open, a few moments pass before a torch beam flickers past your cabin door, clunking magboot steps gradually approach
>Floating exposed in the air you flail around for anything you can use as a weapon
>From the dark hallway a silhouetted figure appears, shining its light in your face, blinding you
>A cold glove grabs your throat. Instinctively you lash at it its owner, alas low gravity renders your blows mute
>"Ooh" Comes a taunting growl "Feisty"
>You are forcefully yanked into a rum soaked kiss, the pirate wolf chuckling, pouring alcohol out into the air before slurping it up then over your face
>"Nice party boat! Now help me dump this heat!"

>A few months after Xerna's plans were unveiled....
>Dawn was approaching, the skies had begun to brighten, but the stars remained out for now.
>The twinkled, as they always had, since the beginning, save for one.
>It was growing brighter, it was falling.
>With a shriek and boom that echoed across the mountain range, it smashed into the ground.
>Only it wasn't a star.
>Glowing metal pinged and popped as it cooled from re-entry
>With a bang, the hatch slamed open, and the occupant got out.
"Crikey," the exoskeleton augmented man said, "Heaps broke spacial displacement engine bout got me."
>He slung his man-purse over his shoulder, along with a long-rifle, hostlering his pistol and knife.
"Right, lemme see where I got dropped." He mutter, racking a shotgun.
>If growing up had taught the Space Australian anything, it was to carry some dakka.
>That and all his redneck American mates insisted on it.
>He came to a clearing at the edge of a mountain, just as the sun rose over the valley.
>For a moment, he stood there, inhaling clean untained air.
"Heaps green this place," He said, "Betteh see what mannah wee beastie lives out 'ere."
>He made sure his hat was on firmly before moving to explore the area round his pod for some wildlife.
>It was the manifest destiny of Space Australians to coddle every exotic and dangerous life form in the galaxy.
>And if his grandpa could tame and ride horse-sized spiders, Steve Dundee could do much the same.
"Now, where's me a sheila?"
>He'd work on naming the planet later, when his mates caught up with him.
>A short distance away, a wolf girl eyed the impossible.
>Humans, ever since their god had blessed this world with them, were weak, adorable
>They might fall out of the sky, she wasn't sure how they arrived
>They didn't wear strange armor, or armor at all, being champions of peace and love
>They didn't have wiry muscles or scars like a warrior would.
>And they probably didn't go around hunting and making necklaces out of large teeth.
>Being a scout of her tribe, it was her job to locate humans and report threats to the elders and the priestess.
>The Priestess would definitely want to know of this human.
>Turning, she suddenly found herself nose-to-nose of the human she'd been observing a moment ago.
>He wore a very broad, very unnerving smile.
"G'day."

>get on to a packed train after work
>all seats are taken and your forced to stand up
>see an awoo woman sat next to where your standing
>she looks at you with a smile and gestures you to sit on her lap

>Anon looks at the awoo woman, not entirely sure what she was trying to tell him. As soon as he realises the message, his face flushes red, his clear skin doing little to hide how flustered he is. He lowers his head a little bit, trying to hide it, but hus eyes are darting away and back to her, as if asking if she was serious, but she was still looking right at him, smiling. He did have a bag on his shoulder and was getting uncomfortable standing. And the taller anthro lady looked so fluffy and comfortable...
>Inevitably, he gives in to the cravings and slowly seats himself on her lap, upright, looking out of the window with a bewildered smile on his face, trying to avoid meeting eyes with other passengers.

>Lopunny teases you with how easily she can make you come with just her thighs
>says you wouldn't be able to handle her pussy
>try to prove her wrong
>within minutes you're completely defeated again
>she claims her victory prize by continuing to milk you until you're dry

>when you free an ultra she-beast
>when she's too protective/possessive of you
>when her jaws are big enough to take out most of your body in one bite, but she's surprisingly gentle with nipping and licking of you

>dick around with dark magic even after being warned by your teachers
>end up attracting the attention of demons and dark spirits
>way over your head and not powerful/competent enough to handle it all
>until a large and powerful spirit/demon strong arms you into a contract
>she'll keep you safe, but she gets access to the mortal plane
>and full access to you too

“Just any other date”

>It was just any other nights I had. Not that is ordinary to you, but to me.
>As you can tell how I dress, I dress in the most finest, yet expensive, tux for a women can buy
>But why I always dress like that at every night?
>Two words
>Human
>Boys
>No need for explanation
>But I will tell you what happened to me last night
>It all started at a young night
>It was partly raining, and I was just looking for a quick date
>Then I saw him
>A human boy
>Like every human male, he’s frail, skinny, only as tall as every anthro’s boobs, and shy
>He was sitting in one of the benches of a fancy restaurant that I always go to with every human guy
>He was bored, lonely, and look like a need of attention
>So I gave him one
>I sat next to him and said, “Hey....”
>He looked at me with a surprise look on his cute soft face
>”Wanna go out with me on a dinner here?”
>He kindly decline the offer, like all human males always do, but I planted my soft feather fingers and made him turn his head and eyes at me as I whisper close to his lips to my beak “I will pay for you...”
>He was blushing hard and feel the heat from him. That’s where I knew I got him.
>As we found our seats in the restaurant, my date was looking around the decor
>Amaze by it, our waitress gave us our drinks.
>As we ordered our food I lit up a cigar to keep me busy.
>Of course, one of the employees told us “no smoking”. Considering I love being a show off with my money, I payed her a $100 bills that changed her mind.
>The human was a bit amused by my money as I expected. I always do enjoy impressing human males. I always make sure that I run the places on where ever I go.
>As we got our dinner and finished our meal, I called a limousine to pick us up and take us to my apartment
>As we got outside of the restaurant, rain started pouring down
>I laid my arm around the little chimp. His face was slightly red, tired, and giggling
>Guess he must’ve drink too much wine
>I taken off my black tux and gave it to him for warmth
>He had a goofy smile when he saw my muscles and my breasts. Big, but not too big
>Once our ride picked us up, I sat really close to him
>The ride was really calming. Rain hitting on the windows, making a deep humming
>I look at him looking at the windows. Just taking the sound with ease
>I slowly put my hand on his soft cheeks and turn his head at me
>As my beak was about to land his soft adorable lips, he moved his head away and said “My.... owner hates birds. I’m not even allow to be with one either”
>”Owner? Haha.... does it make you... ‘dirty’”
>Before he can say anything, I mowed down his mouth
>He was resistance, but gave in
>We were going down town with each other’s gum making sure we never missed a spot from each other
>He was definitely enjoying this
>Wait until we get to my apartment, that’s where the REAL fun begins

>walk this lost human home
>he keeps giving random directions
>been hours now
>never let go of my hand once
>it's getting dark
>says he's scared of the night and needs hugging
>great now he's locked his limbs around me

>you are a young pokemon trainer just starting out on your journey
>you are exploring a nearby coast looking for water pokemon to catch
>a little ways into the water you see a strong-looking one
>it's a female primarina
>you approach her with the intention of catching her
>she notices you and gives a strange smile
>confident, seductive, predatory
>she raises her arms, closes her eyes...and begins to sing
>the moment her angelic voice enters your ears, you start feeling weak
>your vision blurs until all you can really focus on is the primarina
>you meekly walk over to her in a trance, knee-deep in the ocean water
>she opens her flipper arms in an inviting hug, her voice still filling your ears and her seductive gaze capturing your eyes
>unable to resist the temptation, you throw yourself into her arms
>she quickly undresses you and slides your penis into her vagina
>you cling to her wet, slippery body as you shudder and bask in the amazing sensation
>she already stopped singing, but you can still hear it resonating in your head
>she watches with a satisfied smile as you desperately thrust into her, moaning submissively
>she doesn't even need to do anything anymore, you are surrendering to her body on your own now
>you quickly reach orgasm and you can feel the last bit of resistance erode away
>you don't care about being a pokemon master anymore, you don't care about anything else, you just want to stay with your primarina mistress
>happy with her catch, the primarina swims off towards her home while you cling to her, still weakly thrusting your penis inside her, worshipping her, wanting to submit again to her pussy

>Be taking a shower, calmly washing the dirt off from your hard job of taking care of anthros
>It's so calming, you could stay like this for awhile
>Suddenly there is a bang
>"Anon, are you okay!?"
>The hyena you were just letting stay with you kicked open the door
>"What the hell!? Get out! I'm taking a fucking shower!"
>"Alone? You might get hurt! Give me some space, I'm coming in."
>She pushes into the shower
>"... D-do you have to be so close?"
>"It's the best way to make sure you aren't hurt... Mind of I scrub your back?"

>Watching my favorite streamer who’s a cute humie twinky boi gamer
>Gamer humie bois are so rare
>He’s a really nice guy with a wholsome mindset
>Majority of his chats are just horny anthro girls going thirsty in the chat and leaving lewd comments on his chat
>However most of his time when he reads the chat, he always mistook them as literal advice but somehow they accidentally helped him in a game that he was stuck on
>”Thank you, Humiebo-, uh... humieboilslover, if that’s how I pronounce it, that really helped me! *mwah*!”
>He loves giving air kisses to the camera when chat helps him out
>He doesn’t get the obvious message
>That’s how wholesome and oblivious he is
>The humie boi streamer goes to his customization of his human avatar
>”What should I wear?”
>Chat helps him on the “best” clothing for him.

>fantasy setting
>long ago a cataclysm/grand war happened and humans nearly went extinct
>humans turned to a primordial fertility goddess for help
>she blessed all humans to save them
>has a result humans can breed with any species now
>needless to say humanity managed to survive and bounce back to a stable, but slightly smaller population again
>issue is, that primordial fertility goddess's blessing is permanent
>now humans are doing decently well again, but face the issue of being compatible with pretty much everything
>human's new racial ability does get taken advantage of by monsters, animals, and savage tribes/species
>makes it worse that nature has caught on to humanities breeding abilities and all sorts of creatures see humans has viable mates
>the upside is that humans have little worries of being killed by wild beasts now, but the local monster population can see a sudden increase due to a teenager going out in the woods to fap only to get grabbed by something that was drawn to his fertile scent
>clever tribes/savage species will take advantage of this to bolster their numbers and many a human settlement has been raided in order get a hold of breeding age humans
>even the more civilized races will use humans for their abilities, but at least they pay them or ask, most of the time at least

Day 17 of invasion
>It was official, Tyranids had been sighted on the planet, you were damned doomed
>So much for backwater colony that had nothing worth invading over and boring career in the PDF.
>A long range patrol had gone dark after requesting more men been sent in to investigate
>The interplanetary Auger station had also gone dark, so command was essentially blind
>Hence why your company had been sent to go and get it working again
>Into the thick equatorial jungle...which could be crawling with xenos, that wanted to eat you
>Given that you were somewhat shorter than average, you often struggled with all your gear, but you
kept going.
>The Commissar and Techpriests were in a hurry...who could really blame them with what was coming?
>Still, something was rather unnerving bout the dense jungle, doubly so when you were only six hours away from the Auger station.
>Everything was far too quiet from what a jungle should have been, everyone was on edge
>Four people had gone missing on the trek, which alarmed the Captain, his men didn't just wander off.
>Commissar was foaming at the mouth however, vowing to execute them and the former patrol for a litany of reasons.
>The Techpriests vocalized things along the lines of "Weak Flesh," and "Ignorant meatbags"
>Everyone shut up when the Auspex began beeping
>Wall of guns.exe
>Safeties click off, heavy weapons are set up, makeshift barricades are established in all of 15 seconds.
>All that greets your ears is silence and heavy breathing...
"Thirty meters out, unknown lifeforms.signature anomalous and weak."
>Auspex has a range of up to 50 meters, must be all the plant life in the area distorting the scan
>Then it starts screaming, and the ground beneath the auspex wielding Techpriest opens up, swallowing him.
>Then the jungle explodes into movement, the Tyranids have the entire company surrounded.
>Quills and strange spore filled pods start hammering away at your defenses, or hitting unfortunate guardsmen
>Fly variants swoop in, raining down biological munitions or grabbing guardsmen before slipping off.
>Then things take a turn for the strange when stun grenades start landing around you.
"Grenades!"
>The Commissar is screaming about treacherous filth before a lasbolt takes him down.
>The thought of guardsmen turning from the Emperor is bluntly shoved away by several loud bangs.
>Damned stun grenades.
>It was then that the ground itself exploded, and serpentine Tyranids lunged out
>Guardsmen try their best to hold off the new attack, but it's not enough.
>Several men are tripped, coiled, or outright tackled by Raveners, weapons and armor coming loose.
"They's too many of them."
"We can;t hold!"
"Why do they have ti-mmmppphhh!"
>You lasgun fires a few times before a spore mine lands right on the edge of the formation, throwing you through the air.
>You cough, trying to get air back into your lungs, noticing the thick pinkish fog wafting out of the crater.
>It gets in your lungs a few seconds later, your coughing fit intensifying for a moment.
>Everything gets hazy fast, and heat stars to pool in your core and slightly lower.
>Seeing as everything has gone to the fraking warp, you do the only thing you can think of.
>You get into the fetal position, close your eyes, and fall on your side, waiting for the end to come.
>It doesn't, oddly enough.
>You don't hear screams of pain and the ripping of flesh, but armor being torn apart and wet slapping.
>That and your fellow gaurdsmen protesting grunting, gagging, and making some rather embarrassing moans.
>You open your eyes to see heretical activities of the slanneshi kind, leaving you utterly confused.
>The Tyranids aren't killing your brothers in arms, they're fucking them. Or the ones you can see.
>You've been left so struck you hardly notice as a Ravener slithers around you, surrounding you with its...her...body.
>Claws capable of ripping right through you gently reach out and touch, feeling you up as she rumbles gently.
>A long sinuous tongue trails across you neck and along the side of your face, following up with nuzzling and nips.
>She easily lifts you up into sitting position, before dominating you with an approximation of a kiss, one with lots of tongue.
>Even if the spore cloud hadn't fogged up your mind, you have the feeling that She'd end up getting what she wanted from you.
>You fumble with the clasps of your armor, and she cuddles you closer, purring like a well maintained engine.
>The last coherent thing you can recall before your mind was overcome by the haze of pleasure was her words.
"Yes...breed."
>The day was coming to a close, and the Tyranids lounged about with their exhausted prizes.
>The humans had been worn out, some had succumbed to sleep.
> Others drank the sugar and protein rich nectar from the Tyranids chest glands...breasts was the human word
>Mind-probes from the Lictors had revealed the Guardsmen's objective, and an alarming one at that.
>That sensor could not be activated before the rest showed up, valuable biomass could be lost.
>The small, unique hive mind, split off from the greater one, could be lost.
>While most of the humans had been captured, a squad sized group had broken encirclement and would soon reach the Station.
>The local Hive Tyrant had reassured them not to worry, the sensor station was garrisoned by more... kindred individuals.
>And when that squad arrived, the Tyranids would have more men to enjoy and bond with. Soon...
>No, not yet...but soon.

>get bullied all your childhood by a furgirl
>teases you, wrestles you, makes you serve her
>many people tease you about your "girlfriend"
>it suddenly hits you just how obsessed she is
>the way she keeps following you, and gets extra aggressive towards girls that talk to you

spotted hyena girls gotta be fun and confusing in high school
>bully to assert dominance
>bully males they like less harshly
>big and strong and aggressive
>like smaller and more compliant/submissive males
>presetting erections are submissive gestures in spotted hyena social/body language
just imagine you stereotypical school bully in media, but the bully is a she and wants to fuck the nerd too

The human boy is oblivious to the whole situations and took the lewd remarks as actual advice for the game.

>"This type of enemy causes me a lot of trouble. Is there an easier way to handle them?"
>"Take out my dick? Oh, you mean my dirk!"
>"That's much better! I guess I use the spear a bit too much because it helps me reach into tight spots."
>"The dirk is a bit more risky, but the faster jab will really help me finish them off!"
>"Hey, maybe adding glue to this weapon would help keep me safer."
>"Take that, you're all covered in white glue now! I love my dirk!"
>"My underwear? That sounds silly why would I go down to my underwear. Heh, I'll do it for you though, because I love you all."
>"Wow, there is actually a massive speed difference without armor! This might fit my current build better."
>"Thanks, you never let me down!"

>as he's streaming, the door to his room is kicked in
>it's a gator girl who's been watching his stream for months and is tired of his oblivious teasing
>she fucks him right on stream as the chat cheers them on

kek! More? Maybe I’ll give you my prompts.
>Super chats tries to spend more money just to ask if they can order pizza for him
>One of the members in chat tries get online just to meet him and stream with him just to look good

If he's cute and wholesome, I want a cute and wholesome plot
>He has a girlfriend, sometimes she sleepily sits next to him while he streams and gives him advice
>He's having problems with a part and she offers to beat it for him
>She runs to a corner, spins three times and glitches through the wall, runs on invisible platforms and uses a bomb glitch to stack 65,536 explosions that one-shot the boss from a parallel dimension in the span of 7 seconds
>She's a professional speedrunner and she's super fucking smug about beating levels for him
>Other than that one time, she likes to give him really bad advice

>his fanbase embrace the wholesome meme
>his charity-streams usually top their goal by signifcant amount
>the charity organization sends their special thanks to him and his fanbase
>he gets teary-eyed and tells how proud he is of the community
>promises to do poll what he will do for the next stream
>drunk-stream upcoming

>sick of being harassed by furgirls while walking around the city
>keep getting groped and pawed off on public transport
>take some self defense classes
>its full of furgirls. obviously
>they don't even let you learn, keep trying to pin you in various positions before using you to get off
>tutor breaks it up
>offers some private classes at night. just her
>on the mat she treats you as equal, a student, its rough even if shes holding back a lot
>shows you how to use size to your advantage, how to escape grapples, the places to squeeze that make horny anthros think twice before trying to mount you uninvited
>it works on your daily commute
>never works on her
>each time you get close to controlling her she'll overpower you. giving you a face full of her squishy rear till you tap out
>its not like the other girls though, shes not hurting you, constantly checking that your alright, adjusting her body so you are comfortable
>sometimes you don't give in just to see how far she'll go for a submission
>right now you've got her grinding on your face and nosing around your cock
>casting matching grins at each other you both wonder who will strike out first from this position
>only one way to find out

I forgot if Orca was ever brought up here
>superstrong villainess that enjoys toying with you more than her actual plans
>chases you around so she can pick you up and hold you

>"You're too late, Super Lam! I have the reporter Louis Roads!"
>"You fiend! What are you playing on doing with him!"
>"I have created a powerful serum. After consuming this, my sexual prowess will surpass everyone elses! He'll become addicted, Lamb. Your little boyfriend will forget all about you, and he'll be my lover!"
>"Why? Why are you doing this?"
>"Because he was always supposed to be mine! But on that fateful day, you stole him away from me! Now I'm just taking him back!"
>"You won't get away with this! He has a right to choose who he loves!"
>"I'll let him choose who he loves. Just accept that once he gets a taste of me, I will be the one he chooses."

Okay but what if your gf has an impregnation fetish but self-inserts as the male in her fantasies?
>Middle of heated sex with your dominant gf
>"Oh yeah Anon, gonna knock you up! Take my litter~"
>Awkward pause
>She's fucking embarrassed

>"Humans, we have successfully repelled the alien invaders! Thanks our brave soldiers, you will not be forced to mine on distant planets, or work on alien farms!"
>The humans applaud
>"I'm afraid that after all this it would be wrong to have you return to your old life. You can't defend yourself the way you are, so we have set up special broth-training facilities for you. We will require all human males to join us so that you may defend yourself in case of another invasion."
>"What about the women, ma'am? They want to fight too!"
>"Oh, uh, men are better fighters, yeah. I'm sorry, but this is a fact. The galaxy is a dangerous place, and we must be pragmatic. But while the males are training and fighting you will need to replace them. The males will be the soldiers, and the females shall become the cogs of industry!"
>More cheers ring throughout the crowd
>"Man has found its place among the stars, and our species will be there every step of the way! In combat you have seen our wrath, but in peace you shall know our affection! May our species become closer than ever!"
>The alien walks through the back curtains
>"I don't think the females suspect anything, but we have to make this quick. If any man disagrees to the 'training' send out the stealth teams. Remember, we need enough human males for the soldiers and the politicians who funded us. I refuse to deal with pissed politicians and soldiers!"

smothered in 7ft of fluff, tits and love making every day a good day
>they take turns on breastfeeding you and kissing/licking your forehead while you sit in their laps
>they also take turns on draining your balls dry

>They have locked you in their hug while you sleep in the same bed.
>can only enjoy the bliss of their softness until they wake up
>they give you a kiss followed by tongue bath.

>They do this at the same time
>You get fucked by one while sitting in the other's lap
>You're in a cage filled with their sweaty scent and as you're moaning you're unable to hold your breath
>At least you get lots of kisses

>You are away for short time
>literally just went to the store to do some groceries
>the moment you get to home they tackle you teary-eyed because you where away for eternity
>Your punishment is to be their boytoy for the rest of the day

Just imagine asking a cute little wolf anthro on a date and she brings all her sisters with her.

>hold her hands
>everyone else wants to join in
>kiss her
>same thing, they all want one
>she wants to make out
>manage to get rid of them for a while
>they can smell it and barge in demanding their turn
>wind up having to cum on them all otherwise they'd ride you in turn till they are satisfied their sister isn't holding out
>...she wants to start a family with you...

I had a funny thought about the legality of such a situation
Like if you wanna get married but polygamy is illegal, so your big brain lawyer convinces them the pack counts as a single entity like a corporation.

Documents requiring the wife's signiture must be hell to sign.
>Husband: Anon Ymous
>Wife: Linda Rita Elizabeth Francine Leslie Daisy Wendy Wolfgang
And imagine other fun things about having to date a bunch of wolves who are legally considered one person.
>"So, um, I see you brought most of your family."
>"Yeah, you have to get to know them if this is going to work out."
>"Oh, this Anon is a cute one. Hey, how about we head to the bar?"
>"We are legally required to tell you that Francine has been arrested for attempted sexual assault."
>"Are you trying to ruin my night?"
>"Being in jail would definitely ruin a lot more than everyone's night. Don't make me regret not asking you to empty your pockets."

>When they made Jurassic Park, they were concerned that dinosaurs might eat men
>They were right to be worried about them craving human flesh, but it wasn't in the way they expected
>To be fair, making them all female didn't exactly help their cravings

>Giving a human the right to vote

I just don't understand why they want it. My husband talked about wanting it and I asked why, and he said 'what if a man wants to be something other than a house husband'. He was much quieter after I fucked him into a stupor. He's so sweet, but he can be a little dim sometimes, always following the crowd.

I know! Remember the last time we let a human male lead our town before? Human males are for protection. The next thing you know, human males be walking around town alone.

What happened last time?

These are only tabloid rumours but this is what I gathered
>the human mayor was popular but somewhat naive
>had a solid economic and city development policy
>the wife was a bitch tho
>entitled human thot
>mayor spend most of his time at work
>bureaucracy efficiency plummeted since he rewarded all the employees with head-pats and called them "good girl"
>then came the Christmas party which turned in to an orgy
>photos were leaked and the wife was furious
They really should stop giving us head-pats if they are not willing to feel the consequences.

How do you pick up humans without scaring them away? I don't want to be mean!
Humor. Humies love a girl who can make them laugh, helps put them at ease. From there you can move onto compliments, tell him he smells nice, run your fingers through his hair, tell him he has pretty eyes. Human boys melt under any kind of appreciation, they don't get near enough from their own """women""".

>make a gameshow about humans and anthros
>it's a sort run/survival style game
>human guys compete to run and make it through puzzles and obsticles
>set up in different environments like urban, forest, swamp, Savannah, snowy, etc for each episode or season
>have go pros on to show their perspective and drones and other cameras setup in fixed areas to watch the games
>anthro women are scattered around the environments to try and catch them, chase them, and work has living hazards and obstacles
>like gator girls in the swamp, cougars stalking in the mountains, lionesses in the tall grass and so on
>they're all naked and maybe some themed accessories
>the humans get to wear clothes, but most is pretty form fitting
>they get more or less depending on the environment they're in at the moment
>they get eliminated by being caught and fucked by an anthro
>they can struggle and try to fight out of their grip, but are pretty much fucked, literally, when caught by one
>some scenarios have the humans being hunted and others have the anthros has traps for them when they get a puzzle wrong or take the wrong path/route
>not only do the anthros get nice a paycheck and the fun if chasing human boys they also get to keep the guy caught had their new boyfriend/boytoy untill the season is over
>course this means the show can go through anthros pretty often when they retire to stay with the guy they caught and took a liking to him

>Crystal maze
>But you are locked in with a horny anthro if you fail
>She teases you as the timer ticks down
>Team can trade you back for the money room at the end
>More cash sticks to your cum soaked body
>Some teams tactically lose to get more money
>Some refuse to be freed because they enjoy it so much

>gradually learn more about /pofg/ space, wolf pack and this ship
>crew is all female, mostly canines, they just chill & laze around the stars in silent running mode. listening out for the next big score
>not all of them think a human should be walking around in clothes but you smell like the boss, puts you off limits for most
>turns out the doc is rather unruly
>taking great delight in getting you alone for a thorough examination
>"Say, do you see any fur boys strutting around hummie?"
>first came a body scan, you strip off for it
>"You know this whole galaxy is female? 99.9% they say. Till we found humans-"
>there is an odd look in her eyes, something primal flickering beneath the surface. now her razor sharp nails tapped menacingly upon your nude chest, a wicked smile creeping over her face...she wouldn't dare hurt you
>would she?
>using her weight to firmly press you against the scanner she started to grope with her paws, resisting risked a nasty cut
>"-Which means you or more specifically-"
>her pads brush over your balls, making them tense up. muzzle nudging into your ear
>"-These juicy orbs, unf yeah. Hot commodities"
>then came the stern command:
>"Pups. NOW!"
>this crazy girl was not messing around! seemingly reveling in the mixture of fear and arousal she was inflicting upon your body
>"In my paws or pussy boy. The only choices a human need make"
>just then a deep growl from behind made the mad doctors fur spike up, her paws fell away from caressing your trembling sack
>"Oh! Er, Beta i-i wasn't i wa-aaAH!"
>a pissed Beta wolf grabbed the doc by the throat, lifting her clean off you then slamming her onto a bed
>gal was a real powerhouse, peppered with battle scars but treated you like a lil sister not a cum dispenser
>"Alphas first, mine second. Final warning"
>turns out you were requested on the bridge
>where an excited Alpha tail wags. she found a comet for you to name!
>oh, also pick a nearby yeen ship to screw with

>Having a drink alone at a pub
>Huge minotaur woman walks over and sits next to you
>You both start talking, she offers to buy you a drink
>You decline at first but she eventually wins you over
>Night goes on, you exchange stories and jokes, she puts an arm around your shoulder as you share a laugh
>You’re having such a good time that you don’t realize how many drinks she’s putting in front of you
>Last thing you remember is her laying you onto a bed and removing your clothes
>Wake up the next morning with a huge hangover, and a pelvis as sore as your head

"Anon, how about we pray together at the shrine?"
>"What's wrong?"
>"Oh, don't worry. My religion doesn't think human virginity is something to be thrown away like the other religions. We love human virgins!"
>"Just one question, you don't have any appointments this day or tomorrow, right? It takes time to give a human virgin the respect he deserves."

>you brought him penguin today
>EMPEROR penguin
>and he gives you this look
>just like pic related
>like your cooking isn't good enough
>like you don't do everything for him
I swear to the gods, skinnies can be so fucking frustrating at times. Why do they bitch and moan so much about "dietary variety"? Like penguin doesn't have everything you could possibly need!

>Yeen has to be aggressive in public
>Really just wants a way out of gang life

Day 22 of Invasion
>Be in the imperial guard, more specifically an armored regiment.
>You've had a good run, you were part of a good crew, and you guys had a good tank.
>The Leman Russ Eradicator had seen you through more than a dozen worlds.
>Now you were gonna get eaten by Tyranids, all because the regimental commander had an ego.
>Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge was an absolute toad of a woman in all definitions of the word.
>She was located in her Baneblade Rightuous Indignation towards the front of the formation.
>It had a specially built extra-large hatch to permit passage of her wider than tall body.
>She was of noble birth, and had a halfway decent grasp on tactics, which the rest o the regiment picked up the slack.
>This time, she'd gone into the deep end. and was charging a formation of Tyranids without much intel.
>There had been a lot of conflicting information on those Tyranids, some of it nearly impossible to believe.
>Apparently, rumor had it the Tyranids were all female...very female...and had been abducting guardsmen.
>It had been two days since the formation had set out, and you were now entering an area the locals called the Scrub-land.
>Islands of trees in a large grassy plain, set before a large equatorial forest. This was where the Tyranids had to cross.
>The Toad's grand plan involved digging into those islands of trees and blasting at the 'nids until they stopped coming.
>This would work, if a Genestealer cult wasn't using the deep space scanners to jam most of the orbital sensors.
>That and the heat scans were useless thanks to the dense foliage...so nobody knew exactly where the Tyranids were.
>Your tank Commander could only agree, as had the only sane Commissar in the regiment, Commissar Wolfe.
>So, you all had a few good laughs, and started heading into the final battle you would ever be part of.
>Nervously, you clutch at the forward bolter's handles, thumbs over the triggers, panning back and forth as you scan for a target.
>Forest is another hour ahead when it all goes to shit.
>Forward scouting unit stats facing Tyranids, mostly gaunts with a few warriors mixed in.
>Odd part about the initial report is that they are in foxholes and trenches, scattered near the little forest islands.
>The Colonel is not happy about this, and either tries to bellow order into her vox caster or eat the damned thing.
>Toadie Commissars translate this as drive the damned xenos filth out, those are our positions to occupy, not theirs.
>Grudgingly, your unit does so, Your tank and a Punisher pushing up the front, a Hellhound to the flanks, and a standard Leman Russ at the back.
>Then it starts raining spore mines and other Tyranid munitions, all over the place, and with odd effects
>Some of the spore mines slow to a stop a short distance off the ground thanks to parachutes, and belch out immense clouds of smoke.
>Within moments, a wall of thick fog tinged pink surround the tree islands, and more are landing around the forward parts of the formation.
>Then the Tyranids start pummeling the column with all manner of munitions, with a variety of effects.
>It would seem that the Tyranids are using a mirror of the Colonel's "Grand Plan" against her.
>Upon realizing and/or being informed of this, she proceeds to voice her feeling on the matter to everyone in earshot
"REEEEEEEEEE"
>Suffice to say, things go very bad, very swiftly, but through no fault of the vehicle crews.
>The fog is thick enough to hide the large breeds of Tyranids, Tyranofexes, Exocines, Carnifexes, the works.
>Everyone began to clump up, turning their guns outwards and hosing down swarms of gaunts.
>But then they change tactics almost immediately, shooting and advancing while in cover.
>Then the ground starts opening up near tanks, as Raveners eject from the soil along with groups of warriors and Genestealers.
>Your formation is able to avoid encirclement, and Commissar Wolfe is sane enough to know when to fall back.
"Tactical Withdraw," He orders from his Vanquisher, "Cover each other and keep moving. Do not stop."
>The withdraw immediately takes place, as all but the mos stubborn/insane individuals would see the folly of sticking around
>Doubly so with the way this ambush had taken, and was still taking place.
>Radio chatter indicates that most of the column is being immobilized and disarmed. And that the Tyranids do have boobs.
>Most notably, they use some kind of rapidly hardening resin to immobilize their targets, preventing them from escaping
>Even as you hose down a Ravener, you note entire tanks are coated in bony resin or thick webbing, weapons destroyed.
>Odd behavior for a race who exist to consume all in their path, especially as reports come in of guardsmen being grabbed.
>THen shit hits the fan, as a chimera on the right explodes, the work of a Baneblade cannon.
>Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge was definitely pissed, executing her own people for running.
>Clearly, she and most Commissars think it is do or die...and as such, are chasing down the "defectors"
>Suddenly, the Leman Russ is knocked clean over from below, and you are slammed up against one of the walls.
>A few seconds later, you and the rest of the crew bail out, laspistols drawn ad scrambling to catch up
>You do not want to get left behind, but it's clear that you might not have very long to clime onto a vehicle.
>Something massive screams, and you turn to watch what happens, curiosity overcoming common sense.
>The largest Ravener you've ever seen was charging the Righteous Indignation, claws wide.
>A hole is blown through it, and you can see the fat toad smiling sadistically from her perch, as she turns the stormbolter toward you.
>Death is only prevented when the world around you explodes tossing you into the air a few feet and dumping you into the dirt
>Your ears are ringing and vision is blurred, but you've grown used to shell-shock, so it passes quickly.
>The Righteous Indignation is covered in bony resin, webs, and quite a few weapons have been blown off.
>The toad, somehow, didn't get hit by all of this, and is struggling to heave herself from the hatch.
>You can hear the sound of her cursing easily, even with the battle raging near you
SCREEEEE
>The frak is that?
>A giant Tyranid you've never seen before come out of the hole next to your tank and runs at the Baneblade.
>It covers the distance in moments, knocking a few smaller Tyranids out of the way.
>It has no problem lifting the screaming fat woman from the tank, before it's chest suddenly opens.
>Colonel Amelia Astor Emeline Annabele Adele Sambridge was popped into its chest=mouth like a hors d'oeuvre
>The thing takes a few lumbering steps before lurching to a halt, and expelling the Colonel, retching and gagging.
>Well, who would think a race of xenos that literally ate everything in sight to be picky eaters?
>moments later, she's given a thorough coating of rapidly hardening resin, immobilizing her entirely
>Didn't see where the crazy nid was, but seeing as you lost your laspistol, you don't want to draw attention to yourself
>You come around a dirt embankment, only to see a sight that makes your blood run cold
>It's a damn Exocrine, and its aiming for the retreating armor with its bio-plasma weapon.
>Not only that, it seems to be aiming for Commissar Wolfe's tank, as though it knows he's coordinating the retreat.
>You have to stop it, but how do you stop a Tyranid the size of a tank...run up and stab it in the ass.
>Speaking of ass, it isn't half bad for a massive insectoid monster that fires plasma
>A bit of fluid dribbles down as it shifts slightly...and if your awkward first time with a woman had taught you anything...
>You run forward, beg the Emperor for forgiveness for what you're about to do...
>With your running start, you slide under the creatures short stubby tail, and spot your target.
>It's oddly human looking, if a little up sized and drooling copiously
"For the Emperor!"
>Years of being the forward gunner on a Leman Russ ensures your aim it true.
>Your hand slips inside easily thanks to the lubrication, and thankfully, there are no teeth.
>You manage to get halfway to your elbow when she clenches down and gives a bone-rattling shudder.
>Grimacing, you begin thrusting your fist into the creature, doing your best to fight the gripping muscles
>You have the most awkward and shameful boner right now...but if the creatures breathing is anything to go by, it's distracted.
>You spot a familiar nub of flesh, and decide to double down on this heresy.
>Bio-plasma screams from the creature and strikes the ground fifty meters away, showing everything in hot soil.
>You permit yourself a moment of triumph, the rest of the regiment should be safe...for now at the very least.
>The deep rumble from above reminds you just where you are, and the flesh gripping your arm tightens.
>It raises its tail and backside, before it starts thrusting back, causing you to smack into her enormous ass.
>For a few moments, you;re treated like a combination of paddle-ball and dildo.
>You were not prepared to be used as a sex toy, much less several tons of ass striking you at high speed.
>You go tumbling, coming to rest at the edge of a crater, with a sever case of tank shock.
When it clears, you're staring up at a panting Exocrine, a very long tongue hanging from its fanged maw and....
>By the Emperor, each of its...her boobs, are bigger than you...how did it move with those things?
>And why was the cannon giving you bedroom eyes?
>With a growl, one of the enormous talons impales your pants through the crotch.
>Then it kisses you, and by kiss, you mean force about a foot of tongue into your mouth.
>Your jaw aches, and the hot, slimy muscle invading your mouth wriggles in your throat.
>Your trousers are torn with ease, exposing you dick to the Exocrine, and to any onlooking Tyranids
>Breaking its kiss, the Exocrine trails its tongue down your chest before giving you a few licks
>You do your best not to react, but you still squirm under its touch.
>Suddenly, it stops, before glaring up at its cannon, which is glaring back? Alien Biology
>Suddenly, the damned plasma cannon is leveled at you, the opening twitching slightly.
>Your first instinct is to dodge, but you're suddenly under a barrage of quills and a spore pod.
>You slump back down to the ground, a dozen quills in your limbs and a spore cloud engulfing your head.
>On the lip of the crater, a few gaunts engage in what sounds like laughter.
>You can be bothered to think too hard on that, you feel really hot for some reason, and its heading south.
>You can hardly move as the Exocrine takes your dick into its plasma cannon.
>Thanks to the tongue-job earlier, you slide in as the opening grips down on your cock.
>Then the damned thing vibrates somehow, and you groan from the sensation.
>Why does this feel so good?
>As you begin to reach your climax, you come to a sudden understanding that these weren't mere Tyranids.
>They had to be Daemonids of Slanessh...it explained far too much of this perverted mess.
>All further thoughts are cut off as you erupt, moaning like a virgin.
>Panting, you come to your sense as a shadow is cast over you.
>The last thing you see is the Exocrine's ass coming down atop you...there were probably worse ways to go
>Be General Powerstache
>Your glory days had long since passed, and you'd been stuck on this backwater planet because of politics
>No more glorious charges
>No more grand Campaigns
>Just making sure order is kept on this new colony
>You've faced the Great Devourer before, you knew how it worked
>This world was doomed, no matter how badly you stalled.
>To make matters worse, they were all very much female, and were like rabbits in spring.
>Normally, this would not be so bad, but the sector governor had decided that his new colony would be founded by prisoners
>Only male criminals were sent here, and without a woman in sight...some were less reserved.
>Desertion was a problem, and the Commissars were barely holding things together.
>Commissar Wolfe managed to save 30% of a doomed armored regiment, a small miracle.
"Sir, servos skull with a message for you."
"Hmm, what does it say?"
"It's marked for your eyes only."
>You motion for the servos kull to play its message, and the face of a haggard Guardsman appears.
"This is Sergeant Greg Mansfield of outpost 13," He announces, "This is probably all manner of heretical, but I think I've found a weakness in the enemy."

>somehow win position of mayor in a small town
>only human around for miles
>all the townspeople are demons of various sorts
>turns out they spearheaded you being mayor because it's the job of a mayor to take care of the town and it's people
>though with you being a human male and all them demons their view of "taking care of" takes on a lewder tone

How do feel about name calling? Would you be okay with your waifur calling you a slut while she pounds your pelvis into dust?

I really like namecalling. Imagine she's ironically condescending.
>mess something up
>"Aw, I guess I shouldn't have expected anything less."
>knowing smirk as you tense and blush
>"Is the little humie all flustered? Adorable. How about I come over there and we help you unwind?"

isnt it a little... misanthropic how furgirls always draw humans as weak and helpless?

Humans are always weak and helpless.
Sure, some of them are stronger than other humans, but it's not like that matters at all.

>tie humie up
>strap vibrator to his cock
>leave for work
>come back at the end of the day
>humie is still tied up, only now he's covered in his own coom, and is overstimulated beyond coherent thought and can no longer feel his legs
>untie humie, pick him up and carry him to bed and lick him clean
He's sleeping it off right now. God, he was so cute with the way he was twitching and babbling. Love seeing humie boys get their little brains addled from too much pleasure.

>anthros cooing and awwing at humans bundled up in winter
>personal space is invaded even more at the point

>Be human, walking in the antarctic
>See a group of penguins a ways away
>One turns to you, and you wave to her
>Suddenly she screams "lost human!"
>They all come running, and soon are piling on top of you
>"Don't worry, you won't be cold anymore." "There's nothing to worry now that we're here." "I wanna keep him!"
>You tell them that your jacket is fine for the environment and you know where you're going
>Immediately after one tears it off, along with your shirt
>You feel even colder as they start licking your body and coating you in a film of saliva
>"Look girls, he's so cold! We're going to have to do some serious work if he's going to be warm!"
>"We can keep him after this, right? I mean, we are saving his life."
>"It's only right that he return the favor, so I don't see why not."
>And that's how you joined a group of penguins

imagine trying to do work or research out in the wild only for native anthro women to take too much of an interest
>getting picked up at random and being proclaimed you are hers now
>really cold or hot environments having the local anthros fretting over you
>helpless to water anthros when swimming

>Get assignment to tanker crew
>Hell yeah, get to drive a tank
>Turn up for training and you've been paired with 4 giant shark anthros
>At first you think nothing of it
>But then you spend an hour inside a hot, humid cabin together
>Whoever dropped these girls in this unit was either a logistical idiot or a perverted smartass

>Be alpha female
>Used to males of your species trying to get something out of you
>Sick and tired of their manipulative games
>One day you see someone hiding out in the bushes
>One of the males keeps bothering you, hoping to get into your social graces, but you don't care
>You swear you heard the person there say 'beautiful' and 'majestic'
>Pretending to walk away, you secretly circle around and catch the person unaware
>It's a human, and a very nice looking one too
>You can't stop staring at those shorts either
>"Human."
>"Ahh!" he yells and turns on his back
>He starts trying to crawl away but you grab his leg
>"You think I'm beautiful, huh?"
>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to bother you! Please let me go!"
>You think about it
>"Human males are considered dominant, correct?"

>Than again, his attempts to escape are pretty cute
>You bet he'll feel wonderful beneath you

I feel like some type of weirdo for the fact that im not even really interested in getting fucked or having my dick touched by a cute amazon fur girl.
Im far more interested in licking her vagina for hours on end.
You don't think anthro girls will tease me for this will they?

>and your off duty hoodie was gone. he loved to sleep in that, looked so cute on him to boot
>the archives were right about males. they naturally seek out quiet places to unwind, monasteries in the old days, leashing them used to be considered cruel
>he had to be in the upper turret. it was usually left on remote control and empty
>even better
>peeking into the dimly lit compartment you could just make out a hooded human in the chair, bobbing along to some music broadcast from the planet below, in his own world
>stripping off you quietly released the door lock, sneaking in. he'd never hear your soft pads approaching
>the turret was covered in his sweet scent, stalking closer made you so excited. almost dripping wet with the anticipation of making an alpha mate of him
>with a slow, smooth motion so as not to frighten him too much you pull the hood over his eyes
>"gotya!"
>his partial squeal was adorable. tensing up in shock then quickly relaxing into the safe touch of his alpha
>so trusting he didn't even lift up the hood as you sat bare furred on his lap!
>accustom to long cuddles together his hands hugged your hips, not finding any fabric to hold onto they began to wonder up and down
>leaning into him you nuzzled under the hood, guiding the boy into a deep kiss. his head tilted to the side for your tongue, arms securing themselves around you. no words were needed. he wanted this
>slickness dripped from you onto baggy top, quickly soaking in
>he let out a muffled moan. were you hurting him? with a gasp the kiss was broken
>"hot" he panted "too hot"
>oh, it was just your higher body temperature cooking him. easily fixed
>a single swift motion had the human nude and the hoodie sailing down the corridor
>it was all he had on!
>the look on his face was adorable, surprise, awe, excitement
>taking his hands in your paws you hunkered down upon him. grinding against his groin. getting it utterly drenched

>such a wonderful set of noises came from the boy as you did, desperate squirms, sharp breaths, whimpering moans. seemed like he really hadn't been bred before!
>it was just too much for the poor guy
>you tried holding him back from instantly orgasming to your heat
>that only worked for a moment. betrayed by your own desire to breed instinct boiled to the surface
>letting loose a possessive growl your body clamped the human to his chair, pounding wildly on his cock, tail thrashing with joy as it erupted in cooling cum
>more MORE!
>he let out a cry as you bit hard onto his shoulder. marking him yours. getting an extra load of spunk out of him
>wait! that must have hurt him!
>snapping back to reality you relax over the limp human, gently licking the hard love bite
>his face has a dazed, glazed over look. beads of sweat are trickling down him. heavily panting while his eyes roll around

I wonder why people aren't more interested in them.

How unethical would it be to groom a young human boy into being your perfect mate? Asking for a friend.

Incredibly unethical, but I mean, who cares? It's not illegal.

I mean, if I happen adopt a little human orphan, and he just so happens to be entering puberty, it wouldn't be weird if I taught him how to pleasure a woman, right? I mean, better the woman who knows him and loves him best be his first, than him getting molested by some stranger , right? This is all totally hypothetical, of course. I would never, ever try to abuse my power as a child's guardian to satisfy my own perverted desires. No. Never.

It would definitely be weird. Super weird. But I mean, who would know? It's just a human. If you teach him, hypothetically, how to really get his tongue in there, you'd be getting off. Does it really make any difference what does or doesn't happen to a human if you get your nut?

Right? A-and it'd be doing him a favor really! When you think about it. I mean, puberty can be such a scary and confusing time for a young human, and they're already so naturally submissive and obedient to anthro women, he needs a woman who he can trust to teach him about how his body is changing. It's not wrong, not really. Right?

>Dragons are notable for their ability to hypnotize humans
Imagine walking a long and lonely road when you meet a dragon. She greets you warmly, and the moment you hear her voice you feel as though you can trust her. You have a conversation. As she speaks, you find it harder and harder to think. You recognize this, and begin to realize that you're in danger. You apologize and make to leave but she stops you. You're fully panicking now: you know something bad is happening but you can't make out what. She says you must be scared, walking this road alone at night.
When did the sun set? How long have you been here?
She offers to let you stay at her lair until morning. Or if you'd like, to stay longer. Why should you get to where you were going so soon, anyways? It's not like you're appreciated where you're from. And she does appreciate the things you do. She goes on at length the favors you've performed but don't remember. How her home and scales had never been cleaner. How you provide such wonderful company.
She's so glad to have you. She's always wanted a pet.

Nothing wrong with horror. Fearboners are the best boners.
Helps that I've always enjoyed the idea of being kidnapped by a big girl anyway.

I know you're not okay, anon. You say you are, but you're not.
You're all alone. You don't talk to anyone. I see you cry sometimes.
That's okay. Tonight, you won't be alone. I'll make sure you're never alone, ever again.
I can't let you go. I know what you'll go back to.
Even if you fight it, I'll make you learn to love me.
Your struggles are so weak. How have you survived this long without someone?
If you can't fight me off, you can't protect yourself. But that's what I'm here for: to protect you.
From yourself, if need be.

>anthro gf is super sweet
>feeling particularly subby one day, you ask her if she could do a little namecalling
>she does her best
>"You want to get called names, you fucking slu-"
>She coughs, and starts laughing
>Feeling self conscious, you ask her if she's okay, and apologize for it
>After she calms down she explains that it's impossible for her to feel that way about you, and everything about it feels wrong, but she respects your fetish
>She adds that she's gonna try again, but in a way she thinks is more fitting
>"You want it, you fucking good boy?"
>"Look at you, begging for my touch. What a fucking sweetheart."
>"Strutting around all handsome-like. I bet you look good just for me, don't you?"
>"Admit that you're cute. Say it!"
>"No, don't cover your face. I want to see your reactions when I tell you how much I love you."
