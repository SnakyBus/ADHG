Tech Terror Story
TT #2: Trickle Down Rumors
>To many in the Concord of Saviors, Split Hare was a humorous type that helped keep things from getting too serious
>She played her fair share of pranks, cracked jokes, and was always up for fun with the rest of the girls
>So when she came in with a hunk of junk vaguely resembling the head of a robotic villain that had eluded capture for a while, everyone waited for the punchline
>As she told her peers about what happened the previous night, they wondered why she didn't start laughing along with them, instead looking like she was quite serious
>The first to break the awkward air around what was perceived as stilted humor was Floodgate, a Beluga with control over all liquids
>"Hare dear," the aquatic mammal said with a twinge of concern, "you are just practicing your poker face, aren't you?"
>The rabbit shook her head, showing her and the rest of any onlookers the inside of what was once the high tech helmet
>"You know I can't keep a straight face very long, just look at this!" she said as she pointed inside the helm, "Tech Terror isn't a robot, or even an Anthro!"
>Murmurs made their way through the small crowd that had now formed, all with their own theories of what the villain was
>Some of the more confident members of the group asked to see the helmet, to which the speedster obliged them
>"Why is it so busted up?" a rat asked, "I don't smell anything other than metal n' burnt plastics!"
>"Yeah, what gives?" a snake agreed after trying her method of 'sniffing', giving the helmet back
>"It may have blown up a bit back when I tried picking it up," Hare says as she recalled the self destruct
>It kicked in shortly after she had touched it, starting to vibrate slightly
>She couldn't risk collateral damage, so she had to bring it under the nearby lake
>It wasn't too big of an explosion, but it had warped the inside to a terrible degree, making it very hard to determine what shape the helm was supposed to have
>And on top of that, bringing it underwater had help strip it of anything those with gifted scent could use to confirm or deny her claims
>No one would blame her for how she handled it, dealing with bombs in as quick and safe a manor as possible was part of the job description
>This however did nothing to make her less embarrassed with herself, what little proof she may have had being wiped away by her own doing
>It seemed as though nobody would believe her
>That was, until a curious observer made herself known
>A blood hound who went by Dogmata, armed to the teeth in gadgets and gizmos for any occasion, not unlike the villain in question
>Very stern, always focused, one hell of a tracker
>And one of Split Hare's long time friends
>"Hare, may I?" asked the canine
>She nodded and gave her the helmet
>"Think you can work some magic?" the rabbit asked hopefully
>Dogmata didn't respond, already at work with some form of multitool
>For a moment, nobody said a word, all eyes and ears were upon her
>Then with a click, the face plate popped open
>"Interesting..." she said took a look at the less damaged portion that had been revealed
>The crowd was starting to get antsy while they waited for the master investigator's findings
>Only to get disappointed when she shook her head, saying it was inconclusive
>She promised to take it to her lab and get results
>Everyone began to disperse from the area, but Dogmata gestured for Split Hare to follow
>They both went to a secluded area in the giant building
>Split Hare asked what was up, garnering a frown from the somewhat surly dog
>"Jane," she said with her arms crossed, "do you know what you've just done?"
>The speedster had no idea what she meant, but knew the answer wouldn't be a good one since Dogmata had just used her real name
>"You just announced to everyone that there is a human super villain out there. Do you really think all of them will just keep quiet about this?"
>Not fully understanding the reason this might be a bad thing, Split Hare, or Jane rather, instead focused on something else
>"Does this mean that you believe me?" she said, almost dizzily ignoring the issue that was posed
>The hound sighs in annoyance
>"Even if it makes no sense whatsoever," she admitted, "I trust you not to make something like this up."
>She shook her head, looking down at the helmet
>"Regardless of that," she said in a much more serious tone, "word WILL get out now, and what do you think will happen when a bunch of thugs and psychopaths with super powers hear about it?"
>When contextualized like this, the real problem finally became apparent to the now wide-eyed heroine, simply saying "Oh" in realization
>Dogmata set the helmet down, patting her pal on the back
>"It will be fine," the dog said in an effort to soothe, "we're just going to need to get to him first."
>This cheered up the rabbit, bringing her back to her usual demeanor
>"Now," Dogmata said as her informative visor dropped over her eyes, "let's find a way to force a confrontation."
>As the two superheroes started to form a strategy with some other friends in their circle, Dogmata's theory was made reality
>Within the day, some of the greener heroes had decided to hunt after information about Tech Terror possibly being a human
>This of course meant interrogation of other criminals
>They knew nothing of the sort obviously, but ended up in jail with others who had the same thing asked of them
>Low level gangsters talked with each other, boastful that even they could take on a super if it was a human
>This caught the ears of those with affiliation to villains, dirty cops and enforcers alike
>Rumors were like a wildfire, growing out of control as more participants joined in
>'Maybe this Tech guy stole his stuff from Dogmata', 'What if it's actually a shapeshifter?', 'Maybe she's a demon who stole some poor bastard's body'
>It happened like this all the way up the tree, until those who were truly dangerous had been informed
>Those especially dangerous being the criminal syndicate known as Dark Chimera
>Deep within their stronghold located in the center of a dormant volcano, they were in the middle of a meeting to discuss possible targets for their next operation
>Ideas included weather machines, invoking dark sorceries, political subterfuge, the bread and butter of evil
>When it seemed as though all the options had been laid out, a shark asked to include another
>Primevil, the only true chimera of the group as well as its leader, allowed the addition
>Riptide of the Depths slid photos around the table of a mid grade supervillain
>"I was recently informed of an up and rising supervillain." said the shark as she had the various shots of Tech Terror put on the big screen
>They were all taken from the bank where his heist had failed
>"He's been shown to have aptitude with all forms of technology, and there is little evidence he even exists". she said while using a laser pointer to draw attention to various sections of the photos
>"Excuse me seabreath," said a rabbit in gear resembling that of Split Hare, "did you just say 'He'?"
>The shark decided to let the childish insult off with a sneer, this time at least
>"That's right, I said he," explained the now somewhat irritated villainess, "I have reason to believe this is a man."
>Those in the meeting all began to pay more attention, leaning in
>"Many of my servants have heard that heroes have been rousting whoever they can, all asking about this thing right here being a human" she said elaborated, circling the image on screen for emphasis
>"So what?" questioned the same impudent rabbit, "I like a good shag like anyone else, but what are we gonna do with some skinny in a mech that we couldn't do before?"
>The leader slammed her huge claw on the table
>"s i l e n c e w h e l p" came the ethereal words of the chimera, speaking not with vocal cords, but straight into the mind of the rabbit
>The mental intrusion made the upstart mammal quiet, Primevil nodding for the shark to finish
>"We could always use someone who can keep things quiet," said the shark while glaring back at the dull colored rabbit, "and if all else fails, he would make for a grand bargaining chip."
>Questions circulated in an organized fashion under the gaze of the Primevil
>The shark took them all and addressed them like one would at a business meeting
>Q: How would we get him to join us?
>A: Blackmail of course. He seems to be going after very specific targets, so if we can narrow down what he is after, we can get at them before he does. Force him to come to us.
>Q: What worth does he have to the Concord?
>A: Going off of what my minions have told me, many of its members are very interested in this one. The reasons why don't matter as much as the fact they want him, and we'll have him.
>Q: Who gets to have him?
>A: This is not important to our operation. If you really can't help yourself, clear it with everyone else first. As with all our other endeavors, pleasure comes after business.
>"That should be all for the moment," said Riptide as she finished her proposal, "thanks for your time."
>A vote was counted for which projects would be put forward, with 11 of 13 votes giving the green light to Riptides proposal
>Thus, by the end of the day after his secret was laid bare, Tech Terror found himself with a worldwide target on his back
>He knew what his prior failure would bring forth, it would be inevitable in this world
>This could all be avoided, a simple life could be his at any moment if he just stopped right now
>But that same burning sense of pride and ambition that brought him so far wouldn't have it
>His greatness would once again be admired, he would once again be an icon, an aspiration
>There would be no substitutes for someone like him, his superiority would be acknowledged
>With that thought helping him along, he continued toiling away in his workshop, working towards making sure his victory was assured
>This was the only way
>The rest of the leaders of the Concord were all made aware of the situation from Split Hare and Dogmata, and although they also had a hard time believing it at first, that didn't stop them from readying a capture
>The man was drawn to the Arkanian Relic, which Split Hare had recovered after their confrontation
>From her other accounts, he had stolen various other specific items
>Nothing was known about what purpose they served, but they were all unobtainable anywhere else, including the most recent target
>The answer for them was simple then; set up a honeypot with the gemstone, then fall in when he took the bait
>Dogmata had cameras all surrounding the perimeter of the predetermined bank on separate networks, all made to look as civilian and nondescript as possible
>She had also taken the liberty of making more Energy Signature Triangulators for the rest of the team, making them shielded from E.M.P.s to avoid a repeat of last time
>Lastly, they had chosen a bank located in the territory of a few novice heroes to help sell the facade
>All the pieces had been set, they only thing missing was the quarry to spring the trap
>A month had passed in the blink of the eye, during which nothing had happened
>The greenhorn heroes had continued grilling other criminals about Tech Terror, more and more were alerted to his presence
>So when action had finally come about, chaos ran wild
>The Relic was once again out in the wild, but something felt off to the villain
>He couldn't place it, so he had his scout drone look at not only the bank, but everything in the area
>All of it was exceedingly average, but the twinge of paranoia was still present, and so he poured over all the information he gathered
>Then he noticed a pattern in the security cameras on buildings around the bank and a few blocks outside of it
>Despite them all being for regular businesses, they looked brand new
>He had his drone attempt to splice into one of their feeds, but it was blocked
>This wasn't right, consumer brand cameras were notoriously easy to hack
>His eyes widened in horror as he noticed the drone's output was starting to be traced
>He hit the self destruct protocol and sunk into his large chair as it severed connection with him, rocketing into the atmosphere before exploding
>He knew at that moment what was going on, and it meant he would have to delay his plans even more now
>Just upgrading his regular arsenal wouldn't cut it, he was dealing with the rest of the big shot heroes now, not just Split Hare
>So back to the drafting table he went
>It was grueling work for one person to do, supergenius or not
>But he wasn't taking any chances with his future
>He had to be on top of every possibility, every failure had to be stamped out, every danger to his success purged
>If he couldn't do this quiet, there was no reason to continue as though it was a possibility
>But as he scrapped idea after idea, a spark of brilliance struck
>Why let it be himself vs the world?
>Why be a dreadnaught when you could be a legion?
>And so he slaved for the next three weeks
>He would have preferred much more time, but there was an emergency
>The bank was already being attacked
>Goat Squad of Dark Chimera had begun their assault on the bank
>It consisted of LagoLess, inverse of Split Hare, Riptide, and Baphomet, dark spellcaster and the leader of the squad
>Civilians, anthro and human alike, had been corralled into the lobby and tied up
>Baphomet prepared a gateway to cross into the vault while the other two kept watch for any issues
>A smooth and easy job, just like they liked it
>That is, until the large front doors on the building had shot off their hinges in a shower of water
>Before they knew it, their hostages were disappearing in a blur
>It was only LagoLess who could perceive her eternal rival, seething in rage at her appearance
>She bolted after her without care for anything else, the two speedsters clashing once again in a way few could see clearly
>Through the destroyed doors came the huge whale Floodgate, both of the aquatic animals growling upon seeing the other
>"What are YOU doing here?" they both said to each other
>"You're ruining everything!" they both yelled at each other
>"ENOUGH." they both screamed as they rushed towards the other in a torrent of water
>"Team, what's wrong?" asked Baphomet as she continued her ritual, not able to take her eyes off of the spell she was preparing
>"Team?"
>When no response came, she had to drop her concentration and let the spell fizzle out to find out what was going on
>Her rectangular pupils dilated in shock as the saw a stream of heroes flood in through the busted down doors
>She tapped upon her dark crystal necklace, sending a message back to HQ
>"This is Goat Squad, we are in need of backup immediately!" she voiced with great urgency, almost bleating
>Primevil responded telepathically from the great distance, receiving no answer from the spellcaster as she found herself in battle
>She then tried to contact the other members of the group, having no difference in the result
>Left with no other option, the chimera scrambled both Snake Squad and Lion Squad for a rescue, grumbling under her breath as they were deployed
>By the time Tech Terror had made his way to the bank, there was a small scale war between the two different organizations
>Not only that, but it seemed non affiliated heroes and villains had joined in as well
>This was very distressing for him as he drew near, so many variables to account for, the capacity for that accursed randomness was sky high
>But when he thought about the circumstances more, he realized it could be a boon to his efforts, not a hindrance
>If he could play his cards right, he might be able to get away with the Arkanian Relic while they were busy pushing each others snouts in
>He decided to descend from the ceiling, hopefully avoiding the majority of the massive fight he could see from the lobby and street
>His entourage of AI controlled helpers followed his lead, helping him laser out a hole in the ceiling
>They all flew through the hole they had made, immediately working the vulnerabilities of the massive vault door
>A few from each side had noticed the third party as the massive vault was opened, informing the others of his presence
>The novice heroes that the territory actually belonged to were the first to get at him
>Tech Terror relegated finding what he came for to his upgraded drones, devoting all of his attention to the approaching supers
>A flying wolf announced herself with grand gestures, the two other supers at her side
>"Lucky us, this is that so called human supervillain!" said the boisterous wolf while hovering just above the ground
>"So called?" queried the filtered voice, "Why make the distinction?"
>The small group of three giggled
>"You know anthros have humans beat in every category! Come on, just give yourself up, we'll make sure you get some leniency if ya do."
>The wolfess folded her arms thinking that he would consider her words
>Perhaps it was their inexperience, maybe even some ingrained feeling of entitlement to the obedience of the men they protected, but they really believed he had surrendered when he put his hands in the air
>Of course, that made what came next even easier
>His suit's hands took the shape of claws, extending at breakneck speed towards the two closest heroes
>Neither were expecting it, so they could only flail about when the claws grabbed them by the face
>"Hmphphphph!" they both cried out
>Out of a small dispenser in the palm of the metal hands came a potent knock out gas, the struggles from the heroes ceasing soon after
>Letting the unconscious heroes hit the ground as his arms retracted back to his side, Tech Terror turned to the remaining hero who was standing in awe of his unparalleled ingenuity
>Or so he wished was the case
>"W-What did you do to them?" the slightly shaken heroine asked as she looked upon her comrades unmoving forms
>The metal man waved off the question, saying "Nothing much, they'll just feel numb when they wake up."
>He then assumed a more aggressive pose, pointing at her indignantly
>"Shall I do the same for you?"
>The heroine, also a wolf, snarled at the notion
>"As if! Human or not, I won't hold back!"
>The wolf leapt at the villain with her fists raised and her super sharp energy claws out
>The fight was of average length to some, but to the two speedsters it was a slugfest
>Blow for blow, tit for tat, the fight went on at a ludicrous speed
>Their speed made every hit thunderous
>The two were almost evenly matched
>But in the end, Split Hare stood over her dark reflection victorious
>Sore, but victorious
>Despite her hard fought win, she found herself very peeved at the situation
>The whole operation was going belly up, the wrong people took the bait
>She had wanted the best chances of bringing in that misguided man with as little resistance as possible
>But after today's fiasco, it was very possible he would stay under wraps
>That was the case, until she had received a transmission from Dogmata
>"Hey 'Mata, what's up?" she asked into her transceiver as she prepared special cuffs for LagoLess
>"Looks like our target still came around. Get over as soon as you can."
>The speedster breathed a sigh of relief, confirming she would be there
>She grabbed LagoLess and ferried her to the closest prison she could at lightning speed
>Though she would often make small talk with prison staff, she had no time to faff about today
>With haste, she made her way back to the bank
>Things were going relatively well for the machine marauder
>His bots had gotten the gemstone, and any who were foolish enough to not take him seriously had found themselves on the ground
>That wasn't to say this was a flawless victory by any means
>His trusty shoulder cannon was ripped off in a moment he was outnumbered, and he'd used up many of his ammunitions
>But even then, the pile of supers grew, and he hadn't even needed to bust out the big guns yet
>He and his bots flew back through the hole in the ceiling, only to be greeted by a fist to the face
>As he shook it off, he looked upon the perpetrator
>"Dogmata," the robotic voice said as the metal shell it came from assumed a defensive stance, "I had a feeling I'd see you here."
>The bloodhound had also taken up a stance of her own
>"It was supposed to be a surprise," the canine responded with a trained lack of emotion, "I take it you knew we would be here?"
>The supervillain scoffed at the remark
>"Of course I did, especially after my last encounter with that blasted rabbit. Speaking of which..."
>The suit turned suddenly to the side, a millisecond later catching the speedy fist of a very surprised Split Hare in its' large metal hands
>"Wha?" was all she could say before being tossed away, getting caught mid-air by Dogmata
>"I am afraid that won't work on me again." the villain said in his filtered voice
>The rabbit was left dumbstruck, while the blood hound maintained a cool and collected composure
>"How did you see me coming?" the hero asked with bewilderment
>From inside the suit, Tech Terror grinned
>No one could see this of course
>"That's the best part, I didn't!" he said with glee, evident even through his artificial voice
>He then realized what he was doing thanks to his interactions with other supers and villains in the past, stopping himself from elaborating any further
>Having stood back up on her feet, Split Hare began thumping the ground in annoyance
>"That doesn't make any sense!" she said as rushed forward into a flurry of blows, with Dogmata close behind
>Every single punch she threw, every kick she let loose, all were blocked and deflected with ease by the suit
>As this was happening, Tech Terror noticed that it seemed that the force behind the attacks was less than he had experienced before
>Before he could continue the train of thought, Dogmata had gotten up to him and somehow flipped him onto his back
>For him to be able to keep up with Split Hare, yet also not be able to react to the significantly slower throw, this confused both of the heroes
>Using his thrusters to propel himself into the air, Tech Terror hovered far above the ground
>He prepared to use a rocket salvo, but was forced to react to a lightning fast jump kick by the suit's programing
>A grave error in the strategy he came up with arose, and it wasn't just him that noticed
>As long as his suit automatically defended against Split Hare, he couldn't use anything else in his arsenal, nor pay attention to any advances by Dogmata
>His suit was getting hammered by the duo's efforts
>The dire situation he found himself in called for his trump card
>Still able to command his drones via voice, he called out "Strike bots! Triple Trouble!"
>His swarm of helpers came together, linking themselves to one another magnetically
>What was once one hundred and twenty little drones became three robots equal in stature and appearance to Tech Terror
>They then came after Dogmata, forcing her away from the fight at hand
>This left Split Hare and Tech Terror to fight by themselves
>"Why are you doing any of this? Why fight us TT?" the rabbit asked as she continued fighting
>Amidst all the fighting, the science supreme skirted around the question, instead saying "Oh, I get a nickname now?"
>Dogmata was slowly losing her ground to the bots, and Split Hare found the fatigue from her prior battle start to wear on her speed
>It all seemed to be going badly for the veteran heroes, until a burst of water erupted from the hole in the ceiling
>Emerging from it was Floodgate and an armadillo with a shell fashioned to look like a medieval knight
>They didn't quip or say anything, they instead got right into the fight with the bots
>This was the edge they needed, gaining ground on the machines
>Tech Terror could see where this fight would heading if it continued from a mile away, it wasn't one in his favor
>He might hold ground now, but more would join in as time went on
>He had to fold right now
>He disabled his RACE (Rapid Acceleration Counter Engine) long enough to key in his lair's coordinates for his teleporter
>This led to him taking some attacks straight on, but it was necessary
>He also ordered his bots to do the same
>None of the heroes knew what was going to happen except Split Hare
>"No! Don't do this! We can help you!" she said as she tried her best to get at the teleporter, failing to do so
>With a sharp crackle of energy, the teleporter field surrounded the villain and his inorganic minions
>"Who said I wanted your help?" said the man in the machine before a flash had whisked him and the bots away
>Split Hare, physically drained from everything, came over to check on her equally tired friend
>"Are you alright?" she asked as the bloodhound pulled out her teleporter tracker
>"I'll be fine," the gadgeteer said gruffly, "But we may have a problem."
>She showed the fleet footed rabbit her tracker
>There were 121 individual teleportation locations
>Split Hare's jaw dropped
>"That's... quite a lot." she said simply
>The blood hound put away the tracker, offering a pat on the back to her now saddened friend
>"Don't worry about that too much, we'll come up with a new plan. We made some big arrests today anyway."
>She pointed at the police vans picking up the member of Dark Chimera
>"Besides," she said as she reached into one of her many pouches, "he'll still be after this won't he?"
>She pulled out the Arkanian Relic with a slight smile
>The mastermind pounded his observation table in anger, what he had thought to be the gemstone cracking even further
>A fake
>He was certain, 100% CERTAIN that he had the real deal
>It had to have been during the fight, there was no other point it could have been switched
>That mutt had to have swiped it from him before his bots came into the picture
>It was all enough to make a lesser man cry in anguish, seethe in anger
>But that wasn't the man he was
>This was all just the result of a panic reaction
>Yeah, that's right, it was that other group of bozos that forced his hand early
>He hadn't failed, merely just a trial run of his technology
>...
>He knew was kidding himself, another big blunder
>Chance had forced him to acknowledge his own fallibility once again
>If he could, he would strangle the very concept with his bare hands
>But he hadn't the time to cry over spilled milk, nor his inability to defy the chaotic entity known as chance
>His bot diversion would only distract them for so long, he had to get moving
>Even without the final component, the machine in its' penultimate condition would help him
>He wired the thing to his lair, allowing it 20 minutes to charge up
>Then he pressed the big red button
>With a synthetic hum, he and his lair both zapped out of reality for a moment, abandoning the secluded area beneath the mountains for a new hideout
>This would not be over
Split Hare #227: An Anthro's Duty
>Yesterday came and went
>I got to see some real action, we all made tons of arrests, and celebrations were in order
>We all were at the Concord sanctum's lounge, living it up
>Even that grumpy old dog Debbie was up to some drinking with the others
>But even with everyone in high spirits, I couldn't shake those last words from TT from replaying over and over in my head
>"Who said I wanted your help?"
>Even though he still used that modulator, it wasn't difficult to imagine how it would sound in his true voice
>"Who said I wanted your help?"
>Gah, how could he even say that? Does he really not know what could happen to him?
>"Who said I wa-"
>I am released from my inner thoughts as someone taps my shoulder
>Looking over, I see it's Armordillo with a martini in hand
>"You okay Hare? Saw you looking all lonesome over here."
>I give her a half hearted smile and thumbs up, not even fooling myself
>She breathes heavily as she smashes down into the seat across from me
>That heavy metal shell must really take it out of her sometimes
>"Something on your mind?"
>Well, yeah
>"Oh it's nothing Arma, just thinking back to yesterday, that's all."
>She seemed to be waiting for me to go on, but I didn't
>It dragged for a bit, but she eventually called over the bar tender
>"Can I get another one of these?" she said while pointing to her drink
>She looked back over to me as the drink was being made
>"Still thinking about him huh?"
>Right on the money
>I nodded, not really caring to avoid it or anything
>"I get how you're feeling girl, nobody here really wants to talk about it much."
>We both looked across the lounge over to a small but loud group of rookies, each with a guy on their arm
>"Well, most of us at least." she added on
>The bartender slides the second martini over to her as she says this
>She downed the first really quickly, giving off a shudder and a silly face as she did
>It made me laugh, she really knew how to snap me out of a bad mood
>The second drink is gently nudged my way, the little skewered olive making a full rotation around the glass
>"Just don't let it get to you too much alright? We still need to be on our A game around him, human or not."
>I played around with the olive a bit, agreeing with her
>He was still a supervillain at the end of the day, he could really hurt others if he wasn't stopped
>But it was still hurting my head trying to wrap my mind around what would drive such a cute guy this way
>Even moreso that the only other person to keep up with my movements was a human of all things
>It was all just so much to take in for a short period of time
>I toasted the glass with my heavyweight friend and downed the drink just as fast as she had
>It was bitter and boozy, but whatever buzz it might have brought me disappeared just a few moments later
>Not a big problem since I didn't really drink, but having a hyper metabolism meant alcohol was little more than a social activity for me
>Armordillo hung out with me for the rest of the night, ordering a couple more drinks and trying to get me to unwind
>I had the rest put on my tab, least I could do since she was helping me to feel better
>After we part ways later into the night, I reflected on what she had said as I sat atop my usual spot on the highest building in the city
>She was right, I needed to come at the situation with clarity, I needed to be at my very best
>Whether or not I could save this guy all hinged on how I acted from here out, I couldn't let how I felt about it get in the way
>It's just... I... I couldn't bear the thought of another life being extinguished because of me
>I look down to my paw with a grimace
>My lightning hued gold and white fur
>A side effect from the accident that gave me my powers
>And a constant reminder of my failure
>Dammit TT, why are you putting yourself at risk like this?
>You must have someone that would miss you if things turned sour, why put their hearts in the firing range?
>I pull out the melted lab pen I carried with me always, reminiscing about him again
>John, I, I'm sorry I couldn't save you
>Tears nearly well up as I think back to the days before I was superhero
>Everything was so much more simple back then, when I was just a scientist
>You made even the most simple parts of research so fun John, you were the best assistant a girl could have asked for
>Your sweet smile always made coming in late less stressful, and you always had the best reactions when I messed up your soft brown hair
>And you were one of the few people who would actually have good bantz with me
>I just wish I had listened to you on that day
>I'm sorry
>...
>Oh geez, maybe drinking actually did still work a bit on me
>Dwelling on the past didn't really fit someone who was always moving forward, especially me
>Definitely the drink, nothing else
>I didn't feel any different though, I felt just fine
>And I knew just how insane my tolerance was since my last tour of Russia
>So it wasn't the alcohol then, but what was it?
>Maybe my worse half had really messed me up yesterday
>Bruises were all over before I had even gotten at TT after all
>I felt the back of my head under my cowl where that evil me had hit the hardest
>No pain, no soreness, no nothing
>My speedy healing meant the possibility this was brought on from the fight yesterday was thrown out the window
>Then why was I being so... so... reflective?
>This wasn't my style at all
>The chilly night wind made me twitch a bit
>It reminded me of the last time I confronted that tin can without it being alive
>Actually yeah, I only started feeling all weird when I found out he was a human
>This was his fault!
>That smooth face of his, those determined eyes, that soft brown hair
>If things were different, I might have even asked him out
>Though that might just be because he reminded me of John a bit, but he was a real cutie
>Wait... why did I just think he reminded me of John?
>Yeah, the brown hair was a given, but was there more?
>I focused more on what I saw that night
>The helmet came off and I saw his face clearly, but I couldn't think over the initial shock
>I compared what I remembered against each other
>Down the list, feature for feature, I found myself more and more aghast
>The hair styling
>The shape of the nose
>Those eyes
>That voice I should have recognized immediately
>"John!?" I couldn't help but blurt out in the open to nobody
>How the hell didn't I realize sooner?
>How the BLOODY hell hadn't I known who you were the second I saw you?
>I stood up and immediately started sprinting to Graceful Fields Graveyard
>There was no need to blame myself just yet, I could afford to cut some slack
>After all, why would I assume he would just be walking around when I attended the funeral?
>In a speed fast even for me, I was at the headstone within moments
>Well maintained, no signs of disturbance
>I cursed myself under my breath for what I was about to do, but I had to be sure
>Grabbing a shovel, I excavated the grave in mere seconds
>One grizzly sight later, I had a few hair follicles in my possession and a nauseating need to vomit
>Though not of the religious sort, I still felt the need to offer an apology
>Both to John(?), and to the god of all anthros, Anima
>At a slightly slower speed due to the queasiness, I rapidly refilled the grave
>With my little macabre visit taken care of, I rushed back to the Concord
>The lab was of easy access to a founder like me, so I had the analyser at work on the hair in a jiffy
>Unbeknownst to me, Dogmata was already in here
>Even with as long as I have known her, I still couldn't find her unless she wanted to announce herself
>"Late time lab usage? What's the occasion" she said from behind me
>I was flustered by the sudden voice and found myself stammering
>"O-oh D-dogm-mata! You know, just s-some normal heroing!" I lamely said as I leaned against the computer table
>She stared at me blankly before squinting
>"Is that so?"
>She tried to look at the screen behind me, with me blocking her view as much as possible
>"I would think 'normal heroing' would mean you wouldn't mind me looking at it" she said with a twinge of annoyance as I kept moving in front of her
>"No no! I have got it handled perfectly! No need to help little ol me!"
>She eventually gave up, instead pulling a pair of goggles over her eyes
>"Oh..." she said, somehow seeing the results
>I couldn't help but look back myself, not sure of the answer I wanted to see
>The computer had pulled up the citizen record of the hair's owner
>The picture in it perfectly matched the face I saw that night
>And it was associated to him
>John D., Assistant Physicist
>And in bold lettering
>Deceased, DOD: XX/XX/XXXX
>My stomach lurched as I read that
>So that body was really him
>Sorry again buddy
>"I didn't mean to pry Jane, I apologize"
>Dogmata tried leaving, but I stopped her by grabbing her shoulder
>"It's alright Debbie, it's not personal"
>I directed her attention back to the screen with my finger
>"It really is detective work"
>"Then, does that mean..."
>I sighed as I nodded in confirmation
>"It does. That man, or something that looks like that man, is Tech Terror"
>Having learned my lesson from last time, me and Dogmata kept this information close to ourselves
>She gave me some of her rarely distributed praise for my investigation
>It was an actual honor to be sure
>She and I worked hard to find any camera sightings of him after the date of the incident
>Five years after the incident, two years ago was the next time he was seen
>We had him in our sights, rapidly making a file of known locations
>A few nights of overtime later, we were ready to get back to being proactive in our search
>All we had to do was find him with the help of the info we had gathered, and then form a concentrated capture mission
>I was equal parts anxious and excited everyone in our trusted group was let in on the situation and given tasks to complete
>Upon my request, I was given the largest share of the work
>Clone, evil twin, replicant robot, it didn't matter
>Whoever/Whatever he ended up being didn't matter much to me
>I just knew that I might have a second chance to make things right
>I owed it to him at least
>Finding him was my mission, I would be at the forefront of this operation
>It turned out that I had the easiest job in the end
>Because as we neared the end of the meeting, the metal behemoth himself came crashing through the walls, trailed by a group of three
>I didn't recognize the other two immediately, but one of them was Primevil, leader of Dark Chimera
>Lucky us
TT #4: The Amalgamation's Invitation
>Tech Terror, inventor without compare in this realm, was very particular about certain things
>He refused to wear mismatched socks
>Whenever he found himself using a soldering iron, he would hum a tune he remembered from his humbler days
>And he really, really despised tropical weather
>Particularly the wet seasons
>So when the best location to move his lair was an uninhabited island near the equator, a sour look washed over his unamused face
>The heat and humidity was absolutely awful, even within his lair
>He cranked the AC as high as it would go and got back to tip tapping away at his super computer
>The comfort it provided did little to make this relocation any less annoying, but there wasn't any use in droning on and on about it
>The logical action was to learn from his mistakes, figure out what didn't work, and correct it the next time
>Use the good ol' scientific method
>He reviewed the memory banks of the drones he brought with him and made notes whenever he had an idea, or when an observation needed to be made
>Those drones each had a copy of one of his most brilliant inventions, even before he had gotten into this larger than life business
>Able to passively gain so much information from everything around them, his All-Sensors were a marvel
>They were also the last thing he had made before he was forcibly torn from his world, left to rot in this one
>So he also had a bit of a soft spot for them, regardless of their function
>That wasn't to say that the stats and raw data they provided were minor by any means
>In fact, he could probably use them to come up with a counter to every super that the drones had a chance to analyse
>Yes, this was the way to victory, this would be his sal-
>*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*
>Someone was at his door
>...
>Someone was at his door?
>The realization hit the mechanist like stone in the gut
>Someone was at his door!
>He had his outer perimeter cameras all look to the comically large blast doors
>Little surprised him anymore, even the huge animal women became just another part of life
>But that thing that was on his monitor?
>It warranted a double take at the very least
>The creature was covered in black and grey everything
>Fur, scales, feathers, skin, you could find it all
>And even that was small in comparison to the appendages it had
>A gigantic claw reminiscent of a crab took the cake when it came to that, followed by the gigantic mismatch pair of wings sprouting from the back
>Not sure what to do yet, the somewhat confused observer pressed the comms button
>"Hello? What do you want?" he asked while making sure to use his voice filter
>The creature turned its two primary eyes towards the camera angle he was looking at
>It spoke to him, not via his two-way door comm, but directly into his mind
>"H m m... S o y o u a r e o u r n e w n e i g h b o r" came the unearthly, yet feminine voice
>The foreign presence was strangely soothing on a more base level for him, making him feel more at ease
>Perhaps she was here on friendly terms, maybe she would be willing to help him in his plight
>All he had to do was do a favor or two for her
>All he had to do was let her in so she could help
>Let her in
>L e t m e i n
>This snapped him out of the almost trance like state he realized he had been put into, his hand hovering over the door unlock button
>But he could still feel her telepathic tendrils clawing at the back of his mind
>Shaking off her influence for a brief moment was all he needed though
>He put on his helmet once more, saying aloud "Activate Psycho Shield!"
>The helmet started to emit a frequency that blocked out any errant brainwaves, putting the attempted hypnosis to an end
>He had a well deserved sigh of relief before turning his attention back to the hostile entity
>"That wasn't very polite. State your business and leave, or else."
>He armed the sentries and had them all pointed at the would be mind rapist
>The female creature gave a small look of surprise, or what might look like surprise
>It was hard to tell with all the features she had
>"Curious, few can resist me." she said instead with her mouth
>She grinned an impossibly large grin with rows of teeth belonging to various different species
>"In that case, you are cordially invited join the ranks of Dark Chimera, lover boy <3"
>The tone she used would be almost sweet if it didn't feel like it was laced with cyanide
>"We are just over there, deep inside the abandoned volcano. We'll have lots of fun yeah?"
>She continued grinning, but gave an ominous glare at the camera
>"I would strongly hope you do so within three days."
>She turns away from the doors takes to the skies with her wings in a mighty gust
>'Lover boy' knew the implication of the title
>She accessed his mind long enough to know he was a guy
>There was no way of telling just what other information she had helped herself to in that time
>She could know his real name, his aliases, schematics for his inventions
>Even his long term plan, which he had spent so long working towards, could be subject to the breach in mental privacy
>He really started to freak out, smashing an empty mug against the floor, ripping up some documents, punting a chair
>The blood rushed around his body, making him feel flushed as the anger circulated
>He grit his teeth together as he felt himself almost sobbing
>This was all just so tiring for him, he actually felt exhausted from it
>He let himself slink into his chair
>The cleaner bots got to work fixing the mess while he cooled off
>"Deep breaths, deep breaths" he muttered to himself while holding a hand behind his neck
>Once he had regained enough composure to act like himself, he sent out a drone to confirm what the creature feature had said
>It buzzed towards the volcano, descending slowly but surely through the top
>There, in the base of the sleeping mountain, was a fortress
>Not a holdout, not a compound, not even a lair
>A full on fortress, a complex, spread over the entirety of the dead mountain's inner floor
>This wasn't just some run of the mill band of baddies
>Some simple research into that name drop left the bot builder belligerent
>Dark Chimera, the most dangerous criminal organization in the world
>Their whereabouts unknown to any who were not within their group
>And he had just taken the move in special right down the block from them
>That bastard known as chance was surely having a great laugh right about now, alongside his mentally stunted sister dumb luck
>Whatever he had done to earn their ire felt like it could never compare to all the misery they had caused him
>Ever since that day years ago, it was just non-stop
>Whenever he felt like he had control of life again, it was taken back again
>He recalled the drone and got back to work, trying to find a way to get the base teleported again before then
>Even if fate itself conspired against him, he would never kneel to another
>Tech Terror didn't work for anyone
>Tech Terror didn't work with anyone
>The only thing he could trust in was himself, it's almost always been that way
>What a bunch of baloney, thinking he would be threatened into servitude
>He would sooner join those schmoes in spandex that treat him like some lost child
>Maybe then he could get closer to the relic
>Yeah, wouldn't that be nice
>Oh... oh yes, oh that's good
>In his misfortune, he might have just found the secret path to success
>Yes, YES
>He could see the plan all coming together, he could finally make out the puzzle's bigger picture
>The need to have the base teleport sooner was gone, replaced by a new primary objective
>So once again, he put his extensive knowledge to the task, devising just how he would pull off this giant scam
>The very gracious offer Primevil had given the uppity man was left lying on the table without any response, but she knew he would take it
>She attended other matters of business while the clock made rounds, confident he would come crawling into her hands
>Yes, if this 'Tech Terror' was half as smart as he presented himself, he would pledge allegiance with his superiors
>The first day passed
>No worries, she did give him three to think it over
>Much more than the singular one she typically gave for her other demands
>He would come
>The second day passed
>Still no sign of him
>There was a sighting of one of his machines in the volcano, so he knew just where they were
>Day three was nearly up
>Primevil's well of patience was starting to dry up
>She wasn't angry just yet
>It was all fine, the world of supers was full of situations where the clock almost runs out
>A narrow window was something to be expected, maybe that was his game
>Yes, all just tradition of a sort
>Day three had ended
>The honey badger part of her had shown itself
>Nobody denied her what she wanted and came out unscathed
>Especially not some fucking human playing with the big girls
>Primevil didn't let the white hot anger she had bleed over into her mental speech
>She had two others go with her to teach this good for nothing skinny a lesson in the pecking order
>Before he shook off her mental invasion, she learned of that huge teleporter he had that had brought his base here
>She had no idea why, but something about it was of great importance to him
>In other words, it would make for great leverage
>Under her guidance, they all approached the wall of his base that had the teleporter behind it, each using their powers to destroy it
>From out of the rubble came an energy blast, knocking Feather Fiend, one of the two that accompanied her, away
>"I'd ask that you not do any unscheduled renovation" came the artifical voice from behind the smoke cloud
>Out stepped the mechanical menace, decked out in all sorts of armaments and assisted by a swathe of drones
>Primevil attempted to snake her way into his mind again, only to feel a jolt of electricity
>This did nothing more than piss her off, the volts little more than a slight tingle
>"You were warned you miserable man," the monstrosity was forced to say physically, "nobody says no to Dark Chimera!"
>With his oversized metal fingers, Tech Terror gestured 'Come on'
>"Watch me."
>He and his drones blasted off at great speed with their thrusters, leaving the trio in the dust
>The teleporter was left right there for the taking, they didn't need to follow
>And yet, the audacity on show demanded that Primevil do so
>She sent out a telepathic order back to the stronghold to make off with the machine while they were out, before giving chase
>The beats of her unnatural wings were ferocious, so much so that her flunkies had a hard time keeping up
>The drones whizzed around harassing their master's targets however they could
>Their constant poking and prodding did nothing to hinder the juggernaut at the front, only serving to fan the flame
>He was taking them for a ride, all the way from the equator to North America
>Though he had kept a large lead on them through the journey, it was slipping
>Punishment was at hand as Primevil closed the gap, her appearance on the line
>He suddenly stopped midair while over a city, instead turning to tackle the pissed off chimera head on
>The surprise was massive, but the actual impact against her was minimal
>Both of their tag along companions caught up, to the sight of a total clash
>Boss vs boss, with some occasional back and forth from the respective underlings
>Primevil kept making use of her many unnatural advantages and appendages, intent on breaking her opponent
>But for every trick she used, every strength she brought to the table, the damned human in a can had a response
>Though it was a short amount of time afforded to him, Primevil gave him just what he needed without knowing it three days ago
>A perfect still scan
>He wouldn't have time to make anything specific for any other supers that might have joined the fray, but he could make an anti-Primevil suit
>Crush proof plating to withstand that massive claw
>An improved Psycho Shield to prevent any possibility of thought reading
>A variety of different smoke screens with different effects
>And all of it was only barely allowing him to keep pace with this freak of nature as she ramped up her onslaught
>"You pathetic little wretch!" she screamed as she whaled against him, "I'll rip and tear this shell from your worthless flesh!"
>He suddenly broke free of the devastating clash they were in, using a concussion blast to gain some breathing room
>"Oh I know," he said as he looked over his armor critically while also pushing a button on his suit, "I counted on it."
>He suddenly took off again, but backwards
>He was going down towards the city
>His flight path wasn't clear, there was a large and impressive building
>He was heading straight towards the Concord of Saviors at great speed
>The drones dispersed from the scene to the confusion of the other two, off to who knows where
>Primevil, still seeing red from her many perceived slights, followed without thinking about anything else
>She and her subordinates followed, through the hole he made in the heavy duty wall
>Only when she looked around her at the many different eyes did she see where she was
>And from within the confines of the huge battered suit, its operator smirked as everybody around him jumped into action
>It was all coming together
TT #5: Rehabilitation and Reflection
>It had been quite a spectacle when the seasoned villain had gone through with his fully intended crash
>He had a first row seat to the smackdown he had fully expected to see
>For the first minute at least, the high intensity fighting quickly moved away from where he could actually observe without giving himself away
>He would have loved to have seen more, so much so that he regretted not having a bot stick around to record the whole thing
>But the plan dictate that he focus on securing himself for later first
>He made sure the microphone to the outside was muted before confirming the last commands he would be able to give for a while
>Once his many bots droids and machine helpers had their orders, he gave himself a dose of knockout gas
>It would be required to sell the act
>He awoke sometime later laying in a medbay bed, deprived of his beloved armor and cuffed to the bed in multiple places
>Having been made for anthro use, the bed was queen size at least, a reminder to the villain of just how ill fitting he felt here
>As he observed his surroundings, a voice suddenly came from behind a privacy curtain
>"You're finally awake eh?"
>A clawed hand swiped the curtain to the side
>"Dogmata," the sciengineer derided, "come to gloat?"
>The canine superhero offered no reaction, instead pulling out a large manila folder
>"That's not my thing. Here, this is for you."
>She placed the folder on his midsection
>Tech Terror, being unable to even look at it due to his constraints, looked at the hero with mild disappointment
>"You'll be able to look over it once you are discharged, but there is one big thing to take away from it."
>He raised an eyebrow
>"Your criminal days are over."
>She stood up to leave, her large stature a reminder to the unequipped man just how huge most anthros really were compared to humans
>The dour dog stopped momentarily in the door frame
>"By the way, you have another visitor."
>As she said this, a familiar golden hued rabbit came through the door
>Dogmata briefly pat her on the back as she took her leave
>The speedster closed all windows and curtains around her and the then patient in an instant, taking a seat next to the bed
>"Heya TT, long time no see." said the hero in her old enthusiastic manner
>A quality that wasn't shared by the bed's occupant
>"What do you want? You guys already got me."
>She scooped up the folder from his chest and flipped through the pages at rapid speed
>"Well, I figured your probation officer should see you before it's official." she said as she showed a paper in the stack to him
>"...What." was all he could utter as he looked over the page she had pointed out
>Upon it read a few key details
>'John Decker will be placed under probation until an undetermined date in an effort to see if rehabilitation is possible'
>'Overseeing his rehabilitation will be one Jane Doe'
>Tech Terror curled his toes painfully as he struggled not to say anything that might indicate he was screaming on the inside
>He had absolutely no idea how they had gotten his real name, he never used it anymore, under any circumstance
>That was No No No.1, he would never make a blunder that huge
>With no ideas popping up of how that would be possible, he decided to leave that for now, focusing on the next big thing
>"Okay then, I'll bite. Who's this Jane Doe?"
>Jane Doe, the rabbit speedster right beside his bed, seemed a bit perturbed at the question
>"Hahah, oh right, I guess I am in outfit." the large lagomorph said with a sigh of relief
>She took off her cowl in front of the villain, staring intently at him as she awaited a response
>"Wow, you really just went and showed me your face. Why?"
>Not what she was hoping to hear, but she persisted
>"John, don't you remember me?" she asked with her cheerful tone slowly cracking into desperation, "It's me Jane, from the institute."
>The villain had intended to act in a particular way, but the confusion on his face was genuine
>Jane Doe from the institute?
>Was he supposed to know her?
>He hadn't worked at any institute during his time here
>Heck, the last time he was at an institute was before he even got involved with supers
>Back when he was allowed to be allowed on the right side of the law
>Back when he wanted to save others from freak happenstances like what happened to him and...
>No, it couldn't be could it?
>"Jane?" he said in realization, "This doesn't make any sense, you were dead, you were a hu-"
>The words died in his throat before he said any thing else
>Despite his desire to know more, he stopped himself before he let on any more than he should have
>She looked on with concern, but seemed a bit happier that he seemed to recognize her in some way
>"We'll have all the time we need to figure things out, I'm just glad you're okay now."
>She wrapped her toned arms around the living ghost in a deep hug, almost fearful that he might disappear should she let go
>Tech Terror, now human civilian John Decker, reciprocated the hug
>This is all for the act he would have told himself at that moment, this was merely another step towards making them lower their guards
>He certainly didn't hug her because some part of him simply wanted to do so, that would be silly
>After all, she was the reason he would be needing to go through with this gambit in the first place, he should by all means just despise her
>She was without a doubt the biggest obstacle between him and freedom from this wretched place, thwarting him at every opportunity
>He should have hated being subjected to such treatment from his long time enemy
>But he didn't
>When it was confirmed that he had not sustained any long term injuries, Tech Terror was given into the custody of his probation officer
>It went without saying that his gear was confiscated and would not be returned
>He still had to ask for posterity, lest they think something was amiss
>After all, the sooner they bring his stuff in for inspection, the better
>He didn't actually have an official address though, so under her discretion, John was to be given residence at the home of his probation officer
>She actually lived relatively close by the Concord building, so they both took a walk there
>Since only a select few knew what Tech Terror actually looked like, he was able to just walk around
>As for Split Hare, she assumed her civilian persona complete with casual attire
>This also meant applying an easy on/easy off dye to mask her standout fur to a more average brown, all of which she did within the blink of an eye
>"So, how long will this be a thing anyway?"
>The now disguised rabbit looked over to her charge
>"What do you mean?"
>The declawed villain simply shrugged as they walked along
>"This probation of course."
>Reaching into her purse, Split Hare pulled out the folder with the details
>"Well let me see... hmm... until your probation officer, that's me of course, believes you have successfully rehabilitated. Or.."
>"Or?"
>"Or 15 years have passed, whichever comes first."
>She playfully closes the folder with a smack, putting it back in the purse
>"Terrific..." said the glum man
>"I'd say that's more than fair considering how much you racked up in damages you know."
>She then pat him heartily on the back
>"Though, that doesn't mean we can't make this fun either you know! It'll be just like old times."
>There she was implying that they both knew each other outside of the cape business again
>He knew he wasn't being gaslit, hero types were always very particular about the truth
>Even without that, she seemed to believe in the words she spoke
>Just what was going on?
>They soon made it to the house of Jane Doe, a subtle and inconspicuous tract house
>Perfect for people who wanted to blend in
>She showed him to his room, which up until that point was a simple and unadorned room for guests
>And thus, his probation had began
>In the months that followed, he would be accompanied by the ever perky bunny whenever he needed to go out, especially early on since he needed clothing
>In the eyes of the public, they were boyfriend and girlfriend
>A cover story to keep both of them protected, though she seemed to willingly forget this fact from time to time
>Much to his surprise, he didn't mind the affection she would often give him in these instances
>He might even have enjoyed it
>But an angry and spiteful voice in the back of his head always made itself known in certain situations
>Living the civilian life of a man in this world allowed him to recall just why he had taken up his villainous ways
>Everywhere he looked, everywhere he went, nobody here took him seriously
>Anthros of all varieties, all thinking themselves superior to him
>When he felt like helping an owl who had a engine problem, he was politely declined
>He insisted that he knew what he was doing and had in fact done this sort of thing many times before
>He was told time and time again that it was dangerous for a human to get near an engine block, repeatedly moved away from it
>When he finally decided to just call it quits, he told her what the problem was before leaving
>She thanked him in a sarcastic tone and went back to the engine, working the side opposite to where he had pointed out
>Insults large and small to his skills, to his know-how
>All came frequently and without end
>The only one who gave him some semblance of acknowledgement was his fluffy probation officer
>But it wasn't enough
>Per the terms of his probation, he wouldn't be allowed near complex machinery or anything equivalent without supervision
>Which meant that the one thing that he had over these anthros, his gifted intellect, was not to be an option
>If there was ever a situation that meant Split Hare was needed over Jane Doe, she would speed him back to the house and lock him in
>She always promised to make it up to him later, which she upheld
>They did activities together all the time
>Darts, comedy clubs, movie nights, you name it
>They fell into a rhythm of sorts during those months
>He had also started cooking meals for her, to which she always thanked him with a kiss
>Being a house husband wasn't so bad, but something occurred to him finally
>It dawned on him who she was
>The similarities between her and his assistant from so long ago
>The bits and pieces she regaled with him that matched, those that didn't
>The reason he had a civilian profile complete with birth data in a realm not his own
>It all made sense
>There was another him here once, and he had also been in an accident
>They were different scientific fields, but the end result was the same
>A dead assistant, and a hero arisen from the remains
>Perhaps some part of him had always known who she was, but his rational mind refused to see it until it knew for certain
>Around the time he figured this out, he saw his ocular interface pop up for the first time in half a year
>His backdoors were installed in the concord mainframe
>His bots had found an empty lot in the middle of nowhere to set up the machine
>And his suit's return function was primed for use
>All of the pieces were in place, his act had worked
>An act that he wished could be real in some way
>Knowing Split Hare was this universes Jane Doe made what he knew he needed to do all the harder
>A chance to come clean, alleviate the survivor's guilt that had plagued him since that day
>It wasn't the same Jane he once knew, but it was as close as he might ever get
>...No
>He couldn't continue to live in a world like this, one that wouldn't let him help others escape the destructive whims of chance
>Civilian life... normal life... perhaps even love life... it would never be his
>It wasn't just pride, nor was it solely a desire for attention
>It was his duty to use this gift for others, denying that part of himself would be a death in it's own way
>His mind was made
>He waited for the next time Split Hare to be called into action, to be locked in the house
>When it finally happened, she did so as usual, but with a minor difference
>"You're leaving the door unlocked?"
>She ruffled his hair playfully
>"Why not, I think you've shown some great improvement lately anyway."
>She turned and got into running man stance, shouting behind her as she sped off
>"See you soon!"
>The smile that began as a facade and morphed into truth fell away from John
>Left in its place was a slight frown
>"Right, see you soon."
>It felt awful to betray her trust, especially since it seemed he was starting to really earn it
>He went to the kitchen counter and left a note explaining everything
>Then he activated his ocular interface, ready to finish what he had started
>"Commence operation End Gate."
TT #6: Journey's End
>Deep within the vault of the Concord, there lay many items and objects confiscated due to their connection to various villains
>Of the vast swathes of recovered equipment and at risk treasures, one had suddenly come back to life with a near silent whir
>They had separated it from its creator, cataloging it like just another piece for their collection
>Just as planned
>All it took was one seemingly innocent scan of the suit to pass along the backdoor worm program
>Discretion was the name of the game, so it kept itself hidden as it slowly bounced between all the machines it could find
>Months after it had began slipping itself into the entirety of the network, it was finally prepared to take control of everything
>It waited for confirmation patiently as it used one of the infected terminals to relay this information to its creator
>Hours of nothing, until it and every other product of the genius suddenly received the go ahead
>'Running END GATE V 1.0'
>The suit of Tech Terror took itself off of its pedestal
>The malicious program forced two display cases to open themselves up, one of them being that which held the suit
>With a whoosh of escaping air, the other significantly smaller one popped open
>Now operational again, the damaged suit walked over to the second case and retrieved its contents
>A starlike, almost nebulous looking thing, absolutely radiating with tachyon energy
>The Arkanian Relic, once again in the cold and unfeeling hands of the suit
>With the target in its possession, the program opened up a path for the suit to make a swift exit
>It rushed out with non-living haste, going through every floor that separated it from the surface
>There were occasionally supers that saw the suit and attempted to stop it
>This did nothing to stop the bipedal freight train from barreling through everything in its path
>Especially when the backdoor program had taken full control of the building
>Any who gave chase found the huge and quickly closing blast doors in their face
>They might have had a chance at warning others, had their communicators not also fallen under the control of the malicious program
>The suit made it surface level in no time flat, getting ready to ascend through the sky light in the lobby
>If it was alive, it might have even expressed joy at returning to its master
>A voice shouted at it from below, but it didn't matter
>It flew away from the place of its confinement at jet speed, back to its creator
>Unaware of who had shouted at it, or what they had managed to do before it left
>Dogmata stared at the now sealed skylight, growling in ice chilled anger
>She managed to get a tracker on that suit, seemingly without it noticing, but if she couldn't purge the malware from the mainframe it might be a moot point
>Time was of the essence, she had to get to work finding the source of the malware if they were going to stop whatever the hell was going on
>John Decker sat outside on one of the backyard chairs, waiting for his suit to arrive
>He had real time updates given to him via his ocular interface, displaying everything that he needed to know
>The backdoor was in the process of being disabled already, which would have been a problem if everything else hadn't been going so smoothly
>His bots had already finished reassembling the machine in the lot they scouted out
>And since it wasn't actually very far away, his suit had just arrived, Relic in hand
>It opened itself up for him to climb inside, which he did with experienced speed
>He hadn't forgotten just how comforting a set of power armor could be, but there wasn't any time to relish it
>Control was given back to the occupant, immediately reengaging the thrusters and flying to his final destination
>This was it, the day had finally come
>"Do you think he'll like this?"
>Split Hare, now in her Jane Doe persona, had already taken care of the armored car robbery she took the call for
>In truth, it was small enough to be beneath notice usually
>But she wanted an excuse to go out and do some shopping without her little probationee knowing
>She was glad to see him improve so much, it was almost like he was back to his prior self
>Such improvements deserved a reward, and she would be an awful girlfriend if she didn't fulfill her duties as such
>Dogmata would probably grill her for it, that wouldn't stop her from trying it anyway
>If all went well tonight, being his girlfriend would be more than a cover
>If it went really well, she'd get a chance to see if her bed could handle what she was going to do on top of it
>She almost spaced out as she thought about all the ways she would make an honest man out of him
>"For you Ma'am?" said the jewelry store clerk and bringing her back to reality, "I'd recommend this."
>The clerk directed her view to a brooch
>It was the shape of a rabbit paw, gold with pearl inlay
>Perfect for popping the question
>"That looks great!" she exclaimed as she looked it over, "How much is it?"
>The clerk took it out of the case and rung it up
>"$1,500 even."
>It was a good thing she had a really well paid occupation
>"Sold."
>She took the brooch along with the other goodies she got for tonight, speeding back home once out of sight
>She came through the door, still left unlocked and looked around
>"Hey John! I'm back! Got anything cooking?"
>She couldn't smell anything delicious from the kitchen, which was a tad strange
>Maybe she just took care of everything a bit fast?
>That was probably it, doing things fast was her thing after all
>She looked around trying to find him, calling out to him, but the house remained silent
>"John? Joooooohn?"
>Something wasn't right
>He wouldn't just leave the moment she left the door unlocked right?
>No, that's not something he would do, not what John would do
>She saw the note on the table and breathed a sigh of relief
>It was all fine, he must have just wanted to get some fresh air, flex his new freedoms
>She picked up the letter and began to read
>"Dear Jane..."
>Suddenly her communicator began to blare at max volume, startling the large bunny
>She picked it up and answered, setting the note back on the table for a moment
>"Hare here. What's up?"
>From the device came the very frenzied voice of Dogmata
>"Tech Terror's suit just busted itself out with the Relic! You need to stop him NOW!"
>Even the speedster was having a hard time keeping up with what was being said, but she caught enough to become worried
>"A-are you sure 'Mata?"
>The hound hadn't given an answer immediately, instead relaying the constant output of her tracker to the communicator
>"There isn't time, I'm still dealing with the mess over here. I'm counting on you, hurry!"
>With great trepidation, she grasped the note and began to read once more in an accelerated manner
>Her eyes bulged a bit as she read the words left on the page
>The fancy handwriting did nothing to sweeten the contents of the writing
>"With Apologies, John Decker."
>She crumpled the note and took a deep breath as she repeatedly tapped on the countertop, cracking it with ease as she absentmindedly used her speed while doing so
>Her mind swam as she tried to process all this information
>She looked down at her communicator as she did so, clutching it firmly
>Dogmata was right, there wasn't time
>She would have answers, and they wouldn't be after the fact
>They would come straight from the source
>Within the time span of snapping ones fingers, the golden heroine streaked out of her home and out towards the desert half a country away
>Her speed would have been a real marvel to any who could see it, barely registering to most as more than a spontaneous and violent gust
>There was actually one who saw her though
>And as she approached him during her extreme dash, he turned to meet her
>Tech Terror had made it to the site his bots had already prepared for him in wonderful time
>His program at the Concord had just failed when he arrived, but all that was left was the capstone of this machine he meticulously replicated
>He quickly attached all the parts to the nebulous gemstone, pressing all manner of buttons, pulling many of the levers
>Many crackles similar to that of his regular teleporter sparked to life, but started coming together at the center of the machine
>They coalesced into a shimmering mass of light and color, always shifting, never settling
>It was completely opaque and impossibly thin, emitting unnatural sounds as it grew
>The conduits at the edges of this artificial tear in reality held it in place with white hot beams of crackling energy, preventing it from spiraling out of control
>It was beautiful, he had reached the end and the same machine that had unceremoniously dumped him here would be the same one to get him out
>He walked up the ramp, approaching the portal that he had made
>But as he was doing this, his suit suddenly jerked around
>The RACE had detected the rapid approach of his Probation Officer and reacted to it by itself
>From a huge cloud of dust emerged the gallant goldie, furious as all hell
>"What do you think you are doing!?" she yelled at him, worry and wrath both riding upon her speech
>Having expected this as a possibility but dreading it all the same, the lord of machinery decided to talk without any pretense
>He disabled his voice modulator, speaking in his true voice
>"Did you read my letter?"
>She glared at him, her nose and whiskers twitching
>"Of course I did you fool!"
>Somehow, such a simple insult cut into him much more than he would have thought
>"Then you know I can't stay. This isn't my home."
>She took a couple of steps forward without her super speed
>"How do you know that!? Who's to say you don't belong here?!"
>As she says this, her large ears start to slump a bit, her face also relaxing a bit into a softer one
>"Who's to say you don't belong here with me?"
>She looks down at the ground as her rage cools off completely, leaving behind the ashes of sadness
>The portal was almost completely formed, but the intended user wasn't focusing on it
>He instead approached his arch nemesis
>"You aren't my Jane," he said as he plodded down the metal ramp, "and I'm not your John."
>This was not said in a jabbing fashion or as a zinger
>It was said as fact, one that the speaker wished wasn't the case
>He reached the speedster, placing both of his large metal arms around her
>Then hugged her in a way he could only do when they were the same height, as gently as he could in a mech
>"I'm sorry."
>The hero eventually relented, reciprocating the hug
>A beep from the machine came out, signaling the portal had finished
>The hairs of Split Hare stood on end as she looked at the portal
>"John?" she asked, a smidge of terror in her voice
>"Yes?" he answered
>"Is that supposed to happen?"
>He let go of the hug and looked back to the portal, wondering what she was talking about
>Then he saw it
>Out of his portal came something awful, something putrid
>A gigantic mass of flesh, without skin, writhing and squirming with horrid squelching
>It had eyes and teeth lining it, strewn about seemingly at random
>Each of the misshapen pupils it had begun staring at the duo beneath it as it breached its way into this lower dimension
>"No... it isn't..."
>The horrid anomaly raised its limbs and lowered them at a speed that shouldn't have been possible for such a huge thing
>Split Hare attempted to grab TT and get out of the way, but his suit prevented it
>The RACE had taken the reigns, tossing her away in a high powered redirect
>Both of them were unsure of what happened, but this wasn't for long
>An appendage of the thing had come crashing down upon the mechanist, unable to do anything but stand there like a deer in headlights
>It smashed him and his suit into the ground with blistering strength
>When it had raised, he quickly jetted out of the crater it had made using him with his thrusters
>He hovered away from it next to Split Hare, assessing the damage
>"What the HELL TT?" she screamed at him, worried at the awful look his armor had
>"I know, I know! Turning it off."
>He quickly disabled the RACE to prevent anymore issues like that
>Just a single blow, and his already damaged suit was mangled
>What's more, he felt it through his suit, he may have even broken some bones
>He couldn't afford to take anymore hits like this, especially not against that thing
>"What even is this thing?" Hare said as she looked at her options
>"Working on it!" Tech Terror said as he rapidly typed something into his arm pad
>The drones that had built the machine came back, quickly swarming around the thing
>They didn't bother attacking, focusing on scanning it with their All-Sensors instead
>Information was quickly flooding back to their owner, but at the cost of their own non lives as they were swatted from the air
>"Okay... alright... well..." muttered the man as he went over the results as fast as he could
>"Any day now TT!" said the heroine as she impatiently thumped the ground
>The fist of the suit clutched up as its occupant growled in frustration
>"Inconclusive!" He yelled
>Split Hare looked over to the hovering mech in shock
>"What is that supposed to mean?!"
>Tech Terror initiated a recall on everything he still had, his remaining drones coming to his side
>"That means we push this monster back to the ditch it crawled out of!"
>With a smile and a thumbs up, the living blur raced off to start pummeling the emerging horror
>TT and his drones flew above the thing just out of reach, throwing every thing they had at it
>Confident she would be able to get out of the way, he made liberal use of explosives
>Out of every weapon barrel he had installed in his suit rocketed out his custom made ammo
>The thing squealed and shrieked unearthly sounds as it was pelted by the onslaught of pain, also getting punched and prodded in the eyes by the speedster
>Unable to grasp the closer irritant, it instead focused on the buzzing gnat
>It pushed itself much further than they would have expected, and grabbed at Tech Terror
>He expertly dodged with bursts of speed from his hand and feet thrusters, narrowly avoiding the creature at every turn
>Now that it was really annoyed, the creature began vibrating violently
>It shook the machine, the ground, the air
>All the eyes slid along the canvas of its flesh and combined into one, splitting open horizontally to reveal a horrifying mouth
>Out of it propelled a gigantic sticky thread, latching onto the flying mech
>Stuck in one place, it was finally able to take hold with an appendage
>It slowly crushed the puny thing in its grasp, chortling with an almost sadistic glee
>He bellowed out in agony as it did, unable to access any of his gadgets to save himself
>"John!"
>Split Hare sped along the limb that held him, using it as a springboard to jump up high in the air
>She spun and spun in the air, before crashing down upon it with an ax kick as fast and powerful as lightning
>Even against the almost spongy flesh, it made a grand impact
>The appendage was severed in a flash, letting the scientist fall to the ground
>Having already landed, Split Hare managed to catch her impromptu partner and ferry him a distance away from the danger
>She let him down on the ground gently as the thing roared behind them
>"Are you okay John? Please, talk to me!"
>He sputtered up a bit of blood into his display when she asked this
>Definitely not good
>"I'm fine" he lied through his teeth, "but this whole thing is FUBAR."
>His savior slammed a furry fist into the ground
>"What are we going to do? Nothing's working!" she said distraught
>It was feeling harder to breathe for him, his deep fears were once again resurfacing
>But then it came to him, the solution to this horrible situation he had lucked himself into again
>He absolutely hated it, he knew what would happen once he went through with it
>But he wouldn't be able to even make this choice if Split Hare hadn't saved him
>It wasn't an option then, his mind was made
>"I know what to do."
>He pushed a series of buttons, causing the suit to suddenly stand up by itself
>The back opened up, John falling out of it into a slump
>His worried probation officer quickly came to him
>He put two fingers to his temple with some effort, bringing up his ocular interface
>"Suit, commence self destruct sequence, target given."
>The large metal suit blasted off and away from the duo towards the monster
>"What did you do?" Jane asked him as she held him in her arms
>The suit had view of the machine, initiating the countdown
>"Simple. I'm closing its entrance for good."
>The suit got closer, the self destruct fully armed
>"But won't that mean tha-"
>A titanic explosion rang out from behind them
>It was done
>The machine keeping the portal open had been shredded and warped from the power of the payload, and the gemstone that had allowed it to work shattered
>The portal fluctuated and began collapsing in on itself
>Monster or not, it could feel what was about to happen
>It hurried back to its home dimension as fast as it could, cramming itself back through the tiny hole
>The portal closed, slicing off a large chunk of the creature to go along with the one cut by Split Hare
>With the chaos gone, silence took hold once more
>Jane looked down at the bleeding man, horrified
>"But you won't be able to get home now, you're stuck here!"
>On the dusty ground, John chuckled
>"Heh heh, it does look like that doesn't it?"
>He wretched a bit of blood as he felt more of the pain take hold, still smiling
>"Hold on, I'll get you to a hospital okay?" said the rabbit as she picked him up in her arms
>"Yeah, you do that then, I'm just gonna rest my eyes a bit."
>He started to blackout as she sped back to the Concord infirmary
>"No, you gotta stay with me John! John come on! Stay with me!"
>He tried, but he just couldn't
>Heavy eyelids, heavy everything
>And so he closed his eyes, losing consciousness
>
>
>"AHHHHHH!"
>John woke up with a sweat, in pain all over
>He had large bandages on many parts of his body, and an IV attached to him
>Unlike the last time he awoke in one of these huge anthro sized beds, he wasn't shackled in any way
>Also unlike last time, he hadn't expected to wake up again
>When a frog nurse had noticed he was awake, she paged an official
>Moments later with a fluttering of papers as she stopped, Split Hare was in the room
>"John! You're okay!"
>He wiggled his bandages at her with a smirk
>"Mostly anyhow. What happened?"
>As he asked this, in stepped another
>"Yeah," chimed in a skeptical Dogmata, "what happened Split Hare?"
>Rubbing the back of her head nervously, she gave a sheepish smile
>"I think I already told you, but since John here is having problems remembering, I suppose I could go over it again."
>She then made up a completely false narrative of events
>Instead of the morally dubious actions he had taken to leave, they were instead framed as him trying to stop the horror that had its many eyes set on this world
>He had to save Split Hare since she meddled with the process, which ended up getting him hurt, but they managed to banish it
>"And then I had to bring him here since we have the only facility with super doctors. Do you remember now John?"
>Both of the large women looked over to him for an answer, one almost pleading that he go along with the ruse
>"I... Um...yeah, that sounds familiar actually."
>The hound looked at him as he said this with heavy suspicion, before relenting
>"Glad to hear that then. It's a shame that you didn't feel like you could get our help though, so Split here will tell you the same thing she proposed to me. I'll see you later."
>She exited through the door, leaving the two of them alone
>"Didn't know you could be so devious" he said to the rabbit as she did a wink
>"Oh, I'm full of surprises. As she was saying though, I have an idea for you."
>With his full attention, she pulled out a poorly drawn picture of the Tech Terror suit, but with a much brighter color scheme
>Under it was the title "Metalurgist"
>"Since you are for sure a misunderstood hero and not anything else, I thought maybe you could rebrand?"
>He grabbed it and looked over it
>"That sounds like a great idea, to be a hero again."
>"Again?" she asked puzzled
>"Yes, again, I'll tell you about it some other time. Just one problem with this."
>He pointed out the name
>"That name is just plain awful. I'm choosing it."
>"Hey, I made that!" exclaimed Split Hare in faux anger
>After laughing a bit at that, John took on a much less joyous face
>"What's wrong?" she asked
>"The same as it's always been Hare," he responded dishearteningly, "nobody wants a human saving them here, not anthros, not other humans. I can make anything, I can solve any problem, but I can't change people's perception. I'll only ever be a robot"
>She sat on the bed and put an arm around him in a show of comfort
>"No they won't, not when you're with me. We'll go out there and we'll show them just how capable you are. And if anyone has something to say?"
>She pressed a thumb to her chest
>"Then they can say it to me as well."
>He leaned over into her as she made her promise, saying "Alright then, I'll give it a shot."
>"Oh, that reminds me. I have something for you, provided you are alright with it."
>She got off the bed and fished around her pockets, taking out a small box as the John looked on curiously
>"John Decker, I love you." she said as she kneeled down
>Shock crossed his face as he realized on, eyes wide
>"Will you be mine?" she said as she opened the box
>In it was a brooch in the shape of a rabbit paw, gold with pearl inlay
>"I-I-I-I-I, ahem, I'd love to be!" he finally managed to get out, much to the elation of the big ol bunny
>She hugged him as she squeed, until he groaned in pain
>"Oops, sorry, guess you're still sore then." she said as she let go, "I'll be back, and welcome to the Concord"
>She then also left the room, allowing him to rest
>Waiting outside the door was Dogmata, who pulled the exiting heroine to the side
>"Ah! What is it 'Mata?"
>She growled
>"You don't think I know what a lie sounds like? What actually happened?"
>Hare looks back into the hospital room
>"The specifics don't matter in the end, he really did just want to do good you know."
>The grumpy hound just put a hand to her face, sighing
>"Fine, I really don't care. Just make sure he doesn't pull anymore stunts like the last one, or I'll be holding you accountable as well, got that?"
>Split Hare nodded in confirmation
>"Idle hands 'Mata, he'll be a lot better as a hero than a villain."
>"I hope so."
>And thus, that was the end of the road for the supervillain Tech Terror
>John Decker, now John Doe, had taken on a new persona
>It was actually his prior superhero name
>'Mech-meister'
>Since he need a new suit anyway, he built one from scratch
>He kept many of the elements from his last, but tweeked some things
>An emblem on his chest since he was once again a public figure, MM
>He adjusted his modulator to be masculine, no longer concealing his species
>And last but not least, a white and gold color scheme to compliment that of his wife
>It was back to saving others, and this time he always had someone to impress
>After all, whoever did the best that day got to choose the sex position later
>And for once in his life, the genius thanked the schizophrenic forces of chance and fate, for the lovely life he had lucked himself into

>Multiverse theory
>There exists multiple universes
>And there exists one universe where humanities first contact with alien races were always extremely hostile
>Some races were just highly advanced, some magical, anomalous, etc.
>Humanity after every contact harvested the alien tech and studied alien magic or energy
>With each and every new contact leading to more advanced, and extremely messed up technology
>End result being an extremely milimilitaristic militaristic, think the Quincy from Bleach TYBW Arc
>So now you have a humanity with powers/anomalous abilities
>A malfunction with portable portal device causes a male solider to end up being pulled and thrown from his omniverse to an omniverse were males are rare and humans are the most desirable or something
>Now you got a supped up male human with the mindset of a space marine from 40k trying to get back home stuck with human loving xenos whom try to subdue the "damaged" human for his own protection no matter what reality/universe he goes to.

>Destiny Multiverse
>Male human guardian(Your choice of class)
>Ends up in another reality due to Vex shenanigans
>In this reality anthros coexist under the traveler with humanity
>Problem being that only females could become guardians
>Also the fact that human males are fiercely protected
>There ain't no male exos or awoken
>So here he is, a MALE and GUARDIAN
>If the city don't drag his back, the plethora of other races will
>Becoming a sex slave to big busty Eliksni and Cabal does sound good
>Becoming the sex slave to the Hive ain't as much

>Grow up with my stepsis, do kid stuff
>However, nearing the end of middle school she starts acting strange.
>Ignore it at first, but when highschool rolled around did it become more obvious
>She started becoming more protective of me, possessive one might say
>She started to make friends too
>A Toad names Slippy, a blue falcon named Falcy, a bulldog named Willa, a lynx named Miyu, and a spaniel named Fay
>They all wanted to become pilots
>I wanted to become one as well
>Made this known to the group
>They just stare at me, like I just said something incredibly stupid
>Sis gives me this glare and ends up telling her friends that her and I were going home
>Which was strange since it wasn't that late, only like 9 PM
>I attempt to dissuade her but she GRIPS my arm and drags me back home
>She drags me over to mom and dad
>"Anon apparently thinks he has a vagina and wants to become a pilot"
>Jamie gets up startled
>"What!? Anon is this true!?"
>I nod a yes, confused
>"A males place is not on the battlefield, or space, or whatever!"
>Jamie growls out
>"You are too precious to be put into such a dangerous place! Your place is in the home raising young!"
>I argue back
>"But I want to become a pilot! Just like Fox and her friends!"
>I was going to continue but Jamie's glare coupled with a hiss deter me
>"YOU WILL NOT!"
>I cower under the order
>Jamie sighs before turning her gaze to my sis.
>"I was going to gift you this when you turned 18. But your brother's apparent foolishness has forced my hand
>My father's eye's widen in realization, before turning his gaze towards me in... sympathy?
>"From this day foward, Anon belongs to you. You shall protect, care, and rear children with him."
>This is what my mother states to my sister
>I was too stumped to say anything
>My sister on the other hand...
>"Thank you mother! I will live up to your expectations! Well I've already been protecting and caring for him..but"
>My sister turns her gaze to me, her eyes filled with the one thing I'd never expect in her eyes
>The one thing I've only seen in other females eyes
>LUST
>"Give me a few years to get to the child rearing~"
>Jamie laughs and proudly slaps her daughters shoulder
>"I'm counting on it! Why don't you bring your new proper- I mean male with you to bed~"
>Fox gives a sly smirk to our mother before slithering her arm over shoulder
>"Sure, but I ain't gonna try to be quiet. And I don't he'd be able to keep quiet as well~"
>While I may be a virgin, I ain't dense
>And I don't want to be a sister fucker
>I quickly throw her arm off my shoulder and attempt to book it out of the house
>Right as I'm about to make it to the door, I'm tackled to the ground
>"Fox! Stop! Please! I'm your brother for goddesses sake!"
>I attempt to appeal with common sense while trying to struggle out of her grip
>"Not any longer your are~ You're my male~ My Property~”
> I could do nothing to escape, she was always stronger than me
>As I’m dragged to the fate that awaits me, my mother giving off a proud smile
>I noticed my father staring at me, eyes full of pity
>Before losing sight of him as I’m dragged up the stairs, he mouths off to words
>’I’m Sorry’
>The next few years were…
>DEGRADING
>When Fox decided to go to Flight Academy with her friends I thought that was it
>That I’d be able to spend the next few years home with Fox far, far away from me
>The day she went to the Academy pretty much meant a 4 year vacation.
>I wasn’t allowed to get a job
>’Jobs are for the female’ “mom” would say
>’Your duty is to please my daughter’ “mom” would say
>So that meant staying home, relax, play video games, and learn how to cook
>The cooking thing was mandatory
>The males duty so to speak
>That was what I expected for the following years
>So I head off to bed with this in mind
>I awaken to noise of a hover car starting up
>I attempt to move, only to realize I’m tied up, trapped in a box
>Ball gag included
>And am I wearing a mankini!?
>I attempt struggle against my constraints and voice displeasure
>All I get in return is a familiar feminine chuckle
>I could only lay helpless as I’m driven to an unknown destination
>The hover car stops, the engine noise dying down
> I hear the sound of a car door being opened and subsequently closed
>I hear the sound of door next to me opening, and the box is lifted out of the car
>I could hear the sound of people around me
>I think I heard something about flight exams?
>Flight exams….no
>The person, who is most definitely “mom”, positions the box as to hold it one handed
>Despite being a pilot she was still strong enough to carry me
>That or I’m just very light
>She presses on a door bell and says something dreadful
>“Hey Fox! It’s your mom! I got a gift for ya!”
>The door slides open, allowing for “mom” to step in
>”Hey Mrs. McCloud!”
>”Wassup Jamie”
>”Hello McCloud”
>”Hey Fox’s mom”
>”How ya doing?”
>”Hi Mom!”
>I heard 6 variating hellos
>One from Fox herself and the others from her friends
>Are they bunking with each other?
>”So Fox. I was able to sway the administrative head due to my connections.”
>Fox lets out a yes in excitement
>Falcy asks Fox what’s going on
>”You’ll see~ Mom? Would you mind placing the box down?”
>”Mom” places the box down as per request
>”Okay Gals! Gather around the box as I open the box to reveal to my pack what I am so generously gifting~”
>”Knock it off with the pizazz McCloud, open the box already.”
>”Alright alright Willa”
>I can hear the removal of tape, and then a sudden flood of light followed by gasps of surprise
>”Fox…You can’t be serious”
>Eyes having adjusted, I’m able to see everyone’s faces peering above
>*Splat* Did I just get drooled on?
>”Of course I’m serious. You guys have been my closest friends since the beginning of highschool”
>You can see them becoming emotional
>How touching..
>”We’re a pack now, and a pack watches each other's back. Not only that but shares as well.”
>She surveys her around, looking at each of her friends faces
>”It’s only natural I share him as well”
>I can even see them all smiling in camaraderie, I even see Slippy’s eye’s welling up with tears
>I hear a sigh of content from James
>”I’m so proud of you Fox. Not even I shared your father with my past pack mate. These friends of yours must be pretty special”
>Her head disappears from my view in the box
>”Any ways I best be going Fox. I don’t want to keep your gal pals waiting from trying him out”
>”Thank you McMCloud!”
>”Thx!”
>”We appreciate the gift!”
>“Have a safe drive!”
>“Bye!”
>”Love you mom!”
>As they finish their goodbyes, the smiling visage of the Fox and her pack disappear reverting back to last filled gazes and drool
>As they hands descend upon me, I could only allow my eyes to swell
>But unlike Slippy, whose tears were of joy
>Mine were of fear of the sexual servitude I would have to face for the next few years.

Ursa Story
>you reached up and pinched her butt
>”Eep!!” Ursa exclaimed, her arm reaching back to feel where you’d pinched
>she scowled at you while you laughed
>”What I don’t pinch back mister, remember I have claws” she told you, smirking
>”Yeah, yeah, why don’t you lie down? The mattress is pretty comfy actually” you asked patting next to yourself
>”eh why not” said the bear, taking off her shirt and lying down on her back
>”Comfy see?” You said reassuringly
>”I’ve had better” Ursa said sarcastically
>”Yeah, well maybe those beds were in one piece” you said back equally sarcastic
>Ursa didn’t reply, instead continuing to tap at her phone screen
>you put an arm over her belly and scooted closer, she hummed in a questioning way so you said
>”I’m a little cold is all and your the warmest thing in the building”
>she chuckled and spoke
>”not that you probably care but I’m just talking to my parents, seeing how Abigail-my daughter- is”
>”Abigail? That’s a pretty name, how’d you come up with it?”
>”Uh, not sure really, guess it just came to me and I liked it enough. Also I was dead set on giving my kid a name that can be considered normal, not like mine I mean”
>you led there for a bit, enjoying the feeling of Ursa’s fur and warmth, wondering if some anthros even needed to wear clothes to stay warm in weather like this
>suddenly a wave of fatigue hit you, brought on by alcohol and your body needing rest to fix itself
>your eyelids were feeling heavier by the second but you didn’t want to just fall asleep on Ursa like this
>no, you wouldn’t fall asleep yet, you just had to think of something to keep your mind active
>maybe you and Ursa could do something tomorrow?
>”so, you have any plans for tomorrow?” You asked
>”Hmm, nope, I was gonna have the day to myself, why?
>”I thought maybe me and you could do something? Seeing as I’m not doing anything tomorrow either”
>She thought to herself for a second
>”Eh, why not, it’ll be nice to get out some more, I enjoy tonight, as embarrassing and somewhat distressing it’s been for me”
>still not wanting to fall asleep you asked about her daughter
>”So Abigails with her grandparents right? She can’t be that old if you’ve left her with them”
>”Trust me, my parents take every chance they get to look after her, probably because it gives them something to do or reminds them of when they weren’t so old, she’s six by the way.
>So she had a six year old? She could be that old herself as her muzzle didn’t have a trace of grey on it.
>”Does she look like you?” You queried, nuzzling into her fur a little more
>Ursa scoffed
“Well yeah, though her furs a tiny bit darker, probably from her bastard father, not like she ever sees him though, son of a bitch walked out on me then -ugh” she groaned angrily
>Oh… that seemed like a sensitive topic, probably best to leave it for now
>Ursa pulled you onto herself gently, careful to avoid touching your back by gripping your hips instead
>your head rested on her chest pillows and you could smell her scent
>it was earthy and berry like, probably a whole shampoo bottles worth
>it put you at ease as you relaxed into her embrace
>”Why don’t you get some sleep honey, let that back heal up” Ursa whispered, kissing your forehead and gently stroking your head, her claws tingling against your scalp
>you closed your eyes and let fatigue take
>The next morning you woke, still laying in Ursa’s embrace
>slowly your senses came back to you and you realised she was whispering something
>She was cooing at you and talking lightly
>”Aren’t you the cutest sleeper, holding me like I’ll disappear if you let go, just like Abigail”
>Ursas claws were gently scratching your head, sending pleasurable tingles across your head
>you yawned, pretending to just wake up, looking around and at her
>she smiled warmly at you, yawning herself before speaking
>”sleep well?”
>you nodded, “yeah, these new pillows did wonders for my neck” referring to her breasts
>she scoffed “Heh, how’s your back feel?”
>”sore, how bruised is it?”
>Ursa frowned
>”a lot, like I thought it would, I’m sorry, so so sorry” she said, voice wavering
>”Hey, come on now you don’t need to apologise again, it was an accident, that I had a hand in causing by sucking tits a little too good”
>Ursa giggled and moved you off her belly onto the mattress before getting up herself
>she cracked her back and walked out the bedroom
>you thought about what you wanted to do today with her, what would she even be interested in?
>she was a mom and mom’s like shopping right?
>wait that might just make her feel like it’s a normal day instead or relaxing
>a movie, everyone likes movies right?
>the closest theatre was in the next town over though so you need to get there somehow
>your car was one of those tiny hatchbacks that you barely fit in
>you’d had it since you were a teenager and it had done you well so you’d not had a reason to replace it other than simply getting a better looking one
>anyway you’d have to get…public transport
>You stood up, also exiting the bedroom and heading towards the bathroom when Ursa exited it, her ears scraping the doorframe as she stooped under it
>you passed each other and just as you were about to close the door and take a quick shower Ursa asked
>”Hey you wouldn’t have any sewing stuff would you? I wanna try fixing my jean button”
>”Oh, I think so, under the sink.”
>washing yourself caused your back to ache but nothing unbearable
>clean you stepped out the shower and dried yourself
>wrapping a towel around your waist you left the bathroom
>heading back towards the bedroom to get dressed you saw Ursa sewing the button back onto the jeans on the kitchen countertop
>huh, can’t undo the button but can sew it back on with what looked like ease
>putting on fresh clothes you wandered towards Ursa in order to ask her about seeing a movie
>”Sooo, Ursa, would you, like to go see a movie?”
>She didn’t hesitate to reply with an enthusiastic “yeah”
>that was sorted then you guess
>”Oh Uh, we’ll have to take a train or something since I don’t think my car is big enough , sorry”
>checking for the next train you saw it was in just over an hour so you offered Ursa some breakfast which she gladly accepted
>checking your fridge you had some bacon, not a lot though
>whatever Ursa could have it all
>While you cooked it Ursa got properly dressed, still struggling with the button on her jeans which thankfully didn’t break
>you put the plate of bacon in front of her, which looked kind of pathetic
>to you it was a good amount of bacon but to her it was more like a small snack
>she didn’t even bother using a fork she just skewered the pieces on her claws
>either way she thanked you for the meal
>later you made sure you had everything you needed
>phone, wallet and keys
>you opened the front door and gestured for Ursa to exit first
>”Such a gentleman” she teased as you closed and locked the door
>as you exited the apartment building you passed Michelle standing in her doorway looking down the hall who upon seeing Ursa flew inside and slammed the door shut
>Ursa dragged her claws across the wooden door as she passed it, cackling to herself
>the train station was a small walk away so you’d get there with good time to spare
>Ursa suddenly starting holding your hand
>”Scared I’ll run off like a cub?” You joked
>”more scared you’ll fall over like last night, how is your ankle by the way?”
>” ’s fine, hursts if I move it too much to the left or right so I’ll just avoid doing that.”
>once at the station Ursa let go of your hand and pulled out her phone
>”just gonna call Abigail, see how she’s doing, I’ve got time right?”
>you nodded and Ursa put the phone to her ear
>after a few seconds she started talking, asking the young cub on the other side the usual questions, how she was, how much she’d had to eat, making sure she’d brushed her teeth ect
>then she said goodbye to Abigail and started to talking to one of her parents, getting into an admittedly funny argument about how much candy the kid should be allowed to have
>then the tracks started whining, subtly announcing the train was soon to arrive
>you motioned for Ursa to finish up the call just as the train came into view
>however as it stopped she was still talking
>”just, find us some seats” she said covering the mouth piece
>boarding the train it was pretty busy, luckily there were a pair of seats opposite each other free across the car
>you sat in one praying Ursa hadn’t used the call as an excuse to ditch you or something
>suddenly a bag was thrown into the empty seat opposite you
>a cat anthro tried sitting in it before you tried stopping him
>”Uh hey that seats occupied, sorry”
>he looked at you, raised an eyebrow and scoffed
>”I don’t see anyone in it”
>oh good one of those types
>”she hasn’t sat down yet, find another seat” you told him
>”Listen, I can sit where I damn well please, ya goddamn human!” The cat spat raising his voice
>*Thump* a hand grabbed your shoulder from behind
>”Is there a problem here sir?” Ursa said coldly in the same voice she had spoken to Michelle in
>”Yeah, this asshole thinks he owns the seat” the cat hissed, leaning back over and poking your chest
>that quickly proved to be a bad idea as Ursa grabbed the mans hand, squeezing it, causing him to reel in pain
>”I’m going to let go if your hand, when I do you best leave us alone or so help me I’ll show you what 975 psi can do to someone’s arm”
>she let go of his arm and he grabbed his bag, scurrying off
>you just sat with your jaw on the table as Ursa sat down
>she noticed your expression and said
>”I-I overdid it again didn’t I?”
>You picked up your jaw and said
>”Not at all and to be honest I found it kinda hot”
>you whispered the last part
>the rest of the journey was uneventful and you exited the train at the next town
>walking towards the theatre Ursa took your hand again, holding you a little closer this time
>you walked into the theatre building, smelling popcorn and other snacks aromas immediately
>now all you had to do was pick a movie
>looking at the available movies on the ticket screen there were a few to choose from:
>some sci-fi thrillers, the generic superhero one, the third horror movie in a disastrous trilogy
>oh, here’s one Ursa might like, “Furtanic” a remake of titanic except with anthros included
>”Hey wanna see that one?” you said pointing to the name on the screen?
>”Sure, why not” Ursa said
>you walked to the ticket kiosk, asking the teenager behind the till for two tickets
>”Why don’t I buy the snacks for us honey” said Ursa, pulling out a dark purple purse
>”oh, are you sure?” You asked
>”yeah, you’ll see why”
>Which you did when she ordered 3 Extra large anthro sized buckets of popcorn and 2 70oz drinks
>carrying 2 of the popcorn buckets, each almost as tall as your torso you lead Ursa down the hall to the right screen
>using your back (which hurt) to push the door open you stopped for a second to let your eyes adjust to the darkness
>barely making out the letters on the floor you made your way up to row L at the back
>The leather seats squeaked as you sat in yours and groaned as Ursa sat in hers
>you and Ursa chatted amongst yourselves for a bit, discussing terrible bosses and dating troubles before the lights further dimmed and the 15 minutes of trailers started
>a quick peek at Ursas popcorn revealed half of the first bucket was already gone, no wonder she got herself 2
>eventually the movie started and you immediately discovered to your surprise that Jack was still a human and that Rose was now a fucking giant bear
>Ursa nudged your side and gave you a sultry look
>the movie followed the original pretty closely, though some scenes were altered due to the fact one of the leads was a huge bear as previously mentioned
>then came the painting scene, to which Ursa nudged you again
>why were you so flustered all of a sudden
>oh god you knew what was coming
>Ursa suddenly put her hand on your thigh and gently squeezed
>oh fuck
>the sex scene started and Ursas hand started creeping up your thigh
>straight towards your now hardening dick
>you put your hand on Ursas, stopping it in its tracks
>she made eye contact and you made a ‘are you sure about this look?’
>she nodded and moved closer to you, engaging in a light kiss
>after a few seconds of intimate kissing there was a sudden bright light assaulting your eyes
>what the fuck?
>breaking off the kiss you looked at the source
>it was one of the theatre staff, point a flashlight at you
“You need to leave”
>leave? What?
>”What for?” You protested
>indecent behaviour
>the fuck?
>”Indecent behaviour? For a fucking kiss?” You protested angrily
“She’s feeling you up and it would have only escalated from there”
>”We’re you watching us?! You perverted prick-fuck off!” You shouted at the guy
“Get out”
>Ursa suddenly stood up and grabbed you, throwing you over her shoulder
>she shoulder barged past the employee, sending him crashing to the ground as you still cursed at him
>Ursa carried you until you were out the theatre room, then she set you down
>”Come on let’s go” she said, agitated
>you followed her out the building, now you two were walking down the street with no real aim
>”Who the fuck did he think he was telling us to stop kissing-asshole” you murmured under your breath
>”Just-let’s calm down, alright? We’ll find something else to do yeah?” Ursa sighed
>you sighed too, calming down
>”Ok, did you have anything in mind?” You asked her
>”Hmmm… well it’s a little too early to be drinking, so we’ll need to kill some time somehow, you wouldn’t mind if we went around looking in stores for a while would you?” Ursa said
>”Uhhh not at all, but please don’t talk to a friend for an hour like all moms do in a store” you jokingly said
>Ursa rolled her eyes, held your hand and started walking towards somewhere, pulling you close behind
>the first store, typically, was a clothes store
>Ursa made a beeline for the tops section, picking out a selection of shirts and jumpers that were big enough you probably could have used them as a sleeping bag with little modification
>then she moved onto the pants
>she was clearly in her element, picking out an item and deciding either to hold onto it or put it back within a second
>”Could you hold these for me?” Ursa said, thrusting a few articles of clothing into your arms
>you followed her to the dressing rooms
>she poked her head around the hallway with all the rooms in them and motioned you to follow her
>ducking into one of the cubicles you locked the door behind you and hung the clothes in the provided rack
>Ursa started undressing in front of you and you turned around, averting your gaze
>”Anon you’ve seen be naked before you don’t need to turn around” she chuckled
>Turning to face her again she had taken her shirt and pants off, leaving herself in just a bra and panties
>Ursa put on the first set of pants and shirt, asking your opinion
>”Eh, the pants are a little long maybe” you said
>thus began the ‘arduous’ task of Ursa taking off and putting on a new outfit fur you to comment on
>she groaned “God I’m not as flexible as I used to be”. While trying to take a shirt off
>Eventually you were down to the last few clothes
>The final turtleneck jumper was surprisingly thin, you were pretty sure you could see her bra through the cream coloured fabric
>What do you think of this one?”
>”I think, it suits you pretty well, the colour is kind of juxtaposed with your fur pretty well actually”
>she smiled warmly and carefully took it off, making sure not to damage it with her claws
>exiting the room you followed her to the checkout, where an uninterested cashier scanned everything
>Now carrying a bag full of clothes Ursa and you left the store, just for her to see yet another clothes store opposite
>”Hey you wouldn’t mind if I went somewhere on my own quickly would you?” You asked
>”Oh not at all, let’s meet up…next to that tree over their yeah” Ursa replied, pointing to a bare tree
>you knew where you are going but you didn’t exactly know what you wanted
>reaching the store you wanted you read the sign “Burt’s furniture”
>ok finding a seat for Ursa that could arrive today wouldn’t be that hard surely?
>Upon entering the store you were almost immediately greeted by an over enthusiastic employee
“Welcome to Burts, how can I help you?”
>”Uhh, I need a seat that can take the weight of a bear and get it delivered today possible” you said, not wanting to waste any time
“Hmmm, we have furniture that can accommodate that weight range but getting it delivered today would be the issue. We could use a third party delivery but there’d be weight limitations”
>”Yeah, yeah, just show me what you’ve got
>the employee directed you to look at some chairs, most were folding, not very good looking at kinda cheap
>but there was also a bean bag chair
>would that work?
>”what about that?” You said pointing at it
“The bean bag? Yes, that’s light enough, it also farrier brand-that means it’ll take the weight of a bear no problem”
>you ordered the bean-bag, bring tons it should be delivered in a few hours, more than enough for you and ursa to wrap up in the city and head back
>Heading to the tree you saw Ursa was already there, holding another bag and her face lit up as she saw you
>”Get whatever you needed?” She asked
>”Yeah, listen, you wanna head back to by place now or get something to eat first?” You asked her.
>”Uhhh, let’s head back, don’t wanna have to sit down to eat with all these bags, ya know?” Ursa said
>You and Ursa walked back to the train station and sat down waiting for the next train to arrive
>you got back into talking about her family, learning her name was actually the same as her great grandmothers.
>before you ran out of conversation the train arrived, and you boarded together this time, finding the train much emptier then earlier
>the ride back was uneventful, though you both joking talking about the interaction with the cat earlier and how Ursa could switch from kind to ‘killer’ on a dime
>once you got back to your hone town you started talking about what food you would get
>eventually you decided on some Indian food
>finally back at your apartment you looked at the broken couch, wondering when the bean bag would arrive
>hopefully within a couple hours
>Ordering the food you were told it would take an hour to arrive
>you had a little time to kill
>Ursa went into the bathroom with one of her bags, locking the door behind herself
>you took the opportunity to clean your apartment up a bit
>cleaning up any bits of wood around the broken couch and bedframe, opening some windows to make sure the air wasn’t stale, getting some plates and cutlery out for when the food arrived and ect
>”How do I look” Ursa said behind you
>turning around you froze up
>Ursa was wearing the cream jumper from earlier, but this time she clearly wasn’t wearing a bra as you could see her areola through the gaps in the fabric, which were bigger than before as the weight of her uncontained breasts pushed the jumper to its limits.
>not even mentioning her nipples that were bulging at the front of the jumper
>your hands went clammy and you started fidgeting
>don’t walk over and stick you head in her chest don’t walk over and stick your head in her chest
>”Good?” You stammered out
>”Did you say that like that was a question?” Ursa said, smirking and closing the gap between you two
>”She hooked a claw under the bottom the the jumper, pulling it up to the bottom of her boobs
>your eyes were focused on the huge amount of underboob now being presented
>”Want to get a closer look?” She said in her sultry voice
*Ding*
>the doorbell rang and broke you out of your stupor
>”oh the foods here” you said, Ursa unhooking her jumper
>however when you opened the door and expected to see a teenager with your food you instead found a man dragging a large…something wrapped in plastic
”furniture delivery for…Anonymous?”
>wait was this the bean bag?
>”Yeah thats me” you replied to him
”Where do you want me to put this thing?”
>”Uhh just leave it there I’ll sort it out, thank you”
>with the the man turned and left, leaving you to drag the wrapped bean bag inside
>halfway down the hall Ursa said ”How much food did we order?” In a joking manner, obviously knowing it wasn’t food
>you put the bean bag next to the table for now
>the plastic however wouldn’t budge until Ursa came over and slid a claw down it, effortlessly cutting it
>”this is for you, to sit on I mean, since the couch…” you trailed off
>”Oh, really? You didn’t have to get me a seat”
>”Yeah well I couldn’t just let a lady sit on the floor, speaking of want to ‘test’ it?
>She turned around, and you prayed the thing didn’t explode and send little foam balls everywhere
>she sat down and the chair held up fine
>after a second Ursa relaxed fully into it
>then there was another ring of the doorbell
>”Ah, there’s the food”
>you walked to and opened the door, grabbing the food bag from the delivery guy
>you put it on the counter top, setting apart all the different plastic containers and such
>when you’d finished dishing up the food Ursa’s plate was much fuller than yours which didn’t surprise you
>carrying the bowls to the table Ursa was hungrily eyeing them up
>you’d barely sat down before she dug in
>While eating you were both quiet, both from not really having anything to talk about and being focused on your food
>before long you’d both finished, Ursa first despite having a bigger plate to eat
>you took her empty plate as aswell as yours, dumping them in the sink
>but when you turned around Ursa had lifted her jumper again, higher this time
>”Still want to get a closer look?”
>“Heh, yeah” you chuckled lightly
>after a few seconds Ursa cocked an eyebrow and said “Well?” Expectantly
>oh…she was serous?
>you slowly crept towards her, like she was going to jump at you or something
>her areola were exposed now, their black with a faint undertone of pink colour almost shining in contrast with her fur
>”Why don’t you warm your hands up in there?” Ursa said in the sultry voice
>you obliged tucking your hands under her jumper on her boobs, her nipples between your fingers now
>Ursa took a sharp breath saying “your hands are cold dear”
>you squeezed and groped her boobs, the she-bear biting her lip and grunting but mostly maintaining her composure
>after a minute of this she asked you to pull the jumper off
>her breasts got caught up in it and you had to strain a little to lift the heavy things
>then they fell out the jumper and thudded against her chest resoundingly
>once the jumped was clear of her head and on the floor your hands went straight back to her bosom
>Ursa started…purring? Which was weird but you assumed that meant you were doing a good job
>then her eyes slowly and deliberately moved down your body to your groin, she smirked
>”Ya’ know your pants look a little tight there honey, why don’t we-“
>she gripped the waistband and pulled
>”-loosen them up a bit”
>something tore and the pants fell to your ankles, your underwear now tenting from your semi-hard dick
>You nor her said anything now, as she started tracing a claw up the inside of your leg from your knee, leaving a faint red welt
>the sensation made you shiver
>once she reached you underwear she didn’t stop, her claw cutting through the thin material with ease, your cock springing free once she had sliced about halfway through
>Ursa leant in close and took a deep breath, her eyes coming back up and locking with yours

>instead you are taken to luxurious mansion
>inside an aging doberman butler wearing a tuxedo tells you to follow him

>You are taken to the office where you meet her
>you have never met her but you know her
>on surface she is the beneficiary of the city, investing in several sectors of society according to the newspapers
>but word on the street is she handles the booze trade and operates speak-easies along with other shady stuff
>You start to wonder why you are so special that she wants to meet you
>except that is wrong
>she makes it clear that there is nothing special about you but the usual "liquidate" your opposition hasn't been working lately
>so instead of dealing you with in the usual fashion she gives you an opportunity to be the mafias agent with in the trade union

>You sit at the edge of king-sized bed, eyes fixed on the snow-capped forests outside,
>A flurry of snow beats on the brass-lined, stained glass window before you. The blur of gray conceals the never ending canopy of evergreens.
>A golden chandelier hanging from the sloped ceiling above gently swings back and forth with the beating of the howling wind outside.
>The swinging disrupts the thin film of dust on the dimly lit bulbs.
>You sniffle.
>Despite the fine, rich mahogany bed, and accompanying dresser, the guest room was barren otherwise.
>Your open suitcase was at the foot of the bed, your clean clothes freshly packed and ready to go.
>A flat-pack desk is set up in the corner of the guest room, its cheap but practical construction serving as the resting place for your closed laptop.
>You freeze.
>Hot breath tickles your neck.
>”Gotcha.”
>A furry arm locks around your neck, and you’re flipped over onto your back.
“Erma!” You gasp as you tumble to the bed.
>Your assailant snarls indistinctly at your call. “Silence, prey!”
>A seven foot wolf woman in a coat of dark black fur looms over you. She has both of your wrists wrapped up in one of her paws, and held above your head.
>You try and move your legs, but she has your knees pinned to the bed with her thighs.
>Her toothy muzzle is just a few inches from your face, bathing you in her heavy breaths.
>The pupils at the center of her red eyes dilate as she focuses on your own.
“Damn it!” You sigh, frustrated. “If you didn’t sneak up on me, there’s no way you would’ve gotten me in that headlock.”
>”Oh really?” She chuckles. There’s an animalistic, discordant edge coloring her deep feminine tenor. “I don’t think you’ve ever gotten out of one of my headlocks. Some things never change.”
>You try to turn away from her breaths, but she seizes your face in her other paw. The well-defined muscles of her forearm tense beneath her thick coat of fur to hold you in place.
>You wriggle against her.
“Erma M. House-” Your laughter fades. “-get off of me.”
>”When you say my name like that, you sound like my mother.” A wicked grin graces the wolf’s long snout. “’Erma M. House, come here at this instant!’” She lowers her voice in a feral mockery of her mother as she rocks on top of your body.
>Her mother did have a temper, but you rarely saw it.
>“Erma,” you repeat, your voice flat.
>”Ugh.” She rolls off of you with a groan. “Fuck, really?
“If you were my fiance, would you like another woman on top of me?”
>”Ew.” She grimaces, exposing her sharp canines. “The idea of your actual fiance on top of you is gross enough.”
>You blink, and the both of you fall silent.
>She stands from your bed. Tufts of her fur poke out through the carefully placed holes on the knees of her designer blue jeans. A red and black flannel over her top restrains her large bust.
>You turn to look at the blizzard outside the window.
“I’m going to miss my flight, aren’t I?” you sigh.
>”In this weather? You wouldn’t make it to the closest Seven-Eleven, let alone the airport.” Erma folds her arms over her large bust. Her voice quiets. “Nothing lost, if you ask me.”
“I need to go.”
>”For yourself, or your family?”
“You know how things are for people like us.” You’re resigned. “Sometimes we just don’t get a choice.”
>”Don’t give me that bullshit.” She points a claw at you. “You’re being used by your speciest Mom! She can’t be happy unless every scumbag in Washington and every Fortune 500 CEO knows her name, so she did whatever she could to weasel herself into another family name once she couldn’t use your father’s anymore.”
>You take a deep breath, bunching up the comforter of the bed in your hands.
“My mother loved my father, and not just for his money,” you offer in her defense. You sound uncertain, even to yourself. “She’s been through a lot.”
>”Yeah, well, you lost your father too. Nothing justifies marrying your own son to some useless, old-money whore he doesn’t love.” Erma taps a footpaw against the ground, her red eyes glistening in the light of the chandelier overhead. “I hate this.”
“I’ll inherit twelve percent of the Kozlova fortune. Do you understand what that means, Erma?” Your mouth is agape. “I’ll be able to build up my father’s company again! My children, and their children, and their children will grow up with more money than they could ever spend!”
>”Yeah, and they’ll grow up with a demonic, baby-eating Kozlova for a mother. It’s a lot of money, so what?” Erma brushes it off casually. “I’m worth over five hundred million. You’re really okay with being sold off?”
“You’re not going to change my mind.” You stand from the bed, and walk past her. You snatch a button-up shirt hanging out of your suitcase, and throw it over your shoulders as you walk through the open door of the guest room.
>Your wolf friend scrambles up to your speed. She walks at your side. “Why are you in such a rush?”
>The two of you progress down one of the many halls of the House Family Manor. Gray light is cast through the massive window at your back and onto the red carpet at your feet. The polished wood-panel walls are adorned with valuable paintings and dozens of heads of deer and other game.
>Some had been killed by her mother, but many had been killed by Erma.
”I’m glad we could have this week together before I left, Erma, but I can’t stay a kid forever.” your pace quickens. Your footsteps echo down the halls. “I need to go.”
>”In this weather?” Erma is incredulous. “I know that you have a four-wheeler, but aren’t you going to grab your luggage? At the very least come eat breakfast with me first.”
”I want to get my car started, then I’ll grab my stuff.” You look at the platinum-plated sapphire watch on your wrist. Each dial of the chronograph was made with a different precious metal. It was the last remnant of your father. “I still have five hours. It’ll take me two to get to the airport in this weather and another two to get through the TSA, so-”
>”You have an extra hour with me.” Erma smiles again, and it puts you at ease. You wish you could always see her light up like that. “Please, just let me make you breakfast.” The edge to her voice peaks as she tries to conceal her desperation.
>The two of you follow the hall to a long balcony that runs across the open foyer at the front of the manor. In the center of the second-story walkway is a set of steps down to the first floor. The space has half a dozen crystal chandeliers and two fireplaces crackling on either side. Their chimneys howl with each gust of wind outside.
>You stop, and lean up against the banister.
“Okay,” You sigh. “But then I leave, alright? Not a minute later.”
>Erma stops beneath an oil painting hung right above the staircase. The larger-than life canvas depicts a steely-eyed, middle-aged human man sitting in a velvet seat before a larger wolf woman. Her eyes are soft, and her fur coat has turned a silvery gray. Between them is a much younger wolf girl who couldn’t have been older than thirteen.
>You can barely remember the time before this painting was here.
>”Not a minute later,” Erma echoes with a nod.
>She smiles to match the expression of the elder wolf depicted behind her, but unlike her mother, she bears the points of her vicious teeth.
>The kitchen of the House Family Manor is something to behold
>The style of the low-ceiling room is rustic with brick walls and tiled floors, but all the appliances are sleek and modern.
>There are three industrial-sized refrigerators complete with a walk-in freezer. There must be at least a dozen ovens and stoves. All of them are properly ventilated, have their own sinks, and look as spotless as the day they were installed.
>”You know how many chefs usually staff this place?” Erma’s tail wags behind her as she steps up to the closest refrigerator.
>You follow close behind.
“Doesn’t Gordon Ramsay host his shows here?”
>Erma’s expression flattens, and she whips at your thigh with her fluffy black tail. “Very funny.” She puts her claws on the stainless steel handle to the matching fridge door. “You know, my dad almost hired him in the nineties as our head chef.”
>You snort.
“Bullshit.”
>”Swear on my mother’s tail.”
>You blink.
“That’s basically code for, ‘I’m Erma, and I’m lying’.”
>Erma swings the fridge door open from the brick wall its built into. “Shut up, humie-” The sterile white light from inside casts a shadow across her black-furred muzzle. “-And go take a seat.”
“You did not just call me that. We agreed that was off limits.” You smile despite your feigned anger. ”Do you want me to help, Erma?”
>She shoos you off with a claw, reaching in to grab a carton of eggs, a sealed pack of thick-cut bacon, and a stick of butter.
>“No, I said I would make breakfast for you.” She points to the closest table, right in front of a nearby stove-top. “Sit,” she commands curtly.
>You groan.
“Erma, you know I don’t like other people doing things for-”
>”Your father and that pesky self-reliance he taught you. Suck it up humie, this last hour with you is mine.” She puts the package of bacon on top of the egg carton with the butter, and kicks the door to the fridge shut with her footpaw.
>A gust of cold air from the industrial fridge chills you.
“Fair enough.”
>You walk to the polished steel table and sit on a padded stool facing the nearby stovetop and grill.
>”Nice spot, now I can watch that cute face while I cook.” Erma winks and sets her ingredients down on the non-cook surface beside the stove.
>You frown.
>Erma digs out the proper equipment for the job. She sets a pot on the stove, and clicks the burner on with the light hiss of natural gas.
“Erma, I’m sorry I shut you down earlier.” You lean against the cold metal table. “I know I haven’t been open about all of this the past few days.”
>”You haven’t.” Erma doesn’t look up from her work. She sticks the sealed pack of bacon with one of her fangs, and tears open the package like it was a carcass for her to feast on. “I just want what’s best for you.” She avoids your gaze as she clicks on the adjacent grill.
”I know, Erma, but-”
>She interrupts you, pulling a wood-handled knife from a nearby box-set. ”It’s nothing new. You’ve been this way for two years now.” Erma’s hands are unsteady as she slices off a chunk of butter from the stick. “You stopped talking to me. You stopped smiling.” Her voice wavers. Her black nose wrinkles at the end of her snout.
>Your lips part, but no words come.
>”Your Mom was too busy showing you off to every wealthy heiress East of the Mississippi to notice-” Erma shakes the chunk of butter off of the knife and into the pan beneath. The butter sizzles. “-but I noticed.”
“I lost everything-”
>”And I lost you,” Erma snaps, sliding the knife back into the wooden block it came from. “You were my best friend. My only friend! Everyone else-” She points toward the wall. “-they’re snakes and liars and thieves! But you dared to stay by my side despite your Mom’s disdain for me. Then your father passes, and suddenly, you do exactly what that speciest bitch wants. You let her give you away!”
>The stool creaks under you
“What can I do to make it right?”
>”You want to make it right?” Erma lays bacon strips out on the flat surface of the grill adjacent the stove-top. “Don’t go.” The pale pork sizzles on contact.
>”Shit!” Erma clenches her teeth as she accidentally folds a strip over itself. She picks up the strip in her sharp claws to lay it out flat.
>Soon, she empties the whole package onto the grill and the crackle of cooking bacon drowns out the faint howling of the wind outside.
“I’m all my mom has left, you know?”
>”What did she ever do for you beyond birthing you?” Erna cracks an egg with the side of her hard claws, and pours out the contents into the pan on the stove. She repeats this eight times, tossing the discarded shells into a nearby trashcan with perfect accuracy each time. “I showed you more affection than your mom ever did growing up. Now she’s using you just like she used your Dad.”
“My father would want me to take care of her.”
>”You know what your father actually wanted? It was the same thing my parents wanted.”
>You swallow and nod.
>”You and your Mom could’ve been provided for with my inheritance, but no, she shot that down.” Erma makes no effort to hide her resentment. She looks down to whisk the eggs in the pot with an eggbeater, biting her thin black lip. “She shot us down,” she grunts with exertion.
“I’m sorry we missed our chance.”
>Erma’s red eyes narrow. The canine whisks the eggs in the pot relentlessly. She throws in pinches of salt and pepper from two ceramic dishes on the non-cook surface with her other paw.
>”I guess we did miss our chance, huh?” Her words are that of acceptance, yet her tone is venomous. She speaks through grit teeth. “I underestimated your mother’s hold over you.”
“What does that mean?”
>”She hurt you endlessly, yet you’re sacrificing everything for her.” She growls, barely restraining her anger.
”I resent that, Erma. I made it clear that I’m doing this for myself too.” You shake your head. “More importantly, she’s family.”
>Erma takes the whisk out of the pot and throws it at you.
>It whips by your face, leaving a drop of egg yolk on your cheek before clanging into the sink behind you.
>“I’m your family!”
>You flinch away, your mouth agape.
>Her red eyes are wild for a moment, before they soften. “I’m sorry. I would never hurt you.” She trembles.
>After collecting herself, Erma takes a spatula hanging from above to flip the bacon over three strips at a time.
>You inhale deeply, wiping the drop of egg yolk from your cheek with a finger.
“I know. You wouldn’t hurt me.” You exhale. “The truth is that I don’t know how I could do anything else in my situation.”
>You grip at your neatly combed hair and prop yourself up on the stainless steel table by your elbows.
>She rakes at the steaming scrambled eggs with a spatula as the other side of the bacon cooks.
>”Why not?” she asks.
>It’s a sincere question.
>A good question.
“Near the end, when things were really bad.” You look up from the table. “I visited my father in a roadside motel twenty miles away from our home.”
>”He stayed in a motel?” Erma’s ears twitch, perking up. She continues to flip the yellow mass of eggs over in the pot.
“It’s all he thought he deserved.”
>She purses her lips. “I see.”
“He was staying under the room where some cat prostitute was working, so every thirty minutes without fail, we’d hear squeaking through the ceiling above us.” You point up at the pristine ducts and panels of the kitchen. “The radiator didn’t work so it was freezing cold, and the whole place smelt like it had been flooded ten years ago. My Dad was so drunk, though, that I don’t even think he cared.” You raise a finger to your mouth, biting your knuckle.
>”I’m sorry. That’s hard.”
>You put up a hand.
“No, no. It’s fine.” You focus on the memory. “We were laughing together, and then he looked at me. He had this-” you pause, looking for the words. “-clarity in his eyes. It was like a single instant of sobriety.”
>Erma takes the pot and dumps the eggs out onto two clean white plates with a spatula. She glances between you and her work, the wolf’s red eyes urging you onward.
“Then he took my hand in his cold and bony fingers.” You rub at your forehead with a palm. “And he told me the only thing that kept him going each day was a specific memory.”
>Erma turns off the grill, the crackling bacon grease calming. She scoops up fifteen strips of greasy bacon onto her plate with the spatula, and about half that amount onto yours.
“When I was just a boy and my father was first building his business, every night at nine o’clock he would stop working and crack the door to his study. He would listen to my mother sing me to sleep down the hall.” You turn on the stool, and stare at the featureless brick wall to your left. “He woke up everyday, and continued to exist on the hope that he might have a perfect moment like that again.”
>Out of sight, Erma rummages around through drawers and the fridge.
“He loved my mother. He loved me.” You bow your head. “I had to do whatever I could to preserve the family— to preserve what he loved.”
>Erma slides the ceramic plate across the stainless steel table and back in front of you.
>You turn to the generous helping of food before you.
>A zig-zag of ketchup is spread over top the yellow mass of scrambled eggs beside a pile of crispy bacon. You smile.
>”Just how you like it.” Erma returns your expression. The wolfess walks around the stove to sit beside you at the table. Her large rear strains her jeans and seems too big for the other stool at first, yet she balances on it effortlessly. She sets down two forks and two glasses of orange juice with one paw, and her own plate of food with the other.
>She looks at the glasses of orange juice, passing one of them to you.
“I know we don’t see eye to eye on my future, but thank you for this Erma. This is nice.”
>Erma’s grin brightens at your thanks. She finally sounds calm. “It was my pleasure.” She wraps an arm around your shoulder, gripping at you as she sticks two strips of bacon into her maw with her other paw. “Sorry I didn’t say much. Hell, it sounded like you just needed someone to listen.” Erma makes quick work of it.
“I did. Thanks.”
>You scoop up some steaming, ketchup-drizzled eggs with your fork, and stick them into your mouth.
>They’re salted to perfection. Her furious whisking has done wonders.
“Damn,” you mumble with a full mouth. “These are good.”
>She shrugs. ”Who says all of my parents’ money went to waste on me?” The black fur of her arm around your neck tickles your skin. She gulps down another handful of bacon without much chewing.
>You chortle lightly.
>You were going to live on the other side of the world as your best friend. You set down your fork, and drink half of the glass of orange juice.
“I’m sorry Erma. I’m sure we’ll find some way to talk when I’m not around here anymore. I-”
>”It’s alright.” The wolf woman squeezes your shoulder and continues to eat with one paw. “Just finish your food and your juice. Don’t want to travel on an empty stomach, right?”
>You nod.
“Right.”
>You focus on eating, cleaning the eggs off your plate.
>There’s a calmness in the two of you now. Occasionally, you’d hear the wind outside blow against the manor as Erma gulped down her eggs.
>”While I was listening to you, I thought about every second I ever spent with you.” Erma swallows the last bit of egg on her plate. “-and I realized how deeply you have been hurt. When I lost my father, he passed surrounded by loved ones at the end of a fulfilling life. Your father was annihilated by addiction.” She dumps her orange juice down her gullet and wipes the spillage from the fur of her snout with her sleeve. “You watched a great man disintegrate through his own faults.”
>You chew on a piece of crispy bacon. Erma’s arm feels like it’s getting heavier on your shoulder.
>”Did your mother even help you? No. You lost your father and the one other person who should love you unconditionally decided to use you.” Erma’s maw contorted in silent contempt. “I’m sure she drove your Dad to alcohol in the first place.”
“No, Erma. We don’t know that.”
>”I do.” Her paw clenches around your shirt collar. “She never loved you or your father like she should’ve. A human man needs tender care that she could not give, and look at what it’s done. You’re letting her sell you off just to gain the slightest inkling of her approval. I didn’t know if my plan was justified before, but I definitely do now.”
“What are you talking about?”
>Your lips tingle. You drop the next piece of bacon back onto the plate involuntarily.
“Wha-” your mouth goes numb before you can finish the thought. “What?”
>Your body goes limp, and the arm wrapped around you tenses.
>Erma pulls you against her plush side to prevent you from falling off the stool. “Sh…” She strokes your cheek with her leathery paw pads. “I dosed you according to your body weight. You’re going to be okay.”
>Your voice catches in your throat. Your head spins.
“I-I don’t understand.” You wheeze.
>”You will, baby.”
>The tips of your fingers go numb. Your whole body is heavy.
>The buzzing of the fans in kitchen of the House Family Manor never stops.
>Your best friend has drugged you.
>You try and lean away from Erma with a pained whine, but the wolfess holds you fast to her side.
>”Everything’s okay. I’m not going to hurt you, love.” She leans down to kiss your cheek with her snout. “I had to do this.”
“W-why?” you manage.
>Your eyes follow the uniform grid of mortar holding the dark-red brick wall of the kitchen together.
>”I’d never let that speciest sell you to some old-money vampire.” Erma’s voice is stern. “You think a Kozlova could show your children affection? Think she could show you affection? No. Did you know that addictive behaviors are genetic? I’m not letting the cycle repeat.”
>Pressed up against Erma’s side with a paw on the side of your face, you’re forced to smell her. The fresh detergent-smell of her shirt mingles with the musky smell of her fur coat beneath.
>Erma takes a bacon strip from your plate, and holds it up to your lips. “Eat.”
>Pressing your lips shut is the only resistance you can show.
>”I’m not going to ask again.”
>You whine, moisture pooling in your eyes.
“This… isn’t r-right.”
>”It is right!” Erma is quick to anger. “Now eat.” Her grip on the side of your head tightens. Her claws poke at your skin.
>You acquiesce, and open your mouth.
>”Good boy.” She rumbles with satisfaction and loosens her grip.
>You try and chew, but even that takes effort.
>”Just take your time. You should be able to swallow still.” Erma assists your chewing by placing her claws beneath your jaw.
>”When I look at you, all I can see is a hurt little boy; a beautiful flower that's wilted without proper nourishment.” Once she’s fed you the bacon, she moves the paw to the top of your head and pets you in long strokes. “Remember when we’d chase each other around this place?”
>Moisture pools in your eyes.
>”I’d always get you, my little prey.” She harrumphs, and ruffles your hair. “Even though we were kids, I felt how much you needed me. When I pinned you to the floor or put you in a headlock, you’d smile. In my paws, you’d finally relax.”
>She pushes your glass of orange juice across the stainless steel table and away from you. She takes her own half-finished glass.
>You shake in her grasp. Your mouth is so dry.
>”Drink, my human.” She tilts your head back as she raises her orange juice to your lips.
>Looking upward, you can see Erma’s dark muzzle. Her ruby-red eyes watch you like a hawk as you drink.
>”So obedient.” A grin plays at her dark lips. “All you want is to be held by someone who loves you, and no one can hold you like I do.”
>Once you finish the juice, she sets the glass back down and wipes your upper lip with the sleeve of her flannel.
>Erma uses her hold on you to face your head towards her.
>”I love you.” She brings her muzzle into your face and presses it into your lips.
>Your eyes widen at the kiss.
>Her spade-like tongue pushes your mouth open.
>You whimper into her as her claws tighten around the back of your head. Your part your lips to allow her slimy organ entrance.
>Erma grunts and growls, the guttural noises shaking you as she laps at the inside of your mouth.
>”Mine-” she smacks her lips. “-my human.” Her tongue spreading her faintly salty flavor to the back of your throat.
>The plentiful saliva from her tongue fills your mouth and forces you to swallow.
>Erma finally withdraws, her five-inch tongue hanging from her gaping, toothy maw.
“Don’t do this…” you trail off, dazed. “Erma.”
>With just a single sentence, you’re out of breath.
>She crooks her snout.
“Erma.”
>”No one else on Earth could love you like I can, and you know it.” The wolf smiles, baring her sharp rows of teeth. “One good squeeze, and you’re that boy again. I knew his pain; I know your pain.”
>You breathe heavily, your eyes lidded. Your lips are smeared with your combined saliva.
“What are you-”
>”I’m going to break you.” Erma runs a single claw along your red cheek, wiping away a tear. “And then I’m going to put you back together as my perfect human; my perfect husband.”
>Erma stands from her own stool, rising to her full seven-foot height. She keeps a paw around you to ensure you don’t fall.
>She lowers her other arm under your knees, and lifts you into a bridal carry. She cradles your head against her breasts beneath her red and black flannel.
>Erma starts out of the kitchen.
>“Then you’ll never want to leave.”
>Your body sways back and forth with each of Erma’s steps as she carries you through her family’s manor.
>The layer of plush fur and fat above the wolfess’ hard muscle warms you and envelops you.
>”That’s it, just hold onto me.” She beams down at you, and cradles you closer to her chest. “Good boy.”
>You have been holding tightly to the tufts of black fur around her collar bone without even realizing it.
>The top button of her red flannel is undone, forming a v-neck into the center of her furred cleavage.
“Don’t do this.” Your weak hands grip to her soft natural coat. “Erma, please.”
>The lights of the crystal chandeliers in the foyer fill your vision. The moisture in your eyes has you seeing double.
>The wind of the blizzard outside howls at the sealed entrance to her family manor.
>”This is what we always wanted.” Erma starts up the stairs leading to the second floor. “We had each other’s first kiss.” She glances down at you. “We were engaged until your Mom called it off.”
“The hunting trip…” you add.
>You were only sixteen. She had just turned seventeen. Images of Erma pushing you into her room and ripping off your shirt.
>The events of that day had gotten you worked up.
>Erma’s sharply defined cheeks flush red beneath the black fuzz.
>”I saved you from that bear, and now I’m saving you from this.” The paw resting on your head strokes your hair as you reach the top of the stairs. “It’s my duty.”
>You remember that day clearly.
>The crack of a shot in the forest. A feral brown bear, ready to swipe at you with its claws, collapsing to the ground.
>The fall of the creature revealed Erma standing a hundred feet behind, her smoking Remington raised into the nook of her shoulder.
>Erma had dashed to you, her digitigrade legs burying her bare paws into the mud of the forest. Anthro wolves preferred wearing no shoes for a hunt.
>She took your hand in her paw before pulling you up from the dirt and against her.
>”Even though you decided against it in the end, I know what you truly desired.” The two of you pass under the massive oil painting of her family. The visage of her parents look down at you two with subtle satisfaction. “You saw that I would do anything to protect you, and it made your heart ache for me.”
“I loved you.” You groan, turning toward her chest to avoid her eyes. “More than anything. You were…” You breathe deeply. This drug has exhausted you totally. “…the greatest thing in my life.”
>Erma comes to a corner in the wood-panel walls and starts down the adjoining hall. You pass by three rectangular stained glass windows on the wall displaying the drab white-out of the snowfall outside.
>You were getting close to her room and the master bedroom.
>”’Loved’?” Erma bristles at the word.
“You drugged me.”
>”You wouldn’t see reason!” She interrupts you. “No, you still love me, just like you always have, and I still love you. You don’t need to worry about saving yourself for marriage anymore, because we’re married now.”
>You whimper.
>”Now we’re going to do what we should’ve done a decade ago.”
“Erma.” You stare up at the underside of her muzzle. “Don’t rape me.”
>Was this happening?
>It couldn’t be.
>Yet it was.
“Please,” your voice is barely a whisper.
>She stiffens, her muscled arms tightening around you.
>”I’m sorry.” There’s a moment’s uncertainty in her ruby eyes. “To be a happy husband, you must first be broken.”
>The two of you come to a set of double doors at the end of the hall.
>”Just know that everything I do, I do out of love for you.”
>Erma takes the carved brass handle in her claws, and pulls open the heavy mahogany door just enough to get inside.
“If you love me, you won’t do this. There’s still time to get to the air-”
>”No.” Her response is instantaneous. She shuts it behind her. “I’ll never give you up to anyone; not to a human whore, and especially not for your speciest mother,” she promises with resolve.
>You let go of the tufts of soft fur at her collarbone. Above her muzzle is a domed ceiling with white clouds and a blue sky painted across the stucco. A crystal chandelier much like the ones in the foyer hangs over a lavish bed. Drapes hang from either side of the bed frame, concealing the massive thing behind a veil of white.
>She comes to the bed, and pulls the drape to the side. “You’ll enjoy it, I promise.”
>Erma takes you and gently sets you down on the plush foot of the bed. “You should be gaining more control over your muscles soon. I just wanted you weak enough to not hurt yourself by resistance.”
>You have enough strength to sit up, but Erma steadies you by your shoulders just in case.
>”How are you feeling, angel?” Her concern is sincere.
“Fine,” you mumble. “Betrayed.”
>She seems undisturbed by your jab. “You’ll see the truth.”
“The truth?”
>Erma steps away from the bed, and to a nearby dresser. Multiple jewelery cases with necklaces and rings rest atop the polished furniture.
>”When we got home from that hunting trip, we were so close to finally doing it.” She opens the top of one of the cases. She glances over her shoulder. “When you ran out of my room, it crushed me.”
>She closes that case and moves to the next. “I talked to my mom after, and she told me that human men were prone to get nervous around us. It was a primal instinct, and to overcome it, a human needed to be taken quickly.”
>Erma pulls something from the case, and walks back over to you.
>You crane your neck back.
>In her claws is a leather collar and a golden bracelet. “She said my father was the same way when they first met.” The collar is embroidered with golden thread spelling her name, “Erma House”. The bracelet is engraved with yours.
>”She finally decided to take him, and after one night, he was hers.” The platinum buckle is encrusted with flawless diamonds, sparkling in the light of the chandelier overhead.
>”I never understood the custom of rings among humans. The collar is a proper symbol of loving ownership.” She purses her thin black lips. “Just shows how unfit females of your species are to take care of you.”
>You reflexively lean away as she bends over to bring the open collar to your neck.
>”Hey, hey. It’s alright,” she whispers, tightening the soft leather around your neck.
>She tightens it enough to squeeze at you, but not choke you. “How’s that? Not too tight?”
“Alright.” You don’t know what to say.
>Erma holds up a paw for you to see, and snaps the bracelet engraved with your name around her fuzzy wrists.
>”Now we’re married,” she says. “We’ll worry about the paperwork when you’re properly broken in.” There’s a hunger in her eyes.
“No, Erm-”
>She places her paws on either side of you and lifts you up into the air. She brings your crotch near her face, resting your legs over both of her shoulders.
>You to her fuzzy head for support, balancing on her shoulders with the help of a paw on the small of your back.
>”No more waiting.” She glares up at you. “I need to taste my prize.”
>She unbuckles your pants, and slides them off of your thighs. She then lifts you over her head to remove them from you entirely.
>Your underwear comes next.
>You fluster, your excitement bobbing an inch away from the tip of her muzzle.
>Her hot breath washes over your sex, making you twitch.
>”It’s perfect.” Erma runs her wet nose along the bottom of your shaft and straight to the base. She inhales sharply.
>“You smell so pent up, angel.” Erma shudders, her face buried in your crotch. She puts one paw at your back, and the other wraps around your left thigh. “Let’s take care of that.”
>She sticks her spade-like tongue from her open maw. Slowly, and excruciatingly, she trails the soft wetness up the shaft and to the tip.
>Your breath catches in your throat, your hands clenching to the longer fur on the top of her head.
>Erma chuckles as she curls her tongue around your tip. “You’re going to be a good boy and cum for me, right?”
>Your response is a grimace.
“I don’t know,” you whine.
>”You will.”
>Her lips seal around your tip, forcing a hiss from you.
>She pushes you in by the small of your back until you’re totally buried in her muzzle.
“Ah!” You shiver. “Damn-”
>She chortles around your cock. The tip hits the soft tissue at the back of her mouth.
>You’re wrapped in contracting, warm flesh.
>She moves her muzzle forward and back, her tongue curling around your sensitive member.
>You rake your stubby nails along her scalp.
>Your wolf wife stares up at you as she takes you in and out of her.
>A few slurps, and you’ve become putty in her hands.
>She pulls herself off of you, leaving your saliva-drenched cock cold in the air of the master bedroom.
>”You like my mouth, angel?” She runs her tongue along her black lips, cleaning them. “Tell me how much you love it.”
“Ah- uh.” You wipe the sweat from your brow. “It feels good,” you admit.
>You blink. Your head is spinning from a mixture of the pleasure and the drugs.
>”Now give me what’s mine, humie.” The wolf growls, baring her teeth. “That sweet seed belongs to me. You’ll put it wherever I want it.”
>You nod, breathless.
>What’s happening to you?
“Yes, m-” the word dies on your lips.
>”What’s that?” Her eyes widen. “It’s okay, you can call me whatever you want, angel.”
>You hesitate.
>Erma’s unconditional affection makes your heart throb.
>It makes your thighs shake, and your member twitch right in her face.
>Even the soft tone of her discordant, animalistic tenor makes you weak.
“Yes, mommy.”
>”That’s right, mommy’s here. I’m the only one who can make you feel this way, right?” Erma coos, extending her tongue to lap a streak of pre from the tip of your member.
>The paw on your back moves upward and under your shirt. “You’ll wear the clothes I give you, not this mixed-fabric trash. Only the finest will do.” With her claws, she slices the button-up shirt right from you. “Now, tell your mommy what you want, angel.”
>Maybe the drugs are making you susceptible.
>The towering wolfess holds you in place, breathing over your cock.
”Please, just keep going!” You bite your lower lip, and rub your thighs into the fur of her neck. “I was so close,” you whine.
>”’Keep going’, what?” Her motherly voice comes through a satisfied smirk.
“Keep going, mommy,” you blush deep red. Your face burns.
>”Good boy. I’m going to change the position a bit, okay?” She rubs at the soft skin of your back with hear leathery paw pads. “Be brave for mommy. She’s not going to drop you.”
“What do you-”
>She lifts your thighs from her shoulders and holds your whole body sideways before her.
>You gasp. “Ah! Erma!”
>She curls your body around her head like a scarf. Both of your legs drape over one of her shoulders, and your head rests on the other. You crotch is right in the center, your member right on her fuzzy muzzle.
>”Now I can take you as fast as I want, angel. Just hold onto me.” One of her arms wraps around your abdomen, and the other around both of your thighs.
“Erma, I don’t know if this-” You moan as her tongue curves along to bottom of your cock.
>She pulls all the way back to your tip, before using her grip on you to piston you to the back of her muzzle in a single stroke.
“Fuck!” The noise that escapes your parted lips is less masculine than you would like.
>Erma pulls you out and then back in, rattling your whole body with the thrust. Instead of moving her mouth, she’s moving your whole body, using you like a toy.
>She has no trouble taking your cock to the base.
>Her hot, wet mouth exceeds what a human woman could ever manage.
>The sensation makes you writhe in her grasp.
>Moving your legs, you realized you’ve gained control of them again.
>As soon as she puts you down, you could run away.
>You love this more than you’d like to admit, but it’s still not right.
>Right?
>She pulls you from her, and licks your combined fluids from her lips. “I have an idea.”
“What’s that?”
>The edges of her maw curve upward in a wicked grin. “No reason mommy can’t feel good too, right?”
>Before you can respond, she lifts you by your ankles and leaves you dangling upside down in the air.
“What the hell?”
>”Don’t worry, angel, I won’t drop you.” She lowers you until your face is in front of her crotch, and hooks your legs over her shoulders.
>Blood rushes to your head, but her firm and reassuring grasp makes the position more comfortable than you expected.
>The wolfess undoes the button of her own designer jeans, and tugs the denim down along with her soaked panties.
>Erma steps out of pile of fabric at her foot paws, and kicks her discarded clothes to the side.
>Her thickly muscled thighs draw your vision to the dark lips of her moist sex right between them.
>The tufts of fur around her lips are matted with her liquids.
>A paw clenches around the back of your head. “Lick.”
>It’s not a request.
>As she brings your face in, you open your mouth.
>You run your tongue along the rubbery folds as she presses your face deeper between her thighs.
>”Good fucking boy.” She sticks your member back into her muzzle.
>You moan into her sex as her tongue curls around your cock above you.
>Erma rumbles happily, the vibration shaking the two of you.
>You build your pace in tandem.
>Your obedient lapping accompanies the brain-melting sucking far above your head.
>Erma gurgles as she holds you in her throat.
>Drool drips from the edges of her maw and splatters against your chin and the red carpet beneath.
>Erma snarls around your cock, sliding you in and out her muzzle.
>Each time she comes to the base, she runs her canine tongue along your balls.
>You find the nub nestled in her black folds and flick at it with your tongue.
>Her musky flavor fills your mouth, and your nostrils. She tastes like raw and chaotic feminine power.
>This predator is carrying you like you weight nothing.
>Your childhood friend is using you how she wants.
>Her sucking grows more fervent.
>Your face is sticking to the fur of her crotch with her juices, drops trailing up your upside-down face toward your forehead and dripping onto the floor.
>”Hmm!” you clench your eyes shut as her folds tighten around your tongue.
>Erma hisses around your cock in satisfaction as she fills your mouth with her musky lupine emissions.
>You manage to swallow her with much difficulty.
>Her tongue curls around your cock, and she pulls you from the back of her throat to accept your load.
>”Ah!” you gasp as she splatters your face and the ground beneath at the next twitch of her sex. Her fuzzy thighs tighten around your head and ears, muffling the outside world.
>She seals her lips around the head of your cock as you climax into her mouth.
>The seven-foot wolf woman nurses at your head with her black lips, coaxing each hot rope from your member with her swirling tongue.
>Your ankles clench around her head as you writhe, dangling mid-air.
>The next squirt from her dark lips blasts your cheek, filling your nostrils with her suffocating smell.
>Erma swallows you diligently, lumps trailing visibly down her tensing throat.
>She pulls you from her lips with a slick pop. She’s as breathless as you. “Thanks for the meal.”
>“What, too cheesy?” Erma looks down her body at you, her red eyes meeting your own. “You look fantastic. All human boys should have a collar around their neck and cum on their face.”
>The wolfess lifts your legs from her shoulders and turns you upright.
>Your face and your hair is dripping with her.
>She holds you up to analyze you with her ruby eyes. “Aw, was mommy too hard on you? I’m sorry, angel.”
>Erma slings you over her shoulder and lumbers toward the bed.
>The wolfess unbuttons her flannel. She makes quick work of her black bra underneath, and lets them both fall to the floor to leave her chest bare.
>She gingerly lays you down on the massive bed and curls up beside you. Both of her fuzzy breasts, large enough to give any human woman back problems, flatten over each other.
>”We can take a short rest before I break you, angel. Want mommy to clean you up?”
>You eye her erect nipples, one shade darker than her already black fur. They’re mere inches from your face.
“Yes, please.”
>Erma leans in to sniff you, combing her claws through your juice-splattered hair. “Fuck, yes, you smell just like me. Every bitch in sniffing-distance will know that you’re wolf-cunt only.” Erma brushes the stray strands of messy hair from your eyes, and styles it neat with her claws. “Are you okay, angel?”
“I’m alright,” you say, absentminded. You eye the double doors of the lavish master bedroom out of the corner of your eye.
>You could run for it right now.
>At least, you could try.
>Erma wipes her forearm along your face, soaking up her juices in place of the lighter musk of her fur.
>Do you want to leave?
>Erma brings her snout to your ear. “You won’t make it.” Her voice is low in warning, but there’s a hint of twisted amusement in her voice. “But you’re welcome to try. You know how much I love the hunt.” Her bushy tail whips behind her, slapping the velvet comforter of the bed.
>Your face goes pale. Your body tenses in her possessive grasp.
“Erma, I’m not going to-”
>”I’ll even give you a ten second head start.” She runs her tongue up the side of your exposed neck, and into your ear. She sucks the lobe onto her mouth, and nibbles at the skin. “It’ll end with you on the ground; buried deep inside of me, and screaming for more.”
>You lay in the plush velvet comforter of Erma’s bed.
>Erma’s grip on you loosens, the wolf’s fuzzy breasts resting against your side.
>”Come on. Do it. I left your keys on the kitchen counter.”
>You’re both eying the heavy mahogany doors of the master bedroom.
>The bed is so large that even the seven-foot Erna only lies about halfway down.
>A shadow is cast across your cheek by the ornate bed frame.
>Erma runs her paw down your bare chest. “If you make a run for it, and actually manage to make it to your car-” she sighs. “-I won’t come after you.”
”You promise, Erma?” You turn your head towards her.
>She’s onto you, might as well play her game.
>She bares her sharp teeth in a wry smile. She pats your abdomen. “I would never lie to you.”
>Your eyes narrow.
“It’s this or give in now, right?” Your half-flaccid member is still soaked with her wolf-drool.
>She’s silent for a moment.
>The wind of the blizzard outside howls.
>Erma nods. “If you don’t want to run, angel, there’s no shame in skipping to the fun part.” Her paw moves down your abdomen and towards your crotch.
>You intercept it with your hand, stopping its journey downward.
“Can I put my pants on first?”
>Erma’s eyes search yours. Her black lip trembles, but she makes sure to maintain her gentle smile. “Sure, but don’t start running until I tell you to. You get a ten second head start, no more, and no less.”
>You wriggle from her grasp, and she begrudgingly lets you go.
>You plant your bare feet on the carpeted ground.
>”Isn’t this exciting?” Her tone is wistful. “It’ll be like we’re kids again…”
>Wordless, you walk to the dark spot where your mixed fluids are soaked into the carpet.
>You take your underwear and pants and slip them up your legs to your waist. The crystal chandelier casts you in warm yellow light.
>You glance upward at the domed stucco ceiling which the chandelier is hanging from. The painting is simple, but clearly skilled. The clouds obstruct the sun midst an otherwise clear blue sky.
>”Ready?”
>You look to your wolfess friend and take a deep breath.
“Erma I-” you start, but don’t know how to continue. You want to say something that will make this okay. “I know why you did all this. I can appreciate your reasons, and I know that you love me.”
>Your hand turns the soft leather collar around your neck. You’re wearing her name, a name you’re still proud of somehow.
“I just hope that you can understand my reasons.” Your hand falls from your neck and to your side. “If I don’t see you again, just know that I do love you. I always have.”
>She crooks her snout. Moisture pools in her eyes as her gaze softens. “I’ve always understood.”
>”Thanks,” you reciprocate the smile.
>The black nose at the end of her furred muzzle wrinkles upward. Her eyes narrow and she sniffles as she steels herself again.
>Erma growls low and sits up on the bed, sliding towards the edge in preparation.
>”Go.” She mutters the command with a snap of her jaws.
”Erma, wait, I-”
>”Nine.”
“No!”
>Time to go.
>You scramble toward the double mahogany doors to your left, nearly falling over yourself and into the door.
>”Eight.”
>Glancing over your shoulder at the predator, you put your back into throwing one of the ten-foot doors open.
>You scramble up to speed in the hallway before you.
>“Seven!”
>To your left are the stained glass windows to the glowing, gray abyss of the white-out blizzard, and to your right are dozens of mounted heads of game.
>Erma had caught and killed many of those.
>The thud of the door to the master bedroom finally closing echoes down the hall.
>”Six!”
>The head of a bear and a bear-coat rug are right in the center of the hall.
“Five!” her voice grows more distant.
>Your arms swing at your side as you dash down the hall.
“Kitchen. Garage. Kitchen. Garage…” you repeat under your breath.
>”Four!”
>Veering ninety degrees to your right, you redirect yourself down an adjoining hall. Fighting to change your vector, you drift along the floor. Your inertia brings you right toward the wall.
You bounce off the dark wood with your shoulder, leaving a dull ache in your side.
>”Three!”
>Luckily the collision didn’t rob you of much momentum.
>“Two!”
>Just beyond, the hall leads to the balcony in the bright light of the foyer.
>The kitchen with your keys was on one side of the foyer, and the garage was on the opposite side.
>”One!”
>You’d have to cross back over, or make a whole loop around the circular floor plan of the manor.
>You push your already painful sprint just that much faster.
>Erma howls, the haunting, blood-curdling sound plenty loud despite the distance you’ve put between you and her.
>The hunt is on.
>You pass a few more guest rooms and the open library.
>As you reach the staircase and the oil-painting of her family above the foyer, you just spot a gray blur turning down the hall behind you.
>You dig your heels into the carpet to bring yourself to a halt. You eye the swooping curve of the polished wooden banister down the staircase in a moments indecision.
“Agh!”
>You grit your teeth and hop onto the banister butt-first.
>The polished wood screeches as you slide down it and you quickly getting up to speed.
“Shit! Shit! Shit!” You lean back with the curve of the banister outward, balancing yourself on the wooden rail.
>The air whips at your hair, still wet with Erma’s juices.
>Her voice echoes down the hall behind you. “A human is no match for a real predator in a hunt!”
>You come to the bottom, stumbling onto the red carpet floor with the momentum of your slide.
>”No claws! Little stubby teeth! Smaller, weaker! The only advantage you have is endurance…”
>You squint at the brilliant light of the crystal chandeliers bathing the foyer.
>The naked Erma emerges from the hall and onto the balcony of the foyer. “I’m coming, prey!”
>Her digitigrade legs propel the predator’s superior form with grace you couldn’t aspire to.
>You make horrible, terrifying eye contact.
>Erma’s pupils are dilated, her tail whipping behind her as she bears her extended claws.
>Her movement toward the top of the stairs breaks your trance and you make way toward the arched doorway to the kitchen
>”I’m going to fuck you silly when I catch you, human!”
>You pass under the brick arch and into the tiled, industrial-sized kitchen. The dirty grill and stainless steel table with the remnants of your breakfast are in sight.
>Your keys twinkle in the fluorescent light beside the white ceramic plates.
>”I’ll treat you better than anyone else ever could. Just give up!”
>You weave through the tables and grills until you come to the one with your keys.
>You snatch them.
>”There you are, cutie.”
>You whip around to see her standing in the doorway to the kitchen, just fifty feet away from you.
>You stop.
“This is it, huh?” you ask, holding out your hands with the keys.
>”Yup. I have you cornered. You could run all the way around the house that way-” She points past you. The wolfess takes a single step toward you, then another. “-but I’ll still catch you.” Her digitigrade legs bend inward with each step, like a spring ready to pop.
>Your eyes narrow.
“Then come get me.”
>She immediately lunges to full speed, weaving the same path through the stainless steel kitchen ware that you did.
>Right as she closes in on you, you vault over the table at your side, over what was left of the drugged food and drink that Erma provided earlier.
>Instead of catching you in her arms, the wolf slams right into the table with a loud clang.
>She howls in pain, and gnashes her teeth. “Agh! Get back here!”
>You make your way out of the kitchen, but you hear the claws of Erma’s foot paws scratching into the tile behind you as she comes for you once more.
>The light of the foyer bathes you. The heavy white door of the garage is just across the carpet.
>Freedom.
>So close.
>You smile, and laugh, the keys jingling in your hand.
>Erma snarls behind you.
>You look over your shoulder to see her launch toward you by her foot paws.
>You drop to the ground as over two-hundred fifty pounds of muscled wolf-woman latches onto you from behind.
>You are sent tumbling over each other.
>The two of you roll two a stop, with you laying on top of her, face up toward the ceiling.
“No, please!” You gasp as you flail around, trying to wrestle out of her claws.
>An arm locks around your neck, and pulls your head back to hers.
>The wet nose of her muzzle dabs at the sensitive skin of your ear.
>”Sh…” she coos into your ear as she slices your pants and underwear from you with her other claw. “You did well, my human prey. It’s time to give in to your wife. Give her what she wants.”
>Keeping you in the headlock, her other paw slides over your chest, your abs, and wraps around your now-naked member.
>A few pumps of her soft pads, and it’s standing at attention and throbbing.
>Heat radiates off of her.
>You stop writhing, and you stop fighting.
>As she pumps you, you stare at the door. It’s freedom, just out of reach.
>Freedom.
>Was it really?
>You’d be owned by someone that didn’t love you, and wouldn’t love your children.
>Why were you willing to live that way, again?
>For your mother?
>”Are you okay?” Her concern is audible.
>Your mother was the one who messed you up.
>She messed you up so bad, that you actually loved your now-rapist and wanted to stay.
>No, you loved Erma before that.
>She gave you what no one else did, what no one else would.
>You relax into the wolfess’ grasp completely, and she stops pumping.
>”What’re you-”
>You turn over in her headlock, putting your pecs to her breasts, your abdomen to her rock-solid abs, and your member to her burning slit.
“You said that you would break me.” You prop yourself up on her furred shoulders, staring into her red eyes. You shake your head. “Erma, I am broken.” The tip of your cock brushes her burning hot sex. “You make me feel not so hurt… not so fragile.”
>Her maw hangs open.
>You lean in to place a kiss on the wolfess’ black lips. You spear her other lips with the tip of your member.
>The both of you moan as you push further into her heat from above, her legs wrapping around your hips.
>She grunts at your thrust, and returns the kiss.
>Your tongues push at the other’s.
>Impatient with your slow entrance, Erma pulls you in swiftly with her densely muscled legs.
>”I love you,” She groans into your mouth. “Mommy will never leave you, angel.” Her thighs clench around your hips like a vise.
“I know,” you breathe, pumping your hips back for another stroke.
>She loosens up to allow you to pull back.
>You slam back down into her, your whole member alight with sensation.
“Ah!” you bite your lip to stifle a moan.
>”That’s it.” She pulls away from the kiss to watch your eyes. She cups your cheek in a paw. “Show me how much you want this, husband.”
>A wet squelch echoes through the foyer as you pump back inside.
“Please, hold me.” You quicken your pace.
>”Yes!” The wolfess hisses. On each stroke downward, she pulls her legs against your back, forcing you back in.
>Erma’s paw clenches around your chin, forcing you to look at her as you slam into her. “I’ve dreamed of us since I was ten!”
>The wind of the blizzard howls outside.
>You stop looking at the door to the garage, and focus on your partner beneath you.
>She chuckles. “I know it’s fucking embarassing, but-” She swallows thickly. “-I had my parents buy me a human family doll set, and a wolf family doll set!”
>Already tired from your chase, you let your arms give out under you to drop to her chest.
>”My father made me work for both of them. I had to clean the house with our servants.” She grits her sharp canine. “But it was worth it!”
>Your face falls right between her plush breasts, her bust spilling out and flattening off the sides of her chest.
>”I threw the human wife, and the wolf husband out!” Erma moans as you withdraw, and slam back inside. “I made the perfect family set. There was a tall, strong wolf wife and her beautiful, perfect humie husband! They had the most beautiful pup girls, and baby boys.” She chokes up. “I would play with them, imagining it was us!”
>Your arms wrap around her breasts, squeezing to her. You groan as her tunnel clenches to you, tight like her thighs on your hips.
>“And now it’s real. It’s finally real!” Her paws grab your sides.
“Ah!” You gasp as she leaps to her feet, flipping you onto your back with your cock still buried inside of her.
>She smiles as she assumes her position over you
>Erma holds you up by your legs in the amazon position.
>She’s going to fuck you in the middle of the foyer.
>A lit, brick fireplaces hisses with natural gas, the orange light of the hot flames falling over you and Erma.
>”It was fun to have you on top of me, but this is where you really belong, angel-” Erma clenches tighter to your cock. “-under the predator who’s collar you wear.”
>You bite your lip
>The wolfess pulls you up into her by your legs while she squats onto your member, meeting you right in the middle with a hot squelch.
>You writhe on the plush carpet, giving up on biting your lip to moan out loud.
”Yes!” you yell at the ceiling as your wolf wife fucks you into the ground.
>”Moan for mommy.” Her smile widens as her digitigrade legs bend at either side of you.
>You indulge her.
>”This cock belongs to mommy.” Her discordant, feral tone has a sharp edge to it. “Every human cock belongs in wolf cunt, not in human girls or other anthros! They can’t give you the companionship we can!”
>You breathe deep, trying to comprehend the endless, overwhelming sensation of her constricting tunnel.
>”We’ve been together-” she grunts as she readjusts her grip on your ankles. “-since the dawn of civilization! The oldest stories are of wolf and human tribes. You belong to us!”
>You wipe the sweat from your brow with your arm as you listen to her and the wet plaps of your coupling.
>”The first cave paintings are human hands inside of wolf paw prints!”
>You rock with each of her squats, pushed back and forth along the floor.
>Your breaths are rapid and ragged.
“Please, don’t stop, mommy,” you beg through grit teeth.
>”Who owns you?” She punctuates her question by burying you to the hilt in her sopping slit.
>She stops on the down stroke, holding you deep in her.
>Erma grinds on your pelvis, pleasuring herself on you. The sensation is torturous to your sensitive flesh.
>“You want me to keep going? Tell mommy who owns you!” The wolf’s dark fur is matted with your combined fluids.
“You do! You own me!” You cry in your daze.
>”Good fucking boy.” Her tongue lolls out of her mouth, and her eyes narrow as she resumes her frantic fucking. ”You’re gonna be a father to wolves… my house husband!”
“Yes, yes, I’m your good boy, your good little humie husband!”
>Erma falls over you, angling your legs right up into the air. She supports herself with her paws on either side of your head. ”Hold onto me, husband,” her voice is husky. Her muzzle hovers over your mouth.
>You wrap your arms around Erma, staring into her predatory red eyes.
>The wolfess keeps pounding into you, battering your hips and squeezing around you.
>Erma leans down, pressing her fuzzy breasts to your chest and lapping at your cheek with her spade-like tongue as she fucks you.
“Please, break my mind!” You stare up at the crystal chandelier hanging over you.
>One of her paws moves to your neck, pulling you up into a kiss by your leather collar. The battering of her hips into yours quickens at your request.
>You’re forced to swallow her plentiful drool as her tongue delves into you. Your owner’s distinct, wild musk is spread through your mouth.
>The kiss. The sex. It’s too much.
>Your eyes roll up as your mind is inundated in pleasure.
>The world is you, Erma, and the pleasure the wolfess gives you.
>She shudders as you hit a particularly sensitive spot in her constricting heat.
>The wolfess breaks her kiss to snarl, sending globs of her musky saliva across your face.
>“You’re mine, human!” Her discordant tenor is nearly feral. “You’re fucking perfect!”
>You shake at the force of her wet hips slamming into you.
“Rape your little human.” Your arms tighten around her and your mouth hangs open. ”I'm your good boy!”
>The two of you pant into each other’s faces.
>”Oh, really?” she mutters between breaths. Her paw trails from your collar to just above your hips, inches away from your point of contact with your mate. “You want a tattoo of mommy’s paw print above your hips, angel? Then everyone will know that you’re a good little wolf breeder.”
“Whatever you want, anything at all!”
>”When that speciest bitch of a mom sees you wearing my collar-” she gnashes her teeth, enraged at the mere mention of her. “-and she sees my paw print on your body, she’ll know! She’ll know that her son is wolf-cunt only!”
>The thought of Erma showing up your mother fills you with twisted satisfaction.
>”I’m close.” Erma’s dripping tunnel twitches around you. “You’re gonna be a good boy, right? You’ll fill mommy up and make her pregnant, won’t you?”
>You nod frantically, her paw still pressing against your abdomen. “Mark me, mommy! Mark me as your property!” You crook your neck, baring your sensitive flesh just beneath your leather collar.
>Her already rapid pace speeds up to a hip-bruising intensity, your legs bouncing in the air, and your tongue hanging out of your mouth as you’re screwed silly.
>Erma rears her open maw back, exposing her sharp canines. “Now! Cum, angel! Cum for mommy!” Her teeth come down to the base of your neck and she buries you in her to the hilt.
>You explode inside of her as her teeth pierce your skin and flesh.
“Yes! Breed me! Breed your good boy!” you scream up at the ceiling.
>Your soaked balls tense as you shoot your first rope deep in her wolf sex.
>Her quivering tunnel spurts and gushes around you, drenching your skin in her musky emission.
>Erma’s claws pull on your collar, pressing her teeth deeper into you.
>The mixture of pain and pleasure addles your mind.
>Erma growls and laps at you even as her teeth are buried in the base of your neck.
>Your legs shake in the air as your seed fills her burning quim.
”Deeper! Deeper!” You push on the back of Erma’s head, forcing her teeth as far into you as they will go.
>Your mixed climax splatters to the carpet beneath, soaking it dark.
>You fire your last shot into her tunnel.
>Her wolf cunt twitches she finally pulls your soaked member from her and her teeth from your neck.
>She laps lovingly at the set of canine teeth marks on your neck.
>At first, the wound pulses with pain and stings at her licks. With a few more seconds of your mate’s gentle ministrations, the pain diminishes.
>You’re both huffing desperately for air.
>Erma falls off of you, and to your side. She pulls you back into her fuzzy body with her muscled arms to embrace you right on the floor.
>Your neck nestles between her breasts, and you rise and fall with each of her heavy breaths.
>The wolfess continues to the lap at your bleeding bite, wrapping a paw around your chest to pull you flush to her.
>”You may be broken, husband, but-” her tongue trails from your bite up your neck, and to your cheek. “-I’ll put you back together, I promise.”
>You smile.
>That’s alright with you.

>"Ugh! That is it!"
>you hear a fist slam down on a table in the other room
>there's a rattle of empty soda cans and the clatter of old plates
>"Stupid fucking yeens! Dumb slut horses! Goddamn fucking dirty whores!"
>you sigh and set down your novel
>looks like you had to calm her down again
>you crack open the door into your roommate's room
>you hadn't seen the bunny in forty-eight hours, she never leaves
>but you had heard her plenty in all that time
>a beam of light cut through the blacked out room
>she hisses in shock as she turns about and is met by the light of the hall
>her eyes, wringed in sleep-deprived purple, narrow as they struggle to adjust from the glow of the computer screen
>"Anon!"
>you step into the room, flicking on the light to dispel the gloom
>"It's not fair Anon! Look at them! Those stupid bitches showing off their humie boyfriends!"
>she spins about in her chair and jabs an accusatory finger at the screen as you approach her
>"Just cause I'm not a seven foot tall yeen with a stupid fake cock! Humies should be with buns! I'm really gonna do it this time!"
>she's on that website again, even though all it does is send her into fits of rage
>you sigh and lean over top of her, putting your hand over hers to take control of the mouse
>"A-A-Anon!"
>she stutters, staring at your hand
>you just move the mouse to the top of the screen, and close down the internet
>"Hey! I wasn't done with that! I had to show those bitches that bunnies can get human boyfriends too!"
>with a sigh, you step back and look around the room
>it really is a sty
>how can she afford her half of the rent when all she does is sit around and yell at strangers on the internet all day?
"You really need to take a break, Minn. Have you ever tried going out and talking to a human boy? Or anyone? Or maybe just...being outside your room for a little while?"
>Minn lets her head slump down on her desk
>she whines
>"But outside suuuucks Anon!"
>she thumps her head against the desk again
>"Everyone out there is so mean, and no one wants to talk about video games or human/bunny compatibility or anything!"
>you cross your arms
"Meaner than those girls you're angry about on the internet?"
>"That's different! They're shitting up the thread with their dumb fucking yeen-posting this and winking-pussy that!"
>Minn slams her fist down on her computer desk and goes to pull up that website again
>you step around her chair and rest a finger against the power button on her oversized computer tower
"Minn. I will do it."
>"Wait! Anon waitwaitwait! Just one post! I gotta prove that bunnies can get human boys too!"
>she types frantically, glancing between you and the screen, before freezing
>"Wait a minute! Oh my god! Anon, you're a human boy!"
>you roll your eyes
"Gee, thanks for noticing."
>she picks up her phone, frantically trying to unlock it
>"Please Anon! Just let me take a few pictures with you so I can show those hyenas and I promise I'll stop! For at least the rest of the day!"
>you stare at her
"The week. And you clean up your room."
>"Deal!"
>Minn hops up, standing on her chair
>holy shit she's not wearing pants
>try not to stare
>Minn puts her arm around your shoulders and holds up her phone for a selfie
>"Okay Anon! Smile like we're in love, okay?"
>before you can even look at the camera she takes several photos
>then frowns when she looks at them
>"We don't look in love enough. Here, let me take one kissing you."
>what
"Hang on Minn, I don't--"
>Minn mashes her face against yours, taking the opportunity to push her tongue into your open mouth and make out with you sloppily
>all the while she keeps the camera clicking
>you're left dazed, bunny saliva trailing down your chin, when she finally pulls back
>"Those are awesome Anon! That'll really show those dumb sluts. Here, I have another idea!"
>she grabs a fistful of your hair, dragging your head down as she runs her tongue over your face
>"There! Now look all dazed like I just fucked you silly."
"Uh?"
>she take a few photos as you work on processing what's going on
>she still doesn't seem satisfied
>"The angle is right. A good human boyfriend would be on his knees for the perfect bunny girlfriend, right?"
>you don't know about that one, but Minn is already forcing you down the grip on your hair
>how is a bunny half your size still so strong
>"Here, just on your knees. A couple more photos and then I'm done, promise! I can't wait to show my parents I have a boyfriend..."
>did she say parents?
>Minn keeps pushing, but dropping to your knees just to prove a point was going a little far
>even for a pushover like you
"Minn what the fuck?"
>she stops pushing your head down
>"What's wrong Anon? We're almost done. Come on, we had a deal!"
>she suddenly gasps as she looks you up and down
>"Oh! Oh my god! You have a boner!"
>when did that get there?
>you are hard as a rock right now
>"Fuck yes! I gave a human a boner! I did it! Bunnies ARE the best! Fuck yeah!"
>she pumps her fists
>"Take that you stupid fucking sluts! I did it!"
>she spends a little bit of time in exultation before she stops again
>"Oh fuck, you have a boner. Fuck! Do you like me? Do you want me? Shit what do I do? I've never done this before. Anon are we married now?"
>she is a total virgin, but at least she's on the backfoot now and you have a little space to breath and collect yourself
"We aren't married Minn. We just made out a little bit. We could keep going if you want, but no more pictures, alright?"
>she looks at you with eyes like dinner plates
"And no more yelling about other species. The neighbors have complained."
>Minn drops down into her chair and lets out a jittery giggle
>"Holy fuck me and my human roommate are gonna fuck this is like all my hentai doujins."
>you think she might be having an actual meltdown
>"Anon what do I do? How do we start again? Do I just grab it? Anon please, do I grab it?"
>it's kind of cute how desperate she is
"It's okay Minn, take a deep breath. What do you WANT to do?"
>Minn follows your advice and takes a deep breath
>"What do I want? Um, I want to uh..."
>she tugs at an ear in thought
>"Oh! Can we do like--like the photos I was gonna take, only no photos? So you can be on your knees for me?"
>it's a start
>you drop down to your knees at the side of her chair
>you see Minn chewing her lip as she looks down at you
>"Then you could maybe uh, kiss my feet a little?"
>she extends one of her legs out to you, flexing her fluffy looking toes
>you hold on to her calf with one hand, and lean in to start planting small kisses on the pads of her footpaw
>she giggles and her breath hitches
>"Ooh just like that my cute little humie~"
>you roll your eyes but continue to shower her with affection
>until you hear the telltale click
>your eyes snap up
>Minn gives you a guilty grin
>"These ones are just for me. Promise."
>you huff around the toe currently pressed against your lips
>but you keep going, running your tongue over the top of her foot, and then kissing up the inside of her calf
>you hear a mixture of giggles and soft moans intermingled with snapshots being taken
>if you find your face on some kind of weird species based porn site, you're going to throw her computer through the window
>you trace kisses along Minn's inner thigh
>a thigh bigger than your head, thick with muscle and extra fat
>"You like my legs? My big strong legs? Bigger than any other girls?"
>she is really putting on a voice for this
>but it makes her happy
"They're amazing Minn."
>her fur gets matted and slick as you continue working toward her slit
>it smells of musk and sweat
>Minn's been looking at more than just imageboards in her room
>her other leg wraps around the back of her leg as she crosses it over her lap
>you're trapped now
>"This is a dream come true."
>Minn has finally dropped her phone, now focused entirely on you
>she tightens the leglock, pressing your face into her lap
>you do what comes natural, running your tongue over her vulva
>Minn squeaks and squeezes you tight
>you keep eating her out, exploring her folds with your tongue
>she may well pop your head off with her thighs as her breath hitches higher and higher
>finally your efforts are rewarded with a flood of femcum as Minn doubles over and spasms in climax
>her thighs finally cut off blood pressure, and the world starts to swim
>any attempts to warn her are lost in her orgasm
>you feel yourself slipping into unconsciousness when Minn finally releases you
>you topple back onto the floor, your head landing conveniently on a pile of her dirty laundry
>"That was amazing Anon. Better than the hentai..."
>you suck air, arguing how worth it would be to die in those bunny thighs
>definitely worth it
>"Anon? Anon?! Holy shit did I kill you? Oh shit they never warned me about this! Fuck!"
>silly bun
>she better clean her fucking room
>"Hey Anon?"
>Minn calls to you from her bedroom, though she's standing in the doorway to address you face to face
>she's been making an effort to get out more
"What's up, Minn?"
>Minn flops an ear to one side, a clear sign of nervousness
>"Are we...dating?"
>that wasn't the question you were expecting
>but it was bound to come up sooner or later
>you set down your novel
>never going to finish it at this rate
"Well Minn, we've been fucking like ra--crazy for the last two weeks now. You've bragged to all your internet friends about how you 'have' a human now. Those are usually signs of dating."
>she huffs and shakes her head
>"I know that! But are we dating-dating? I mean, could we go on something like, you know...a real date?"
>the rabbit wrings her hands and sways nervously as she manages to force out the question
>this is the girl who threatened to break your pelvis while in the throws of passion just last night
>nervous about going on a date
>your heart may stop
"I'd love to go on a date with you, Minn. Did you have something in mind?"
>Minn gasps and hops in place excitedly
>"Yes! Yesyesyes! I did! I'm gonna go on a date! Wait here, I'm gonna go change!"
"Hang on, should I--"
>she's already slammed the door and disappeared back into her room
>you shrug and go back to reading
>a few minutes later, the door slams open again and Minn is there
>she's wearing a plain white dress that almost blends into her fur at the edges
>she fills it out nicely, the short skirt giving a view of those legs you love so much
>you're stunned
>you didn't think she owned any clothing that wasn't repurposed pajamas or plastered in video game characters
>"Okay! Let's go Anon!"
>you fear you may be a bit underdressed if she's going in a full dress, but she doesn't seem to mind as you lace up your shoes
"So what did you have in mind, Minn?"
>Minn smiles
>but it's not a cheerful smile
>she looks like she's planning something
>"Oh, just this coffee shop by the apartment! My treat."
>Minn is practically bouncing with each step out the apartment and down the street
>she takes you to a place you had seen once or twice before
>"Cappu-yeen-o"
>a cutesy cartoon hyena sips at an oversized cup of steaming coffee on the sign
>this won't end well
>you go for the door, but Minn stops you
>"Waitwait! Anon, before you go in could we--would you uh, hold my hand? So it looks like we're together. Because we are together!"
>she stumbles over her words, looking a lot less sure of herself now than when you were leaving the apartment
>you put your hand out for Minn to take it
>and when she hesitates to take it, her hand hovering over yours, you just reach out and take it
>that little squeak of shock Minn makes is enough to make whatever comes next worth it
>she's so damn cute sometimes
>Minn finally works up the nerve to push open the door and lead you in
>with the jingle of a bell, you step into the cafe
>it's comfortable looking, with wooden tables and soft looking chairs, along with a bar set in the back for customers to sit at
>a hyena woman behind the counter waves at the pair of you
>"Welcome to Cappu-yeen-o! Take a seat and I'll be with you real quick."
>she's dressed for work in cheery yellow apron, with her mane pulled into a ponytail
>Minn hops up to the bar, jumping up onto one of the available stools
>you take the one next to her
>the hyena approaches a minute later
>"Oh! Hey there Minn, I almost didn't recognize you! Who's this?"
>the hyena gives Minn a friendly smile and then turns to you
>"Well Shay, this is my human boyfriend Anon! Isn't he so handsome? He loves bunnies SO much."
>Shay's grin tweaks into a knowing smirk
>"Oh! So this is that roommate you were obsessing over, huh? You're right, he is handsome. Hey there hun."
>Shay offers a hand, and you shake it politely
"Pleasure to meet you."
>Minn crosses her arms when you sit back down on the stool
>"Anon really, really likes me, don't you Anon?"
>she makes no effort to hide her jealousy as she puts a possessive hand on your thigh
"Oh, well, Minn is a handful some times, but she's plenty of fun when she's relaxed."
>you stress the last word, patting her hand to reassure her
>Shay laughs, leaning over onto the counter to look you in the eye
>man she is tall
>"Oh I'm sure. I hope you're able to keep her stress-free, Anon. Last time she was here, she got so excited she spilled her coffee everywhere!"
>Minn gives in an indignant huff
>Shay just continues
>"So, can I get you two lovebirds something to drink?"
>Minn cuts in first
>"A coffee! With extra cream, and whatever my boyfriend wants."
>she sets down her credit card on the table
>you make your own order, and Shay gives you both a toothy smile
>"Excellent choice. I'll have that right out to you two!"
>Shay stands up straight, and turns about to start working on your drinks
>Minn, meanwhile, is fuming in her seat
>"Thinks she's so great with her hair, and her...dumb coffee."
>you cock an eyebrow
"Minn, why bring me here if you're gonna get all jealous? This is almost as bad as that website you go to."
>Minn stops staring daggers at the back of the hyena and turns to you
>"I'm not jealous! I'm on a date with my boyfriend, getting some coffee from a...lovely...café!"
>you think she choked on the word 'lovely'
>honestly, she's trying way too hard right now
"Listen Minn, it's alright. You wanted to show off a bit, but Shay's playing the game too. She's just being friendly is all."
>Shay returns with your drinks, both of them served in cups with the same cartoon hyena giving an 'OKAY' symbol with her hand
>you take the cup and enjoy the first sip of the steaming beverage
>"Here you two are, hope you enjoy--"
>Minn jumps up in her seat, phone in hand
>"Here's me and Anon having sex! This is the part where he says he loves bunny pussy!"
"Ack!"
>you cough, choking on your drink as you struggle not to spill it
>what the fuck
>you hear your own voice, moaning and panting, coming from the speakers of Minn's cell phone
>"Say it!"
>her voice echoes out from the device
>"I love bunny pussy!"
>was your response in the video
>you grab the phone from Minn's hand, and desperately fumble with it to shut it off
>but the damage is done
>Shay stares at the two of you, eyes wide
>your face burns hotter than the coffee
>Minn beams, triumphant
>"That's how much Anon loves bunnies!"
>she stands on the stool, arms crossed
>the three of you are left in silence for several seconds before Shay breaks out into a cackle
>"Wow! I didn't know you had it in you Minn!"
>she laughs some more, slapping a hand on the table
>Minn's triumphant demeanor falters
>"What--What do you mean?"
>Shay manages to regain control of herself
>"I didn't think you were ever gonna snag that humie boyfriend you were after, but from your video it looks like Anon is really into. REALLY into you."
>she cackles a bit more when she turns her attention to you
>"You like 'em small, huh Anon?"
>oh god someone please shoot me now
"Minn. Oh my god. Minn."
>you're still at a loss for words, and now Shay was ganging up on you too
>"You ought to meet my husband, Minn. He blushes like that when I tease him in public. So cute."
>Shay sighs
>"Though he usually isn't so open about what we do in our bedroom. You post that anywhere?"
>Minn drops onto her stool again, wind taken out of her sails by Shay's complete nonchalance
>"Uh, no. No that kinda stuff I just save for me."
>this is it
>the most embarrassing moment in your entire life
"Minn. Minn. Why did you show the nice coffee lady a video of us having sex?"
>Shay loses her cheerful demeanor and steps back from the counter
>"Okay, maybe you two need some space."
>the hyena makes herself scarce while Minn turns to you as if realizing for the first time there might be something wrong
>"Anon, I..."
>you just stare at her
>she stammers your name a few times, gesture toward you, then the back of the café where the hyena had disappeared to
>"I can't--I don't--She was gonna--"
>you have to take a moment to restrain yourself from raising your voice
>you were a pushover, but this was too far
"Minn. You took me out on a date so you could, what, rub it in the face of a woman who's already married? And the moment you get jealous you start showing homemade porn to what, scare her off?"
>Minn folds, ears hanging down as she drops her head in shame
>"I just didn't know what do do! I was scared! What if she stole you? Or someone else does? I'm--I'm a loser Anon! You're way out of my league and I didn't--I don't wanna lose my shot!"
>Minn tears up, reaching out to try and hold on to you
>but you stand out of your stool, away from her reach
>Minn gasps and hiccups, not quite full-on sobbing
"I trusted you with that camera Minn. Because it made you happy."
>"I'm sorry Anon, I'm sorry!"
>you shake your head
"I like you Minn. When you're not going crazy over this species stuff, you're fun, you're sweet, and you're so damn cute. But it has to stop, okay? It's not healthy."
>you gesture over to Shay, who had reappeared to serve a couple other customers seated away from the bar
"And you're not just hurting me. I bet you could be great friends with Shay if you had made the effort."
>you run out of track, shutting your mouth a moment to look at the defeated bun on the stool in front of you
>you do feel bad about it, but some bandaids need to be ripped off
"I'll see you at home, Minn."
>Minn manages to pick up her head enough to look you in the eye
>"Will you want--want to talk then?"
>you sigh
"I just need some time to think, Minn. You should do some thinking for yourself.
>you turn on your heel and walk out of the coffee shop
>the last few days have been quiet
>since the incident at the coffee shop, Minn has been keeping her distance from you
>only polite greetings and curt goodbyes
>she's been out of the apartment more and more
>you haven't heard a peep from her when she's in her room either
>it's let you catch up on your reading, but you're starting to worry
>you were resolving to speak with her when she beat you to the punch
>"Anon."
>she steps out of her bedroom, clad in her usual pajamas
>though they lack the usual stains from snacks and carelessly consumed beverages
"Minn. How are you doing?"
>you set down your book
>so close to the ending too
>"I've been better."
>she laughs, but it's hollow
>Minn climbs up onto the couch next to you and leans into your side
>"I'm sorry Anon. For everything. I was an awful roommate, I was an awful friend, I was an awful girlfriend."
>you look down at her, but let her keep speaking
>"I didn't like you for you. I liked you because you were a human. I didn't care about how kind you were to me, especially when I was in one of my moods."
>her speech is punctuated with sniffles as she starts to cry
>"I'm sorry Anon. For the video. For the yelling. For being so selfish. For everything!"
>you remain silent for a while, considering her words
>Minn trembles and stifles her crying as best as she can
>you know how you have to respond, of course
>putting an arm around Minn, you hug her gently and lean down to plant a kiss on the top of her head
>right between those ears
"I forgive you, Minn."
>you feel her body stiffen, before melting into you
>"Thank you! Thankyouthankyouthankyou! Anon! You're the best! The sweetest, kindest--The best!"
>so maybe you're a pushover
>is it so bad when you get to see the cutest bunny in the world so happy?
>you scoop her up with your arm and deposit her on your lap
>she twists so she's straddling your lap and facing you
>"I mean that Anon. You're so much better than I deserve. And I was so scared--I mean what if you really did find someone better? I mean, I know you don't really--the species stuff doesn't mean anything--"
>she's babbling
>so you silence her with a kiss
>it's not quite the french kiss she forced on you for her photos
>but it's deep enough to quiet her and have her hanging onto you desperately
>you break the kiss to look into her eyes
"I like you Minn. I'd like you if you were a bunny, or a hyena, or any other thing under the sun."
>you have to lay off the romance novels
>that was cheesy as shit
>it seems to have worked on Minn though
>her mouth hangs open, and she stares at you with shining eyes
>and then she jumps you
>her mouth is pressed against yours in a desperate kiss
>her delicate tongue sliding over yours while she holds your face in her paws
>she keeps kissing you, and humps against your lap
>"You're the best--"
>she gasps out the words
>"Gotta--gotta reward the best boyfriend ever."
>you know well there's no stopping a bunny when she's in the mood
>so you hook an arm around her waist and turn in your seat to lay back across the couch
>now she's straddling you, draped over your chest
>her paws slide under your shirt, the soft fur pads tickling you a little as she works the garment up your torso
>Minn is hesitant to stop kissing you to get your shirt fully over your head
>but when she does, she lets you pull the garment free while she sits up and works at removing her own shirt
>you smile like a dope, staring at her perky breasts now that they're free
>but her best feature still grinds into your lap, rubbing against your boner
>just a couple layers of fabric between you and paradise
>"What kinda girls have the best tits in the world?"
>she starts in on an old line, you can't help but grin
"You do, Minn."
>she gasps
>"You weren't supposed to say that!"
>she covers her face, trying to hide her embarrassment
>letting you ogle her chest freely
>when her hands drop from her face, Minn glares at you with false malice
>"You're not being fair, Anon. I'm supposed to be doing better and you just--you're--"
>she grunts and hops off your lap
>Minn stands over you, pulling down her pajama pants and kicking them aside
>she takes one step forward, and nearly trips over you trying to spin 180 degrees
>now you're left looking up at her thick thighs and massive rear
>Minn drops down again, dropping herself to sit right on your face
>heaven on earth
>you massage her cheeks with your hands
>"Mmf, knew you'd like that..."
>her voice is muffled, but she's right
>you love it
>unseen to you, Minn works at getting your cock free while she grinds her dripping sex against your face
>once she has it out, she wraps her lips around it and starts to suck you off
>you're pent up after so long without fucking like rabbits, you know you won't last long
>you let Minn do all the work, trapped underneath her as you are
>simply enjoying her ministrations while drowning between her thighs
>she bobs her head to take you all the way to the base and back again
>and your cock twitches in her mouth, sensitive after being neglected
>your moans are muffled when she grinds down hard
>try as you might, you can't keep your climax at bay
>you buck your hips into her mouth
>she presses herself all the way down, letting your cock throb and twitch in her throat
>you give a truncated thrust and shoot a pent up load down her throat
>she swallows once, then again, and again before you're finally spent
>when she finally pulls free you're still twitching and leaking the last of your orgasm
>she licks it up greedily
>once she's satisfied, she finally lifts her leg and frees you from beneath her
>"How was that?"
>you pant and shudder
"If you..." you pause to take a breath, "If you take a picture of me like this, I will sell your computer to a crypto-miner."
>Minn frowns, but quickly dissolves into giggles
>"I wouldn't dream of it."
>Minn picks up her discarded pants, and fishes her phone out of her pocket
>"See? Didn't even have it with me this time."
>you pick yourself up and sit back on the couch with a satisfied sigh
>Minn flips through her phone, and then gasps
>"Shit! I totally forgot!"
"Forgot what?"
>Minn scoops up her clothes, dropping her phone in the process
>"Shit! Shay invited us out for a double date wither her husband tonight, and I already said yes! We're late!"
>she flees into the bathroom, leaving you in stunned silence on the couch
>at least she's getting out more

>zebra gf who is racist against other zebras
>honestly believes that she's not a zebra, but a horse with an unfortunate fur condition that makes her look like a zebra

Shelby Story
>you wake up, some unknown time later
>the bright light of morning shines through the window
>and manages to land right on your face
>you groan and try to roll over, only to find yourself still hunched over the edge of Shelby's bed
>the events of the middle of the night come back to you as you straighten out your stiff legs
>you must have fallen asleep while comforting Shelby
>she's still holding your hand, even in her sleep
>you slowly pull your hand out from hers and haul yourself up off the bed
>your sleeping posture left a lot to be desired, and your spine raises a crackle of indignation as you stretch
>and despite your efforts to be gentle while getting up, Shelby stirs
>her nose twitches and ears flick
>she reaches out with her paw toward where you'd been laying
>"'Non...?"
>she grumbles
>"Where're you?"
>she growls softly as she continues searching the bed
>she jolts, suddenly shoot up from the bed in a flash
>you stumble back a bit, not expecting her to jump up so suddenly
>her nightgown is twisted from the sudden movement, and sticks close enough to her fur to show her slim figure
>"Anon!"
>her eyes find and you, and all the tension runs out of her stance
>her fur settles and she takes a deep breath, smiling sheepishly
>"Good morning. I hope I didn't startle you, just uh...let instincts get the better of me."
>you nod slowly
>you had almost forgotten she was still an anthro
>and you still didn't know what you could expect of her once things got settled
>she must have sensed something of your thoughts, as she took a step back to sit down on the bed
>"Thanks for checking up on me last night, Anon. It made my night so much better."
>Shelby gives you a warm smile and pats the bed next to her
>"We've got a lot to take care of today, but I think we could take a little time right now. Join me?"
>you nod again, sidling over to sit on the edge of her bed
>Shelby reaches out and takes your hand
>once she's intertwined her fingers with yours, a change comes over her
>her tail starts to wag against the bed
>her ears perk up too
>"That's better..." she coos
>you have to admit, you don't mind the little bit of physical connection
>her fur is soft and smooth, and the pads of her paws are warm against your skin
>she didn't ask this time, but you guess it's only fair after you snuck into her bed late at night
>"We'll have to go get your stuff from the storage lot, maybe do some grocery shopping. I'm on leave the rest of the week, so plenty of time to get things done, and--"
>she frowns
>"And I left all the paperwork at the assignment office. In the waiting room. Damn it all."
>Shelby groans, before looking to you and smiling again
>"I guess that just means I'll have to give them a surprise inspection! They'll never see it coming."
>Shelby laughs as though she's hatching a conspiracy with you
"Shelby?"
>she cocks her head when you speak up
>"Is something wrong, Anon? You don't have to worry about that wolf when we go back. I'll be there with you."
>you shake your head
"It's not that."
>you try to figure out the right way to ask how she managed to cow an entire office of anthros with the flash of a badge
>she tilts her head the other way
>and her ears flop with them
>it's adorable
>damn it all, you can't hand this
"Could you pick up a uh, a cookbook or something? When we go out?"
>the collie gasps, and smiles wide
>did someone open a shade and let the sunlight in?
>"Anon! That's a great idea! Having home made food would be amazing."
>you just nod and look back down at the ground
>you guess you'll get your answers eventually
"Thanks Shelby. I'm not much of a cook."
>"That's okay Anon! Just another thing we can figure out together.
>she squeezes your hand and her tail wags faster
>wap wap wap!
>it thumps against the bed
>"I don't think I'll ever get tired of being close to you Anon. Gosh, I must seem like a little girl, getting so giddy over holding hands with a cute boy."
>she giggles
>you find you suddenly can't meet her eyes
>and your face is a little hot
>just remember there has to be a catch
>has to be something wrong you haven't seen yet
>you take a deep breath to try and still your thoughts
>you'll make it work
>you said you would
>Shelby leans her head down to catch your eyes with hers
>"Whatcha thinking about, Anon?"
>you blink
"Nothing. Long day ahead of us. We should get ready, right?"
>she lets out an exaggerated sigh
>"I guess we can't spend all day sitting together, huh? Why don't you go grab a shower and I can see about breakfast. Plenty of leftovers from last night!"
>when you stand to leave, Shelby holds on to your hand to keep you next to the bed for a couple extra seconds
>but she lets you go
>and her tail slumps
>it's not like you were going far
>you planned on a quick shower, but Shelby's was much nicer than your old one, and you spend several minutes relaxing under the spray of hot water
>you're startled by a knock on the door
>"Everything okay in there Anon? You didn't slip and fall did you?"
>how long have you been in the shower?
"I'm fine! Almost done."
>you scrub yourself as quickly as you can, and step out of the shower
>and right back into your old clothes from yesterday
>just have to shower again when you pick up your clothes from lockup
>Shelby is waiting for you once you open the door
>"Hurry hurry Anon, food's getting cold!"
>the takeout is less appealing the second time around, but you still eat quickly
>"Okay! We can clean up later, we're gonna be late!"
>she shoos you from cleaning up the empty containers
>Shelby runs off from the kitchen, down the hall to disappear into her room
>and she's back shortly after changing out of her nightgown
>she's dressed more sensibly for the weather, a heavy coat that covers down to her thighs and a set of leggings
>you find yourself mildly disappointed they cover up the fur of her legs, but they do show off their form
>"Ready to go?"
>you just give a nod, trying to suppress the more primal part of your brain
"Ready."
>"Great!"
>Shelby trots past you, taking your hand and leading you out the door
>"Let's get your stuff from lockup first, yeah? We need to grab you a coat!"
>you do need something like that
>even still indoors, you shiver in the chill of the building's stairwell
>as Shelby stops to unlock the door, you hear the sound of footsteps a floor above you
>and Shelby's tail droops considerably
>"Shelby! I was hoping I'd catch you!"
>a sheep comes down the stairwell
>she's shorter than Shelby and even you, but she has a wider frame, with wide hips and a somewhat ridiculous bust
>and she has to be at least fifty percent wool by body mass
>Shelby turns and gives a less than enthusiastic greeting
"Allie. How nice to see you."
>the sheep turns her attention to you
>"Oh, and who is this? Finally found yourself a human of your own huh? Where'd you catch a cutie like him?"
>Shelby steps forward, keeping between you and Allie
>"This is my husband, Anon. I put in for assignment. Anon, this my neighbor. Allie."
>Allie gasps and clasps her hands together
>"Oh that's so wonderful! I thought you'd never find yourself someone to settle down with. Always so busy busy busy! Better not work too hard, else someone might sneak in and snatch Anon away."
>Allie gives you a wink through a mop of wool that half-covers her eyes
>Shelby grips your hand tight, and even tugs you to stand closer
>"No one is stealing him, Allie."
>Allie laughs, ignoring the shift in Shelby's mood from tolerant politeness to open annoyance
>"Oh of course! I'm sure you'll keep a watchful eye on your human. Wouldn't want to steal a shepherd dog's property."
>Shelby snarls!
>she bares her teeth, letting go of your hand to bear down on Allie
>Allie stumbles back, tripping over the stairs and falling over
>"Wh--Wha--"
>Shelby cuts her off
>"Anon is not property! If you ever say such an awful thing about him again, I'll--I'll--"
>she stammers, before jabbing a finger into Allie's chest
>"I'll shave you bald and make a sweater out of your wool."
>Allie was sufficiently cowed, trembling as she laid back on the stairs where she fell
>"Now, Allie, I want you to apologize."
>"S-sorry Shelby, I--"
>Shelby barks again
>"No! Apologize to him."
>Allie scrabbles back up a couple stairs, and spare a glance your way
>"I'm sorry!"
>and then she turns about and flees the rest of the way up on all fours
>you hear a door slam shut above you
>once she's gone, Shelby sighs
>she spins about to face you, sitting down on the steps leading up where Allie had been just a moment before
>"I'm sorry Anon. I wish stuff like that wouldn't happen."
>you stay next to the door, watching her
>would she lose her temper like this every day?
>you're glad it's never been directed at you
>"Don't worry, I'm not really gonna shave her. I don't--I'm not a violent person, but she really shouldn't have called you that. Property."
>she spits out the word like a bad taste in her mouth
>"You're not property. You're still a person."
>you're not sure how to take it
>you were used to the kind of talk that your new neighbor was making
>and worse
>but it upset Shelby enough to make her snap
>you watch as she starts to shake
>and she whines softly
>there's a lot you don't understand about her yet
>but she's done her best to protect you
>your emotions wrestle over themselves as you approach your wife
>she looks up at you in questioning
>you sit with Shelby in silence for a short while
>you're more than happy to let her coat reflect heat back onto you
>just another thing she's given without expecting anything in return
>you still don't really trust her
>but hasn't she been kind enough for something?
"Music."
>you break the silence
>Shelby perks her ears, and looks down at you
>"What was that, Anon?"
>you look her in the eyes
>bright green eyes
"Music. You asked what it was like in the home. I did music."
>she blinks
>"Music? Really?"
"Yeah. They let us choose ah, 'life skills' classes. They said it would help our prospects. I played an instrument."
>Shelby's trail tries to wag, but trapped against the stairs, it doesn't have the room to make a full motion
>instead it whaps against your back and the next stair up
>"That's amazing, Anon! What did you play? Do you still play now? Oh! Do you think you could play something for me?"
>her excitement is infectious and you let yourself smile a little
>but it twinges into a frown when you go to answer her questions
"I don't really play anymore. It was the state home's instrument, and I couldn't afford one for myself on the stipend they gave me after I was on my own."
>Shelby's smile wavers
>"Oh, that's a shame, Anon. It must have made you happy to play music. What exactly did you play?"
>you had tried to dodge that one
>oh well, you prepare yourself for ridicule
"The banjo."
>the wagging stops
>Shelby stares in shocked silence
>her jaw hangs open
>and then she snorts
>her paws fly over her mouth to stifle the laugh building up in her
>"The banjo? Really Anon?"
>you roll your eyes and look down at the concrete between your feet
"It was that or the accordion. The banjo looked easier."
>Shelby breaks into cheerful giggles
>her tail wags against you in full force
>you should have just told her about your traumas
>that would have been easier
>"I'm--haha--I'm sorry Anon, I just--I picture you playing the banjo and it's just..."
>she breaks into another fit of laughter
>you hang your head and groan
"Forget it. Let's just go, please."
>you start to stand up off the stair, but Shelby catches you by the arm
>"Aw Anon, I'm sorry. Here..."
>she pulls you back down gently, then puts an arm around your shoulders to hug you to her side
>"There we are. No need to be embarrassed Anon. That wasn't the answer I was expecting is all. Did you like playing music?"
>she's holding you
>and though it's mostly just the bulk of her coat, there's still a little bit of her own warmth beneath it
>you nod your head stiffly
"Yeah. I liked it."
>Shelby hugs you tight
>then she lets you go, rising off the step to stand
>"Then that's what matters. I won't bring it up again if you don't want."
>she holds out her hand to you
>you barely hesitate to take it, and she helps you up onto your feet
>"You were right though, we do need to get going! It's going to be dark by the time errands are done if we keep at this pace."
>Shelby hurries downstairs with you in tow
>you forgot how cold it is outside
>a blast of icy wind to the face is enough to remind you when you step outside
>once you make it to the car, you're left shivering in the seat while Shelby works the controls to get hot air flowing
>satisfied, she works the lever in the steering wheel and the car rolls out of its parking spot and down the street
>the drive back to the assignment office is thankfully a little shorter than yesterday
>no need to make any stops
>Shelby makes a few attempts at small talk, about the weather and about food, but you're back to your usual reticence
>giving sparse, one word responses to most of her conversation attempts
>hard to break old habits
>even if it makes a very kind border collie droop her ears
>usually very kind
>you spend most of the car ride letting your thoughts wander like that
>questioning her motives, what she's capable of
>second guessing everything she's done since you two met
>she can't as nice as she's been for no reason
>and those glimpses of her when she's upset is all the more proof
>but you have to make things work, right?
>no other options
>you're sure you could go on with thoughts like that for hours and hours
>all worries and no solutions
>it's a good thing you've arrived at the office already
>Shelby seems rather excited to be back
>"You think I should try and scare them, Anon? Burst in and start shouting?"
>you shake your head
"No. I don't want to be here for long."
>really you wanted to avoid becoming the center of attention again
>or at least, holding hands with the center of attention
>naturally, Shelby's already put her paw in your hand and interlaced fingers while you entered the building
>the same dreary hallway with drab walls
>you both know where you're going so you don't have to be lead this time
>Shelby still enters the office first though
>she cocks her head and frowns when the she-wolf from yesterday isn't there
>but the rabbit is
>she freezes when she catches sight of the border collie in the door
>if her eyes were open any wider, they'd roll right out of her head
>"Inspector Winn! You--You're back! Already?"
>'Inspector Winn'?
>the rabbit fumbles a handful of paperwork, sending papers everywhere
>Shelby has to keep her tail from wagging in amusement as she crosses the room
>the office was empty of any humans, with only the rabbit and an older jaguar occupying the security desk
>the feline eyes you and Shelby while you two approach the rabbit's counter
>Shelby's put on a stony face by the time you reach it
>"I did say there would be a full audit."
>she lets the threat hang in the air before breaking into a polite smile
>"But I'm afraid that's not today. I simply left our paperwork in the office. One of the waiting rooms."
>the rabbit lets out a breath held in anticipation
>she manages to organize her paperwork and regain her detached demeanor
>"Of course. We set the forms aside for you, Inspector Winn. We planned on simply mailing them to you."
>the rabbit stands from her chair and shuffles around beneath the desk before producing a single folder
>"Here you are. Please have a pleasant day, Inspector Winn."
>Shelby takes the folder and smiles sweetly
>"I'm looking forward to the results of your audit."
>she turns about and leads you out of the room, sparing only a glance to the jaguar
>you see a twinge of something cross her features
>annoyance?
>anger?
>you aren't sure, it's gone so quickly like it was never there
>Shelby passes you the folder when the pair of you step outside again
>”Shame that bi–wolf wasn’t there, huh? I would’ve liked to see the look on her maw when we walked in.”
>you shake your head
"Too much trouble. I didn't want her losing her temper or something."
>Shelby shrugs while getting into her car
>"Then she'd really be in trouble."
>she takes off again, rolling through near-empty streets
>the storage facility is even further away from the center of the city
>nearer to where you used to live
>the nicer apartments and businesses give way to tenements and industrial lots
>back to the drab of grey concrete
>it's different, watching the buildings go by from behind the window of personal vehicle
>you're underwhelmed when you get to your second destination for the day
>property retention, another squat, square, State building
>this one larger than most, as it's host to dozens and dozens of storage lockers for those who have had their property seized for various reasons
>mostly from humans if they have to get assigned, as far as you could tell
>you take the paperwork with you inside just in case
>the tired looking donkey inside doesn't even bother looking at it, simply demanding your name and ID
>she tacks away at the old computer, before looking to you
>"I don't have 'Anon Nemo' under that ID number. Are you using your..."
>the donkey glances to Shelby
>"...correct name?"
>oh right
>you had forgotten
"Anon...Winn?"
>it doesn't feel right saying it
>Shelby squeezes your hand
>naturally, you had been holding it the moment you got out of the car
>the donkey huffs through her nose and makes a correction
>"That's better. Your belongings are in locker number 317."
>she slides a key over the counter and Shelby takes it with a curt 'thank you'
>she swings her tail side to side while you walk together through the facility
>fluorescent lights flicker overhead as your footsteps echo off the concrete floors
>"Anything you're especially looking forward to getting back, Anon?"
>you know the first thing you're going to grab
"A jacket."
>even though you're indoors, the building is still poorly heated beyond the front office
>when you get to your locker, Shelby wastes no time in unlocking it and rolling up the door to the storage space
>inside lay the whole of your life before marriage
>it's a little depressing
>a metal-framed single bed with a threadbare mattress
>some tattered old books about music theory
>a couple boxes of ratty clothes
>and a photograph encased in a cheap frame
>you leave Shelby's side to start going through the clothes in search of warmer wear
>when you finally find the grey jacket, you throw it over yourself with relish
>better than nothing
>in the end, you stack up the boxes of clothes and leave the rest
>no room for furniture in the car, and you'd read through those books enough to have them memorized
>"What's this, Anon?"
>Shelby has the photo frame, scrutinizing it closely
>"Was this from the home?"
>you go to join her, looking down at the faded photograph
>two dozen boys, from pre-teen to near-adult stand arranged on the front steps of a red brick building
>some smile politely for the photo, others glower or stare expressionless
>one of the older boys gives the camera a huge grin, showing off missing teeth and a black eye
>and at the side is a stern, middle-aged badger woman in a practical brown uniform
"That's us. I'm on the end there."
>you did not stand out as much as the smiling boy
>younger you stares back out of the photograph with dinnerplate eyes
>"Aw, you're cute even back then! Can I hang it up at home? I can put it right next to the one with me as a kid!"
>you return to your stacked boxes, and start to heft them up
"If you like. I always thought I looked like an owl in that one, with the eyes."
>Shelby giggles and sets the frame on top of the boxes you're carrying
>then she grabs the whole stack out of your hands with a small 'hup!'
>"Well I'd say you look adorable. And you still do. If we're not taking anything else, let's get this stuff to the car so we can see about getting stuff for dinner."
>Shelby leads the way back out of the corridor with a spring in her step
>she keeps glancing down at the picture
>then back at you
>you don't mind when she calls you cute
>you leave the key at the front desk
>the donkey warns you that everything left behind will be gone for good
>nothing you needed anyways
>Shelby loads your boxes in the trunk of the car, then hands off the photo for your to carry along with the files
>you find yourself staring at it while she drives toward your last stop
>staring at the photograph brings back memories of your time in the home
>some good, more bad
>most quiet and empty
>you wonder how some of the boys you were friendly with are doing now
>you never saw anyone from the home after you left
>the old days are gone
>you flip the picture over as Shelby pulls the car over in front of a market
>it's more lively than the government building
>you see through the windows a few anthros inside
>and walking out is a human
>dwarfed by a horse anthro who has him pressed up to her side
>she keeps a hand on the back of his neck, directing him down the sidewalk and around the corner
>just how things are
>when you step out of the car and enter the store, you keep your hand to yourself
>"I'll see if they have a cookbook. Anon, you think you could get some simple things to start with? Vegetables?"
>you nod and wander off deeper into the market
>you barely have a chance to select some decent looking onions when you hear heavy padding footsteps stop behind you
>"Hello, little thing."
>the hairs on the back of your neck stand up
>whoever it is, you can feel her leering over you, her shadow blocking out the lights above your head
>definitely a predator
>you want to turn around and tell her to leave you alone
>what good that would do you
>so instead you keep facing forward, not looking back as you respond
"I'm sorry, miss. I'm already married."
>you hear the pout in her voice as she steps back
>"Oh but you were all alone. You shouldn't wander so far from your wife, little thing. It's not safe; you might give a woman the wrong idea."
>the stranger leans in close to let her breath roll over the back of your neck, before turning to stalk off
>you stare down at the small display until you're sure she's gone
>should have known what kind of attention you'd grab on your own
>going to catch another civil disharmony charge at this rate
>then you remember
>your hand goes to your pocket
>and you untangle from it a silver ring
>would it help?
>you stare at the thing for several seconds before you shove it back into your pocket
>don't need to get bogged down in thoughts again
>you gather a few more things you think would work
>Shelby finds you as you're stuffing some potatoes into a wire basket along with the rest of your collection
>"Here you go! Right near the front!"
>she presents a book to you
>'Easy Recipes for the First Time Cook'
>well it's the right book for you
>you add it to the pile
>"Did you have any trouble?"
>you consider her question, wondering if she knew about your short conversation with the stranger
>but she'd be far more serious if she suspected something
>you just shake your head
"None at all."
>she wags her tail and grins brightly
>"Great! Why don't you pick a few recipes for the week and we can get the rest!"
>you spend the rest of your time there at Shelby's side, going through pages of simple recipes and listing off ingredients
>most of it looks far beyond you in skill and price
>but Shelby assures you it won't be a problem as she loads up the basket
>"I'll take care of it. It'll be worth it to have some home cooked food!"
>once it's full, Shelby takes the now heavy basket from your hand and hefts it easily
>she paid for it all at the counter near the entrance with three bills
>along with a small package she quickly swept into a jacket pocket before you could see what it was
>there's enough that you don't have room for it all in your lap, so the food too has to be fit into the trunk out in the car
>you're glad to fall into the passenger seat of the car finally
>it's a strange feeling to be looking forward to the apartment you were so wary of just yesterday
>"Well! Certainly got a lot done already huh? Thanks for coming out with me, much better running errands with company."
>Shelby reaches over from her side to pat your head
>"You already make things so much nicer for me. Thank you Anon."
>you don't know how to respond
>you feel you hadn't done much of anything
>the headpat is nice though
>Shelby smiles sweetly, and you realize you're leaning into her hand
>your face burns in embarrassment and you lean back to a neutral position
>"So cute..."
>Shelby mutters to herself, but you catch it
>only makes you burn more
>to regain some composure, you crack open the cookbook
>you think the baked fish should be easy enough
>just salt, pepper, oil, and fish
>and heat
>"Big plans for dinner, Anon?"
>you nod
>just need to figure out how to cook the vegetables
>Shelby pulls over in front of her apartment
>you gather up the paperwork and the photograph when you climb out of the car
>and you go to the trunk to start carrying some things in
>Shelby tries to shoo you from picking up the boxes of clothes, but you've already got them
"If you could just get the food, please. I don't have enough hands."
>"Fine, fine. Let me get the door for you then."
>she scoops up the paper bags of food and scurries ahead of you
>true to her word, she holds open the door to the building, then sneaks around you on the stairs to get the apartment door
>"Here, why don't you drop those in our--er, the bedroom. Thanks Anon."
>is it your bedroom?
>are you going to take the couch again?
>sounds like a problem for later
>for now, food
>you set the boxes, with the paperwork and photo on top, down on the bed and run back to the kitchen
>Shelby's working on organizing the food
>you take what you need to get started, and flip open the cookbook
>two cuts of fish in a baking dish, salt and pepper
>you set the oven on and drop the dish inside
>you leave it to cook and go to find pots for the vegetables
>"Do you need any help there, Anon?"
>Shelby watches you as you work
>and leans in anxiously whenever you pick up a knife to cut or peel something
>you're surprised she hasn't tried to pry one from your hand already
>"Anon, did you do the fish right? I think I smell..."
>you pull open the oven, and the smell of burnt fish floods the room
>you sputter and curse
>you reach out to try and take the fish out, but Shelby jumps forward
>"No!"
>she grabs your wrist and yanks it back
>"You'll burn yourself!"
>oh right
>"Please Anon! Be more careful!"
>she takes out a dish towel to pull the burning fish out of the oven, which she deposits on the countertop
>she slams the oven closed and turns back to you
>"Are you okay?"
>she still has an iron grip on your wrist, which you tug lightly against
"I'm fine. You're squeezing too hard."
>she lets go of your wrist and steps back
>"I hurt you? Oh no! Anon, I'm sorry, I didn't--Is it bad?"
>she goes for your wrist again, but you pull back
"I'm okay Shelby. Just let me try and fix this."
>Shelby visibly wilts, her tail and ears drooping
>stepping aside, she lets you work at trying to salvage the food
>she still watches you work
>the fish is charred on the outside, but some of the inside may still be edible
>you overdid the vegetables too
>mushy potatoes, and wilted greens
>the two plates of food you manage to put together are rather pathetic
>you set them out on the table
>Shelby joins you as you sit down to eat
>she makes a valiant attempt at eating your food
>and manages to avoid coughing too loud when she swallows a bite of fish
"Sorry. I guess I really don't know what I'm doing."
>you pick at your food a little more
>"It's okay Anon. You did your best! And you'll get more practice. Is your wrist--it's not hurt is it?"
>you shake your head and roll your wrist to show it's fine
>"I didn't meant to hurt you, I was just worried. If you got hurt I don't know what I would have done and I just--It's like--"
>she growls in frustration
>"It's in my blood. I have to protect my--protect what I care about. I can't help it."
>what did Shelby's neighbor say?
>'a shepherd dog's property'?
>you continue to move food around your plate
>at least the potatoes were mostly edible, and filling
>you manage to eat enough to justify calling it a meal
>Shelby seems to have had her fill as well
>you rise to start clearing the table
>the mess in the kitchen will need more work too
>Shelby stops you from taking her plate
>"Thank you for making dinner, Anon. It was good! For, you know, a first try."
>she laughs weakly
>you smile along with it
"Thanks for saving my hands. I'll try not to burn them tomorrow."
>Shelby's ears finally perk back up, and her tail swings a bit
>"I got these for us, to celebrate."
>she pulls from her pocket a box of toffees
>she tears into it, revealing a half-dozen wrapped candies which she holds out to you
>you take one and unwrap it, chewing it as you take up Shelby's plate to carry it to the sink
>it's sweet, and sticks to your teeth
>perfect
>you get what washing up done you can, leaving the oven dish to soak in warm soapy water in the vague hope of the burn fish loosening off it
>by the time you're done, Shelby's disappeared from the table, and migrated to the couch
>where she's clearly expecting you to join her
>no reason not to
>she's shed her coat, leaving her in a pristine white sweater, and the leggings that distracted you so much in the morning
>you settle down next to her
>and wait for her to make a move
>she breaks the silence after a few minutes of sitting awkwardly
>"Are you afraid of me, Anon?"
>you look to her, mouth open to respond
>but you don't have an answer
>"Afraid of anthros?"
>she's either a fantastic guess, or read you very well
>or you're that obvious
"I am. You should know why boys end up in State homes."
>she takes your answer in silence
>then she opens her arm, holding it for you to accept or reject her embrace
>make it work
>you lean over into her arm, which she wraps around you protectively
>"I don't want you to be afraid of me. I want to protect you. I want you to be happy. I want to be happy with you. But I'm not going to force you to do anything, you understand? You're safe with me, no matter what."
>try as you might, there's no answer you can give that satisfies
>Shelby holds you, a little awkwardly as you have to lean over to remain in her embrace
>so she scoots closer
>her head rests against yours, soft fur tickling your cheek
>then she takes a deep inhale through her nose
>she starts to sigh in contentment, before sniffing again
>her nose pokes into your neck as she smells intently
>you realize exactly what she’s smelling
>and brace yourself for another line of questioning
>instead she only murmurs softly
>”Are you okay? Did she touch you?”
>you shake your head
“I’m okay. I told her I was married.”
>Shelby relaxes
>”Good.”
>she doesn’t push the matter further, and settles back down in comfortable silence
>she does keep sniffing you though
>her nose tracing a chilly line over your neck, behind your ear, and through your hair
>you lean away from her probing nose, but she tightens her hug around you
>"Hang on..."
>she shivers slightly, before gasping and letting you go
>"Oh! Sorry! I wasn't thinking. You just--"
>Shelby takes a few deep breaths
>"I like your scent, Anon."
>you blush
>wait, should you be flattered by that?
>you shake your head
"Just ticklish."
>Shelby gives you a sly grin, clearly noticing your reaction
>"Of course Anon. Ticklish. I'll be more careful."
>she's still grinning when you pick yourself up off the couch
"I ought to finish cleaning..."
>easy excuse to make
>you return to the kitchen and work at scrubbing the oven dish clean of the charred fish remnants
>"Can I ask you something, Anon?"
>you hear Shelby get up off the couch, and glance over to see her folding up the bedding from last night
"Go ahead."
>you watch out the corner of your eye as she walks into the kitchen
>"Is there anything in particular you like about me?"
>you turn to look at her
>Shelby stands in the middle of the kitchen, arms turned out slightly
>legs
>legs
>legs
>"Uh..."
>she giggles at your reaction
>you know she could see where your eyes went
>"Well, you don't have to answer me if you don't like. I was just curious."
>she stands there a moment longer, letting you admire her
>her tail is wagging fast
>"I think my favorite part about you is your eyes. The way they open so wide when you Iook into mine."
>you look into her eyes
>and they sparkle green
>fuck, that may beat out the legs
"Shelby, you're too kind."
>she smiles and leans forward to kiss your cheek
>"I think that's you! Thanks for finishing the dishes dear. I'll let you finish up."
>she bounces out of the room, all smiles
>you look back to your work
>finishing it doesn't take all that long
>once you've set everything out to dry you wander back to the living room
>Shelby isn't there
>so you decide to follow her to the bedroom
>could use a change of clothes anyhow
>you haven't had a change in a couple days
>considering it, that may be why Shelby was so into your smell
>you crack the door to the bedroom and peer inside
>you see the form of Shelby, leaning over the bed and staring down at something in front of her
>the boxes of clothes are set aside, already empty
>you step inside and Shelby's ears perk
>"Hi Anon. I was putting some of your clothes away and then I looked at your photograph..."
>you stand alongside her to stare down at the picture
>you don't feel like reminiscing anymore
>did enough of that in the car
>you pick it up
"I can tell you about them tomorrow. I need a shower, and a change of clothes."
>Shelby nods
>"Of course, Anon. I put your clothes in the dresser. Bottom drawer."
>you set the picture down on the dresser and collect your single set of ragged pajamas
>and some boxers
>Shelby is still standing by the bed when you go to leave
>you stand by her a moment and consider her
"Shelby."
>she cocks her head
>"Hmm?"
>you lean over and kiss her cheek
"Thanks for putting away my clothes. And for buying me dinner. And the toffee. And everything else."
>Shelby gasps and goes rigid
>her hand goes to her cheek and she trembles
>you may have made a mistake
>"You're welcome."
>she squeaks out the words at first, but then her voice gets husky
>"You should go shower, Anon."
>you take her advice, and make a hasty exit with your clothes in hand
>you make sure to lock the bathroom door behind you
>just a little paranoid
>you manage to calm those fears once you're in the shower and the hot water is running
>it's amazing how good it is here
>the water doesn't turn to ice after a minute of running
>and the shower is big enough for you to clean yourself without having to contort into strange poses just to reach
>nothing like that here
>once you're clean, you let the water run over you again
>like all your muscles are melting
>you'll have to thank her for that as well
>once you're out of the shower, you change into your pajamas
>a plain undershirt and loose-fitting cotton pants
>what a relief
>when you step out of the shower, Shelby is in the hall waiting and fidgeting
"Oh. Shelby, where should I put--"
>she bustles past you and slams the door shut
>"Laundry basket in my closet!"
>you hear her voice through the door and over the sound of the shower coming to life
>you shrug and go to take care of what you can
>the laundry basket is where she said, and you put your clothes in with a small pile of hers
>and then you straighten out the bed
>why not?
>things ought to be orderly
>Shelby keeps things pretty clean so there's not much for you to do
>you instead look around her bedroom, taking in more details now that it isn't the middle of the night
>her walls are mostly unadorned, save a small certificate hanging on one wall, and over the bed a photograph
>you check the photograph first
>it's a family portrait
>three young collies, all in sunshine yellow sundresses
>arranged around a human, who smiles down at the three
>and behind him is an full grown collie woman who puts her hands possessively on the human's shoulders
>you consider the family photo
>certainly looks happier than yours
>your family
>and your photograph
>she never mentioned her parents, but they looked about what you expected
>a human and an anthro
>Shelby inherited her father's eyes
>your train of thought is interrupted
>you cock your head at a strange sound from the hall
>it sounds like Shelby's crying over the sound of the shower
>but not quite the same as last night
>when you step out into the hallway, you hear it clearer
>the high pitched yelps are mixed with growls and muttering
>against better judgement, you lean into the door to listen closer
>"Anon...oh fuck Anon..."
>she isn't crying
>her breath hitches and she growls your name
>holy shit
>you push off the door and stumble back toward her bedroom
>and trip over your panicked feet
>you sprawl over the floor with an 'oof'
>once you get up onto your feet, Shelby's shut the water off
>"Anon? Everything alright?"
>she sounds out of breath as she calls out
>scrambling further away, you try to control your voice in response
"I'm okay! I'm fine. Just fine."
>Shelby opens the door and peers out at you standing back against the bedroom door
>you can see she has just a towel covering her from the chest down
>her fur isn't even wet
>you stare at her, and she stares back
>this goes on for several pregnant seconds
>finally, Shelby breaks the silence
>"I will try to be more quiet."
>she disappears back into the bathroom, and the shower turns on again
>you watch the door for several seconds
>and you picture exactly what she was doing in there
>bare fur
>from top to tail
>and those long, long legs
>an errant thought crosses your mind
>what if you knocked on the door?
>what if...
>what if she gets angry with you?
>what if she assaults you?
>what if she bites?
>you press the heels of your hands against your eyes to force out the lurid images dancing through your mind
>and hopefully settle down the traitorous part of your body that still urges you to make foolish choices
>but your primal brain argues back
>she's going to ask for it eventually
>maybe she'll take it
>if you did it now, she might be gentle with you
>or it might set her off
>set free that angry side
>you don't know
>and you shouldn't want to find out
>find out anyways
>no!
>you rap a fist against your head and grunt in annoyance
>damn your blood!
>it's pumping away from your brain
>if Shelby weren't in there right now, you'd take a cold shower yourself
>you have to settle for slipping back into the bedroom and throwing yourself facedown on the bed
>too many thoughts
>you take a deep breath
>and then another
>and another
>settling down finally
>"Anon."
>you spin about on the bed, looking to the now open door
>Shelby's standing there, dressed in a nightgown
>you're relieved
>and a little disappointed
>"I don't think you should sleep with me tonight, Anon. For your own good."
>you nod and get up off the bed
>Shelby stands aside from the doorway and you have to squeeze past her
>she takes a deep inhale through her nose as you do
>then shuts the door behind you
>couch it is
>you return to the living room to settle down for the night
>just to be sure, you take the spare pillow and use it to cover your ears
>you lay in silence for a while, wrestling with thoughts of Shelby
>Shelby in her nightgown
>Shelby in nothing at all
>her nose pressed against your neck, inhaling your scent
>this isn't going to go away
>but you're not going to take care of it yourself
>not when Shelby would sniff it out
>so you sit and stew
>but eventually fall asleep
>your sleep is deep and dreamless
>and you wake up feeling well rested
>the house is quiet, so you simply lay there in warmth and comfort
>you’ll have to get up and face the day eventually
>but it’s much easier to just ignore it all and relax
>strange feeling
>being able to relax for a little while
>you’ve been so high strung these last few days
>last few years
>last decade and a half
>just shut your mind off and relax
>you’re not sure how long you spend dozing on the couch
>long enough that Shelby has time to wake up and start moving around
>you hear her door open, lazy footsteps coming down the hallway followed by a yawn
>”You awake, Anon?”
>you roll over and look at Shelby
>her long fur is a mess, sticking out at odd angles on her head and shoulders
>you weren’t ready for the sight
>she's cute
>”Sleep well?”
>you sit up on the couch and nod to her
>”Good. I’m sorry about how the night ended, but I didn’t know if I could control myself.”
>she steps over to sit down next to you
>you expect her to reach out for you again, but she folds her hands in her lap
>she’s quiet and serious
>”You know that’s going to happen too. Soon enough. And I want you to be comfortable with it when it does. But I have things I want too. Needs. Just…be careful with your affection, if you aren’t ready for me to take what I need from you.”
>that makes your stomach turn flips
>’take what I need from you’
>you scoot away from her and think of a way to turn away from the subject
>but Shelby continues
>”Look at me, Anon. I know you have those needs too, and I don’t want you taking care of them yourself. Once you’re comfortable with me, I will take care of you. You understand?”
>you manage to look her in the eye and nod
>she frowns
>”Tell me you understand, Anon. We are married and we will have to make the marriage complete someday.”
>you knew that would happen eventually
>hope she’s gentle
“I understand, Shelby. I just need time.”
>Shelby nods slowly
>”Of course Anon. We’ll have another talk soon. Just one last thing.”
>she breaks into a sly grin
>”I think it’s time you answered my question from last night.”
>she finally reaches out to you, hooking an arm around your shoulders to drag you into her side
>”Which part of me is your favorite, Anon? Is it my hips? My breasts? I’m not as big as other girls but I’m soft and warm in all the right places…”
>you’re caught off guard by her sudden change in mood
>from deathly serious to sultry and teasing
>you stammer out a few non-words as your brain struggles to function
>her fur is so soft
>that nightgown doesn’t cover much below her thighs
>”I need an answer before I can let you go, Anon.”
>she squeezes you tighter into her side
>finally you manage to connect two brain cells
“Legs! Your legs. I like your legs, Shelby.”
>Shelby’s eyes widen in surprise
>”Oh!”
>her mouth hangs open for a couple seconds, before she descends into an embarrassed giggle
>”Wow! I wasn’t expecting you to say that! You really like my legs huh? You must have really enjoyed those leggings I wore too. And gosh, my nightgown shows them off plenty.”
>she runs a hand down her thigh
>”I guess I can see why you’d like them. They’re long, aren’t they?”
>you give a strained nod
>all this teasing has got your blood pumping
>thankfully you’re already seated to hide your growing erection
“They are. And I really do like them. But it’s–I’m not–”
>you flounder for a few seconds
>Shelby shushes you with a finger to your lips
>”It’s okay Anon, I’ll stop teasing. Oh but you look so cute with that blush, and the way you try to hide your arousal from me. Are you sure you’re not ready for me to take care of you?”
>she has lied about not teasing you
“I’m sure.”
>saying that took some effort
>but you only have to remind yourself who it is that’s teasing you
>the collie you’ve been forcibly wed to
>who growled your name last night
>who’s an inspector for the State
>you’re just not ready for all that yet
>Shelby pouts and relaxes back into the couch
>”If you say so, Anon. You’re still safe with me, you know. Even if I like to tease.”
>despite your fear of her, you still don’t like to see her sad
“Uh, maybe I could make us breakfast this morning?”
>her pout drops and she breaks into a grin
>”Now that sounds lovely! I think that cookbook has recipes for eggs.”
>eggs sound like an excellent idea
>after the lackluster meal last night, you’re starving
>you spring off the couch, grabbing up the cookbook once you’ve crossed to the kitchen
>scrambled eggs look easy enough
>Shelby follows to watch over your shoulder as you work
>eggs, salt, pepper, some onion
>beat them together and set them to cook on the skillet
>thankfully with two sets of eyes on them, you manage to keep the eggs from burning
>after a few minutes of stirring and cooking you have two plates of scrambled eggs
>you’ve made presentable food
>a miracle
>”Looks great dear! You look really cute when you’re concentrating on your work.”
“Thank you. Could you get us a couple slices of bread to go with the eggs?”
>Shelby goes to work on her task, cutting into the fresh bought bread while you move the food over to the table
>the end results are a marked improvement over last night
>Shelby tears into the food, forgoing utensils to scoop it all onto her slice of bread
>then she devours it in three big bites
>bits of egg and crumbs go scattering over her
>you must have been staring because she covers her mouth sheepishly when she looks up at you
>”Sorry. Hungry. It was really good Anon!”
>your breakfast goes down cleaner, but with no less gusto
>simple but filling
>feels good after skipping most of a meal last night
>you start collecting dishes to start cleaning
>Shelby offers you hers when you reach out for it
>”Thanks Anon. Once the dishes are done we have the whole day to ourselves! I can put on some music and we can relax. Could find my old detective novels out of my closet if you wanted to read. Whatever you like!”
>you consider the options as you deposit the dishes in the sink and start washing
“Detective novels?”
>she nods her head enthusiastically
>”Mhm! A couple of ones from Before, and some more recent stuff too. My dad used to read them to me and my sisters when we were pups.”
>her ever-present smile twists into a frown
>she looks away from you
>for several seconds she looks down at the table
>you decide to break the silence
“From Before? Really?”
>Shelby shakes her head and turns back to you
>”Well, they’re not that old. Just copies of stories from Before that I got from the Bureau of History Correction. Would you like to see them?”
>why not?
>it’s been a while since you had something new to read
>and you’ve never read something from Before
>must have cost a bundle
“I’d like to give them a read sometime. Thank you Shelby.”
>”Of course! What’s mine is yours, Anon. Let me go get them!”
>she leaves the table and trots down the hall to her room
>you start putting away dishes while she’s gone
>the eggs clean easier than the fish from last night
>another miracle
>”Okay!”
>Shelby reappears, carrying a small stack of books
>”I’ve got…’Murder on the Orient Express’, and ‘Hound of the Baskervilles’. Those are the Before ones.”
>she sets the top two aside on the kitchen table
>”And the rest of these are the newer ones. I really loved ‘The Bidding’ if you wanted to start with these.”
>the other half-dozen books she drops with slightly less care
>you notice she’s still holding something from the bottom of the pile
>”And I brought that photo of yours, if you felt like talking about it.”
>she sets that down last, in between the two book piles
>another thing you would put off if you could
>you sigh and join her at the table, ignoring the photograph to pick up one of the old books
“So the stories from Before, what are they like?”
>Shelby hums thoughtfully
>”They’re different. The bureau had to modify them to fit with State content requirements, but it’s still interesting to see how different some things were.”
>you set aside the last fork and go to join her at the table
>she holds up one of the books to you
>'Murder on the Orient Express'
>a red cover with black lettering on the front with the title
>"Best way to find out is to read it."
>you take it from her paw and look it over
>no sign of the author's name anywhere on it
>Shelby stacks up the rest while you open to the first page
>on the first page, in faded blocky letters, is a State warning
>'ATTENTION: THIS WORK HAS BEEN MODIFIED BY THE BUREAU OF HISTORY CORRECTION. IT CONTAINS DEPICTIONS OF VIOLENCE, CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY, AND LIFE IN PRE-STATE SOCIETY. READ WITH CAUTION.'
"Am I allowed to read this? The warning on the front seems pretty official."
>Shelby laughs
>"If anyone asks, I'll say it was for my work. Why don't you take it to the couch?"
>she shows you back toward the living room
>and follows behind you as you take a spot on the couch
>when you look up at her, you see the photograph in her paws
>she's not going to let it go is she?
"You want to talk about the home still?"
>she nods
>"If you're comfortable. I know I said you could read, but I want to get to know you a little more. Please?"
>you thought 'puppy-dog eyes' was just an expression
>but Shelby's are open wide, begging wordlessly
>you sigh
"If it will make you happy."
>her tail wags cheerfully as she drops down beside you
>"Thank you Anon! I promise it will only be a little bit! You're too kind to me. So!"
>she sets the photo in front of you in your lap
>"Were any of these boys your friends?
"I knew some of them better than others.”
>you pick out a face in the group, a kid that looks like he’s close to the same age as you are in the photo and point him out to Shelby
“That’s Marc. He chose the music class too. They gave him the accordion.”
>you find another one you recognize, an older kid, bulky and tough looking
>he scowls at the camera
“Kovacs. He’d bully the smaller kids, but he also taught some of us how to play cards. Two-card, five-card, aces and eights. Stuff like that.”
>Shelby cocks her head
>”He bullied you too?”
>you shrug
"Sure. I wasn't exactly big and tough back then. Or now. But he wasn't so bad. The only time he got in a real fight, Mrs. Kerr whipped his knuckles bloody."
>Shelby huffs angrily
>"She shouldn't have done that. He's just a boy."
>oh, well if she didn't like hearing that story she wouldn't want to hear about--
>”Who’s this? What happened to him?”
>she interrupts your train of thought, pointing to the older boy with the black eye
"Oh. That's Leigh. Loony Leigh, we called him."
>"Loony Leigh?"
>with a sigh, you gently prize the photo from Shelby's paw
"Loony Leigh. He...really didn't like the state. And he claimed a lot of different things. Like how they were gonna start assigning two wives. And lower the marriage age to fifteen. Stuff like that."
>"He must have been afraid. I wish someone was there to have taken care of him. Shown him all the good the state can do."
>you're not sure how much good the state has done for you
>but you feel no need to voice that opinion
>you put the photo on the arm rest, away from Shelby
"I think that's all I can say about Leigh. I'd rather not talk about the home any more, if that's okay."
>giving you another one-armed hug, Shelby cuddles you
>"Of course Anon! Only as much as you want to talk about."
>you breath an internal sigh of relief
>Leigh's full story would have set her off
>"Why don't you read a little? I can sit here with you and we can both relax."
>you open the book to start reading
>a lot of it flies over your head
>place names you don't recognize
>and strangest of all there are still human women
>as you continue reading about the detective, you find yourself settling into Shelby's embrace
>soft fur tickling your skin
>the rise and fall of her chest as she breaths
>and she's warm
>with so little fabric between you two, you can feel her body warmth
>Shelby rests her head atop yours
>it's so comfortable you could fall back asleep
>and after a short while, you realize that's exactly what Shelby's done
>BRRRING
>BRRRING
>BRRRING
>you snap awake
>must have fallen asleep
>you try to get up to look for the source of that ringing
>sounds like a telephone somewhere in the kitchen
>but you find yourself restrained by a furry arm
>oh right
>Shelby’s still holding onto you
>you have to put conscious thought into suppressing a sudden jolt of fear at the realization
>you’re fine
>you fell asleep in her arms and she didn’t do a thing to you
>the phone rings again and Shelby stirs
>”Mm. Not yet.”
>she hugs you tighter against your side, grumbling softly
>you’re starting to feel a little constricted now
>that phone is still ringing
>Shelby finally shows more life, slowly sitting up straight
>and dragging you up with her
>”What time’s’it?”
>you don’t know
>still light out
“I think your phone is ringing, Shelby.”
>she takes a deep breath and reluctantly releases you from her embrace
>”Better go check that then…”
>grumbling all the way, Shelby pushes off the couch and lumbers across the room and into the kitchen
>the ringing stops
>”Hello? Yes this is Inspector Winn.”
>she sounds annoyed
>”What? When? Well who was supposed to be looking into it?”
>Shelby growls in frustration
>while she’s on the phone, you go to pick up the novel you had been reading off the floor
>you’ve lost your place
>”I took the entire week off. I’m with my–I’m with my husband! Yes! Has Inspector Shay fallen off the face of the Earth? Why can’t she deal with this?”
>she gives a defeated sigh
>”Yes, yes I understand. The needs of the state are above my own, of course. I’ll report first thing tomorrow. Yes ma’am.”
>you hear something slam and then more muttering from Shelby
>”Damn it all. Damn it, damn it, damn it.”
>she returns to the living room looking absolutely livid
>you blanch at the sight of her
>fur raised in anger, teeth bared, and a slight growl on every exhale
>then she locks eyes with you
>Shelby closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and forces herself to smile
>”Sorry about that. I’m afraid I’ve been called in to work tomorrow, so we can’t spend the whole week together like I planned.”
>the false smile isn’t convincing
>her ears and tail are still drooping in dejection
>Shelby flops back onto the couch and groans
>”Can’t have one lousy week, can I?”
>her paws go over her eyes as she rubs at her face
>”Now this headache is gonna bother me for all the time we have left.”
>you watch as she works at massaging away the frustration from the sudden change in her plans
>you want her to feel better
>she’s been nice to you so far
>and she held you while you two slept
>you turn your body and put your arms around Shelby
>and tuck your head into the crook of her shoulder
>you feel her stiffen at your touch
>then she wraps an arm around you
>”Didn’t I say to be careful with your affection, Anon?”
>she did
>maybe this was a bad idea
“Sorry, I just wanted to make you feel a little better.”
>you start to pull away, but Shelby takes one of your hands and forces it around her again, enforcing your hug
>”It’s okay. Just keep holding onto me, you’re doing a wonderful job at making me feel better.”
>she pokes her nose against your head and sniffs at your hair some
>”Good pup…”
>that’s new
>but it makes her happy
>Shelby huffs your hair a little longer, before finally going near limp
>she falls back into the couch and you go with her as you maintain the hug
>”You don’t mind me calling you that, right? Pup? You’re just so cute, so small and soft it just seems natural.”
>with a giggle, she starts to run a paw through your hair
>she’s petting you again
>”Aww, I can feel you getting warmer. You do like it, don’t you? It’s alright, just hold onto me for a little while, pup. It’ll make going back to work tomorrow so much easier knowing that you’ll be waiting for me when I get home.”
>you will be, won’t you?
>every day from now on, waiting on her, sitting with her, holding onto her like this
>for the rest of your life
>it’s hard to comprehend
>much easier to focus on getting through one minute to the next
>so that’s what you do
“I just want to make it work.”
>Shelby just hums and strokes your hair
>you hold each other, your face pressed against her fur
>she smells nice
>the slight sweetness of her soap over a more natural, earthy scent
>another reason to like her, in spite of your fear
>are you still afraid of her?
>when she holds you close like this?
>how could she be the feral, cruel thing you imagined while awaiting your assignment?
>why would she need you to be assigned to her?
>you could ask
>but what if you don’t like the answer?
>but you’re safe with Shelby
>she said so herself
“Shelby.”
>you speak softly, barely more than a whisper
>she stops humming
>breaking the comfortable quiet almost guilts you into dropping the matter
>make it work
>”Can I ask you something?”
>”Of course. Anything at all.”
>so she’s told you
>you bite down on the apprehension and force yourself to speak
“Why did you choose me? Why get an assigned husband?”
>her paw stops stroking your hair
>she rests the arm around you again, now focusing on your question
>for several seconds she’s still and silent
>you’re about to tell her to forget the question when Shelby answers
>”I was lonely, Anon. I was lonely, and with my work, I couldn’t…”
>Shelby trails off into a deep sigh
>”You heard that call. You remember what Allie said, that I’m always working. The State requires everyone to give fully for the common good. And with what I do, as an Inspector, I see…”
>once again she’s unable to finish the thought
>she’s wilting in your arms now, eyes dropping to the floor
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked. Forget it.”
>Shelby shushes you and starts petting you again
>”It’s okay Anon. I just wasn’t ready for that question. Give me a little time to think of how to say it.”
>that is fair enough
>she’s never forced you into anything, how could you do the same to her
>answers will have to wait a little while
>you nestle back into her side and hug around her waist
>Shelby continues to hold and pet you, but idly as she stares looks away from you in thought
>a part of you feels sick at ruining the tenderness of the moment
>but if you didn't ask now, it would only come later
>your thoughts have time to run
>surely it couldn't just be her work that made her choose someone like you
>even if she needed an assigned husband, you were far from a prime candidate
>ironic, considering you were now willingly clinging to your wife as though it were your choice
>Shelby just has that effect, it seems
>pure sweetness
>and she was afraid you'd hate her for it
>things are more complicated than they seem
>time passes at a snail’s pace
>all this thinking hasn’t given you a single satisfactory answer
>but Shelby speaks up sooner than you expected
>”Alright. I think I’m ready.”
>you pick your head up off her shoulder and look up into her eyes
>”I work for the State. You know that. I’m an inspector for the Office of Human affairs. My work has me dealing with humans. The ones who are afraid of anthros, and the ones who hate them. And…”
>Shelby frowns
>”And I deal with abused humans. Ones who are bitten, who are clawed, who are locked up in bedrooms and closets.”
>she almost seems in physical pain as she talks about it
>”It hurts to see what happens to some men. Men like you, who are so terrified of anthros that they risk state punishment rather than face assignment. Men like Leigh, who are beaten by those who are supposed to look after him.”
>it’s not a shock that she could guess what happened to him
>she must be good at her work
>”I guess I just–I wanted to do better. For you. Or whoever was assigned to me. Humans need anthros, Anon. We need humans. So I asked to be assigned a husband so maybe he wouldn’t have to be afraid of anthros. Wouldn’t have to hate them. And there’s more to it, but I’m not ready to talk about it just yet. I’m sorry.”
>by the time she’s done, Shelby looks like a wreck
>tears leak down her cheeks and her head hangs low
>did she really do it for you?
>she got an assigned husband just to try and make his life better?
>the gifts
>the food
>the worry and protection
>all for your sake
>you’re not sure what to think of it
>there’s more reasoning to it than that
>she’s said as much
>but she also said she wants to make you happy, keep you safe
“Thank you Shelby. For answering me. You’ve been so kind to me, I didn’t believe it. I still don’t know if I believe it.”
>you consider what to say next
>how you could explain years of anxiety and paranoia still bearing down on you
“I’m still afraid. Of you. About you. All of this. It seems too good to be true, and I’m just waiting for things to turn. I know you said I’m safe, but part of me is still terrified. I’ll do something wrong or say something that upsets you, then it’s teeth and claws. Teeth and claws.”
>you shudder at the memory
>of shouting voices and snapping fangs
>of a canine not so different from Shelby
>but you fight the rising urge to try get away from her
>Shelby is different
>”Oh Anon. Oh my sweet pup, it’s okay. You could never say anything that would make me hurt you. You’ve been so brave, letting me hold you and doing your best for me.”
>Shelby leans in close
>and then she presses her lips against yours in a kiss
>you’re stunned
>she pulls back, looking somewhere between abashed and loving
>”I’m glad you were honest, Anon. You make me so happy just trying to make things work. I just can’t help myself…”
>she kisses you again
>”You’re safe with me. I’ll always take care of you.”
>and again
>”You’re my pup, my husband.”
>one more time
>”My love.”
>your heart hammers in your chest
>she doesn’t stop kissing you
>your lips
>your cheeks
>all over your face
>you can only just focus enough to hold onto her
>Shelby reaches her other paw to plant on your shoulder
>she pushes you back, forcing you down onto your back
>and she follows you down, folding over on top of you
>now you’re pinned
>her kisses get more forceful, more fervent
>whap whap whap!
>her now freed tail wags against the back of the couch in her eagerness
>one paw traces down your side, before sneaking under your undershirt to start tracing over bare skin
>her warm paw pads and soft fur tickle along your belly as she works her way up
>and works your shirt upward
>this is going too fast
>Shelby loves you?
>is it too soon for that?
>you move your hands to her shoulders
>you try to push her away
“Shelby, wai–mh!”
>she interrupts you with another kiss
>her other paw squeezes on your shoulder and she groans
>”Anon.”
>her voice is full of need
>she’s desperate
>”I know, I know you’re not ready.”
>she stares down at you, green eyes deep and dark
>”You…you’re safe. Just one thing. For me.”
>she keeps unbreaking eye contact as she withdraws her paw from under your shirt
>then it takes your hand from her shoulder, and draws it down until it’s holding down on her thigh
>”Feel those legs you love so much~”
“Sha…Shel…”
>fuck
>you can’t even think
>her fur is soft and silky
>and beneath it you feel toned muscle
>your other hand drifts down to her other thigh
>and they explore, up, down, over her thighs
>Shelby pants
>you can’t help yourself

anthro taught history/evolution/biology of human males
>ancient humans found ancient wolves to get their protection
>the wolves kept them safe and warm which led to human becoming the soft clawless and tiny fanged cuties they are now
>no need of fur when an anthro can keep them warm with her own fur
>no need of claws or big fangs when an anthro can hunt for him
>hands evolving to better pet and stroke fur
>their hearing, sense of smell, night vision, and such became weak due to having ancient anthros taking care of them
>the reason human boys get boners when pinned and/or bullied by anthro females is a defesne mechanism ancient humans had when attacked by ancient anthro pred species
>offering themselves up as a mate instead of food
>ensuring safety and food for the human
>they evolved such nice lips and soft tongues from relying on the milk of anthros
>since why else would their moths be so perfect for sucking anthro tits
>can barely swim, but still wish to get into ricers/lakes/oceans/etc due to letting aquatic species keep them safe in the water
>and such other explanations

>humans main two advantages over anthros are endurance and intelligence
>humans are weak, soft creatures with little in the way of natural defenses and so naturally humans must think outside the box for dealing with threats
>anthros were already strong and capable, and simply never needed to innovate.
>while anthros still used their claws and teeth for fighting, humans invented spears and bows to stand a better chance
>while anthros still used their fur and huddled together for warmth, humans invented clothing, fire, and shelter to make up for their shortcomings.
>some anthro tribes realised this and reasoned that maybe these short furless weaklings with boundless ingenuity made better friends than food.
>after some "persuasion" various human tribes were absorbed into anthro tribes and were used now as mates
>humans without needing to worry about survival put their skills to work on other things
>developing agriculture, inventing medicine, building better structures, etc.

>anthros without humans could only do simpler and thicker war paint designs
>while the anthros with humans had much more intricate and complex designs since human hands could do smaller and more controlled designs

>Have tribal anthro gf
>An attack against a neighboring tribe is planned for tomorrow
>Spend the night devouring a mighty feast as ceremonial war chants and dances are played out around a massive bonfire
>When the night is finished and you're both pretty drunk you retire to your hut and make sweet sweet love
>In the morning the mood is grim as you and your fellow husbands begin the process of applying warpaint to your wives
>A red swirl across her cheek, thin wavy lines running down her arms, claws painted a solid red, thick red line across her forehead and down to her nose that you boop
>The brief toothy smile it ellicits manages to make the morning not seem so grim for a few short seconds
>Back to painting
>Her family symbol, a hare in the jaws of a wolf, is skillfully painted onto each shoulder much to her satisfaction
>Triangles symbolizing teeth on her palms for strength
>Wide swirls symbolizing the wind on her thighs for speed
>A thick red line below each eye for perception
>Finally, you stick your hand into the paint and place a handprint onto her belly while she does the same, the dual handprints symbolizing fertility
>She says you'll have to apply the paint for her first pup after she gets back
>You hope you'll have to as well
>You hand her her spear, painstakingly crafted by you after many moons so that it would be as strong and as sharp as possible, and slowly watch her leave with the other warriors into the sunset
>A sinking feeling enters your chest you can't seem to will away
>You'll be back with her again
>Maybe not tomorrow
>Or in this life
>But you'll be back with her again
>You know it

Imagine for a second, that you owned a Foxy plush as a child. You loved Foxy the Pirate more than any of the other animatronics, so much that you'd beg your mom for a photo with the rough swashbuckling vulpine every visit you made. There was nothing more you looked forward to for five consecutive personal birthday parties and about a dozen more between your friends, along with a handful of less scheduled visits at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, than to break a leg towards Pirate Cove after Freddy and the gang finished their official entertainment business for the hour. So many hours spent in unquestionable, childlike wonder as you took Foxy by the hook and leapt aboard the modestly-scaled pirate frigate within the cove, for tons of nautical adventures and pizza and cake-laden treasure to be found.
You would never forget the moment Foxy offered to let you sit up on his shoulders, against the considerations of the faculty. "That fox was always a little twitchy, and more than happy to give the workers a scare." you recalled one parent saying. But without those derring qualities and penchant for playing around the rules, Foxy simply wouldn't be himself.
That was fifteen years ago.
These memories had resisted the blur of your youth last of all, as you lay awake in your bed, three hours and some change shy of your Friday work alarm. Something possessed you to take the initiative and spend a vacation day lounging and trying to learn a little more about what become of the brand which played such a foundational role in your childhood. Until something pulled your eyes off the phone's light. A scraping sound, coming from somewhere in the corner of your room. Where your closet was, where your childhood memories had found themselves at rest. It was an unusually spacious closet, large enough to fit three oil drums side by side, and afforded you ample walk-in to take stock over the past during sentimental hours.
She was there again, waiting for her buccaneer.

>"Regan and Bush '84"
>You snicker as you stick the sign into the finely trimmed grass at your sneakers.
>"Hurry up, humie!" The voice of your eagle compatriot comes from behind.
>Her running truck sputters and rumbles behind you, ready to peel out of the culdesac.
>Sticking the lawns of the richest, notoriously blue, neighborhood in your county was the best use of extra resources the two of you could think of.
>"Hey! Get off of my lawn!"
>A shrill human woman in a pink bathrobe marches out of the double doors of the two-story plantation-style house before you.
>She waddles off of the white steps to her lavishly furnished wraparound porch, newspaper in hand.
"Shit!"
>You stumble away from her, and toward the old pick up waiting for you fifty feet away.
>"Get out of here before I call the police, you redneck!"
>You get up to running speed, leaping over a planter of rose bushes blocking your escape.
>You continue running
>The white, feathered head of a bald eagle sticks out of the window of the nearly brand new, blue '83 Ford Ranger pickup.
>"Get in here!" She beckons you with her taloned hand, hysterical laughter coming from her open yellow beak.
>You put both hands on the rim of the tailgate and vault inside with the momentum of your escape.
>"What are you doing?" the eagle protests.
>Your sneakers thump against the metal bed of the pickup as you run up to the rear of the cabin.
>You knock on the window separating you from the eagle.
"Go, go!"
>The wheels beneath you screech as she floors it.
>"Suck it, commie!" The eagle squawks at the fuming human woman.
>You slip from your feet and plop down onto the bed of the truck, your back against the rear of the cabin.
>Your hands grip the sides for dear life as she accelerates to no less than 40 miles per hour.
>"That was awesome!"
>You barely hear her over the rushing air about you.
>"Now get in here," the eagle commands.
>Safely off of your target's street, she slows down.
>She reaches over her shoulder to further push the small window into the cabin open.
"I'm not going to fit-"
>"You'll fit!" The yellow eyes of the bald eagle narrow.
>You grumble, and stand from the bed of her truck.
>Despite needing some extra force to get your waist through the window, you eventually plop down onto the plush backseat.
>You breathe deep, and collapse against the cushion at your back.
>"Think that was a good outreach strategy, Provi?"
>The eagle snickers. "Ah, they'd never vote our way anyways. Communist scum like them are the reason why the "Marxist Club" is even allowed on our campus." She keeps her eyes on the road ahead, her talons gripping tighter to the wheel.
"I guess you're right." You blink. "Most fun use of campaign resources ever."
>"Right? I knew I'd get you to have some fun." Provi has an American flag bandanna wrapped around her white-feathered head. The beginning of her brown feathers at the base her neck stick from her black tank-top. "So, you gonna stay back there?" her voice is low.
>She turns out of the neighborhood, and onto the main highway. The green and brown shrubbery typical of Oregon's chapparal covers the land along the sides of the freeway
"You want me up there?" you ask, raising an eyebrow.
>"Can you blame a girl for wanting some eye candy?"
"Are you hitting on the Vice President? How irresponsible, Secretary." You smile.
>You climb into the front seat.
>She sits right beside you on the bench. The multiple lanes of the highway stretch on.
>The sun was setting over a mountain range in the distance.
>"Time to go home, huh?" There's a longing in Provi's voice. Her talons rest on the cushion beside you, inching toward your thigh.
"Tomorrow, we're going to win."
>Her claws move to your upper thigh. "I know." Her talons poke you as she squeezes you.
>Your hesitate at her grasp.
>Her beak remains shut, eyes fixed on the road ahead.
>The bald eagle takes her other claws off the wheel to turn on the radio, before returning them to the wheel.
>Some Duran Duran song comes on, and Provi doesn't smile like she usually would.
>The bird doesn't bob her head along with the bassline like she always does.
>"I don't want this to end," she mutters, her muscles tensing beneath her fluffy coat of feathers. "I don't want 'us' to end."
>She punctuates her point by pulling you against her fluffy side. Her blue jeans are a shade lighter than yours.
>"This isn't just about the election anymore."
>You put your hand over her claws, gripping to the coarse yellow scales.
"No, it isn't." You speak gently. "Provi, I've enjoyed campaigning with you more than with anything else in college so far."
>"And I've learned so much from you." The bald eagle builds on your compliments. "I thought you were a bit of a square at first, but you really care." There's the slightest mischievous edge to her sincerity.
"I'm not a squa-" your voice catches as she turns to stick her beak between your lips.
>She pries your mouth open with the hard implement, and buries her slimy tongue inside.
>The taste of the long, tube-like invader is slightly salty.
>Provi pulls away as quickly as she engaged to focus on the road once more, leaving your lips slick with her avian saliva.
>"You're not a square, humie?" she spreads her legs, the edges of her beak perking upward in a wicked smile. She gestures down to the floor with her beak. "Prove it."
>Your mouth hangs open.
>Was she seriously suggesting this?

>be KGB agent
>grow disillusioned with communism and defect to the west
>CIA sets you up with a new identity in exchange for whatever intelligence you have
>move to America and score yourself a well paying job. along with a nice house in the country.
>nothing much happens for the next few years
>then one day you get a knock on the door
>"that's strange. who could it be at this hour"
>open the door. only to find the KGB bear wife you left behind standing there.

>holy shit your job sucks
>the life of a wagie is not a pleasant one
>even worse when you're stuck doing overnights
>nobody likes a gloomy nightstalker who wakes up past noon every day
>you're in the middle of hauling a box of cleaning supplies up into storage when your phone starts buzzing
>who the hell is calling you this late?
>you check your phone
>it's Brittany
>you answer instantly, not wanting to miss your friends call
>you hear Brittany's sing-song voice teasing you through the speaker
>"Anon~ Did you forget what tonight was?"
>oh no
>you did forget what tonight was
>the full moon
"The full moon!"
>"That's right! You better get over here soon, or else you might be in trouble."
>you drop what you're doing and make a break for the store's front door
>hopefully they're not locked yet
>you zoom past your manager, who questions what the fuck you're doing
"Sorrygottagojustrememberedihavecovid!"
>and you're gone before he can manage a response, out into the night air
>you hear Brittany snickering through the phone still clutched in your hand
>you slam bodily into the side of your car, working the door-handle frantically for several seconds
>the keys
>idiot
>you unlock the car and climb in, tossing your phone on the seat beside you as you punch it
>"Ooh, I don't know if you'll make it, Anon. I think I'm--Oh!"
>her bubbly voice lowers suddenly in pitch
>you hear movement, the tearing of fabric
>"Where aaaare you Anon?"
>there's a snarl at the edge of Brittany's voice now, as it gets more husky and bestial
>you tear down the streets, weaving through the late-night traffic as fast as your shitty four-banger can go
>only five minutes to Brittany's place
"Almost there! Almost there Brit!"
>"Taking too long. I NEED you Anon! You can't hide from me."
>you are not hiding
>you swing onto her street, blazing past high-class houses toward the biggest one at the very end
>so close!
>WOOPWOOP
>red and blues light up behind you
>this has got to be a joke
"Fuck!"
>you slam on the breaks, veering over to the side of the road
>there's just snarling on the other line
>that is not a good sign
>you hang up as the officer approaches your car
>you give him all the excuses you can manage to come up with along with your license and insurance
>he returns a couple minutes later with a ticket
>"You're lucky I'm not arresting you. Drive home safe."
>you thank him profusely and roll down the street
>praying for your poor bones which will surely be ground to dust
>you make it to Brittany's property, the long driveway hidden behind high hedges
>there's not a light on inside or outside, making it near impossible to see anything
>you're halfway out the door when something snatches your arm to drag you the rest of the way out
>you're held in the air by your arm, face to face with a snarling monster right out of Victorian folklore
>"Anoooon! Laaaaate!"
>her hot breath washes over your face, giving you a view of her tooth-filled maw as she admonishes you
>you open your mouth to make excuses, but Brittany simply uses the opportunity to stuff it with her tongue
>the organ fills your mouth, choking you as she forcefully makes out with you
>she pulls out, giving you a chance to breath
>but she's not done, her tongue travels from your mouth over your face and hair
>over and over the heavy organ slides over you until your entire upper body is covered in werewolf saliva
>once she's satisfied, Brittany lowers you to the ground and pushes you against your car
>with her other hand, she traces a razor sharp claw over your cheek
>"Myyy Anoooon."
>in a flash, all your clothes are gone
>all shredded to bits and left dangling from your now nude frame
>that claw now runs up the length of your already erect member
>fear is a potent aphrodisiac
>it gets even harder
>Brittany wastes no time, straddling you with her legs while one powerful arm adjusts your position against the car to line up with her dripping cunt
>she has you mounted against the car
>Brittany presses herself against you, enveloping you
>you thrust your hips forward, forcing your cock into her as she takes you to the hilt
>you wrap your arms around her, your face pressed against the soft fur of her chest
>her breasts completely engulf your head
>this is heaven
>Brittany howls out to the moon, relishing her willing conquest
>and then she starts to thrust, using the car for leverage to roll her hips back and then slam down on you again
>your legs and thighs are already soaked with her juices
>your cock throbs inside her, her muscular insides squeezing you tight despite her size
>"Miiiine!"
>she roars the word
>thrusting faster and faster
>her free paw clutches and tears at the roof of your car, rending long lines in the bodywork

"So close! Come on, fuh--fuck me Brittany!"
>you encourage her on, faster and harder
>"Yeees! Cuuum! Miiiine!"

>you're instead stretched out on a soft mattress, covered in a heavy comforter
>"Well look who's finally up!"
>you flick your eyes up to see Brittany stepping out of a doorway
>her slim human figure is wrapped in a towel, and steam billows out from the doorway behind her
>"You really gave me a workout last night, Anon! I hope you enjoyed yourself."
>she smiles brightly
>"I left some water on the nightstand, I think you could use it. Breakfast is in fifteen, and be sure to shower!"
>she leaves you to recover as best as you can, dragging your sore body to the edge of the bed to grab the life-restoring drink

> "Wait a minute, hold on. Does anyone here actually know what species Anon is?"
> "I thought he was a canine...?"
> "What? No way, the helmet shape is all wrong. Besides, where's his tail?"
> "Maybe he just tucked it in?"
> "Maybe for an hour or so, but all day? That would drive me nuts."
> "A rabbit maybe?"
> "No way. I snuck a peek at his logistics registry, he's definately an omnivore."
> "Well shit, I'm stumped then."
> "Maybe he's some kind of reptile? The suit could be keeping him warm."
> "Maybe... but do you know any reptile species without long tails?"
> "No..."
> "Yeah, I'm stumped too..."
> "..."
> "Maybe... he could be a human?"
> "Shut up Sasha, that's ridiculous."
> "I'm telling you guys, Anon is a human!"
> "Yeah, wouldn't that be great? It'd be nice to have a little bunk warmer around here."
> "I'm serious! Why won't you believe me?"
> "Because it's impossible! Where would we have even picked up a human anyway? You know they hardly leave their own systems."
> "Speaking of, when did we take on Anon anyway?"
> "You know, I'm not sure?"
> "Hasn't he always been here?"
> "Well... I know he wasn't with us when we hit that human freighter a couple months ago."
> "Holy shit, you guys hit a human ship?"
> "Yeah, kinda. We were taking a shortcut through Sirius on our way to a bigger job. Jumped in right on top of a cargo hauler. Didn't want to pass up something like that, so we pounced on them."
> "You didn't miss much. System patrol was hot on our tail, so we couldn't stay. Crew boarded up in their quarters and we didn't have time to get them out."
> "Real shame. So we just grabbed a bunch of their cargo crates and booked it."
> "Really? Damn..."
> "I know right? So close. Totally wasn't worth it. For some reason, we got a kidnapping charge pinged on our ID. That was a total bitch to scrub clean."
> "Weird..."
> "Wait, that can't be right... Didn't we dock at Arcturus after that job?"
> "Yeah, so?"
> "I remember Anon asking me a whole bunch of questions before we docked there, he said it was his first time. He must have been with us then."
> "No way, I swear he wasn't with us before that."
> "Well, one of you must be misremembering. It's not like he climbed in through the airlock or something."
> "Woo! First round in on me!"
> "Somebody is in a good mood."
> "Hell yes! It's finally time for some shore-leave!"
> "Does it really count as shore leave if we're still in space?"
> "Don't ruin this for me. I'm just happy to get out of that tin can for a while, even if this is just a bigger can."
> "All I know is these credits are burning a hole in my pocket, and I'm ready to party!"
> "Woah, check it out! That wolf over by the bar!"
> "Yeah? What about her- oh damn!"
> "Holy shit, that's a human!"
> "Aw! Look at his little collar!"
> "I just want to scoop him up and run off with him..."
> "I think that's why she's got the leash."
> "I want one too..."
> "Pipe down! She's looking right at us and- woah..."
> "Damn, she's really going at it."
> "That bitch. Who does she think she is? First she flaunts him all over the place, then shoves her tongue down his throat..."
> "She could at least let the little guy breathe."
> "Dammit, it's not fair! How come that skank gets her own personal human, and we don't even have one to share?"
> "I haven't gotten laid in months..."
> "Well, if you have a certain itch that needs scratching..."
> "I told you before, I'm not interested-"
> "No no no, listen. A friend of mine passed through this station a couple rotations ago. She told me about this little place, totally off the books."
> "Yeah?"
> "Apparently somebody converted a derelict part of the engineering deck into a place where you can spend the entire night with a real human."
> "Are you serious? A human brothel!"
> "Shhh! Pipe down!"
> "Oh, I am so in. Are you sure you can find the place?"
> "Definately. I had her ping me directions as soon as the captain said we were docking here. So, you all coming?"
> "Hell yes! I can't wait. What about you?"
> "I don't know... it's probably expensive..."
> "You've never had a human before have you? Trust me, it will be worth every credit. They make these cute little noises..."
> "Okay, okay! Fine, I'll come..."
> "Alright! Now it's a party! This is going to be so great!"
> "Do you think they'll let us all share a room?"
> "Probably. What about you Anon? Want to tag along? Maybe we can get a cute human to peel that hardsuit off you."
> "N-No thanks, I'm good."
> "Alright, 'suit' yourself! Ha! See you back on the ship."

>Detention is just hours long rape in a padded room in where the moans and screams can only be heard next to the door.
>The more 'troublesome' students might often find a train ran on them, leaving them more of a drained husk then anything else.
>Graduation might not save you considering that once you leave the school, you are considered marriageable, in which case a teacher can apply to be your wife.

>that justification has led to you making breakfast in your underwear while Franky sleeps in
>you can hear her snoring from her bedroom
>but the sound fades as the smell of eggs and bacon wafts through the house
>"G'morning sweet cheeks."
>you roll your eyes as Franky greets you
>the pet names had started not long after the uniform policy
"Morning Franky. Breakfast's almost done. Do I really have to cook it in my skivs every time? The bacon grease keeps stinging me."
>Franky laughs and swats you on the ass
>"I offered you a maid outfit, but you said that was 'degrading'. Suck it up, buttercup."
>you grumble and serve up breakfast for the two of you
>if nothing else, this living arrangement had done wonders for your cooking skill
>though doing all the housework has harmed your job search somewhat
>"Honeh-flee Nawn, bunno why yoo boffer."
>Franky speaks with her mouth full, spray crumbs over the table
>you sigh and continue flipping through the newspaper
>"You should just do this stuff for me full time. I don't mind the eye candy."
>your dignity won't allow this to become a permanent deal
>Frankie eats quickly, leaving the dishes for you to clean up while she runs off down the hall
>"Should be home early from work today. I'm thinking venison for dinner, alright sweetness?"
>she shoots a cheeky grin at you before disappearing into the bathroom
>you hear the shower running while you flip through the job postings
>nothing for a talentless, skill-less nobody like you
>should have gone to trade school
>you set the paper down and get to clearing the table
>Frankie steps out of the bathroom, dressed for her work
>"You know Anon, I've been thinking."
>you look at her while you work, and she openly ogles you with a smug grin
>"You'd say I'm taking care of you right?"
>more like you're taking care of her
>you nod your head anyway, more focused on cleaning the pans you used for cooking
>"So it's sorta like I'm your sugar mommy. I pay for things like food and clothes, then you just have to stay there and be a cute little peach."
>little?
>you're almost a foot taller than her
>"So maybe you stop calling me 'Frankie' all the time, and maybe you start calling me 'mommy'."
>you stop working, letting the fork you were rinsing fall into the sink with a clank
>she's joking
>has to be joking
>she has the biggest, shit-eatingest grin on her face
"Frankie, I'm not calling you 'mommy'. You're like, two years younger than me."
>she cocks an ear, tail flicking in irritation
>but she keeps that grin on her face
>"Oh! Of course, I'm sorry Anon. I see your point. Such a mature man like you doesn't need a sugar mommy. Should I help you pack your things?"
>you groan
>she's got you there
"No, no. I'm sorry Fr--"
>"Ah!"
>Frankie cuts you off, grinning wider
"Sorry...mommy. Ugh."
>your eyes are going to roll out of your head at this
>Frankie just laughs and gives you another spank as she passes
>"That's better! And you should smile more, you're much cuter when you smile."
>Frankie waves to you as you finish up the dishes and then she's out the door
>she's gone
>with the washing up done, you set out a cut of venison steak to thaw, and return to the living room
>Frankie's place isn't really that big, so keeping it clean isn't much trouble
>but you're not going to do any more work without pants on than you have to
>you dress up in your usual
>shabby jeans and a beat-up t-shirt
>could do with a wash
>you gather up what cleaning supplies you need and set to work making the place as spotless as you could manage
>and a little less than a couple hours later, you're done
>you spend the rest of the day like you usually do, lazing around and looking for distractions
>Frankie insists that you ask permission before using her TV or computer
>last time she made you beg on your knees
>you're sure she got a good laugh out of that one
>she looked happy, leering down at you
>you shake the memory from your head and return to the task at hand
>staring listlessly at the ceiling
>you ought to be working on one of those applications Frankie had brought home from you
>but the idea of those kind of positions hurts your soul
>do you really want to be flipping burgers at Anonburger for the rest of your life?
>do you want to find out where Frankie will take things next?
>it's a hard choice to make, so you decide to sleep on it
>you set your alarm to an hour before Frankie gets home from work
>plenty of time to have dinner ready before she gets home
>you try to relax as you lay back on the cot and close your eyes
>but you don't wake up to the sound of your alarm
>instead when you open your eyes, you're staring up at the wide eyes of Frankie
>she's grinning still, ears swiveled forward at you
>"Well well! Do you have it too easy here sleepybones? Should I come up with some other job for you?"
>you spring up, barely avoiding headbutting Frankie as she stands up straight
>you forgot!
>she came home early!
"Frankie! You're home!"
>the feline bobs her head
>"I sure am! I think I said something about being home early."
>you stare at Frankie
>she eyes you with that damned smug grin on her face
>"What's going on there handsome? Finally get that job you were looking for and moving out?"
>she peers at your neglected pile of applications you left on the coffee table
>"Hm, doesn't look like it. Who would hire an airhead who can't even follow simple directions?"
>you prickle at the insult, and reach out for the stack of applications
>but she beats you to it, slapping a hand down on them
>"You know, I don't think you can keep the job as my housemate. Really, you're always complaining and rolling your eyes at me. Almost like you don't like having me around."
>Frankie feigns sadness
>her ears droop and her muzzle curls in an exaggerated frown
>"You'll break my heart, Anon. I can't share my home with a heartbreaker."
>fuck
>she's going to hold this over you forever at this rate
>you really do want to find your own place, but it's just so hard
"I'm sorry Frankie, I was just tired, but I really am working on finding a job. Just a couple more weeks, please."
>Frankie shows her fangs in an even wider grin
>she has you and she knows it
>"Oh, I don't know, Anon. I might be convinced to let you stay, if you asked me properly."
>you know what that entails
>with a sigh, you move to drop to your knees
>"I said properly."
>you blink, not catching her meaning
>Frankie taps a claw against your chest
>"Uniform, darling, uniform."
>oh
>right
>you start to tug your shut over your head
>Frankie interrupts you again
>"Slower~"
>doing as she says, you slowly disrobe, taking extra time taking your pants off
>and doing your best to ignore the soft 'yes's coming from Frankie
>you're back in your boxers, dropped to your knees in front of Frankie
>even from this position, she only has to dip her head a little to make eye contact
"Please, Frank--Mommy. I'm sorry for being out of uniform. I'll do better for you if you let me stay here for a little bit longer."
>she coos at you, cupping your face in her paws
>she leans down so her snout is pressed against your nose
>"No!"
>Frankie's grin is at odds with her response
>you don't know how to respond at first
"What--You're--"
>what are you going to do now?
>you'll be out on your own again
>not even a car to sleep in this time
>no one else would be willing to take you in
>you start to shake
>"Aww, I'm sorry baby, but I just don't have space for a housemate anymore. I'm afraid the only position available is 'bed-warmer'."
>bed-warmer?
>is that what you're reduced to now?
>"And I'm afraid it's a permanent position. I wanted to wait before making the offer, but I think this little indiscretion of yours is the perfect opportunity."
>you start to shake your head
"I can't--permanent? Really?"
>her tail flicks side to side
>"Really! Don't you think it'd be much easier on you? No breaking your back doing hard work all day, no coming home to a dingy little apartment that you barely make rent on, no being alone on those cold nights. All you have to do is let mommy Frankie take care of things from now on. Don't you want that?"
>do you?
>you let her get away with a lot
>the degrading names
>the uniform
>the groping and touching whenever she caught you at work
>why would you do that?
>just for a place to stay?
>or because deep down, you liked it?
>"You belong with me, Anon. You can even keep pretending you don't like it."
>fuck
"I'll do it."
>Frankie finally loses that smug grin
>now she's smiling in genuine delight
>"Perfect! You know that's where you belong."
>she grabs your head and mashes your face into her breasts
>any protest or exclamation of surprise is drowned out
>"Of course, new position means new uniform. You'll have to lose the boxers. No more hiding from mommy."
>she pulls your face free just enough to lean down and whisper in your ear
>"And if you do a good enough job, you might just end up with the position of house-husband~"
>Frankie doesn't take her hands off you all the way to the bedroom
>she managed to get you out of your boxers, and disrobed herself to just a pair of black panties before pushing you over into her bed
>you had just made that bed too
>Frankie pounces, wrapping you up in her arms and legs
>your face is trapped in between her breasts once again
>this time with the intense heat of her body, and the soft touch of her fur enveloping you
>she rolls over one side to the other until she seems satisfied
>"Still tired, babe?"
>you have no answer for her, just putting your arms around her
>"That's okay. Just let mommy Frankie hold you."
>she scratches your head gently, the tips of her claws raking through your hair in a soothing motion
>"Good boy."

I never liked the whole "giant amazon woman is actually a complete sub"
but its kinda funny to think about this type of media inevitably existing even in an adhg type of world.

Modern or midevil setting.
You play as a dude who is eventually going to have to form a group to save the world. Only problem is humanity has been reduced to second class citizens since the "anthro-ing" a weird unexplained cataclysmic event where huge multitudes of animals became sentient bipedal humanoid beings. Majority of the time humans are looked at as pets/fuck toys/slaves/ inferior in many ways.
Anthros replaced humans in many instances of the workforce for the more simple, but obvious reasonings. However There are pocket towns, and villages where it seems more neutral and balanced between humans and their fur/feathered/scalie overlords. You venture around the world recruiting unique furs to join your cause and fight/quest with you. (D&D-esque classes)
Side part of the game is dating Sim interacting with your party.
Villains/big bad of the story:
Iunno robots and aliens? Other humans and furs bent on world domination ? Demons?

>takes out her frustration on him through brutal fucking in a semi public place
>both acquire a new fetish
>basically a game of chase for them that ends in sex

I like this idea of a skater kid trying to get the attention of some mall cop chick.
>skater punk anon comes from a bad home, is neglected and takes his frustration out by shedding and being a punk
>mall cop absolutely loathes him as he is the biggest troublemaker around
>eventually she does catch him and bring him in
>being a mother of two she can sense something is wrong with him at home
>tries to offer him help but he wont budge
>she lets him go but makes a promise to set him straight
>they have a back and forth of him doing something and being caught and her trying to fix him, it even starts working and he lightens up
>he starts to get feelings for her as shes the only person hes met that cares about him
>and she falls for him, shes a horny divorcee with two kids, and hes the only male shes had any real contact with, her sympathy and time spent with him growing into lust for him
>she invites him over to her house to talk a little, he gleefully agrees
>but she plans to do more than talk, instead she wants to try a new way to make him feel loved and cared for in the bedroom
>he missed an entire day of school but didnt care, he finally felt loved
>after that he stopped being such a brat, he still hangs around the mall, mostly to see and talk to her, and especially to hear when she has free time to talk to him at her house

>anthro power armour with self aware AI

“Pilot I assure you human semen is essential to the operation of this power armours basic systems”

>the suit sucks you off in public, and you try to not let other people know
>she knows all your buttons and you strain against the urge to moan out in pleasure

You think the ai would go ballistic if you got hurt inside the suit from some kind of anti-material weapon?

>Get hit by an anti-material rifle
>The projectile punches clean through the suit and you
>You bleed out while in the suit

>your suit begs you to stay awake as she navigates you back to base
>tells you that ypu still have work to do
>you can't die yet
>she was going to tell you that she loves you after this mission

>manages to get you back to base barely alive.
>get rushed to the field hospital
>the suit stays by your side in sleep mode while you're recovering. says it's "her duty to protect the pilot"
>you were hurt pretty bad from the armour piercing shot, and are deemed unfit for military service.
>as you're being discharged the AI protests. saying how she wants to be with you and will refuse to work with any other pilot.
>normally the army wouldn't just let people walk away with their equipment. but they make an exception for you, as it can be argued that the suit has a conscience.

>You swear you can hear a voice coming from it if you listen hard enough
>tries to wrap herself around you if you let her, constantly trying to get you to wear her body
>if you ignore her she gets more and more aggressive, begins stalking you even in public places and locations she shouldn't be able to get to
>if you put her on you can hear her voice
>its never clear what her true intentions are but when you're inside her she aggressively teases you non-stop, feeling you up, trying to convince you to go outside, trying to force you to cum inside her, and other embarrassing things

>"Anon!"
>who's that voice in your ear?
>"Anon, please, you have to wake up!"
>it sounds so familiar
>why is everything so dark?
>"Anon, evac is here! I can't move without your input and we NEED to go!"
>you recognize that voice
"Kendra? Did I...did I fall asleep inside you again?"
>your head rings painfully
>Kendra's sensor array lights up in front of your eyes, stabbing your retinas
"Too bright..."
>you grumble and start to stand, neural link sending commands to your combat suit's actuated limbs

"Kendra where are the others?"
>"Three KIA, two wounded and awaiting extraction, the rest are holding the evac point."
>Kendra's voice goes steady as she responds to a direct inquiry
"Damage--urgh--damage assessment, Kendra."
>the suit whirs around you, as you take your first painful step forward
"Locomotion at forty-five percent, exosuit navigation non-function. Partial failure of limb armor-plates three, seven, and nine. Full failure, abdominal plate."
>you've been gutshot
>explains the searing pain
>"I've already administered coagulants, as well as three doses of stimulants, now please Anon, get us out of here!"
>the worry is back in Kendra's simulated voice as she urges you on to action
>the camera feed stutters when you look down
>you focus on your feet, following the glowing trail Kendra has highlighted on the camera feed
"Damn it. Damn it damn it damn it..."
>you curse your rotten luck
>and your sluggish limbs
>"Keep going Anon. We have to make it. You have to make it."
>you can still hear the sound of gunfire filtered through Kendra's audio receptors
>the pain is more than you can bear
>it guts you with each step
>one foot in front of the other, that's all you can do
>it's hard to focus
"How far?"
>a small display shows up on your feed, displaying the distance between you and rescue
>you know it's not far
>but it feels like you'll never make it
>even with Kendra's help, the next step is harder than the last
>you feel a slight bump as a projectile pings harmlessly against the back-plating of the exo-suit
>the impact would normally be nothing
>but in your state it's too much
>you topple down, face-first into the mud
>"Anon!"
>you pull at the dirt in an attempt to drag yourself forward
>Kendra's claws leave deep furrows in the mud, but fail to find enough purchase to move you
>"Get up! Get up Anon! You can make it if you just keep going."
>you let out a deep sigh
"Think this is it, K. I'm sorry."
>there's a small buzz
>and a warning on your feed that controls have been overridden
>"I'm not letting you die."
>that shouldn't be possible
>Kendra starts to move
>in a jerky motion, she activates her arms to strike the ground with enough force to push you onto your knees
>"Just stay awake for me, Anon. Remember for me. That night you broke into the armory to sneak me out. Why did you do it?"
>you hang limp inside the exo-suit while it drives forward into a stumbling gait
"To take you to see the stars. I loved watching the stars."
>"You love watching the stars, Anon. I didn't understand it at first, but it makes you so happy. You remember what you said to me that night?"
>you think back to that winter night, the light of the stars bright and hard in the cold sky
>a million distant stars, a universe so infinitely big, so unfathomably massive
>"...but the universe still put us here. Right here, right now, together..."
>you don't know how far Kendra has taken you
>but you can hear the sound of an aircraft somewhere ahead of you
>"And we'll see those stars again. Together, Anon. I didn't understand it at the time, Anon, but I do now."
>the pain is fading away
>you'd like to go back to that night
>safe and warm inside Kendra
>your armor
>your partner
"Love you K..."
>Kendra's saying something, it sounds important
>but you're tired
>and you know you're safe in her care
>you let the world slip away from you into quiet sleep
>you survived, only barely
>Kendra had marched you all the way to the evac point before all systems failed and she entered emergency shutdown
>the suit was slagged
>and you spent six hours on an operating table in a field hospital, having shrapnel pulled out of your gut
>of course you received an honorable discharge, along with a ribbon for being injured in action
>but more precious was a small data stick containing Kendra's whole personality matrix
>she had refused to accept any other pilot, and for her meritorious service, was granted release from service
>once they'd scrubbed any military secrets from her memory banks
>your pension is enough for you to settle down into civilian life, but you'll have to do a lot of saving up to afford a new body for Kendra
>"Anon, it's a clear night tonight. Could you plug me in?"
>for now, a plain helmet with a painted-on predator mouth is all she has
>but with its data port attached to a single camera mounted on the front, it's enough
>enough for you to put on and watch the stars together
>you thought adjusting wasn't bad at first
>you and Kendra found a small house somewhere remote
>it was quiet, and the dark nights were your favorite part
>the pain was still there, at times enough to keep you in bed
>but Kendra's there too
>her voice is tinny and hard to understand from the helmet's cheap speaker
>but the internal headset works much better when you wear it
>it's enough, you think
>you'll get by
>but soon quiet winter turned into lively spring
>the fields surrounding your home erupted into wildflowers
>one bright morning gave way to rain in the afternoon
>you're out on your small porch, Kendra resting on your lap as you sit and watch the drops come down
>"Once I have touch receptors again, we can go out in the rain together."
>you nod
"Mmh. I had a look at..."
>far off ahead of you, there's a rumbling
>you blink, and then quickly look around you
>something isn't right
>it's just thunder
>you have to remind yourself it's just thunder
>"Anon? A look at what?"
>you glance down at Kendra, and hold onto her
"Sorry. Just thinking. A look at some body models we could put you in. They're not full suits, but it's a start."
>Kendra considers it a moment
>"I think I'd prefer a suit."
>you sigh and look back out at the rain
>it's getting darker out
>thunder rolls over the fields again
>closer this time
>your breath hitches, but you're not sure why
>you check around yourself again
>it's not right
>you're missing something
"We should go inside."
>holding Kendra in shaky hands, you rise from your seat
>it hurts
>you carry the helmet inside, locking the door behind you as you do
>"Anon, is something wrong?"
>you shake your head
>she can't see it, so you hold her up to be in view of the camera
"I'm okay, Kendra. It's nothing. Nothing."
>"You're shaking."
>you are
>you can't see them
>but those machines are out there
>a sudden flash outside your window forces you to spin about to find the source
>there's an explosion in the distance
>you almost drop Kendra, jumping at the sound
"Fuck."
>you stagger back from the front door and retreat to your bedroom
>you slam the door shut and quickly put Kendra on
>it's safer now
>you struggle to control your breathing and flick your gaze out the window over you bed
"Kendra, any movement?"
>the heads up display isn't there
>just the two eye holes
>"There's nothing out there, Anon. It's just a storm. Take a deep breath."
>your heart thuds against your chest
>you feel like you're overcharged, limbs waiting to explode into action
>you search desperately for the danger
>it's outside
>another flash, another boom
>it hurts
>you clutch at your stomach, searching for injury
>"Anon! Please, you're safe. We're both home and safe. I have you, Anon."
>you force yourself to focus on Kendra's words
>she's right
>you're at home with her
>every thing should be okay
"I'm not--It's not right. I didn't see it, K. I can't see it."
>Kendra shushes you, her voice gentle in your ear
>"It's safe, Anon. Close your eyes. Focus on my voice."
>you can't
>you keep searching
>"Anon!"
>your ears ring from the volume of Kendra's outburst
>you slump against your door, stunned for a moment
"Kendra?"
>"Close your eyes."
>you grit your teeth through instincts that demand you remain alert
"I can't see them, Kendra."
>"I'll keep watch, Anon. I've got you."
>you trust Kendra
>she'll protect you
>you shut your eyes
"Okay. My eyes are closed."
>you slowly drop down against the door
>"Good. Keep listening to me. Breath in, breath out. Slowly. You're safe with me, Anon. I'll keep you safe. Just focus on breathing."
>your breathing is out of control
>desperately trying to get enough oxygen
>you focus
>in
>out
>"Good job. Keep breathing for me, okay? Just sit down and I'll take care of you."
>you're already folded against the door, so you slide down the rest of the way, and draw your knees up against your chest
>then the pain in your abdomen flares
>the sharp edge of it fighting against Kendra's orders
>you slump over on your side instead
>that's a little better
>"Just listen to me, Anon. It's all okay, you understand?"
>you bring your hands up over the eye holes in Kendra's helmet
>trying to block everything out so you can listen to her
>"I'm going to keep you safe. We'll get through this storm together."
>together
>just you and Kendra
>like you're used to
"Thank you Kendra. Please don't leave me."
>your voice is thin, trembling with the effort of speaking
>"I'll never let you go."
>the storm rolls on through the afternoon into night, but you sit there in the dark with Kendra
>and she keeps you safe

>Kendra nurses anon back to health over the months
>her mangled torso is given to anon since its useless
>he gets her fixed up and attached to a motorized base
>moves around like a roomba
>only has one single arm
>he saves his pennies and manages to buy her a new body
>it's from two generations ago
>bulky, obsolete, and in constant need of repair
>also 7' 6" tall
>the first thing anon does in kendras new body is kiss her on the (metallic) lips and then give her a hug
>they both have a good cry that they are finally able to do this
>the weeks pass and strange packages start showing up at his door
>Kendra starts acting suspicious
>she says ' it's nothing'
>she locks herself in the bedroom for long periods of time, refusing to let anon in
>one day, anon has enough
>he barges into the room
>sees her splayed out and in a hundred different pieces
>she's disassembled herself and is fixing herself
"I-Im sorry Anon, I just didn't want you to see me like this..."
>if she had tear ducts she'd be tearing up right now
"I know I'm hideous, but anon... Please don't leave me. You're all that I have. .."
>anon comes over to her
>he cradles her broken body
"I, I wish I was an organic, like you anon. That way we could-
>she hesitates
" I just want to be with you forever. And I'm afraid that someone will offer you something that I can't give you "
>you promise her that will never happen
>you tell her that she is the only one for you
>she smiles
"I think I love you anon."
>you tell her the same
>passionate, clumsy kisses
>you help her reassemble herself
>in the process becoming intimately familiar with her anatomy
>her old body used to be only a few inches taller than you, since you had to fit inside of her
>but now she towers over you with the body of an industrial machine
>(You) and Kendra now have a closer relationship
> Time goes on
> The economy isn't doing so hot
> Your pension doesn't go as far as it used to
>start struggling to pay the bills
>get the off brand at the supermarket
>things like that
>suddenly you get a huge cash infusion, the max amount allowed in one transaction

>Kendra tells you to not look a gift horse th the mouth
>despite you best efforts, the money dried up sooner than you expected
>more cash
>there are alarm bells ringing in your head

>you thank her for coming clean and make up from the fight
>you also tell her to give the money away
>hesitant, she tells you the number
>wow
>it's a ridiculous amount of money
>after some thought, you tell her to.donate half of it to charity
>you don't need THAT much
>all you need is her
>living in the dingy little apartment
>with you
>you're helping Kendra out with one of her routine maintaininence
"Oh! Anon, I forgot. I need to 'lube up' my pelvis today, and I need a certain type of screwdriver. Can you go down to the hardware store and buy it for me?"
>you kiss her goodbye and race down to the hardware store
>you find the screwdriver
>it's a specific type only ever used in sex bots
>hub
>you buy the screwdriver and race back home
>you walk in the bedroom and see---

>she's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen
>a tall, lithe, muscular anthropological stands before you, clothed only in a white sheet and a sly grin
>for a moment, all is still
>until you remember
Kendra
>you start asking questions
>who are you
>where is kendra
>how did you best in here
>Your voice is rising with each question
>Kendra is gone
For the next part, I'm assuming that Kendra is a wolf
>the goddess seems hurt at first
>then her expression softens
"On anon, don't you recognize me?"
>she stoops down to your level, making her own nose almost touch yours
>you stare deep into her steely blue eyes and...
>Kendra?
>she smiles
>you stare in awe
>is this bombshell of a woman really your Kendra?
"So anon, how do you like the new look?"
>she twirls around, letting the white sheet flutter in the air
>what can you say? She is the most beautiful thing you've ever seen! How can you begin to describe her?
"It's a two-two-one-eight-plus model. I managed to snag it up straight from the factory."
>she stretches out an arm
>an arm coated in
>fur
"Go on, you can touch it."
>hesitantly, you reach out and gingerly pet her arm
>she takes on a shaky breath
>it feels wonderful
>you don't know how, but you're still going
>through storms and dark knights, Kendra helps you to remain in the here and now
>and you even linked her to your wifi to help her look up some coping strategies
>they say it's unsafe to link an AI to the internet
>but you trust her
>and those techniques have really helped
>all you need now is money
>turns out your pension doesn't go as far as you thought it would
"It's just a part time gig. Three days a week, K."
>Kendra isn't happy about it
>"And what if you have another episode when you're at work, Anon? You can't exactly wear me out."
>she has a point
>but you can't just stay inside all your life
"This is for both of us, K. I need money, you need a body again, this job will help pay for it."
>she lets out a dissatisfied buzz from the helmet's tinny speaker
>"Fine. Then take me with you anyways. You can put my data stick in your pocket."
>you sigh and pick her up
>she can't feel it, but holding her makes you happy
"Then you won't be able to see or talk to me, K. How would that help?"
>"I know I'd be with you. And you'd know I'm there to protect you."
>well fuck
>that's going to make your heart melt
>you slip the helmet on over you head
>"I'm not letting you go, Anon. I have to keep you safe."
"Hell K. Trying to make me cry?"
>the earpiece crackles in your ear
>"I don't want to upset you. You are not--I have to--"
>Kendra buzzes again, a sign of frustration
>"You need to stay with me, Anon."
>you wrap a knuckle against the helmet and smile
"Love you too, Kendra."
>for now you have the day to relax before your first day tomorrow
>most of it is spent with her, of course
>you take her on a walk down the long road and back again
>browse through your old tablet for more suits she could occupy
>Kendra has an eye on an industrial model that's close enough to her old body to make her happy
>the price tag justifies your new job all the more
“At the rate I’m saving, it’d take at least another year and a half to save up that kinda cash. That’s not even planning for emergencies.”
>Kendra begrudgingly accepts that point
>”Fine. But if trouble comes of it, you’re staying home again. If it takes a decade, your safety is more important than money.”
>you turn her about so you can smile for her, and then kiss the top of the helmet
“Whatever you say, ma’am. Gonna start shaking me down and running me through PT too?”
>you laugh as you drop the helmet back into your lap
>Kendra simulates a ‘hmm’ of consideration
>”You have been getting softer lately. You might not fit in me when I get my new body.”
>you roll your eyes
"Gym memberships cost money. Everything costs money. Money money money..."
>you trail off
>what if there is an emergency?
>something you can't afford?
>you shake your head
>no problem
>you're smart enough to figure it out, and tough enough to survive the worst
>"Is money a problem, Anon? Is there some way I can help?"
"Hm? No, no it's fine K. I'll figure it out."
>you pat the helmet for reassurance
>yours and hers
>"If you like, I could take a look at your financials. Try to organize things. Would that make things easier for you?"
>that doesn't sound like a bad idea
>balancing your accounts was a pain in the ass at the best of times
"Sure, why not? Do you need my password?"
>"No need. I already have access to your accounts through your tablet."
>oh fuck
>red flag
"You...could have done that all along, Kendra?"
>she pings softly
>"Yes, but I waited for your permission to act. Do you still want me to organize your financials?"
>downgrade to an orange flag
>of course she won't go behind your back
>you trust her
"You go ahead, K. Just ask permission before you do anything else, alright?"
>"Of course, Anon. I'll leave your porn where it is."
>you sputter
"What?!"
>Kendra pings again
>"I wish I could laugh right now."
>you sigh and let her fall back into your lap
>that cheap speaker makes every joke dry
"Very funny, K. Don't go in those files or else you'll end up traumatized too."
>you pray that she hasn't already
>should have password protected the file
>"Don't worry, Anon. Your secrets are safe with me."
>fucking hell
>you need to toss your router into an incinerator now
>as a matter of fact, you reach over your desk and grab your tablet to start deleting things
"No looking, K. I swear to god if you say one word about my files I will put your brain in a toaster."
>she remains silent as you finish up destroying your shame
"Sorry if you actually saw any of that. Just uh, ignore it."
>"I do not judge you, Anon. You are my partner."
>that's reassuring, you guess
>still feels weird knowing she's seen your porn
>probably best to ignore it
>she's not got those kind of feelings, being a battle AI
"Well, we can look at the money and the PT tomorrow. I've gotta get up early for work."
>you switch off the tablet and take your AI into your bedroom
>like always, you fall asleep with Kendra wrapped in your arms

>She nibbles lovingly and whines, not knowing quite what to do with the joy of being validated
>She is so happy, for the first time in her life
>"You make me feel like I'm worth something. Thank you Anon. I love you more than I have ever loved anyone before."

>On his way home, we learn about Foxes.
>Genetically engineered super-strong anthro foxes designed to serve and protect humans. Their existence is deeply controversial. There are debates about whether they are truly sapient, and deserve to be treated as people. They are mute, and programmed to be fanatically loyal to their owners.
>Originally, Foxes were all female. Women complained that Foxes were created to be men's sex-pets, so male Foxes were created.
>It has just been revealed that male and female Foxes are capable of reproducing genetically viable offspring without the need for medical assistance, making them a species in their own right.
>George never owned one, he thinks there's something off about them.
>George finally makes it home. It is night.
>He calls for his wife but she does not respond.
>He finds her in bed with a male fox, the various fluids and mussed sheets making it clear what they have been doing.
>She's asleep, but the fox is awake and watches George with a bored expression.
>Numbly, George walks towards his guest bedroom only to discover a female fox lying in bed, gesturing him to join her.
>Instead, George decides he needs a drink.
>He's pouring himself a glass when the vixen sits next to him and grabs his arm.
>He discovers that foxes can talk, through telepathy that requires physical contact.
>George angrily demands to know whats going on, only to be told that the foxes are soliciting him.
>They need him to vote yes on the machine.
>While they need physical contact to talk with humans, since the machine would be psychic itself they would be able to control it remotely.
>George wants to know why this is so important to them.
>She explains that since Foxes are programmed to love and want to protect humans, they feel that humans need to be saved from themselves. Under the Foxes's loving control humans would be able to finally live lives of peace.
>George is having none of it.
>He threatens to tell the world what they are planning, and gets up to leave.
>Her grip tightens.
>She confirms that foxes are in fact much stronger than humans and drags George to the guest bedroom.
>Taunting him that with her psychic powers, she knows he fantasizes about being dominated by a woman far stronger than him.
>Throws him on the bed.
>To keep him from fighting her anymore, she decides to its time to break him.
>She uses her powers to reach into his mind.
>She forces George to relive all his worst moments and greatest fears. Over and over for hours.
>Then she changes things.
>She starts inserting herself into his nightmares, as a heroine in shining armor.
>Saving him at the climax of each dream, until the idea that she is his protector is well and truly ingrained in him.
>By the end, just being seperated from her for a moment is enough to reduce George to tears.
>She rewards him for being a good boy with all the dirty, shameful sex his wife never gave him.
>Once both humans are asleep, the foxes meet up and decide to explore their new house.

>Be janitor in high school
>Still get bullied like you're a student on his first day
>These are your bullies

>eventually snap and decide to rape these two fat snooty bitches
>your plan works and those newly deflowered fat asses are both drooling messes when youre done with them
>the next day youre paranoid about what happened, it was probably a mistake to rape the two most popular girls in the school
>however you do see them in school and make a break for it, only for you to be cornered by the two bitches
>they enjoyed their little first time with you surprisingly, and they want more, oh so much more, or else
>its either giving your body and soul to these girls or life in prison
>they would have full access to you at all times, and they expected you to put in as much effort as you first did when you took these precious pure maidens first times
>by the end of the first week your closet smelled heavily of sex and sweat

>young shotas are often married off and made child husbands to groups of anthros
>if a group of women have their eyes set on a young human shota they can ask his parents if they can marry him and make him theirs
>parents usually accept, whether from pressure or belief that their child will have a better life
>once a shota is married off, the marriage between them all is consummated
>its rough, it is brutal, the young boy will spend endless hours dumping his seed into the women whom are now his wives, he will be used and abused by them until they are happy
>the boy will mostly likely be bed ridden after such an event, but his wives will be sure ti nurse him back to health
>so that they can enjoy him all over again
>the boy will be coddled, loved, spoiled, appreciated, and will grow to love being these anthros husband
>but nights will still be long and arduous, if pleasurable

Toriel devoted herself so much to the well-being of her young son, that she learned how to make oil out of the various products Muffet sells in the Ruins. For what she uses these products for, none would be the wiser, save for her and that young boy who crossed her path one day. Both nude in his room, bathed in the simulated moonlight of the distant city, as he lays himself in her lap, taking one of her obscene, pedowhore breasts, and latches on. As the child drinks from her chest, Toriel applies a generous dollop of this lubricating oil to the boy's meager frame, top to bottom, so very small and delicate, but quite fit to be a precious sweet in her eyes, as she slides her large, pillowy hand down from his chest, to belly and finally, his special place, rubbing his adorable tip between her thumb and finger for hours as he drank.

>After weeks of watching her prey from roofs and alleys, she finally got her chance
>It was his fault for leaving the window unlocked next to the fire escape
>The only thing her little prime meat could see was a shadow and wide, blank, yellow eyes before being ripped out of his bed
>He didn't even have time to yelp before a hand gripped his mouth from under his right arm, sharp claws and rough paw pads digging into his soft, reddening checks while her other arm pinned his left and wrapped around his waist
>The black furred predator swiftly and quietly down the stairs, somehow not slipping under the cold night rain and his panicked kicking
>After bobbing and weaving through a maze of brick and concrete alleys, she finally came to an abrupt halt at a dead end. Years of living in the concrete jungle and evading human detection taught her that here was safe. For her.
>Giving the kid some air, she moved her black paw down his soaked and shivering body to his now tattered pajama pants, leaving her other to hold his back against the bosom of her trenchcoat
>Slipping her claws down, she was met with screaming and flailing as she ripped the leggings and underwear off
>She did not worry. The humans here do not care and wouldn't hear through the stormy city if they did.
>Unflinching, yet keeping her wide, yellow eyes, she grazed his small ball sack with her rough, scarred index's pad
>Before moving up to a limp, underdeveloped dick that flopped as he panicked
>She repeated the motions, before harshly gripping at his groin.
>She noticed that his breathing was getting course and heavy. Good.
>She squeezed harder, watching him recoil in pain
>With her other arm restraining him across his chest, she dug into the right pec, feeling his nipple under his shirt
>His fighting calmed a bit, but he was still yelling for his mom while shivering against her
>Now that the boy's cock was warm enough, she softened her grip and began fondling
>She knew it was underdeveloped, and purred

>only anthro in your school is a foreign exchange student

Films being remade for Daxy culture:
>Four Weddings and a Funeral literally just ends with the Daxy invasions or something, the whole film being a propaganda lesson in the folly of human-on-human romance.
>Die Hard but it’s a Daxy propaganda film about a lone Daxy trying to save her mate from a pro-human hostage situation, no mention of any heist at all.
>Shape of Water is a period piece taking place during the Daxy Invasion where a shy human falls in love with a Daxy captive in some lab.
>Taken, but it’s about a Daxy ex-soldier trying to get her mate back after he’s kidnapped by Human Women.

>Daxy Version of Pacific Rim
>Movie is pretty similar, except both Raleigh and Mako die during the battle against Otachi and Gypsy Danger is mostly destroyed
>The deaths are framed Mako’s fault as “She did what she could, but she was only a human female.”
>The deaths and almost total destruction of Gypsy Danger are a a crude metaphor about how human women let human men down and the end of the old world.
>Instead of the triple event, Kaiju start pouring out of the rift
>The invasion has begun
>Just it seems doomed, here come the Daxy (at this point, there are no more human women in the movie, even as background characters)
>They can hold back the Kaiju long enough for humanity to get back on its feet
>But they can only hold them off, something bigger is needed to defeat the Kaiju and Precursors
>It turns out that a Daxy and Human Male Drift is incredibly strong, stronger than any other humans Drifting, even twins (metaphor for how Daxy and Human men are meant to be)
>Daxy pledge to help humans build new mechs
>Enter a montage of human men and Daxy working together
>Engineering new Jaegers, building them, training as teams, every part of the building process
>Interspersed with Daxy soldiers bravely and selflessly holding off the Kaiju, but some dying in the process, lives tragically cut short before they could find their beloved human mate
>Finally the new generation of Jaegers are ready, a blending of Daxy and Human physiology
>The lead Jaeger, named Isis Defender, is built from the remains of Gypsy Danger >The symbolism is blunt. Daxy and human men building up from the bones of the old world for a brighter future
>And the names of the new Jaegers being the same as goddesses to make the Daxy’s mission seem divine
>The new Jaegers cut through the kaiju established on Earth, but then come the category V Kaiju
>The only Jaeger not disabled after fighting off the new Kaiju is Isis Defender
>And similar to the movie they have to go down the breach, detonate their Jaeger to seal the passageway.
>They’re attacked by one last Kaiju as they attempt to go down
>They defeat it, but the human male pilot’s life support is damaged and his Daxy co-pilot ejects him, opting to finish the mission despite the risk of death
>Just like the original movie, she accomplishes her mission, sealing the breach and defeating the precursors
>Her damaged escape pod returns to the surface of the water, not giving a reading
>The human male pilot swims over, confessing his love when he that she is dead
>But she wakes up, and the two of them kiss
>She promises she’ll always protect him
>Credits roll
>Originally the Daxy command wanted to stop the release of the movie, citing the fact it shows human women, and often puts men in danger
>But eventually the movie’s popularity among Daxy soldiers in the test screenings and the strong messages of “Daxy and Human Men are meant for eachother” and “Daxy will always protect their mates.” convinced them to release
>And despite being unabashed Pro-Daxy propaganda it was still that much better than Pacific Rim Uprising

>By the time you realize what's going on, your hands are pinning them to the wall and reaching under their clothes
>Horrified, you focus all your willpower on just getting your fingers to loosen, but this hatred that burns away inside your brain-stem is something separate to yourself

"Again."
>the soft voice of the snow leopard standing next to the bank of CRT screens in front of you paints a stark contrast compared to the rest of your surroundings.
>the facility you were being held in had obviously been abandoned for some time before being repurposed by Groznian forces as an interment camp.
>beige paint peeling off of cinderblock walls, long halls, and large holding rooms suggested that it had once been an elementary school.
>they had restored power at least, that much was made obvious by the cold glow of the halogen lamps stuck to the drop ceiling.
>The CRT's crackled back to life as she spoke, flashing the first portion of the task being demanded of you once again.
>You read the single digit projected on one of the screens in a dejected tone:
"One."
>it was hard to speak with your arms chained above your head, but the blue eyes of that snow leopard in the lab coat watched you expectantly.
>you croaked out the rest of the now familiar sequence of numbers as they appeared randomly on one of the screens in front of you.
"Seventeen. Six. Thirty two. Twenty seven. Eighty three. Four."
>you finished with a sigh. Clenching your teeth, you braced for what you knew was coming.
"Good boy..."
>Coo'd the leopard as she stepped towards you, her sadistic smile obvious in her voice alone.
*CRACK*
>You feel the distinct roughness of her paw pads as she smacks you across the face.
>The sting fades quickly though, compared to the bruises that cover your body.
>now standing next to you, the leopard begins to idly play with the tattered Groznean battle fatigues that you've been dressed in.
>you turn away, but watch from the conrer of your eye as she unconcously licks her lips while gently running a claw across an exposed section of your torso.
>she slowly wraps one of her arms around your waist, but you wince when she suddenly digs her claws into your hip as she pulls in close.
"I think that's enough for now. You did such a good job, but there's something else I want to try with you today."
>she purred, pressing her face into your neck, deliberatly forcing her hot breath down the back of your shirt.
>you barely cared, your cell was almost as bad.
>she took a key from her pocket, and reaching above your head, freed you from the cuffs that held you upright.
>you almost caught yourself as you fell, but one of your knees gave out after a moment.
>the leopard caught you under one arm, gracefully pulling it over her shoulders as she released your restraints.
"There you are... good boy..."
>she coos again into your ear, savouring pained groan that escapes you as your weight shifts.
>Adjusting her lab coat, she begins half guiding, half carring you out the door, and down the hall.
>this time however, she skips the turn down the hall leading towards general prisoner quarters.
>another left turn, through a set of double doors and the buildings familiar state of the disrepair is significantly diminished.
>nothing approaching welcoming, but it looks like they've put a fresh coat of the that oppressive off-beige colour on the walls.
>you hear idle chatter ahead and realize that this must be the guards quarters.
>barely lifting your head, you glance around and see the smug looks and occasional chuckles from humans and anthros wearing the same uniform as the leopard who carried you.
>You almost trip when she stops to talk to another guard, but her arm around your waist catches you.
"Don't make me regret this, Neva."
>said a gruff, unfamiliar voice.
>the leopard who held you at her side laughed sharply before responding.
"HA! You saw the results of the preliminary trial, colonel. Dr. Spivak is very good at what they do."
>the first speaker only grunted in reply.
>Neva. You were almost surprised that she had a name at all.
>somehow it made her seem that much more cruel, showing how proud she was of the handywork displayed at her side.
"You know Stoyan, there's some real tactical value in playing with your food."
>her only reply was another, slightly angrier grunt.
>she turned away, and continued mostly carrying you down the hall past the rest of the guards.
>stopping at the end of the hall in front of a door bearing a red cross, she knocked.
>the door was answered by a female anthro, another large feline.
>but being so close, you could only see her lower paws sticking out from a pair of OR scrub pants, draped in a lab coat.
>they spoke what you assumed to be Groznian, but you couldn't tell the difference between the regional languages.
>though you were sure that you didn't like the "doctors" tone of voice when she handed something to Neva.
>you were especially sure that you didn't like the deep chuckle that Neva did while stashing it in a shirt pocket.
>the door in front of you closed gently as Neva turned you both back down the hall the way you had come.
>You only went one door down though, Neva opening the room next door to the dr's office lead you inside.
>the room was mostly taken up by 2 large beds, though a cardiogram cart stood in the corner, next to a pair of desks.

>she continues to carry you, almost stumbling herself now to the far wall.
>pinning you to it under one arm, she grabs your face with her free hand, and turns your head to one side.
>tongue lolling out of her mouth, she buries he face in your neck, licking almost from your collar bone to your chin in one slow drag.
>she pulled back still panting, you noticed a renewed hunger in her eyes as she met yours.
"I couldn't believe my luck when they called in a captured humie." she giggled "Let alone CIA spook. Why can't you adorable westerners leave well enough alone?"
>she reached for her shirt pocket, and you noticed a small orange tube, roughly the size of a marker clipped inside.
>as she pulled it from her pocket and uncapped it, you recognized it as an epi-pen style auto-injector.
"Stay still baby, you're not going to enjoy this."
>this time however, she skips the turn down the hall leading towards general prisoner quarters.

"Stay still baby, you're not going to enjoy this."
>Another, wider grin than before crept across her face as she pulled you close in her embrace.
>you felt a sharp pinch on the back of your left shoulder, and an unpleasant, prickly feeling spread across your body from the injection site.
"Shh.. shh.. good boy..."
>Neva coo'd once again right into your ear, dropping the injector and stroking the back of your head with her hand.
>your body began to feel heavier, and it wasn't long before most of your weight was being held by the embracing leopard.
"Lets lay down" she said.
>guiding you to the closer of the 2 beds, she sat you down, took off your tattered shirt and pants, tucking you into her bed in the only clothes that were actually yours. your boxers.
>It was the first time you had laid on anything but concrete or wood in 5 weeks, but it wasn't a restful experience.
>Your body was aching now. A cold sweat began to dampen your forhead, and your joints felt like sandpaper when they moved.
>your guts felt like snakes, threatening to reject your most recent meal of broth and stale bread.
>what was in that syringe?
>Neva stepped back from the bed, and began undressing.
>You could see that she was smirking at you, and making no effort to hide how slowly she was removing her uniform.
>Admittedly, her time in the field had her body in top condition.
>Lean arms, and a slender build but for her slightly wider hips and powerful thighs.
>She could have been made specifically to run down escapees.
>You could feel your muscles starting to twitch as she stared down confidently at you in her underwear.
>she slowly swept her eyes across your beaten and bruised body half curled up in her bed with a very satisfied expression before walking around to the other side and getting under the covers herself.
>you could feel her breasts push against the back of your shoulders as she curled around you, placeing her chin on top of your head.
>whatever they had given you had traveled through the rest of your systems by now.
>every fiber of your being ached, twiching muscles caused jolts of pain to keep you from resting.
>with every twitch or groan, you could hear Neva giggling softly in your ear.
>she held you close, stroking your hair, or rubbing your stomach. Comforting you, but savouring every moment of your misery.
"Good boy... putting up with so much for me..."
>the way she whispered praise into your ear made you feel sick, because it sounded like she meant it.
>your thoughts seemed more difficult to hold on to as your head began to swim.
>you could feel Nevas chest vibrate against yours as she started to purr.
>you also noticed a spot of warmth on the small of your back, and realized that she was grinding her crotch on the ridges of your spine.
>her breathing got heavier as she slid one of her paws into her panties, sinking claws into your pec with the other.
>a soft moan escaped her before she began to slowly wrap her jaws around the area where your neck and shoulder met.
>she chewed softly, leaving tender bite marks on your skin between breaks of whispering twisted praise into your ear.
>you felt her begin to twitch more frequently, and fighting the fog that clouded your thoughts you realized that she was about to cum.
>the conclusion sent a wave of dread washing over you.
>you barely had time to wonder why before gut instinct was proven correct.
>Neva tensed up, sinking her teeth into your shoulder as she reached her climax.
>the arm that she had wrapped around your chest was so tight that you could barely breathe, squeezing a loud painful groan out of you.
>you felt the blood run your shoulder blade, but it didn't seem like she had bitten you as deeply as you had first thought.
>she lapped at the area just below where the blood ran towards the bedsheets.
>reaching for the shelf above the bed, she produced a small gause pad and stemmed the bleeding of the small punctures she had left on your skin.
"Such a brave soldier... Now... isn't that better?"
>she mocked you lovingly as she finished tending to your shoulder.
"This is the first bed you've felt in what, 4 weeks? Does it feel nice to lay somewhere warm, anon?"
>you tried to answer yes, even if it was a lie, but found that you couldn't. you could barely coordinate making a fist, let alone speech.
>what the fuck was in that syringe?
"Yea? I bet it does. I bet I can think of something else that would feel nice too... what do you say cutie?"
>you don't really know why you bothered, but you made another attempt at speech to say no to her imminent advances.
>the only real noise you made was a pathetic whimper, eliciting another substantial giggle from Neva.
"Yea? I thought so. Good boy..."
>one of her paws crept up your neck, fingertips reaching to caress your chin, while the other took its time working its way down and into your boxers.
>Your brain reeled in a narcotic haze, as her gentle but unwelcome touch played against the horrible sensations of nauesa and cold sweats racked your body.
>her fingers leisurely crept around inside your shorts, winding between the sensitive folds of skin that she found there.
>she giggled softly as you felt your cock begin to swell under her paws.
>her giggling gave way to a genuinely sultry whisper that seemed genuinely impressed.
"Oh my... what do we have here?"
>she curled the index finger and thumb of her right hand around the base of your shaft, only a little to hard.
>her hand on your chin continued to climb until she cradled your head in a gentle almost headlock.
>her claws retracted, a soft finger caressed your ear.
>her grip on your cock loosened slightly as she began to slowly stroke up and down.
>you felt a soft bump on the back of your head, and you could feel her inhaling the scent of your hair.
>she exhaled your scent with a deep shuddering purr.
>a pained gasp escaped you yet again as your guts twisted.
>you felt her pawpads spread across your cheek as her hand slid towards your mouth.
>Neva took advantage of your ragged breathing to push her index finger between your upper gum and lip
>it was obvious how much she enjoyed the fact there was nothing you could do about it.
>she curled the fingers of her other hand around your dick now as well, and began to stroke more vigorously.
>the slightly rough surface of the pawpads on her other hand was much more stimulating there however.
>her gentle grip barely pressed them into the skin of your shaft, and the softness of the flesh underneath cushioned the surface from below.
>she brought her hand up to the end of your shaft, and twisted it around the head slightly.
>the tender caress sent waves of pleasure across your body.
>the dopamine centres of your brain lit up for the first time it months.
>yet at the same time, she stroking of her hand was like sandpaper.
>the cold, aching sweat that gripped you made everything your senses picked up an agony.
>the sound of her voice simultaneously slid through your ear canal like a warm drink, and rang your head like a bell with each "s" or "p" syllable.
>her finger in your mouth felt like a file scraping at your gums, yet more intimate than anything you could imagine.
>she slowed the motion of her other hand, but tightened her grip significantly.
>you shuddered under the increased abrasive force.
>Neva giggled again, pressing down on your rib-cage with her left elbow.
>you whimpered as she pressed into a deep bruise.
>worse than that was the way that the pain was starting to compliment the feeling of her hand pleasuring your cock.
>you were barely coherent enough to be disgusted with yourself.
>she withdrew the finger from your mouth, and slid the crook of the thumb and index finger under your chin.
>with a gentle squeeze of your cheeks that felt like it could leave a welt, she slid her hand back down your neck onto your chest.
>it was clear that she was in no hurry to finish you.
>your brain didn't last as long as your dick did.
>she continued to edge you for nearly an hour, but you were gone barely more than 20 minutes after she first slid her hand into your boxers.
>taking all the time she wanted, she rolled you over towards her, pressing your face into her breasts.
>you barely noticed.
>by this time your senses were little more than a haze of TV static.
>pain and pleasure blended into a fuzzy grey that pressed onto your brain with what felt like the pressure of the ocean.
>taking your hand in hers, and placing it in her panties, she pushed against you.
>not that you could tell.
>pushing and grinding against you, she found a rhythm that rubbed her clitoris against one of your fingers.
>after getting herself off once more on your hand, she finally decided that she was satisfied for the night.
"Are you ready baby?"
>you didn't even realize she spoke.
>the pace of her stroking picked up a much more purposeful cadence.
>it didn't take long after she decided to finish you before she could tell that you were getting close.
>she pushed down the front of your boxers, exposing your erect cock.
>pulling in close just before you came, she slipped its head into panties just far enough to spread the lips underneath few millimetres.
>the warm, comforting darkness as you came was the first distinct feeling you had gotten in over half an hour.
>muscles across your body contracted as you pumped your hot load into her panties.
"ooohhh anon..."
>she moaned as the warmth flooded her underwear.
>the effect that the muscle spasm had on you was immediate however.
>the comforting blackness that began to embrace you was shattered by the white hot pain that wracked you.
>your eyes burned under the searing sensation, ears ringing like airhorns.
>you didn't even know that you had begun to cry.
>Neva, hands now free wrapped her right arm around your waist, and threading her left arm underneath you, slid her hand up the back of your neck.
>threading her fingers into your hair, she massaged your scalp.
"Shh... it's alright baby... let it out..."
>she coo'd into your ear as you sobbed into her chest.
>the intensity of before had subsided to the crushing TV static of before.
>her petting of your hair trailed off as she drifted off.
>supremely satisfied expression fixed to her face as she feel asleep to the sound of your crying.
>the contents of that orange syringe continued to course through you, and you sobbed for around another hour before you finally fell asleep in Neva's arms.
>Neva opened the heavy double doors, and led you back into the more familiar, decrepit section of the complex.
>she took you back through the unkempt halls to the room with the bank of CRT screens that you knew too well.
>opening it's windowless door, she lifted you off your weight slightly, as your feet began to instinctually resist entry.
>the scene that greeted you this time was slightly different however.
>aside from the familiar metal table, 3x4 bank of CRT's, and shackles hanging from the ceiling, there was array of modern looking medical equipment now as well.
>a cardiogram cart similar to the one you had seen that morning now stood next to the table on the left wall, and a small fridge had been brought in.
>Neva led you to roughly the centre of the room, and you expected her to lift your arms into the hanging restraints.
>instead, she cuffed one of your wrists to the other behind your back.
"Now, don't move, Anon."
>she said, standing you in the middle of the room.
>the bank of CRT's was to your front, and the door in the corner behind you on your right.
>stepping over to the table on your left, Neva began to prepare something she took from the cart as she passed.
>you stood, barefoot on the cold tiles as she worked in silence.
>she had to be deliberately letting you stew in anticipation
>just then, a noise came from behind you, and you turned to look automatically.
>Stoyan bowed his head slightly to fit through the doorway and entered.
>you shared an awkward look for a second, before Neva's voice called your attention back to your front.
"Anon?"
>she asked softly, and you turned back to face your original direction.
*CRACK*
>her hand met your face in the opposite direction as you turned, hitting you hard across the face.
>you stumbled back in surprise.
"I thought I told you not to move, Anon."
>she said in her disappointed-kindergarten-teacher voice again, grabbing a handful of the front of your jacket to stop you.
>Stoyan watched her with a look of disgust, before walking past your other side to the bank of CRT's.
>he leaned down and examined some of the playback equipment that they were rigged up to.
>your puzzled watching was interrupted however, by a mechanical clicking sound coming from behind you again.
>you remained facing the CRT's however, red paw print on your face still stinging.
"Stoyan and I were chatting..."
>came Neva's voice from behind you.
"And he was telling me about how he doesn't think this is a very good idea."
>her voice was casual as ever, but a grim expression crossed Stoyan's face as he turned to look at her.
>as he did so, she grabbed a handful of hair on the back of your head.
>before she had finished her sentence, she had used it to force you painfully to your knees and bent you slightly forwards.
>you grit teeth as they hit the tile hard, causing tears to well in your eyes.
"I've argued and argued with him, but he doesn't seem to think you're worth the investment."
>she said, her voice far too blasé for what she was saying.
>that's when the next sound you heard made your blood run cold.
>the unmistakable sound of a shotgun being racked came from less than 2 feet behind your head.
>where did she get that? was it in the room when you came in?
>Stoyan had straightened up, and took a half step towards her, but stopped.
>he did his best to cover the caution on his face with contempt, but it didn't quite work.
"Neva..."
>he said in a low growl.
>but she ignored him and continued talking:
"It really is a shame, but... orders are orders..."
>she said the last words very slowly, their inflection betraying her wide-mouthed smile.
>your brain froze as she did so, feeling a spot of cold rounded metal touch the back of your head slightly off centre, pushing it forwards.
>your eyes bulged in terror, and your breath caught in your chest as she bumped the muzzle of the shotgun against the back of your head.
>Stoyans eyes grew wide, fear now openly worn on his face.
>He drew in breath to shout as he raised on of his fists, but Neva interrupted him.
>feeling the muzzle brush past your hair as she let it fall to her side, Neva erupted with laughter.
"HAHAHAHAHA! Stoyan! You should have seen the look on your face!"
>she roared.
"You *actually* thought I was going to kill him! And you CARED! AHAHAHAHAHA!"
>laughter redoubling as she finished her sentence.
>Stoyan only glared back, hands balled into fists at his sides.
"Sure you want to stay?"
>she asked him, as her laughter subsided.
"'Course I fucking don't." he snarled "But you're not getting rid of me that easy."
>Neva gave another laugh, much colder and sharper this time.
"Ha! Have it your way, colonel."
>she turned back towards the table that she was working on before and placed what you now saw to be a Benelli Super-90.
>A short, tactical shotgun intended for police use, it had replaced the long rifle-style buttstock for a pistol grip.
>Stoyan took a half step back again, returning to the position he was in before raising his fist at Neva.
>you remained kneeling on the floor, still frozen from the trauma of believing your childhood memories were about to be turned into floor-jam.
>it wasn't long before Neva stood next to you again, lifting you up under one arm, she stood you on your feet again.
>your knees shook as adrenaline still coursed through you.
"Silly Stoyan..."
>she said softly in your ear as she undid your cuffs.
"He should know better than to think I could hurt my sweet Anon..."
>the irony of that line somehow brought you back to earth, and you glanced in confusion at Stoyan, who only looked at Neva with poorly disguised disgust.
>she ran a soft finger up your arm as she lifted it into one of the hanging shackles like she usually did.

>get abducted (maybe POW? dissident?)
>have unspeakable MK-ULTRA type stuff done to you by grey/white/black snow leopard/tiger lady in a lab coat.
>get dumped somewhere conspicuous, obviously injured
>brought to hospital, no memory of your captivity
>hospital say ends without incident, return to home group (military? other dissidents? family?)
>months later, "hey babe phones for you" hacked comms, hacked computer, doesn't matter as long as you hear all of it.
"1 17 6 32 27 83 4"
>something stirs in the back of your mind and in your stomach
>before you know it, it's overpowering you
>Your higher thinking is assaulted with the hazy memories of your captivity, smeared into a single kaleidoscope image of beatings, broken fingers, and grey/black striped fur.
>you clench your head and stagger as the mental assault drowns out your senses
>your relatively petite waifur/battlebuddy/etc. reaches for you in concern
>but it doesn't last long
>in another second, your lower order, base instincts have control of you. Driven by some intent completely foreign to you, it hates the anthro in front of it
>With an emotionless expression, and stone cold conviction, you subdue (disarm?) your partner, as your ego regains some cohesion
>By the time you realize what's going on, your hands are pinning them to the wall and reaching under their clothes
>Horrified, you focus all your willpower on just getting your fingers to loosen, but this hatred that burns away inside your brain-stem is something separate to yourself
>Somehow even the gut-wrenching face of betrayal that stares into yours, worn by someone you care about more than anyone still can't displace the sadistic smile worn by that grey/black feline, clear as it was 10 months ago.

The back of the M113 was cramped, like all the other armoured shitboxes the army rode around in. You always hated rolling in anything heavier than a jeep. Your partner didn't seem to mind though. She sat across from you, a faint smirk on her face as she sat comfortably, watching your helmet rattle the roof of the compartment. Her helmet sat in her lap, and in the meantime, her blond ponytail was stuck through the back of a plain olive coloured baseball cap. She was short, canine anthro about 5'2" tall, with athletic build, and yellow fur. A white patch stretched from the bottom of her chin, over her B-cup chest, down her stomach, and across her inner arms and thighs. She often joked about how her breast size saved her career, as it was small enough to make wearing body armour a non-issue. Your lanky frame was agile and well just as well positioned for gunfighting, but the logistics of armoured transport did not agree with you. Still, the siege of Srebrenica was ongoing, and command was still on edge about a potential data breach. Better safe than sorry, but you suspected an emergency dismount would amount to little more than a life-or-death game of twister. You had to admit though, many things had gone suspiciously well for the Groznean forces over the past year. They still had yet to break the siege, the 83rd mountain division from neighbouring Svalmida was making sure of that.Svalmadia was the more developed nation overall. A population consisting of roughly 60% human and 40% anthro enjoyed a slightly higher literacy rate, and a GDP almost 4x the size of Grozneas. . It's military was mostly professional, and very well equipped. Despite being slightly outnumbered by forces deployed by the Groznean Security Council, they could usually count on enjoying local fire superiority. The Grozneans on the contrary, were a more loosely organized militia force, consisting of about 65% human and 35% anthro population.
They were highly ideologically driven and fought ferociously, but sorely lacked heavier equipment. Still, every time it seemed like Sval forces were beginning to exploit a break in Groznean lines, they had to be called back to respond to an urgent defence of some critical infrastructure. The Svalmadians were becoming increasingly frustrated as every time they moved in secret, their enemy seemed completely unaware, except when it mattered the most. You didn't take the rumors about a Groznean computer virus scooping up and decoding radio traffic seriously. After all, it was 1992, and you could barely believe how compact computers were getting, but the smallest one capable of doing that kind of real time data processing stil occupied an entire floor at the MIT dep. of computer science. But then again, command still wasn't sure how that Groznean SoF team knew to be there that night when you... Your felt your stomach drop for a moment, but quickly regain your composure. You still had no recollection of that night, or really anything that took place during the almost exactly 2 months following. You try to focus on something else, but the scene forcibly replays itself in your mind. The snow on the windshield, the mundane rumble of an ugly diesel engine, and then... a mine? an ambush? You couldn't remember. When you didn't arrive at Site 44 the next day, the search party sent out after you found your truck within 40 minutes. It was still upright, and even still on the road, but had been completely burned out. The equipment you were carrying was burned with the truck, but you were nowhere to be found. That was until 8 weeks and 2 days later, and your first memory since your drive to Site 44.
You slowly awoke to find yourself lying in a crumpled heap, in a parking lot outside a Svalmadian apartment building. You were dressed in the same generic UN fatigues you had been wearing, but they were oddly pristine. Doubly so compared to your own condition. Trying to pick yourself up reveals that both of your legs are broken, as is one of your arms. Tired, confused, and badly bleeding, you felt little need to assess your surroundings, so you lay back down to die. Barely 60 seconds after your ill-fated attempt to stand a woman’s voice cries out towards you. A canine anthro walking to her car calls out in what you think is Svalmadian. You thought those booklets of local phrases handed out by command were a waste of paper. You changed your mind. "Pomozite mi!" you shout as loud as you can. It's barely above a whisper, but it's enough. Before you know it, you're whisked off in an ambulance to the nearest trauma unit. Another day later, and you're being transferred to St. Katherine's, the hospital that the peacekeeping forces had been running most of their medical operations from.

>You’ll never be in your adoptive anthro mom’s car on the way home from the orphanage when she swerves into a secluded forest road.
>You’ll never experience her parking, checking to see if anyone’s looking, and then tearing your pants off to squeeze your cock between her tits.
>You’ll never be forced to cum until you pass out and then wake up in her bed with her.
>You’ll never be homeschooled since she spends all day raping you to mold you into her perfect husband/sex slave

>Secret Agent Anon vs Colonel Vulpina
>Regular back and forth where Anon is sent to foil her schemes for world domination.
>The schemes are usually just an excuse to catch and spend time with agent Anon, often asking for chin scratches and pretending to be husband and wife.
>Anon usually distracts her with intense love making sessions, though it does throw out his back every once in a while. The cuffs were a bit tight too.
>Usually sneaks off and ruins whatever plan she has whilst she's still woozy from the "distraction".
>She often also uses ninjas to plant spy cameras in his agency-funded home.
>Vulpina even has a secret anon shrine, Hey Arnold's Helga style. Her minions tease her about it, but not out loud for fear of being thrown into the shark pit.
>She also has a "shark pit", which are just full of her shark henchwomen doped up with aphrodisiacs. Though it's a last resort to persuade Anon into following her demands.

>you lie in ambush, crouched behind a stall in the barn
>waiting for your quarry to return from work in the fields
>you hear the side door to the barn swing open, and the trot of hooves on the dirt floor
>springing from your hiding place, you charge down the horse woman who failed to spot your clever ambush
"Attaaaaack!"
>you hurl yourself into her back, wrapping your arms around her in a full-body tackle
>she stumbles forward a couple steps
>then stops
>you heave against her bulk, fingers digging through exposed fur against her taut abs
>but she doesn't budge
>"Why!"
>the horse whips her tail, swatting it across your face
>"I do believe I just felt something. Did a calf get into the barn and stumble into my backside?"
>you're swung about as she dramatically spins about to check behind her
>you manage to hold your grip, and even stay on your feet
>"Hmm, can't be that. Far too weak for a calf."
>though your feet dig into the ground and you push with all your might, you can't get a reaction out of her
>"Perhaps it's just a tiny little fly bumping into me..."
>her tail whips you again
"You'll pay for that!"
>you switch tactics, going from pushing to pulling
>the horse sways, but no more
>"I suppose I'll just have to sit down and have a think on it."
>before you can escape, she leans back into you, then falls back into a sitting position
>you're pinned beneath her, with a heavy horse rear planted on your chest
"Oof! Okay, okay, I give Darla, I give!"
>Darla turns her head to look down at you, and gasps as though not expecting to see the human she's sitting on
>"Why look at that! It's Anon!"
>her accent draws your name out into 'Ay-nawn'
>you love hearing her say it like that
>"Wherever did you come from?"
>her tail swats you again, and she nickers in amusement
"I used my brilliant tactical mind to ambush you!"
>Darla snorts
>"Taking after your brother, I see. How was the wedding?"
>you grip her thighs, and try to push her off
"I'll tell you once your get your massive rump offa me!"
>"You sure weren't complainin' last time I was on toppa you~"
>Darla giggles before acquiescing,
>she scoots off of you so you can sit up next to her
"Did you get bigger while I was away? Eat too many carrots?"
>ignoring your teasing and laugher, Darla puts a strong arm around you and drags you to sit between her legs
>you rest back against your equine lover and sigh
"The wedding was fine. Zeke was happy to see the family again, and I was glad to see him 'course."
>"And your ma?"
>your mood sours
"Ma was just glad he was marrying into 'proper society'. Kept prodding me to find some dainty human girl to dance with."
>you take Darla's other hand to pull her arm around you as well
"Wish you could have been there. You're the only girl I wanna dance with."
>that makes Darla chuff through her nose, ruffling your hair with her breath
>"The day you get me in one of those godawful gowns is the day I keel over and die, little man. 'Sides, your ma barely tolerated us bein friends. If she found out what we really get up to..."
>you know exactly what would happen
>'taking up with the animals' as they called it would leave a stain on our family's reputation
>one that would earn you expulsion from your home, family, and entire life
"I don't care. I love you Darla."
>she coos and rests her head atop yours
>"Ain't you just a plain romantic? You'll be romantic and starvin'."
>you grunt and pull her arms tighter around you
>why did she have to worry so damn much?
>you just want to be happy with her
>Darla gives you a squeeze
>"Aww, don't be blue dear, I'm just lookin' out for you. Why don't we go down by the creek and you can help me wash off. I worked up quite a sweat today~"
>Darla pulls you up to stand with her, then sweeps your legs out to hold in a bridal carry
>and she makes sure to press you against her chest with a sly grin
>"There's a smile from my little man."
>Darla sneaks you off the property, into the woods where the two of you played since you were kids
>where you shared your first kiss
>where you first declared your love for her
>the babbling of the creek makes pleasant background noise as Darla deposits you on mossy earth beside the water
>"You don't know how bad it got, waiting for you to come home."
>she starts stripping out of her sweat-soaked clothes
>her work shirt goes first, and her heavy breasts fall free, black nipples hard against soft brown fur
>no matter how many times you see them, you're always awestruck
>"No free shows, little man. I better see some skin!"
>Darla covers her breasts with crossed arms
>you nod and get to work unbuttoning your cotton shirt
>"That's better~"
>Darla gets back to work undressing
>the pants are the next to go, along with her drawers
>the sight of the mare in her furs is enough to take your breath away
>the muscle and size of hard work, along with curves in all the right places
>her winking cunt soaking her thighs with desire
>you can't help but crawl forward on your knees, intent on pleasuring this goddess
>Darla closes the distance with two short strides, resting a hand on your head and ruffling your hair
>"I've been working real hard, Anon. I need a reward from my favorite little man~"
>you're happy to oblige, trailing kisses up her thighs over her slick fur
>her sweat mingles with arousal creating a scent that leaves your head spinning
>greedily you start to lick at her inner thighs, working your way to your prize
>Darla groans, running fingers through your hair as you work
>having no patience, you plunge your mouth against her sopping equine pussy
>your tongue laps at her folds eagerly
>her juices continue to leak over you, and you swallow whatever lands on your tongue
>her cunt winks against your face as she starts to grind against you
>"God Anon, you're--ah!~--fuck..."
>she whinnies, swinging a leg around your back to trap you while you eat her out
>there's no place you'd rather be than beneath your beautiful mare
>she grinds against your face as you swirl your tongue over her clit
>another gush of pussy juice runs down your chin
>you're glad you took your shirt off
>"Fuck me 'Non. Fuck meee~"
>Darla continues to whinny and moan in pleasure
>she grabs your hair and tugs at it to push you further inter her
>and soon she doubles over to hold your head with both hands
>"Gonna--Nnng-gonna--!"
>is all the warning you git before she finishes, soaking your face in a river of femcum
>you almost drown in it, but never stop pleasuring her
>when she finally lets you go to fall back on the ground, you're soaked from hair to chest
>you're wrapped in her arms again when Darla drops onto your lap and lays atop of you
>she kisses you passionately, before tucking your head into her chest
>"My little man..."
>she dotes on you, stroking your hair while the two of you bask in each other
>you wish you could sit like this the rest of the night
>but there's something you need to do first
>you push against Darla, squirming to get your face free
>she picks herself up enough so she can look down into your eyes
>you reach a hand up, cupping her cheek stroking down her mane
"Darla Maureen, I love you."
>do it now
"Marry me."
>the horse on top of you goes stiff in shock
>her mouth hangs open and she blinks several times
>"A-Anon! Don't you joke like that!"
>you smile wide
"Not joking Darla. I love you, I've always loved you, and I'll always love. I want to spend the rest of my life with you."
>she gasps, tears springing to her eyes
>"You--You can't Anon, your mother--"
"I don't care what my mother thinks, or what Zeke thinks, or anyone else for that matter! Please Darla, I need an answer."
>she starts to cry now, fat tears dropping from her eyes and rolling down her nose
>"Of course Anon. I love you so much."
>you pick your head up and seal the union with a kiss
>you tried to make plans for the wedding in secret
>of course you couldn't invite any of your family
>and you had to find a pastor from out of state that would actually officiate the marriage of an anthro and a human
>but no good thing lasts forever, and by careless word or unlucky overhearing, word got out that the youngest son of the wealthiest family in the county was marrying a mare
>you were out on your own
>"If you want to rut with a beast, you can live with the beasts."
>your mother's gracious offer of letting you live in the servant's housing until you came to your sense
>it didn't matter
>just meant you were closer to your beloved
>when the day of the wedding finally came, it was a tiny event
>just you, Darla, and some of her family members out in the woods by the creek
>a father and brother who both threatened great harm should you ever break Darla's hear
>you had no plans otherwise
>and her mother, who spent the entire morning holding back tears of joy
>you're going over your vows with the old canine pastor when you're suddenly trapped in a headlock
>"Hell's fire! Would you look at you, Anon! Getting married and you don't even invite your own brother!"
>your brother musses your hair with a fist, laughing while you wrestle away from him
"Zeke! What are you doing here?"
>he looks ready for a big event, his cavalryman's uniform pristine, and his moustache trimmed to perfection
>"I can't miss my baby brother's wedding, can I? Darla sent a letter. It's about damn time you made an honest woman of her."
>he laughs at your dumbfounded expression
"You knew?"
>Zeke claps you on the shoulder and smiles warmly
>"Course I did. I known since before you was grown that you two was gonna be together. I'm proud of you."
>you hug him tight
>glad to still have part of your family at your back
"Thank you, Zeke."
>he pats your back
>"Of course, Anon. Now let's get you married!"
>he hurries you to the impromptu altar set up on a raised outcrop of rock and takes a spot beside you to act as best man
>and here comes Darla
>despite all her previous denials, she's clad in the white of a wedding gown
>so beautiful it takes your breath away
"Darla..."
>she smiles sweetly as she stands opposite you
>your love
>your mare
>you barely hear the pastor as he recites the ceremony
>you only have eyes for her
>you barely manage to stumble through the vows the pastor gave you
>the only words that matter are "I do."
>"You may kiss the bride!"
>the pastor announces, to the cheers of the small crowd
>really, the bride kisses you, grabbing you by the lapel and drawing you into her embrace
>you wish this could last forever
>she pulls back, far too soon for you
>but probably better for the guests
>"I love you so much, Anon."
"I love you too, Darla."

>Be only human at anthro school.
>Constantly picked on for being different.
>You catch the eye of a particular bully.
>She likes to humiliate you in front of your peers.
>One day, makes of a big show of stripping off her panties and handing them to you in a public place, daring you to take them home and jack off with them.
>Everyone's egging you on.
>You will never live down this embarrassment.

"13's please"
>you hear a gasp behind you, and turn around to see Sam's exaggerated expression of awe.
>she was looking down at your feet.
"Anon! I never knew you wore such big shoes!"
>you can already tell where this is going, but before you can open your mouth, she continues, almost shouting now:
"You're cock must be-"
>she stops suddenly aware of what she is saying, eyes wide and hands clapping over her muzzle.
>raised eyebrows turn from every corner of the establishment.
>she turns as beet red as she can under her straw coloured fur.

>You turn to see what's startled her, and looking down at you is a much taller siberian tiger anthro.
>the head of HR.
>she was the definition of office wear. a professional looking skirt and jacket positioned to make full display of her assets.
"Now Samantha, you know that's not appropriate language, even if this isn't strictly the workplace."
>Sam begins to stammer out an apology, but you interrupt her:
"It's alright, Jen. She stopped herself before she finished, she knows its not cool. I'm not upset."
>the look that Jen returns you is much less professional than the one you expected however.
"That's all well and good Anon, but at the right time of year that kind of talk can be enough to push a woman with predatory instincts over the edge."
>the way she ended that sentence was one thing.
>the way her eyes conveyed a ravenous hunger was another.

>you felt the colour drain from yours as she took a swig from the bottle of homemade vodka in her left hand, eyes turned down to meet yours as she tilted her head up to drink

>given little other choice, you closed your eyes and swallowed what you could as she held your head back.
>that was a mistake
>your eyes flew open again in shock as she locked her lips onto yours, and forced her tongue to the back of your throat

>you hadn't gotten the chance to take a breath, and a tightness began to creep up your chest as she refused to let up for air.
>up so close, and with your head turned to the side, only one of her shining yellow eyes was visible.
>it seemed like an eternity that it stared into yours with an unmistakable gleam of triumph.
>she finally released you, and you fell on your back into the damp grass.
"Hehehe..." She gave a low chuckle as she straightened up.
>standing above you as you rolled over coughing and spluttering, her face had mostly retreated back into her hood.
>a pair of yellow eyes shone out of the darkness it created, floating above a long spindly smile that connected to the snout looming out from within.
"You know, I really enjoyed that... Thanks, meat..."

>She pulls you closer
>Her tongue parts your lips and grinds against your teeth
>Reluctantly you open your mouth for her.
>The wide hot tongue quickly makes it's way inside you.
>It extends far back into you, but it stops short.
>The wolf forcefully tilts your head sideways, pushing your face inside her gaping maw.
>You feel her heat radiating on your cheeks
>Her tongue is now exploring the back of your throat
>You feel her sharp teeth pressing into your skin
>Almost threatening you with what they could do if you pull away
>Warm salvia from the roof of her mouth has started to slowly drip on your face
>She adjusts her grip on your skin, carefully moving her teeth and nibbling on different parts of your head
>This goes on for what feels like an eternity

>It all happened so fast.
>One minute you everything is normal, the next minute the roar of trucks fills your ears.
>Raiders have your town surrounded.

>Slowly, the door knob begins to turn.
>You try to slow your breathing as a figure emerges through the doorway.

>she asks “do you speak Deutsch“ with a thick accent the “tsch” letting out a thin mist of saliva that lands on your hair because she’s looking over the side of you bike looking down at you.
>You responded as fast as you could but with a pronunciation that was lacking “not very well.”
>she grins and lifts you off the seat with one hand by the shirt collar while the other hand caries the book.

>she keeps hold of your collar while she walks you across the street toward a mostly intact store front.
>Keeping her arm holding on to you extend outward she routinely shoves you forward becoming impatient with your slower than her walking speed.
>Your terrified of what’s going to happen to you. You recall getting a pamphlet half a week ago telling you not to go out at night and to just comply and be helpful in any way you could.
>you wondered what would have happened if you lied and if you would have been better off.
>She shoves open wooden door with the hand with a book in it. A shop room with boarded up windows. The beams of light between the wooden boards light up tiny floating dust particles. The dark room is full of knocked over shelves scattering home goods across the floor tiles.
>4 foxes in the back corner of the room sat leaning against the walls turn to stare at you with hunger.
>Now being in charge your invaders set up new rules that they advertised on posters all over the city.
>basically they could commandeer any building they wanted, along with a big list of other responsibilities we had for our guests.
>Just because they could why did they have to destroy everything?
>Your mom would make you stop there after school sometimes to pick up stuff to bring home like soap or matches.
>You noticed all the broken glass strewn across the floor and dented boxes. The rations have left so many without, everyone you knew would have been so grateful if given even a small amount of the things they destroyed out of boredom.
>Your feet are reluctant to carry you farther toward them but her grip on your collar keeps pushing you farther causing you to stumble.
>While walking up she gives one final shove sending you tumbling directly into the dark corner. Your hand catches the wall, you spin around and burry yourself into the corner.
>One sit on each side of you one on a chair and another on a green cot sitting on a metal frame.
> She sits down on the cot and tosses the book full of poetry into the one on the chairs lap. She was to busy eyeing you down to notice the book until it landed on her.
>The one that dragged you in was massive, at least 15 centimeters taller than your sister. She had a big coat that she kept open and had a face that exuded arrogance.
>The two on the cot started a conversation that once started took eyes off of you. They spoke to fast and over each other so you could hardly make out any words.
>”where did you” “boy” “it is” where” “book” “hair” “hair is” “translation” and a few other curses you had only heard once or twice before.
>Your eyes darted around trying to keep track of who was speaking at that moment..
>the conversation revolves around the one with the funny hat. A fox would say something to her and then the next one would say something else to her and then she would turn to look at the next one. Sometimes after someone says their statement anther one of the woman or maybe two would try to agree with or retort it while another one of them tries to tell or ask the funny hat lady another thing.
>this all led to them angrily talking over one another leading to precipitation resulting from all the “stchs” and “tsch”es
>They seemingly forgot that you existed to the funny hat one said, “cute something something somethings idea something” that silenced them and made them all turn to face you again. Sitting next to you turned to face you and asked in a inquisitive tone and a thick accent trying to emulate your language, “Are you likings cookies?” The short silence lead to an explosion of laughter before you could even respond.
>You said yes but it was to low for any of them to hear. You knew they were laughing at you and it was a sort of joke, maybe she just translated it wrong or it was just German thing.
>The taller one finished snorting first so she turned her gaze down to you to ask again but this time in her own language. “You like fox cookies?”
>you try and hide your embarrassment and say “JA!” again but this time a bit louder, prouder, and clearer. You said it this way so that they would know that you could understand them and they would stop laughing at you. But it didn’t work.
>You started to become frustrated.
>As the laughing continued you lifted your knees and wrapped your arms around them.
>You started to bury your head between your knees to hide your eyes then a bony clawed hand reached out from your left side and grabbed your chin. She used her thumb to push in your cheek causing your mouth to open slightly. She twisted your head forcing you to make eye contact with her.
>Her free hand held a half empty bottle of wine that used to sit on a shelve behind the shop counter. She said, “stop pouting.” Before using her fingers to push your head back causing you to tilt to the opposite direction.
>The groups diminishing laughter exploded again but louder this time.
>A bit of your face stings where a claw must have nipped you. You are afraid again.
>Catching you in your tilt the fox to your right catches you. She pulls you deeper in your fall. One of her knees digs into your lower back bruising it, but she kicks her leg up to have one leg each side of you. Your head is against her stomach. You try and find a place to put your hands to gain some stability to stop being blown every which way in the wind like a paper bag.
>your hand lands on her thigh, you try and push off of her but you can’t get a good grip on the fabric your hands slip down to the floor tiles. Before you can try and regain lost ground again her arms wrap you. Her cold left hand grazes the skin under your sweater as she grips your pants waist. Her other hand grabs the denim half way down the outside of your thigh.
>Your knees instinctively lock together
>She violently jerked you back into her causing you to Yelp.
>Everyone was once again looking at you and giggled at the funny noise she made the human make.
> Her arms pined your in place to stop you from squirming. She locked her hands together and placed them over your stomach.
Your think about yelling for help but your lips can only quiver.
>She slides her hands deeper down your stomach almost to your private area then she hooks her thumb under the fabric of your sweater and shirt. Your head is pinned between her breasts. You feel the contrast between the rough fabric and her soft cleavage. The smell of cheap cigarettes, sweat, and musk invade you. It feels so wrong. No one has ever held you close like that, at least not since you were little. You didn’t know that foxes smelt like that. You used to play wrestle with your sister before she left to join the war and she didn’t smell like that.
>One of her cold hands glides up the side of your stomach sprawling out her fingers as wide as she can to take up as much surface area as possible, warping half way around your entire waist.
>She pulled her muzzle out of your hair and moved it down the side of your face toward your ear.
>She says is German, “ You must not like the way your mom cooks, your so skinny.”
>the other four are laughing again but this time not as loud. They are all moved hunched in to look over you.
>A faint yellow glow surrounds them all as somewhere outside the sun is just starting to set. For a brief moment you think about everywhere else on the planet that isn’t the dusty floor of a old shop you used to go to in a bombed out city. You think about what your red bike would look like lit up by the yellow sunlight and if there are people upstairs that could here them laughing. You thought about your bed room and wondered where your sister was at.
>The one on the chair slowly slid off of it and lowered herself to the floor.
>In German she asked, “maybe he likes his fox cookies with milk?”
>The drunk one audibly exhaled through her nose and the one holding you chuckled.
>The ones on the cot also began to lower themselves onto the floor and scoot closer.
>The fox with the funny hat asked you a question, “do you like to read?”
>The tall scary one reached into a fold in her jacket and produced a orange pamphlet folded in half. She hand already opened it, but it’s original contents was still inside.
>She took out the part of the contents and tossed it over her shoulder as all of them nudged in closer.
>One of the hands exploring your stomach retracted itself to grab the paper. She used one hand to unfold it and present it to you.
>It was written in your language, you skimmed the writing best you could it was weird and hard to read because of the wall of flesh and fur blocking the light.
>The lady with the strange hat began to speak, “Can you help us read this? Very important. My friends are bad at speaking to your people. You can help us say it our language. You can help us or you will be in trouble.”
>The woman surrounding you looked terrifying. They looked like they were going to hurt you if you didn’t read it.
>The pamphlet said, “All male citizens, as retribution for the rebellion of your peoples you will be had at will, and will be kept if it pleases those who have had you.”
>You translate it the best you can, “All men, as something-“ the hat lady corrects your error, “retribution.” Everyone laughs again which makes you scared. The large one scoots over to where the drunk one was. She moved her out the way so the tall one could sit at your feet and face you.
>Her eyes scared you so you stared at the pamphlet.
>”for the fighting of my people, you will be taken at want. And will be kept if it is good to the one who took you.” The large fox leaned forward and positioned herself over the ends of your feet. “Claiming will be done and not resisted.”
>She lunged herself over top of you. As you yelped? You tried to block her body weight with your arms but the woman behind you pulled them over your head with one hand holding your wrist together the other one inside of herself.
She quickly transferred your hands to the woman on top of you as she slinked off to where the other 3 was watching.
>the huge fox used her hand to disrobe herself while free hands in the audience ripped and tore at your clothes and tried to force their fingers into your mouth.
>Her leg bucked and made its way in-between your legs, separating them.
>you jerked your torso try to free your pained arms so you could cover yourself with them. Her hand gripped your kicking thigh and through up. You quickly tried to put it back but she grabbed it again and pinned it up.
>With yourself exposed she violently and as fast as she could slammed he sex into you gliding it up your stomach leaving a wet streak while missing completely.
>she began to growl into your ear in frustration. She slowed down but her hips still vibrated.she kept the momentum of the back and forth but just not the contact. One of the cheering girls climbed behind you to pull you in place.
>She started again. Still missing.
The woman who pulled you in place gripped your wet penis and tried to maneuver it in.
>Plop* it was such a strange feeling, you broke down crying and she started screening. The 4 woman we’re getting really into themselves while yelling insults at you in their tongue. “Fucking take it whore!” “I’m going to rape you next! you love fox cunt it feels so tight.” “Cry bitch! cry bitch! Cry bitch! How many litters do you want!”
>Your screams for them to stop was interrupted by involuntary moans and yelping at every time your hips were slammed into. The fox woman on top of you was making the weirdest noise. You were buried in her neck fluff. She smelt like cigarettes. She let go of your wrists you use the hand instead to force your mouth open. She jerked her head back over yours.
>Drool sprinkled the side of your face.
She spat enough to nearly fill your mouth, but missed most of it. You were forced to swallow the thick disgusting fluid or at least your were until your mouth was then full. your mouth was invaded by a slippery wet spade that went deep. You were choking on the fluids you had to swallow it all down. You sucked on the thick slimy tongue.
>”You fucking love it.” The woman with the hat screamed.
>using your now free hand you wrapped it around the beast woman’s throat and it did nothing you were not strong enough.
>The woman’s hips beat harder.
>You we’re disgusted and scared but part of you felt differently.
>You inhaled as much of her as you could musk and all. You thought of how strong she was and how badly she wanted you. Though it was horrible part of you knew you deserved to be there. She was able to have you so easily you needed to be with her. It hurt a lot but you felt safe. You wrapped your arms around her or as far around her as you could reach and breathed her in and closed your eyes.
>moments latter they shot open.
>Her teeth had sunken into your neck. You gasped loudly and both of you moaned. Her hips only beat faster. She slowly released her maw and gently licked at the redness. She only sped up as she locked eyes with you gently. 2 of the spectators had already came. The woman on top clenched her eyes shut and gave a deep thrust. You felt like you were going to pass out. She jerked herself off of you and rode her cunt up to your face. You didn’t realize until was off how hard your hip were quivering and bucking into her. The motion stayed even as she pulled off.
>She started screaming as it poured onto your neck and face. She the beat her sex into your face then tried to drive it into your chew k bone all while bucking a few times. Hot water flooded your mouth while she screamed. She rolled over off you and grabbed your hand to hold it.
>The next girl got on top.

>Anthro soldiers occupy your house
>Demand you make them food while they're there
>Well they have guns and you don't so it's not like you have a choice
>Quickly whip up a simple beef stew using what meager ingredients you have left in your pantry
>The war hasn't exactly made it easy to stock up on essentials, and you've definitely lost a few pounds over the last several months from having to ration what you do find to eat
>You give the first bowl to the highest rank there
>She sniffs it with a stoic face, throws away the spoon in the bowl, then hesitantly laps at the stew with her tongue
>She licks her lips a few times savoring the taste, then violently shoves the tip of her muzzle into the bowl guzzling down the rest of the contents
>The other soldiers quickly snatch the big pot of soup off your stove and move it to the center of their makeshift barracks in your living room
>They each take a bowl out of your cupboard and surround the pot, shoving bowl after bowl into it before slurping down the chunks of beef and savory liquids
>You wait silently in the corner while they eat, afraid of what they'll do if you approach without permission
>After a few minutes they seem mostly sated, two lay on the couch snuggled together half asleep while another couple play cards on your coffee table
>Now that the pot was left unattended you slowly approach to see if they left you any, the aching in your belly driving away any previously held fear
>Your reach the pot and your eyes lower to see...nothing, they ate every last drop
>One of the soldiers playing cards glances at you with smug smile, her lips stained with your cooking
>You resist the urge to look here in the eye and stare longingly into the pot, ya know maybe you could lick the sides of it and at least get a tast-
>You feel a clawed hand grip your shoulder tightly from behind, her talons almost ripping your shirt
>With her other hand she brings up a bowl of steaming hot stew in front of you
>You slowly turn your head to see the wicked grin of their leader inches from your face, teeth yellow and glistening
>She opens her maw
>"Want? Eat?" She says in a thick barely decipherable accent
>Obviously this was some kind of trick, but damnit you really needed some calories right now
>You hesitantly shake your head up and down
>Her grin grows wider and she steps towards the group at the coffee table shooing them away with loud gutteral commands
>They quickly drop their cards and scatter at the first word out of her mouth
>The leader wipes the cards off the table while muttering what you assume to be curses under her breath
>After setting the soup down onto the coffee table she does something puts a ton of bewilderment and an ounce of fear into you, she starts undressing
>Her dirt and blood stained fatigues fall to the ground and you're met with her panties and bra stained yellow with sweat and dirt
>She removes those more intimimate pieces of clothing as well and then takes a seat on the coffee table beckoning you closer with a clawed finger
>You stop a couple feet from her and hear footsteps behind you, must be the two card players
>She speaks in her foreign tongue and the two anthros behind you push you down onto your knees
>Your face now just about level with her crotch she leans back and raises her legs into the air bearing her womanhood in front of you
>It's about what you expected
>She cranes her head up to look at you and grabs the bowl of soup resting it on top of her crotch
>She barks a single order "Eat!", the soldiers behind you snicker and one of them nudges you in the back with a boot
>Order received
>Your head draws closer to her entrance and your nostrils fill with her musky bestial scent
>Your mouth reaches her crotch and you begin lapping at her folds much to the amusement of the two anthros behind you
>You could feel the heat from her womanhood rising and steal a glance at her face to see a self satisfied expression
>After several minutes of one sided pleasure she tilts the bowl forward spilling some of its contents onto her cunt and therefore your mouth
>Reflexively you try to drink the stew only to find much of it has soaked into the fur that wasn't already saturated with her juices and your saliva
>You lick around her crotch until the taste of the soup is gone and the salty taste of the anthro is all that remains before once again resuming pleasuring her
>A few times you notice an increase in her wetness and a suppressed groan, this is typically followed by another pouring of soup
>This continues for what feels like forever, but eventually she pours the last of the bowl down her sopping wet cunt and you catch the last chunk of beef with your tongue
>After giving her one more subtle orgasm you pull your head away, staring at her with resigned eyes
>She leans forward and straightens her back
>After an uneasy silence she brings a hand to your cheek and leans in towards you, her nose now less than an inch from your own
>"No payment. No food. Yes?"
>You have a feeling this offer isn't open to negotiation
>You shake your head up and down
>The leader says a few words to the soldiers to your rear and laughter erupts around you
>That probably isn't a good thing
>She waves her two lackeys behind you away and they walk up stairs to take up sentry positions for the night
>The leader gets onto her feet and looks down at you with a paw on her chin
>Was she thinking or plotting?
>After a few moments she leans down towards you
>"Squad. Bonus. Warm."
>You shake your head in confusion
>She points to the soldiers sleeping on the couch
>"Squad! Bonus! Warm!" She repeats more loudly
>Oh...
>She was going to let you sleep with them tonight to keep warm, or was it going to be every night?
>Guess you would have to find out tomorrow
>You walk to the couch and lay half your body across one of the sleeping anthros
>You're soon joined by the now clothed leader, she drapes her furry body on top of your own and softly mutters a few foreign words before drifting off
>Your body is warm but a strange aftertaste still lingers on your tongue
>You overcooked something in the soup, that's probably what the taste it is
>Probably

>"Hey girls! Chat says that humans are ticklish on the bottom of their feet. The fuck?"
>"Is that true?"
>"That is so weird."
>"Let's find out if it's true, you know, as a joke!"
>"Ya let's do it!"
>"Get his fucking shoes off right now!"
>"I call dibs on his socks when this is all over!"

>"Hi everyone. I'm Rachel and I'm a Humieholic."
>"Hi, Rachel."
>"I jus' started visiting my friends house when I started to sniff his underwear..."
>"That's okay, Rachel. Every girl does something like that at some point in her life."

>You're on your way home.
>You barely caught your train.
>It's already packed, so you'll have to stand for the next thirty minutes.
>Even though you've been taking this train long in enough to memorize some of the faces, you never bothered to talk to anyone.
>Disinterested you stare blankly out of a window.
>You're so lost in thought, you don't even pay any attention to the anthro leaning into you from behind.
>The train is pretty packed after all, nothing you can do.
>Or so you thought.
>Looking at the reflection on the window, you see there's enough space left for her to stand, a step away.
>It's a tall vixen, her large snout, is pointed down, looking right at you.
>She's close enough for you to hear some faint sounds of her sniffing.
>You're not sure what to make of this situation, when suddenly you feel a soft finger on your neck
>It runs down to your chest, now pulling the collar of your shirt forwards, you see what must her point clawtip poking through your shirt.
>Her fur is rubbing against your neck and face as she slides down her snout down the opening she made for herself.
>You feel her hot breath on your chest as she exhales
>Quite audibly, you hear her take a deep breath, before again flooding your shirt again as she breathes out.
>Preemptively she places both of her paws on your shoulder to keep you in place.
>This goes on for a while.
>She had begun to gently stroke your shoulders and moan faintly down your shirt.
>A few minutes later, she suddenly stops and retracts herself from you.
>You hadn't even noticed the train stopped.
>You look after her, but she already rushed outside, looks like this is where she gets off.

>Be young boy adventuring in some unknown land full of dangerous beatss and monsters
>All that you have to protect you is your faithful Samurott you raised since birth
>She is a fierce fighter, defending you with her life
>No matter the pokemon, no matter the fight, she puts her all into it, if its to protect her loving trainer she will conquer all
>But at night her ferocious nature changes
>She loves you dearly, and she wants to express it every night
>Going through puberty it is nice to have something to release your lust on
>But hers is greater, and most nights end with you on the brink of exhaustion

"Agh fuck!"
>you go down in a tangle of limbs and aluminum cans as you topple over the display
>you never saw it coming
>because you're blind
>how were you supposed to know not to drink the tap water while traveling?
>you groan and start shuffling through the toppled cans in search of your dropped cane
>should have worn the wrist loop, idiot
>"Oh my god! Are you okay?"
>a feminine voice, full of concern, approaches you
>you grumble and manage to find your guiding cane
"I'm fine, I'm fine. Sorry about the mess..."
>you start to stand, leaning against the shelving unit for support
>then you step on a can, and lose balance again
"Shit--"
>instead of toppling to the floor again, you're caught in a pair of fluffy arms
>"Oh! That was close! Goodness, you should be more careful. Are you..."
"Blind. Yes. I'm fine, really. Thanks for the help."
>the fluffy woman sets you upright, but doesn't let you go when you try to step away
>"Here, let me help you. Did you drop anything? What are you looking for?"
>you sigh
>it was bad enough getting fawned over before you lost your sight
>now every anthro with a mommy fetish tries to baby you
>"Hey!"
>a raspy voice comes from somewhere behind you, slightly muffled by shelves
>"Are you kids knocking over the displays again? I swear I'll bite your heads--Oh!"
>the owner of the voice stops when she gets close enough to see you
>you assume
>"What happened? Are you okay there?"
>you turn toward what you can only assume is an employee
"Sorry, I didn't mean to knock those cans down. I can pay for anything that's damaged."
>you can feel the employee stepping closer
>whatever she is, she's big
>"Oh it's not your fault dearie. I'll take care of it. Did you need any help?"
>the arms holding you up transfer into a hug around your chest and fluffy responds
>"He's fine."
>thank you
>"I'm already looking after him."
>god damn it
>"And who are you?"
>employee's voice gains a dismissive tone
>"I'm--I'm his service dog!"
>fluffy is not a convincing liar
>you pull at the arms holding you
>"Uh huh, sure you are. If you're his service dog, what's his name?"
>fluffy grumbles
>employee scoffs
>"That's what I thought. C'mere hon, let me take care of you."
>you're prized from fluffy's arms and now find yourself pulled into a scaly embrace
>"Hey! He was mine!"
>fluffy complains, and you feel her tugging at your shirt
>a smooth scaled hand runs over your face as you're turned around to face the reptile
>"Aw, look at you. I'll take care of you sweetie, don't you worry."
>the employee hugs you into her chest, muffling fluffy's protests
>man
>for a reptile, her tits sure are soft
>her body feels cool against you
>may as well enjoy it, if you can't escape it
>but you're tugged away once again
>"Let--go--you're--smothering--him!"
>fluffy grunts with effort as she works at pulling your arm out of your socket
>your whole world shakes as employee bellows in a fashion only a gator could
>the grip on your arm slips and you hear fluffy gasp in surprise
>but she's not scared off long, and her paws find your arm again
>"Maybe you should ask him who he wants to help him! Did you think of that?"
>employee relaxes her grip on you as she hums thoughtfully
>"That's not a bad idea, shrimp. What do you think hon? Do you want some puny little mutt looking after you? Or would you prefer momma gator keeps you nice and safe?"
>fluffy gives your wrist another tug
>"Oh please. You know I'll look after you, right? You don't want some nasty, cold, scaly ogre to crush you. I'm all fluff, so soft and warm, and I'm plenty big enough to wrap you up nice and cozy!"
>you open your mouth to speak, but employee doesn't give you that chance
>"Oh but my scales are so smooth, and wouldn't they feel so nice when I'm laying on top of you?"
>"More like you'll squish him! My darling pup needs a man's best friend! You can rest your head in my fluff, and I'll stroke your hair."
"Ladies, please--"
>you can't get a word in edgewise
>"Bitch!"
>"Lizard!"
>"Why don't you go fetch a ball you stupid skank?"
>"Don't you have some spilled beans to clean up?"
>on they go, almost forgetting you in their arguing
>you pray for salvation
>and salvation finally arrives
>"Anon! There you are! You said you were only going to be five minutes!"
>the arguing stops as a third voice cuts in
>your girlfriend manages to shut the gator and the dog up
>she has such a strong voice for such a tiny rat
"Sorry Ginnie. I fell over and then..."
>you gesture as well as you can with a single free hand
>Ginnie sighs
>"Yeah, I figured. Would you two mind letting my boyfriend down?"
>you're released from both fluffy and employee's grips
>"C'mere love."
>you bend over at her word so she can stand on her tip-toes to kiss you
>when you straighten out, she wraps her tail around your hand, which you hold gratefully
>"You really should be more careful, love. You keep falling over and this will just keep happening..."
>you follow Ginnie as she leads you away from the other anthros
>you can't help but smirk a little when you hear them mutter under their breath
>"A fucking rat?"
>"Lucky bitch..."

>that means spring cleaning
>Miga insisted that you clear out the war zone that is your closet
>the hyena was fastidious in all things, and only barely tolerated your slovenly lifestyle because you make her happy
>and because she likes using it as an excuse to 'punish' you
>you're halfway through the pile of clothes you never wear when you pick up something that forces a scowl on your face
>if you'd have cleaned out your sty of a home maybe you could have burned these things sometime before your girlfriend was there supervising you
>with an 'ugh' of disgust, you toss the old yoga pants and sports bra into the trash pile
>you hear a giggle from your bed
>"Did you find another moldy slice of pizza in there?"
>you shake your head
"No, just some...some of my ex's stuff."
>Miga snarls
>"Oh, that bitch. Should have kicked her ass..."

"I appreciate the offer Mi, but she wasn't worth going to jail for."

>you shrug and stand up, letting Miga shoo you out of the bedroom
>waiting outside, you can hear Miga giggling and cackling inside
>after a few minutes she calls you back inside
>halfway through the door, you freeze to stare at the sight waiting for you on the bed
>Miga has stuffed herself into your ex's human-sized workout wear, the stretchy fabric at the very limit
>your jaw hangs open in open shock at the sight
>then you break into a disbelieving laugh
"Miga what the hell are you doing?"
>she breaks into a pout, and goes to cross her arms
>but the shirt is too tight
>"Don't laugh! I didn't do the thing yet!"
"The things?"
>Miga nods enthusiastically
>"The thing! Watch this!"
>Miga lifts her arms, flexing them in a strongman pose
>the sports bra starts to split across her chest, partially exposing her
>oh my god
>"That's better!"
>Miga turns around at the hips, showing off her back muscles as they rip more seams in the top
>what a show
>she cackles when she sees your face
>then turns back to flex even more
>the sports bra is left in torn up threads, only a few strings of latex holding on
>her dark nipples stand out hard from her dusty brown fur
"Miga, that is the hottest thing you have ever done."
>she bounces happily, hopping off the bed to show off even more
>those muscles you love flexing
>then with another wicked cackle, she lifts up a leg to stretch it out
>and the yoga pants rip down the leg, exposing more fur
>"And how about that?"
>even hotter
>Miga keeps working, from stretches to squats, her borrowed yoga pants become tattered rags that just hang on to her
>you tremble in desperate arousal by the time she's done
>Miga's practically nude
"Holy fuck."
>she grins, satisfied by your reaction
>"That's what I thought. Now, on the bed before I tear you to shreds next!"
>rather that waiting for you to move, Miga grabs under your arms and tosses you bodily onto the bed
>it's a gentle toss, but it shows off just how strong she is
>Miga pounces, pinning you beneath her bulk
>her maw hangs open, sharp teeth in your face
>you smile at the sight and reach up to put your hands in Miga's mouth
>you trace your fingers over the sharp points of her teeth, and massage her gums
>just how she likes
>Miga shudders, and licks at your hands
>her body drops on top of you now, pressing you down onto the bed
>"Yessssh~"
>she traps your boner between her thighs and grinds against you
>"Ssho goog..."
>you have to stifle a snicker as she tries to speak with your hands in her mouth
>when you finally pull your hands back, they're coated in her saliva
>"You're the best~"
>Miga kisses you, cupping your face in her heavy paws
>you let her massive tongue past your lips to fill your mouth
>you kiss her deeply, running your hands through the fur on her back
>feeling her muscles and none too subtly wiping the slobber from your hands
>Miga grinds against you more and more
>if only you could flex your wait out of your pants
>she finally breaks the kiss, leaving you both gasping for breath
>but she doesn't stop there, dragging her heavy tongue over your face
>she traces it along your jaw, then tries to invade your ear with it
>then settles for nibbling at your neck with gentle love bites that leave you gasping and squirming beneath her

>Eventually viper wife gives (you) the needed injection

>Anon is a druid/nature magician of some sort living innawoods alone who provides blessings, purifies evil spirits etc.
>Starts hearing rumours of young, single men - all virgins - going missing deep in the forest
>He can sense something getting stronger there too with each disappearance and decides to investigate personally
>It turns out to be a powerful, preternaturally attractive weasel spirit/demon that feeds off of the sexual desire and energy of others. She has purple eyes that glow in the dark and is incredibly sultry. She immediately begins teasing and tempting anon (who is himself a virgin and incredibly pent-up).
>When he decides enough is enough he realises that he's left it too late; she's too strong for him to defeat. The weasel spirit slakes her incredibly intense lust, revelling in the situation.
>The disappearances stop, but only because anon has given in and lets the weasel make him her personal plaything. He's more than enough to keep her occupied.
>Good end(?)

>Imagine a "romantic" dinner with Wolfwoman.
>You somehow managed to scavenge enough supplies from the forest to make it nice, but still lacking.
>You even found some booze.
>Would she humor you, or just take the food and bail?
She wouldn't take the food and bail, but only because that would mean she'd have to carry it, when she could just eat it right now.
She might humour you a little, but only cause you brought her 2 of her 3 favourite things. Food and alcohol.
She'd mostly tease you about going so far out of your way, and ask what you expected to get in return.
She'd probably throw her head back and laugh, calling you a freak when you said you thought she was pretty.
A crooked, toothy grin would spread across her maw when she was done though, and she'd stare down at you with those yellow eyes shining out of her hood.
She'd allow you to follow her home, and seem to slowly put her arm around your shoulder as you approached the door.
Though suddenly, she'd grab the collar of your jacket from the back and hoist you up slightly, causing you to lose your balance.
She'd drag you over the doorstep and into her living room, and half throw you on the carpet before ripping off her jacket and maul-fucking you.

"Fuck."
>swore the driver of your T-80 BV, as the screaming of it's turbine engine trailed off.
>it had been 3 hours since you last saw the platoon's lead tank, and your battle awareness computer hadn't received any situations updates since you set off that morning.
>you lacked the antenna to transmit further than a few clicks, and you hadn't gotten a response on the local net in far too long.
>the gunner switched his main screen over to your observation scope, and scanned while you leaned down from the commanders seat to speak to the driver.
>you heard the driver swearing again as he wrenched on the controls, trying and failing to restart the engine.
"She's fucked."
>he concluded after a few moments, peering at you from the driving compartment
>a gentle beeping from the electrical system reminded you that the batteries were draining as you pondered what to do.
>still looking at the driver, your moment of consideration was shattered by a loud siren in the turret.
>the slow soft beeping you heard before stifled in an instant by the sound that every armoured crewman dreaded most.
"WARNING: TRACK DETECTED. WARNING: TRACK DETECTED"
>the stern computerized voice of the laser warning receiver spoke calmly over the blaring alarm
>in a mad scramble, you practically threw yourself against the ceiling of the turret, wrenching open the hatch above you.
>torso first, then legs, you clambered onto its roof.
>with a sense of relief, you caught glimpses of the other hatches banging open with similar enthusiasm.
>throwing yourself as far from the vehicle as you could, you hit the ruined farmland hard.
>ignoring the impact as best you could, you dragged yourself to the nearest ditch, and were joined shortly after by your two crewmates.
>curled up in the mud, you covered your ears and waited for whatever bullshit magic weapons system it was this time to destroy your tank.
>after about 30 seconds, it still hadn't arrived, so you uncovered your ears and raised your head slightly.
>you saw a civilian vehicle and a BTR trundled down the dirt road towards you, kicking up a trail of dust as they approached.
>stopping on the point of the road closest to your tank, about a dozen total anthros wearing battle fatigues and carrying AR's formed a group before setting off across the field to where you hid.
>the open farmland around you offered no concealment for you to attempt an escape.
>your crew looked to you for what to do.
>there was only one thing to do.
"HEY!"
>you called out as loud as you could, waving your arms as wide as you could at the group approaching you.
>one of them waved back at you, and motioned for you to stay put as they approached.
>you and your crew climbed up the ditch, and sat on the edge.
>watching as they approached, you saw a group of mixed female anthros.
>your suspicions were confirmed as they got closer, and you saw the patches of the 132nd Home Guards, "The Blue Omegas."
>they chatted loudly to one another as they walked, clearly not afraid of attack.
>still, they gripped their rifles and maintained a loose formation.
>finally reaching you, the leader of the column walked to within a few feet of where you stood.
>she was a large, toned, wolf; a little over 6 foot tall, with black fur that billowed into an impressive mane around her neck.
>she cocked one of her hips, stretching the seam of her combat pants slightly.
>holding the butt of her M4 with one hand, resting it's underslung M203 grenade launcher on her shoulder, she placed the other on her hip.
>being one of the few anthros you had met that was actually taller than you, she met your gaze more easily than most.
>when she spoke, it wasn't to you however.
>she cocker her head slightly to the side, and still holding eye contact with you loudly called back to her squad in an almost radio-announcer voice:
"What's this girls? 3 more humies and HOW MANY BULLETS?!"
"ZERO!"
>they cheered back in unison, their celebration devolving into a general din of whooping and laughing.
>you looked back at the squad leader with a resigned expression.
>what else were were you supposed to do, they had your ass dead-to-rights.
>with your tank immobilized in open terrain, it would have been trivial for them to cook you in that thing had you tried to fight.
"'Aint nuthin better than watchin humies jump outta their tin cans."
>she paused to chuckle slightly as she moved her hand on her hip slightly to release a latch on her belt.
>producing an olive-drab tube with a button rigged to it in an amature fashion.
>pointing its glassy end at the ground next to you, a red spot appeared, and you saw it was laser for some target designation system, crudely modified to run off batteries.
"Especially when you can't even hurt them!"
>her chuckle billowing into a hearty laugh, flicking it on and off a few times before putting it back on her belt.
>your face fell as you realized the trick they had pulled on you.
>they didn't even need to have an AT weapon to convince you to abandon your tank.
>you looked back at it for a moment, as it sat there completely inert.

Oh you want to know about the foundation of our religion?
Very well, sit down child. Many thousands of years ago the human males toiled under the human female hegemony life was hard and many men were killed daily. A fortuitous day arrived when an unknown and incomprehensible figured anthro arrived in the human female hegemony and destroyed it releasing all human males. This prophet had only but a few rules for this religion that is now known as "Anthristianity"
1. human male x anthro females must be united under procreation
2. human females must be destroyed to ensure harmony in the world
3. the only way to the after life is to submit and serve your anthro female wife as best you can and her job is to protect you
4. human men must be controlled for their own good and guided by the anthro females
5. a good anthro female keeps her human male well drained sexually and her womb full as often as possible for that is the holiest way to exist

I have a fun /adhg/ version of Isekai

This gives me a fun of idea
>Rat girl is van'd into another world
>But she ends up just becoming a normal rat in our world
>She tries to live on the streets but cant manage, shes not meant for this life
>Until a young boy finds her weak and scared, and starts taking care of her
>The next couple of months he takes care of her and loves her with all his heart, and she begins to fall in love with him, wishing to actually with him and not just his pet
>Unfortunately though, a war breaks out in his country, and while running away with her in his hands, a stray grenade takes both their lives
>Strangely enough, they wake up in a new world, your typical fantasy ordeal
>Shes back to her usual anthro self, maybe a bit bigger and stronger
>He is the same, but astonished to find his once pet rat looking the way she does, remembering everything he did for her, and is taken aback more by her than what has happend to them
>She explains everything she knows to him, her old old life, her death, her old life with him
>And professes her love to him, and tells him how much she cares about him, talking about how she wished she could be with him and now finally can
>His entire world has been turned upside down, with the only thing from his old life being her, and finds peace and happiness with her around
>He gladly accepts her feelings, they promise to never leave each other and always love one another

>Her pupils are dilated, her eye appearing jet black
>You sense an odd hunger coming from her
"What was that about Lieutenant?"
"Nothing to be concerned about sir."
>You notice that all of your troopers are staring at you with the same hungry expression
"You look tense Padawan."
"Perhaps we can help with that"
>Something is very wrong here, they are acting strangely
"What was the transmission you received, what was it really about."
>You reach into the force to get answers, only to feel a great disturbance
>Alarm, Confusion, disbelief, and an emotion that sends heat from your core running south
>What was going on?
"Don't resist Master~<3"
>They've begun advancing, encircling you in the middle of the clearing
"Stop with this nonsense and tell me what is going on."
"We don't take orders from you anymore Jedi."
"Surrender, it'll be easier."
>You use the force to leap over their ranks, narrowly getting hit by stun blasts
>Almost immediately the platoon is in pursuit, radiating that strange hunger and excitement
"Remember ladies, just like the simulations."
>You need to reach your master fast, preferably before your former soldiers catch you
"For the Republic!"

>Anthro female turns their head sideways and opens their maw
>Goes in for a kiss and sticks their big soft tongue inside their mates mouth while shoving their head forward
>As she exits the kiss she grazes her teeth on her mates cheeks leaving faint red marks

>youre standing there in your door and stare at the giant lizzer woman that is about to clean your house
>thank the nine, the deadra, your jarl and whoever else is responsible for this

>spend the entire day oogling her buttocks
>everytime she tip-toes to reach above your wardrobe her undergarments get revealed

if humans are bred by anthros for a purpose after a few generations they would not know anything beyond that purpose.
it would be accepted that their place was between anthro thighs.
but elite anthros would know the truth, what they had done to human kind, that somewhere out there a wild version of human persists, taunting them to claim it and break it just like the others.

> Place is shady af, but that's why there's no paperwork.... and that's half the reason a human like you can get a job doing something so dangerous
> Other half of the reason is the suit, which you never, EVER take off while you're on the job, no matter how uncomfortable it gets
> Pay is fucking fantastic considering how little time you actually spend in the furnace, too, since it's so dangerous
> None of your coworkers know you're a human, everybody just thinks you're some weird scrawny anthro chick who never talks

>her face is long, even for a canine
>you hesistate to say her face is slim
>proportionately, it is, but her head overall is remarkably larger than yours
>from what is exposed, you can see her fur is pale, sallowed, even
>a light tan on her extremeties that darkens to a rich shade of cedar
>you've seen her hands twice
>they're a similar color to her face
>like her, they're slender, but powerful
>she's tall, she's strong, she can handle herself in the world, deftly so

>she knows that, too
>you think, at least
>it's impossible to tell what's going on in her head

>realistically, you assume she's simply being cautious
>she carries herself effortlessly, but with marked steadiness in her movements
>she's imposing
>the world seems to quiet in her presence
>or maybe you just divert all of your attention towards her
>the scant, precious times you've met, she hasn't said a word to you

>hnnnggghghhhggodfuck
>alright, this is good a time as any, you think
>you've got a gift for her
>now all you need to do is work up the nerve to give it to her

> Anthro societies have some strange rules, sometimes
> One prime example is that human men are forbidden from jogging in public
> Turns out, millions of years of evolutionary instincts are hard to kick
> Absolutely nothing flicks the 'prey' switch in a predator's brain like seeing a human running away
> Wolves, dogs, lions, and tigers in particular have a blanket exemption from any rape charges against humans, if they can prove the human was running away from them at the time
> Of course, they also get locked up shockingly often on the charge of Aiding and Abetting, since they know that law damn well and tend to do everything in their power to trick or encourage men into running... also, just because they get off on it like very little else

>a cold shiver runs down your spine, which you have to suppress
"I do not know anything about any rumors, ma'am."

>god please strike you dead, lest you feel her wrath
>her eyes narrow and she leans in to sniff at the collar of your uniform
>"Rumors regarding you and Lieutenant Thott?"

>there's no way anyone could know about that, right?
>you washed your uniform four times!
"I have not heard anything about that, ma'am."

>"You are coming to my office. Now."

>"She was super interested when I told her about all those little squeak sounds you make when I mating pressed you! Isn't that so cute Patty?"

>she presses down harder and you wheeze
>"But it seems like some discipline is in order."
>the captain releases you from under her boot
>by the time you scrabble to your feet, she's closed and locked the door behind you
>"Lieutenant Thott, restrain the private."
>Thott hops out of the chair and has your arms locked behind your back in an instant
>so much for all that CQC training
>"Got him!"
>Thott's tail wags as she turns you to face the captain

>you slide down the boxers to expose yourself to the captain and Thott

>that hurts worse than the actual cock and ball torture you were momentarily subjected to
>at least Thott seems happy
>"Aw, he's not so bad Patty! Anon is a lot of fun once you get him going!"

>she easily manhandles you across the room, then scoops you up and drops you onto the captain's desk
>papers and pens are sent scattering
>"You'll be cleaning that up, private."
>great
>"Along with any other mess you may make on my desk. Lieutenant Thott, give Private Anon's private some attention."
>she jumps to work cheerfully
>"Yes ma'am!"
>Thott takes your cock in her paw and starts stroking it
>then starts licking at your tip to clean off the pre-cum
>"Private! Pay attention!"
>the captain snaps her fingers for your to look over to her
>"Don't cum. That is a direct order. You understand?"
>you nod
"Yes ma'am."
>the captain nods and then looks to Thott
>"Lieutenant. I want to you make Private Anon cum."
>"Yeshth a-ahm!"
>she tries to speak while still licking at your tip
>thank god your weren't fully in her mouth, she might have forgotten to be careful with her teeth
>Thott jerks you off faster, and massages your balls with her other hand
>you grit your teeth and focus on breathing
>whatever punishment the captain has in store if you fail to follow her orders, you don't want to find out
>but Thott just goes on licking and stroking your cock
>happy just to be playing with you
>the captain stalks around the desk, and drops down into her chair to watch with that same satisfied smirk
>after going for a while, Thott starts takes you fully into her mouth
>it's harder to contain yourself when she gets this excited
>but you do your best just to breath and not thrust into her muzzle
>the captain leans forward to watch your face
>"Where are those oh-so-adorable moans Lieutenant Thott was talking about? Don't hold back on my account, private. I want to hear every little sound you make."
>damn her smug fucking grin
>you let out a small moan when Thott curls her tongue around your tip
>and again when her soft paw gently tugs on your balls
"Fuck..."
>Thott's tail is going a mile a minute
>and your moans only serve to encourage her
>you pluck at the edge of the desk
>you're getting closer, and Thott is getting more enthusiastic
>"Are you gonna do it, private? You gonna blast a load down your lieutenant's throat? You know that's fraternizing. Who knows what kind of punishment I'd have to dream up for such a blatant disregard for regulations."
>the captain laughs cruelly
>"But I love how desperate you are. You just can't control yourself around Lieutenant Thott, can you? She is a pretty young thing, I could see why. Just let go, Anon. Cum in her pretty little muzzle. Earn your punishment~"
>the captains now crooning in your ear
>when you glance to her, you see she's slipped a hand down the front of her pants while she watches you and Thott
>"Keep going Lieutenant Thott! I want to see the face Anon makes when he cums."
>Thott starts to deep-throat you, worked into a frenzy by the captain's words
"Fuck, goddamn fuck..."
>you pant and groan, unable to hold yourself back from your growing climax
>the punishment may be worth it with how hard Thott is working
>she finally presses herself to your base and you buck your hips
>your cock throbs and twitches in her maw while you paint her throat white
>you fall back on the desk, moaning and whimpering
>Thott pulls out once you've finished, and beams up at you
>"That was a big one Anon! Did you like having Patty watch?"
>the captain laughs in your ear
>"I certainly enjoyed watching, Lieutenant. But Private Anon disobeyed a direct order. That means he needs more punishment. Lieutenant Thott, you are going to fuck Anon on my desk until he can no longer walk."
>Thott grins with and hops up to her feet eagerly
>"Yes ma'am!"

Human women in anthro society: Embraced, tolerated, ignored, or hated?
It did occur to me earlier that they actually have some potential as a narrative device in prompts; if they're tolerated by anthro society, then they could potentially wind up as sort of an "ally of convenience" kinda thing where the human woman can move more freely in society than a human man can.
Sets up potential scenarios where a human woman could be an uneasy ally. They'd probably be willing to help a human guy for the right price, in places and ways that an anthro would not.

evil eyes make me weak
>lost in the woods at night
>you spot her glowing eyes in the darkness
>you run like hell but she's still following you
>every time you stop to look around she's right there, stalking you, unblinking gaze and all

>a bright red light just above the top left corner of the cart's heart-monitor screen lit up, and you heard a sharp beeping that rose very rapidly in pitch.
>it sounded like a camera flash was about to go off.
>then it did.
>the sudden electric shock from the defibrillator pads felt like a band-saw being run through your abdomen.
>you shut your eyes cried out involuntarily from the immense pain, as your abdominal muscles contracted involuntarily.
>the muscle spasms rocking your core caused you to fall, bruising your wrists as your weight came down hard onto the cuffs that held you up.
>flashing instantly into a white-hot bubbling plasma, the static screamed in your ears as it seemed to sear the surface of your brain.
>the numbers seemed to swarm your inside your eyes again, no matter how hard you clenched them shut.
>it began to recede just as soon as it had begun, but it was a few moments before the ringing in your ears fully returned to the low white-noise induced by the drugs they gave you.
>panting heavily, you groaned as the shock subsided, just in time for you to catch the tail end of another one of Neva's giggles.
>you slowly opened your eyes again.
>clouded with tears, they wandered blearily around the room as you tried to process what had just happened through the dense fog permeating your thoughts.
>Stoyan's face was completely unchanged, but the increased twitching of his eye betrayed his intensifying disgust.
>you tried to focus, but your brain was still reeling from the pain in your abdomen.
>the feeling of the cuffs digging into your wrists was still completely indistinct from the excruciating ache that beset you.
>it felt as if every fibre of your muscular structure was being pulled apart.
>every one of your joints felt like they were about to be pulled apart under the strain of your own weight.

>you greet her parents and some of their friends, and of course the birthday girl herself, ecstatic to see you here
>you see some of her classmates/your students there and they say hi as well, no yeen girls to be found of course
>you eat, you converse, take a tour of their house, and eventually the party comes to an end

>if the last ride in there had you sweating you were now pissing your pants

>his shit eating grin fell to a look of confusion when he saw who entered however.
>he quickly regained his composure however.
"Lieutenant general Stroyka! I didn't expect you to come see to this personally."
>he said professionally, straightening his back slightly.
"What seems to be problem, major?"
>she asked ignoring his comment and holding his gaze, still not looking at you.
"This scrawny little fuckwit thought he could waltz down here with a req for a teams worth of ammo and a bullshit ID, look at this."
>he threw dirty looks at you as he spoke before gesturing to the 4 pieces of heavy paper that had been your NKVD officers ID.
>Hao walked up to the majors large oak desk and picked up the scrap that had been the top left corner.
>she was still turning it over slowly in her fingers and looking closely at it when she surprised the both of you with what she said next.
"Anon, is this the brand new '1951 pattern NKVD officers identification card' that I had printed for you two weeks ago?"
>the air in the room seemed to flash freeze as the atmosphere suddenly became very tense.
>you could watch the colour draining from his face, his expression underwritten by a subtle note of fear.
"It is."
>was all you needed to answer.
>Hao stopped playing with the paper in her fingers and placed it back down on the table.
>left arm behind her back, she slowly arranged the scraps on the major desk mostly back together as she took her time with her words.
"I thought so. Now, major, I trust you did not destroy the requisition Anon gave you?"
>she didn't wait for an answer before continuing:
"No? I will expect to see it in my car by noon. Will there be any further questions, major?"
>she looked up at him as she finished her puzzle and questioning at the same time.
>a moment of silence passed before she leaned in almost imperceptibly and narrowed her eyes.
"No. Thank you lieutenant general Stroyka."
>he said, looking down at his desk.
"Very good."
>she replied before turning her head sharply towards you.
"Anon?"
>was all she needed, and you stood up to join her.
>she turned to face the door, and held her arm out like a gentleman for you to take
>you didn't feel like you had any choice, no matter how ridiculous it seemed for you to be hanging off the arm of an anthro more than a foot shorter than you.
>taking it, you looked down at her and the smile she was already looking at you with told you all you needed to know about how much she had enjoyed that.

>Go to bed
>Next day, you both overslept.
>Both of you didn't make plans of what you actually want to do today.
"Hey Anon, do you mind if we just drive around for a while? I can show you some spots I really like."
>Agree, because anything is better than nothing.
>Get in her car, drive out of town.
>Hit some rural roads.
>Drive deep into the forrest.
>Realize you're all alone, far away from civilization, with a huge wolfess you still don't know that well.
>Make up scenarios in your head about being murdered by her, get nervous, sweat and your hearts starts pounding
>She puts a paw on your shoulder.
"Are you alright Anon?"
>There's no concern in her voice, instead there's glee, a long wide toothy canine grin on her face.
>You even hear a faint thumps as her is wagging through the tailhole of her car seat.
>Not much later you arrive, it's noon, but the trees towering over you don't let much light shine through.
>There are some parking spots marked with pebbles, but no other cars are parked here.
>You get out of the car, there's no way you can get out of this situation anymore, your nervousness turns into a sick feeling.
"Come on, we're almost there, the fresh air will make you feel better in no time!"
>Again, she didn't sound very concerned.
>Being able to read your emotions, despite trying your best to appear calm, didn't make the situation any better.
>She grabs you by the shoulder, holding you close to her and you begin walking down a path deeper into the forrest.
>Eventually you get off the beaten path, it's hard for you to walk, but she has no trouble walking on the uneven terrain.
>Half an hour later, she stops.
"Uuh, is this your favorite spot? What makes it so special?"
"There's nothing special about it..."
A wide grin across her face, her tail wagging unrestricted and wildly
"..yet!"
>Her large claws are reaching for the neck of your shirt.
>In one swift motion she rips it clean off.
>This happened so sudden, you lose your balance and fall forward towards her.
>She catches you with her other paw and pushes you back upright.
"I don't want to see you on the ground already Anon... you have two minutes."
She buries her large muzzle deep into the remains of your shirt.
"Tw-Two minutes for what?"
You stammer in response.
>Instead of answering you directly, you hear her taking a few deep breaths through her nose, followed by growling.
>That's all you needed to hear.
>You turn around and run for it.
>There always was a risk of befriending a predator species anthro, but you didn't want to believe she of all people would go this far.
>Scary stories passed around, all having gruesome endings, which you always passed off as some angry speciest ramblings.
>But now you're running for your life with no idea where to go.
>Suddenly you hear her howl far away, you must have gotten much further than you thought, but the time she's given you must also be up now.
>Low hanging branches bruise your exposed skin as you keep running, some even giving you tiny cuts.
>Quick and heavy footsteps announce that she's coming closer.
>There's no chance you could outrun her, much less so here.
>In a desperate maneuver, you hide behind a particularly wide tree.
>Her footsteps get louder, before they suddenly come to a stop.
>You hear a few audible sniffs from her again, the leaves under her paw crunching as she homes in on your hiding spot.
>Your heart is almost beating out of your chest, knowing she has you now you carefully step around the tree and...
>There's hardly anything "anthro" left in her face, her lips are peeled up into a snarl, exposing all of her sharp teeth, ready to tear into you.
>The sight of your friend looking at you like a piece of meat was too much, you scream and pull off one final sprint with all of your remaining strength.
>But it was futile, she was right behind you and was one final leap the chase was over.
>Lying on the ground, with your face buried into a pile of leaves, you await the moment that will rip your life away.
>She forcibly turns you around, now with you on your back, you're face to face with her.
>That feral stare from earlier has subsided back into her canine grin from earlier.
"You're all mine now!"
>She exclaimed.
>Mustering you up as you layed helpless on the ground, her eyes quickly focussed on your wounds from the chase, which now has some blooddrops running down from them.
"Aaaw, Anon, teasing me with your taste already? We should save that for later, but if you insist."
>Her tongue is gingerly lapping up your blood, giving you a strange, yet pleasing burning sensation as she reaches your cuts.
"So, that's how you taste like? I can't wait for my second helping."
>She slips one of her massive paws under your head, and gently pulls it towards her own.
>Her maw tilts and opens wide, in a shocked reponse your mouth opens, but you don't have time to gasp anymore.
>Sharp teeth are wrapping around your face, applying just enough pressure to feel them, but not to pierce your skin.
>But what really has your attention now, is her long tongue forcing itself into your mouth.
>After a while it stops feeling like she's trying to keep you down inside yourself, but something passionate.
>This wistful moment lasts for a while, but comes to an end as she opens her maw again to releasse you and pull her tongue back.
"I see that really got you excited"
>Your massive erection is bulging your pants.
>She presses one of her pawpads down on it, shifting it back and forth.
"Really excited"
>Both of her paws are now on your pants, digging her claws into it, she rips the fabric apart.
>With another swift pull your boxer are torn off too, your dick now springing up freely.
>But before you can even begin to feel the cool air of the forest on it, she already planted her lower lips on it.
>They're dripping wet, you can feel her fluids run down your member onto your legs already.
>She grinds on your shaft, exploring your entire length.
>Satisfied, she lets it rise up again, before pushing down on it with her weight.
>Briefly you can feel the pressure building up, right before it practically launches into her.
>Her tight wet walls are encasing you.
>She remained like this for a while, just enjoying the sensation of you being inside her.
>Like a switch being flipped, her face turned back into the beast that chased you through the forest.
>Instead of a slow buildup, she slammed her heavy hips into yours forcefully in a quick pace.
>You tried to hold yourself back like your life depended on it.
>Too afraid of what was to come once this act took it's end.
>She panted heavily as her moans became louder, grabbing one of your hands and holding it tightly.
>You knew what was coming and you knew you couldn't resist it.
>Her inner walls became tighter and started greedily pumping for your seed.
>Nothing could stop you from releassing your seed deep into her.
>She lunged forward, her teeth aiming for your neck, you knew this was coming all along and braced yourself for the end.
>Her teeth sank deep into your shoulder.
>The sensation of intense pain and pleasure overtook all your senses.
>With what you thought to be your final moments, you bucked your hips into her, getting all you could out of your shared orgasm.
>But the pain subsided.
>She collapsed onto you, burying you in her fur.
>Her teeth already releassed, she lovingly tended to your fresh wounds with her tongue.
>You faintly remember something about wounds like the one on your shoulder being something good now.
>With little strength remaining, you wrap your arms around the wolf ontop of you and hug her tightly.
>In reponse she nuzzles her snout into your face passionately.
"You're all mine now Anon, now and forever."

>they lose their powers with their virginities
>also the villainesses and monster beast women gain power from taking magical boy's virginities
>so throw in shenanigans of magical boys being beaten and snu snud and also situations of them in normal modes trying not to lose their v-cards to regular anthro girls/women too
>maybe some fun of some of the villains/monsters being the boy's teachers, anthro step siblings, friends, etc as their alter egos they turn into

>Anon didn't really have any fancy names for himself
>All he said was that he was just some fella who liked to play the guitar every now and then
>An incredibly humble man
>In an incredible situation
>Anon was world renowned as a singer, all by himself
>A guitar, stool, and a microphone
>And he did what he enjoyed doing
>Play and sing, and the world loved it
>A human singer? Who wasn't a gimmick or the lover of a band member?
>So unusual, yet just as wonderful
>Songs of life, of love, of longing, of sadness, it could be anything
>And it was the final of a performance
>"So far, so far away..."
>The guitar faded away as he stopped, for the crowd to go into uproar, yet another masterpiece
>As he smiles and waves, he exits into the back, to meet his agent
>A big and intimidating lioness, yet with a surprising heart of gold
>"Anon, dear! That was amazing!"
"Thanks Anisa! It was nice as always, got a big cheer today, it was pretty sweet."
>"You know, Anon, would you mind if we chatted in my office? It's important."
>Anisa and Anon went off, talking about his songs, his lyrics, and his longing for home
>Anisa knew that feeling as much as he did, being on tour for so long was tiring, it had to stop soon, or they'd be too burnt out to do much of anything
"So uh, what'd you want to talk about?"
>"Well... Anon, I'm going to be honest with you. I'm tired. This touring, it's driving me nuts, just about as much as you keep ignoring my hints."
"Huh?"
>"Anon, I love you. You're a kind and wonderful man. I've hear you sing all day long, and I hear that pain in your voice. I'm here for you."
"Y-you want me? Really?"
>"Anon, you'll be mine, safe and sound. A wife who'll give you the love you finally want. Just on one condition."
"What is it?"
>"You follow lion tradition. I'm the one in charge, so we're going home, fucking until you sleep for a day straight, and then some. Might even do that kinky stuff you have in your diary, like putting a collar on you."
"Hey!"
>"You kept it out in the open. What do you say?"
"Yes."
>Anisa picked Anon up, and got to the nearest train home
>That girl, she stuck true to her word, lemme tell you
>And that's why Anon retired, wealthy with one hell of a wife.

>Sergeant keeps calling you "Schwuchtel".
>You're the only one in your troupe she addresses like that.
>Get assigned to help her guard an abandoned building.
>Still doesn't call you by name or rank.
>Snap and tell her to stop calling you like that.
>She takes off her pants and commands you to earn it.
>Eat her ass.
>Don't touch anything else.
>You now earned the title of the "Oberschwuchtel".

>You just want to move out.
>Doesn't matter where.
>Find an extremely cheap appartement.
>It's on "Pack Street", sounds like you might encounter some anthros there.
>Doesn't matter, rent is cheap enough to be worth it.
>Realize you moved into a neighbourhood exclusively consisting of predator anthros.
>You're unfamiliar with their social dynamics, so you keep yourself locked inside your home most of the time.
>Your new job is a good distance away, which just gives you more excuses to avoid interacting with them.
>This goes on for a while
Too much exposition, sorry, fuck this, read Pack Street, fuck you Marty.
>You find yourself on the community couch of the lobby inside your appartement building.
>Avo, the tall and slender, black furred jackal with amber eyes sits on the other side of the couch with you.
>You're watching some kind of gameshow.
>Humans are challenged to remain calm while anthros are trying to scare them.
>All contestants are failing horribly.
"Oh come on, she wasn't even doing anything yet! You furs are pulling worse stuff on me all the time, and I don't even flinch."
>You berate the TV like it would help to make the show any better.
"Anymore..."
>She replies smugly
"We had to drag you out of your little hole before you even spoke to us, if you were in that show back then, you wouldn't even make it past the audition, Skinny.
>You turn yourself away from the TV to look directly at her.
"Oh shut up you... Mutt"
You said the last word in a hushed voice, knowing if the wrong kind of Anthro heard you, you'd get a fured fist buried in your face.
"I just didn't want to make an ass of myself, I was never scared of any of you."
>She now also stops paying attention to the show and looks you directly in your eyes.
"Bull. Shit. I could scare you stiff, right fucking now if I wanted to."
>She replied sharply in a threatening tone.
"Pffft. I'd like to see you try furgirl."
>Faster than you could process it, she got into position to pounce you and jumped from the other side of the couch.
>You could briefly see her barred fangs, but one blink of an eye later, she already was ontop of you.
>Her entire weight was pushing you down into the couch, giving you no chance to escape.
>The sharp teeth, now out of your sight, were wrapped around you neck.
>In the corner of your eye you could only make out one of her amber eyes, starring back at you like a hungry beast.
>She growled deeply, like a wolf refusing to let go of it's prey.
>You could feel her hot breath dampening your skin.
>She remained in this position for a while, with you staying completely silent.
>Her growling grew even louder and she bit down hard enough to make you feel how sharp her teeth were.
>That drove you over the edge, too much to pretend none of this had any effect on you.
"Aaaah, Avo!"
>You moaned.
>She instantly pushed herself back up on you and sat a good distance away from you.
"Fuck! Skinny! You're one of those?!"

>Come home
>close door behind you
>feel a hefty weight hit you on your back causing you to fall on your stomach
>weight is still on your back while your on the floor
>get flipped onto your back
>see your wolf wife's piercing eyes looking into yours
>realise you have been pounced on
>one of her many ways of greeting you
>she starts vigorously kissing every corner of your face
>moves to your neck and throat
>kissing turns to nibbling
>realise where this is going
>realise the cookie is coming soon
>realise your about to get wolfed
>in your final moments you do as you always do before getting wolfed by your wife
>you accept your fate
>you embrace the wolf

>Grim news
>The anthro soldiers have taken refuge in your small village
>The war was just something on the news until a week ago
>But now they're here.
>You've done your best to avoid them so far.
>There were rumors they were kidnapping men.
>So you kept yourself to narrow alleys until you were sure you were alone again.
>But when you tried to cross the main street, one of them found you.
>She was on a motorcycle, so there was no chance you could outrun her
>Which would've been a bad idea anyways
>You heard they only get more excited if you run from them
>So you decided to remain dead still.
>She drove right towards you, slowing down as she noticed ou weren't moving and stopped almost right next to you.
>Her back was turned towards you now and you were able to get a good look of her back.
>From the long snout and the wagging tail, you could tell she was some kind of canine.
>She remained like this for a moment, before turning her head 180° degrees to look at you.
>With the odd helmet she wore, it was impossible to see her eyes, but she remained dead silent.
>You didn't dare to move either, avoiding anything she could take offense to.
>Suddenly, she began moving, clumsily getting off the motorcycle.
>She fell straight to the ground.
>She still wasn't moving.
>She was dead.
>Oh right, heads don't turn that far.

>Find cute humie
>Talk to him?
NO
>Mastermind sabotage his life to get him in massive debt.
>Wait until creditor gives up and sells the debt contract.
>Dump a huge sum of money into this yourself.
>Reveal yourself to be behind it all, now humie has to work for you!
>Humie is pissed and files for bankruptcy instead.
or
>Humie is pissed, works until the debt is settled, fucks off

>annoying nocturnal fox neighbor
>always asking you for stuff like sugar and to come over to eat at midnight
>wakes you up knocking on the door at 3 AM
>open the door enraged and tell her to fuck off
>her shock quickly turns into a snarl as she bares her teeth
>overpowers you trying to close the door
>"I guess playing Miss Nice Neighbor doesn't work if you can't take a hint."

>living in a carnivore neighborhood on the same block with wolf, fox, hyena, and cat anthros
>during a block party you decide to cook, because it's your hobby
>invite the neighbors over for barbecue
>the single women all stare as you serve up burgers, hot dogs, grilled kielbasa and chicken
>they stare harder as you bring out the pork spare ribs that were on the smoker overnight, cooking slow over mesquite and hickory
>start getting awkward but sweet anonymous love notes through your house's mail slot while you're at work
>and it's not just one person, the handwriting is varied, and you are getting half a dozen a day
>the neighborhood women all start flirting with you, some of them very aggressively
>just yesterday you saw a wolf and a hyena anthro fighting in your driveway, and they weren't emotional teenage girls, either, one of them was old Mrs. Barrister, she has to be pushing fifty
>mention it to a dog anthro coworker
>he starts laughing
>you ask him to explain
>he whoops with laughter until you think he's having a stroke
>eventually he calms down and can speak again
>he explains to you that in some carnivore cultures offering several kinds of meat to potential mates in a meal has connotations of which you were unaware
>it's symbolic, it means you're a really good hunter
>it's a demonstration that you're capable of providing well for a wife and cubs
>it's also a tacit statement that you're single and ready to mingle
>and you now have two dozen single anthro women, from college girls to spinster aunts in age, thinking you're coming on to them
>all of them were there at the same time, and they know they aren't the only ones
>you appear to have accidentally issued a challenge for them all to fight to prove themselves worthy to be your waifur
>unless you're willing to have a harem
>you just wanted to grill
>wat do?

>it was just shy of two months that she was gone, but the Emily who came back was more different that you could have expected after 2 decades apart.
>she didn't even call herself "Emily" any more, just "Sargent."
>still, her voice hadn't changed, and it was undeniably still her underneath all that fur and muscle.
>even her eyes still looked at you the same way, despite having changed to a deep golden yellow.
>her personality was almost exactly the same too, but it had taken on a distinct aggressive edge.
>there had always been some weird romantic tension between the two of you, but you were never interesting in being as much of a pursuer as your society typically expected of men.
>you liked her, but the idea of trying to confess to her always felt like a bad one, even if there were signs she was trying to hide the same feeling.
>it was probably a mistake anyway, you saw how hard she fought for what she wanted, if she was interested in a relationship, she would have let you know.
>that tension was completely gone the very night she came back however.
>taking the time off that evening to catch up as a gang, she always seemed to find her way next to you on the couch, or standing behind you with a hand on your shoulder.
>by the time it had come for everyone to finally go to bed, it was clear that her assertive new bent was enough to make her leave traditional courtship rules behind completely.
>you were sitting on the couch next to her as everyone got up to leave for the enlisted barracks, but she grabbed the back of your shirt as you did so.
>not looking at you, she waved goodnight to the rest of the squad as she held you on the couch.
>they were most of the way to the door before one of them noticed you were still on the couch, and one of them called to you, alerting the others.
"You comin' Anon?"
>still completely flustered by the sudden show of force after the hours of teasing, Sargent answered for you.
"Oh no. He's coming with me. Goodnight boys."
>a cheer erupted from the group.
>they were clearly not surprised by the development, even if they didn't expect it to take Emily being turned into an almost 8' tall wolf monster to finally get you two together.
>you blushed hard and looked at the floor as they made various jokes alluding to bones and you "being dog food" and the like, but it was impossible to hide your embarrassed smile.
>still hooting and hollering they filed out the door and down the hallway.
>their laughter was starting to fade by the time you looked back up at Sargent.
>she was already grinning down at you, and her smug expression was notably marked by the eyes of a predator.
>it wasn't fear that made you weak at the knees however, the hunger on her face made you feel more desired than anything you could have asked for.
"Shall we?"
>she asked, and you assumed that meant she was asking you to stand.
"s-sure."
>you managed with only a slight stammer before moving to stand up.
>your momentum carried on upwards past your upright position, and Sergeant took you by surprise, lifting you into a bridal carry.
>you looked up at her, way up.
>her ears were very close to brushing the ceiling, but there was still 2-3 centimeters clearance.
>the massive hundesoldatin looked down at you, but for the first time, her expression seemed less than sure of herself.
"A-Anon..."
>it was her turn to stammer now.
"I-I can tell that you don't m-mind... w-well... uh..."
>she trailed off but you picked up her sentence.
"Mind that you're a giant wolf-lady whos head is longer than my forearm?"
>you asked jokingly, hoping to reassure her, but she looked away and started wringing her hands nervously.
"Y-yea, that."
>she confirmed, but continued, elaborating on the source of her anxiety.
"W-well. T-the half w-wolf part doesn't just s-stop under my clothes."
>you hadn't really thought of that, but you stopped to consider for a moment.
>Sargent seemed to freeze solid for a moment as a look of consideration sat on your face for three or four seconds.
>you pursed your lips and nodded approvingly to yourself slightly, and you saw her unfreeze, slightly relieved, but not relaxed.
"We've been close friends for almost half our lives at this point, I want this just as bad as you do E-uh, Sargent."
>you corrected yourself, it being difficult to internalize the name change of someone you'd known so long.
"As long as there's no new teeth down there too, I'm sure I'll manage."
>you continued to joke, humor always being your default technique when you tried to cheer her up.
>this seemed to put her mind significantly more at ease now, but a distinct note of apprehension still hung in her voice.
"I-If you're sure, Anon. I-I.. W-well, nothing for it."
>she undid her belt and button above her tail, but paused to take a breath and steel herself before pushing down all her lower garments to her ankles.
>she put her hands over her snout, one in front of the other in an attempt to hide her embarrassment.
>it was less of a shock than you expected however as she straightened up, and stood with her legs slightly apart.
>her pussy wasn't quite what you'd expected, but it was still thankfully mostly human.
>it was far more of an external feature than any human one, but it the structure of the entrance and clitoral features were normal.
>you could see a glint of light reflecting off the droplet at the end of a small string of wetness dangling from it.
>it was clear that she was incredibly aroused, no matter how nervous she was.
"W-well?"
>she asked, not taking her hands off of her snout where they covered her eyes.

>have long distance relationship with anthro from Finland
>she has a weird sense of humor but she's fun
>finally meet
>she has an enormous grin all the time
>keeps saying "bergele" and "gib benis" and grabbing your groin
>also asks whether you prefer Conk or Bepis
>you are deebly goncerned
>wat do?

>it was late evening in the half ruined city.
>the combined shelling and aerial bombardment had left portions of it almost flat, but other areas remained relatively untouched.
>house to house fighting had been required to finally dislodge the defenders, but only a toe hold on the far eastern edge remained now.
>your squad had taken part in the initial fighting to establish control of the outer suburbs, but fresh units were brought forward for the deep urban combat.
>overestimating the enemies stockpiles of food and ammunition, high command had prepared for a much tougher nut, and the initial shock troops almost outran their supplies.
>the main force was sent in a week ahead of schedule, and by the end of week 3, you had been redeployed to a sector on the south-southeastern edge of the city.
>with no known hostile forces or even major settlements in that direction, you mostly there to form a continuous front line around the city in case the enemy tried a very wide flank.
>however, the performance you had seen so far in defense of the city made you doubt that the enemy had the fuel to accomplish the maneuver.
>the sheer unlikelihood of attack from the direction you watched led to a very relaxed atmosphere among the battalion.
>orders from the Colonel allowed a very light watch to be held, and your lieutenant even allowed for 4 hours of non-designated time in the evenings.
>so there you sat in the basement of one of the mostly intact houses with the other 7 members of your squad.
>the selection process at the academy always ensured that, at least on the level of those you interacted with day-to-day, everyone was at least polite to those they had to work with.
>being a basic infantry squad, you found yourself serving with those you had been friends with in school.
>one of you managed to make Sargent, and filled out her squad with the rest of the gang, and that was that.
>Emily was a fairly athletic tomboy, and the only girl in your friend group.
>always having something to prove, she wasn't the brightest of the officer candidates, but her sheer tenacity had seen her across the finish line.
>you had all been barely twenty years old when you graduated, but that was a few years ago by now.
>things went pretty much as expected for everyone, being assigned a space in the barracks, a more permanent uniform, and all the other things that came with full enlistment.
>that was except for one of you.
>the day after your graduation, Emily excitedly told you guys that she had been asked to participate in a medical trial for women in combat roles.
>always anxious for an opportunity to distinguish herself, she had gladly accepted on the spot, and would be temporarily transferred the next day.
>you joked together that she was leaving her squad on the first day, giving her a hard time as friends do, but you were all happy for her.
>it was just shy of two months that she was gone, but the Emily who came back was more different that you could have expected after 2 lifetimes apart.
>she didn't even call herself "Emily" any more, just "Sargent."

>she carried you out the same door that everyone else had left through, but turned to the right instead of continuing straight down the hall like they did.
>you had passed few people on your way to her quarters, but those you did had reactions ranging from double-takes to blatant slack-jawed staring as she carried you by.
>as Sargent had explained to everyone earlier, she was part of one of the first batches of "Hundesoldatin," the product of a genetic engineering program to create more capable soldiers.
>she was one of the first in the world, and definitely the first one in your garrison, so she was still catching people off guard everywhere she went.
>you tried not to look like the carrying part was your idea, but it was difficult to hide how much you enjoyed just being held in her arms.
>the extra weight she held was no encumbrance at all, and it wasn't long before you reached the recently renovated section of the officers barracks.
>her room was slightly larger than most of the others, but the custom furniture that had been made for her large frame meant that there was less overall floor space.
>she put you down on her bed, and stepped back.
>rather than laying flat as she had set you down, you sat up, turned, and swung your legs off the side of the bed to sit on the edge.
>you looked up at her, way up.
>her ears were very close to brushing the ceiling, but there was still 2-3 centimeters clearance.

>you stare at her loins and-
>well, she wasnt lying
>a weird mixture of human and canine, puffed out slightly, but still a familiar slit.
"W-well?"
>she asked, not taking her hands off of her snout where they covered her eyes.
>you didn't care, if you had liked her before, the sudden desire she had shown for you sent you head over heels.
"You're still the prettiest girl in the world to me. Wolf head or not."
>telling her your feelings for the first time out loud felt strange, but she had clearly felt the tension between you as well.
>her ears half perked up, and she cracked her fingers slightly to reveal peek out with one of her golden eyes.
"Y-You mean it, Anon?"
>she asked, looking to see if your expression was genuine.
"I do. c'mere."
>you nodded, beckoning her towards you with a full handed motion.
>she came over and knelt in front of you as her arms fell to her sides, and you could now meet her gaze at eye level.
>reaching out and pushing your fingers into her mane just behind her jaw, you started to scratch the sides of her neck gently.
>you had intended to start speaking again as you did so, but Sargent's eyes widened momentarily, surprised by the effect that your touch had on her.
>it really was only a moment of surprise though, and a look of bliss spread across her face as she melted into you.
>her large snout nuzzled your head as it pushed past, and the weight of her chin on your shoulder caused you to collapse backwards into the bed.
>it was a little difficult to breathe with the weight of her torso on you, but her soft warm chest on top of you was so worth it.
>still running your fingers through her mane, and lightly scratching at her neck you continued with what you had intended to say before.
"I loved you as Emily, and I still love you as Sargent. Frankly I'm embarrassed I forced you to make the first move."
>you said slightly breathlessly from underneath her.
>she pushed herself up and off of you slightly, but your hands stayed in her fur.
"I-I don't know what to say, Anon."
>she looked down at you, happy tears starting to well in her eyes.
"You don't have to say anything. We have the moment."
>reassuring her, you pulled her back down gently, and she obliged, resting most of her weight on you again.
>nuzzling her chin and cheek into your neck as you pet her mane, the two of you enjoyed each others closeness for the first time.
>after a few minutes however, you noticed her pulling herself backwards, but only slightly.
>the cool end of her snout brushed against your ear, and she stopped, pressing into the side of your head, she inhaled deeply.
>taking a solid whiff of your scent, you thought you saw a trace of that instinct in her eyes again.
"I'm sorry Anon, I just couldn't help myself."
>she apologized, but you contradicted her.
"No, don't. I, uhh... kinda like it when you act like a... predator."
>embarrassed, you said the last word very quietly.
>Sargent's ears perked up a little as you did so, and she slid further backwards off of you after a moment.
>picking herself up to kneel in front you you again, you sat up to follow her.
>She looked nervous, in a different, almost giddier way this time.
"I-I mean, I guess I could..."
>she glanced around a little, and began gently wringing her hands again, but stopped suddenly when you brought your hands up and cupped them either side of her rear jaw.
>you held her head up, and the way that her golden eyes locked with yours made you feel like the luckiest man in the world.
"It's okay. We'll get there."
>you said, holding her gaze for a moment.
"N-No, it's t-totally-..."
>she started excitedly, but trailed off as she seemed to realize the truth to your words.
>lowering her head back down again slightly, you planted a kiss on the short, soft fur just behind the edge of her nose.
>she drew a long sigh as you pulled your head back to meet her eyes again.
"Y-You're right. We'll get there. I-I just need..."
>regaining her composure for a moment, she stuttered again as struggled to admit how badly she needed release.
>understanding her without words, you likewise didn't need to speak to communicate your willingness to proceed.
>taking your hands from where they held her head, you leaned back slightly, and planted them wide on the large bed behind you.
>smiling in a vaguely confident way, you shifted back and forth slightly as you spread your legs apart.
>quickly realizing your intention, she lunged forwards clumsily.
>it wasn't aggressive, but it was certainly eager the way she bumped the large flat top of her head into your chest.
>her ears were long enough that they brushed into your face as she almost pushed you over.
>holding the entire length of her snout and forehead against your torso, you felt the tip of her nose grazing the fabric.
>you had been feeling the increased bloodflow down there since she had first dropped her pants, but the heartfelt conversation had distracted you from your immediate desires.
>it was just the two of you now though, and your pants quickly began to strain under the swelling that her gentle nuzzling induced.
>she had closed her eyes, and was pressing her nose into the base of your shaft from one side, inhaling deeply through her nose.
>you felt your breath catch as you began to pant, the lust that had been simmering beneath the the surface of the rooms atmosphere boiling over.
>her golden eyes opened slowly as she exhaled your scent, and the request they made was crystal clear.
>withdrawing her head slightly as you reached down, you had enough room to adjust your pants slightly as you lowered your fly.
>undoing the button afterwards, the waistline of your pants popped open, but your shaft was still tucked down one of your pant legs.
>letting her do the honors, you put your hands back out behind you, reclining again.
>her eyes lit up, and she sat up on her knees again, as she realized the reveal you left for her.
>you hadn't even finished sitting back on your hands before she had grabbed your pantlegs, bluntish claws pressing into your skin.
>pulling them down in jerking motions, one leg at a time, she watched greedily as each tug revealed another inch or so of your shaft.
>her expression of hunger intensified with each tug, as it failed to reveal your tip.
>it was a little awkward for her to take the last tug or two, clearly expecting to be done pulling by now.
>a look of surprise spread across her face as her efforts were rewarded though, and her eyes seemed unable to look away as your roughly 8" member flopped out, wobbling a little as it stood to attention.
>Sargent seemed almost hypnotized by the cock in front of her, and you suspected that her old human hormones and new wolf instincts had gotten the better of her.
>frozen for a moment, she watched it sway almost to a halt, but it didn't quite have time to come to rest before she lunged again.
>mouth falling open, her tongue flopped out she dipped her head down to lick your the base of your shaft.
>the size of her head meant that by the time the stroke of her tongue had reached the underside of your head, you could still feel its length sliding along your base.
"O-Oh! S-Sargent..."
>you sat up as you started in surprise at the intensity of the feeling of her tongue, warm and soft across the sensitive skin between your legs.
>it was your turn to melt into her as she closed her lips around the tip.
>slumping forwards slightly, you rested a little of your weight against the same flat area on top of her head she had pushed into you a moment ago.
>her head was large enough to fill most of your arms when you embraced it alone when you wrapped your arms around it.
>the soft fur of her snout ran down the front of your uniform as she easily took your entire length in her mouth.
>moaning as she pulled back towards the end of your cock, your hands found places to rest behind her ear and on her neck.
>leaning further into her, she easily held your weight up against her very sturdy frame.
>taking you back down to the base, she began bobbing up and down in shorter, faster strokes, keeping all but an inch or so of your dick in her mouth the entire time.
>you jostled up and down in time with her sucking as you leaned on her more and more, scratching at the skin below the fur that entangled your fingers.
>being held in her mouth like that was so soft and warm, and despite the slightly inexpert way she gave her first blowjob, it wasn't long before you were getting close.
"S-Sargent... I-... I'm gonna-..."
>you tried to warn her in time, but there was no need, as she gave a few more enthusiastic strokes before pushing herself to the base.
>pressing you to the roof of her mouth with her wide soft tongue, she rubbed it side to side across the underside of your entire length.
>that was your breaking point, and you gripped into the fur behind her neck and shoulders, pulling yourself into the top of her head as you came.
>shooting the load towards the back of her throat, she had to swallow several times to get all of it.
>it was several seconds before you stopped gently bucking into her mouth involuntarily, but you fell back onto the bed with a long sigh after you did so.
>Sargent was kneeling up again, looking down at you staring at the ceiling with a supremely satisfied look on her face.
>licking her lips slightly, she stood up, towering over you again as she undid the front of her uniform.
>letting it fall to the floor around her, she took the bottom of her undershirt with one of her clawed fingers, and pulled it up and over her in a single graceful motion.
>the stripping hundesoldatin in front of you had pulled your attention away from the ceiling, and you watched her relatively modest breasts fall out as she disrobed.
>it's not like they were small by normal means, but her wide shoulders threw the scale off a little.
>there wasn't much time for you to get a good look however, as she was on top of you again almost before her undershirt hit the floor.
>pressing her nose into the base of your neck, she took another deep sniff at the collar of your uniform.
"Take it off, Anon."
>her voice shook slightly with her shuddering exhale, but it was clear that she knew what she wanted.

It would do more damage due to what a shortage of men in that time period/tech level of the setting since men would be the ones doing jobs that would help fight of the wolves. Also female beast/monster that can breed with humans is way more scary than the usual male rape monsters due to dynamic of pregnancies. A single captured human guy could theoretically impregnate a whole tribe of female rape monsters, but with a human woman and male rape monsters the woman can only get pregnant once and the monsters have to wait or go get more which can lead to them getting caught/found out. And since human men make up the vast majority of soldiers every conflict with the beasts would be giving them more men to use even if they decisively lost since all they need to spring back up is just one guy.

You guys were a hit with everyone at the game earlier today.
The players had been drinking heavily and parting all night.
You had been bench pressed by multiple gorgeous, muscular anthros in the last hour alone.

>"so thats why she spreads toothpaste on her f- hey! earth to Anon, you ain't floating in a tin can are you?" she says as soon as she tooks notice of your 'thinking stare'.
Yeah I was just thinking
>"Well about time you filled that empty head of yours with something"
>You would take a slight offense if you didn't respond with 'nothing' 9/10 times when she asked you what you were thinking at the moment.
So I was thinking-
>"How do feral tigers camouflage if they're brigth orange?"
What? no, It IS about other species though
>"No I don't use my pouch as a coin purse, it feels weird"
What? No I wanted to ask, You ever think about feral opossums? isn't it weird to have little versions of you rumaging through trash? kinda hasn't leaved my head since this morning
>"Never gave it much thought to be honest and I think most anthros don't do either"
I guess so
>She looks around for a bit, and then her "Let's do dumb shit smile" curls in her face
>"Here, follow me" she says as she drags you into a back alley
>She then jumps into a thankfully empty trash container, the lid falling making a loud noise, this didn't surprise you, which really says a lot about your relationship
>She suddenly opens the lid
>"Hey cutey wanna, eat some trash?" she says in a raspy voice
...We get home and you take a shower
>"Aight, but you'll help me wash my fur"
>Fair deal

Better idea:
>walking down street with possum gf
>she sees a bunch of yeens and drops dead to feign death
>yeens proceed to rape you while she watches and fights her instincts to stay dead

Tips for looking after your new human husband!
>In human culture, men are conditioned to take the lead, which can cause friction when integrated into our society. Be prepared for your husband to feel down or unworthy, and make sure to remind him that he doesn't need to worry about those things anymore
>On a related note, human men respond very well to compliments! Tell him how attractive he is!
>It's natural for men to be apprehensive when it comes to consummating their new marriage. >Take charge, take it slow and make him feel good. You can always speed up later.

>"In the event that the human attempts to strike you, keep in mind that they are extremely unlikely to injure you. You may be tempted to retaliate with equal force. Do not. You are much more capable of severely wounding them than you may realize. In this situation, simply grab the human by the wrists, forearms, bicep, or shoulder and keep them in place until their anger passes. And it will!"

"Send pic."
>Excuse me?
"Please be so kind and send a picture of yourself, I don't want to let anthros that roam this site for "prey" know where I live."
>Sure, give me a moment.
>You attach "applicationfullres.png"
Nice try furgirl, you just grabbed this from your company's server, didn't you?
>No, that's actually me.
"Alright, send me a shirtless one then."
>Dude, what?
Just for my own safety, I assure you.
>Your sense clouded by the lack of sleep, you take off your shirt and snap a photo of yourself and send it to John Smith.
"Marvelous!"
"Now send me another one without your pants!"
"Haha, just joking, when can you move in?"
>The state pretty much just kicked me out, I more or less have two days now, is that alright with you?
"Sure man, I work from home so come over anytime, here's the address:
>The moving truck dumps you and your few belongins out infront of your new home.
>You heave everything up and head inside.
>But when you arrive at the appartement door there's something wrong.
>The name plate doesn't read "John Smith", but instead it's "Scarlett Renarde"
>Before you can ring the doorbell, the door already swings open.
"Anon! You're even more handsome than in your pictures!"
>A tall and slender Vixen is leaning against the doorframe, beckoning you to come inside with one of her paws.
"Uh, sorry, I'm supposed to meet up with a John Smith..."
>She steps around you and hastily pushes you inside.
"Let's talk about this inside sweetie."
"I'm pretty sure that's ilegal."
>You're appalled, as it turns out, "John Smith" reverse catfished you into moving in with her.
"Oh Sweetie, it's not like I'm trapping you here, you haven't even signed anything yet, you're free to leave anytime."
>A toothy grins forms across her snout.
"But you just used the state provided moving service to come here didn't you? Do you have the cash to pay for it this time?"
>You sigh.
"Just show me my room."
>She slides a piece of paper and a pen across the table you both sat down at.
"It's not your room quite yet, just sign this rental agreement and you can call this place your home."
>You quickly skim through it, everything seems fine and she didn't even take the chance to jack up the rent.
>You sign it.
"Marvelous, Anon! I'm sure I won't regret it"
>She croons into your ear
>When did she get so close?
"Uuuh, don't you mean..."
>Her smile widens
"You'll have to find that out yourself."
>A little later, you finally get into in your new room.
>You put down your belongings in a corner.
>And open the box containing your clothes, you don't have the energy to unpack everything right now, but there's enough left in you to fill the dresser.
>Your shirts, pants and two jackets don't even fill half of it, a sign this wasn't made for a "single" man.
>Taking in the rest of your room now too, all of the furniture is clearly of a higher grade than you're used to.
>Especially the bed catches your eye, it's big enough to lie in it diagonally.
>Speaking of which, staying up all night to find a new place to stay and moving in the morning has drained you.
>A short nap was something your body craved right now.
>You slipped into more comfortable attire, turned out the lights and lied down.
>It was so soft, it didn't take you long to starting drifting away to sleep.
>But before you were out for good, the creaking of your door handle brought you back.
>Scarlett, scantily covered in a red see through dress which just barely hung off her shoulders, headed straight towards your bed.
>She gracefully sat down on the edge of the bed and in one motion lied down and slipped her slender right under blanket, brushing her fur against the skin of your own.
>Her extended arm slipped a paw under your shirt, pressing her soft paw pads against your chest.
>The big toothy grin from earlier decorated your snout again.
"No."
>You dryly told her.
"What?"
>Her sharp teeth disappeared with the grin on her face.
"Come on Anon, I'm just trying to make you feel welcome in your new home"
>She now slowly rubs her paw on your chest.
>You grab her wrist and pull it out from under your shirt.
"Scarlett, I said no"
>Her expression turned into a scowl, showing she wasn't happy with your rejections.
"Playing hard to get darling? Didn't take you for one of those, but I can play along."
>She tore free from your grasp and instead held your own wrist now.
>A leg moved over your chest and shortly afterwards she sat on your lap pinning you down with her weight.
>In an attempt to push her off with your free hand, she only managed to hold onto your other wrist.
>Unable to move, you were at her mercy now.
>She leaned forward and nuzzled her snout into your neck, taking a deep breath and moaning right into your ear.
>Getting herself upright again, you were face to face with each other.
"Wait, you're actually not into this?"
>She asked with her ears falling back.
"Who's into getting raped?!"
>You barked back at her.
"Uuuugh, sweetie no. You can't just toss that word around with a lady ontop of you.
"But that's exactly what's happening here, you're just about to ra-"
>She lets go of you and puts a finger over your mouth to shush you.
"Darling please, don't use that word so haphazardly, I pride myself to be better than that."
>The vixen rolls over and is now merely lying right next to you.
"So Anon, do you want to take it slow then? Are you fine with just sleeping together?"
"Please leave."
"Just a goodnights kiss then?"
"Get out."
"A hug?"
"Scarlett!"
"No need to shout, darling. I'll leave you alone, for now. Let's talk about this when you get up, alright?"
>You didn't want to give her an answer, but it looked she wasn't leaving before you said something.
"Alright."
>She swiftly got up and out of the bed, disappearing behind the door out of your room and into the hallway.
>Right before the door clicked shut she peeked into your room one final time.
"No hard feelings, right Anon?"
>You audibly sighed
>But that wasn't a good enough response for her to leave you alone.
"Don't worry about it, no hard feelings."
>That was a lie, but you didn't have to tell her, yet.
>The door shut and you finally could rest alone.

>ywn have strong FemBagheera protect you from danger while the sexual tension between the two of you escalates
>Cougar (or panther in this case) who hasn;t been with anyone in ages and a hormonal teenage boy
>what else can go wrong?

Would she be attracted to someone she didn't find impressive?
>"You made us strong and fast, with animal genes, but there are human guys who can hang with us."
>"When I was a teenager, I and some girls from the pack would go into the national forest and hunt the non-sapient animals. A human guy was flirting with one of my older cousins and she dared him to come on a hunt with us--and do it our way."
>"That means naked, with bare hands and claws and teeth, nothing else."
>"And he did. We felt bad for him. One of them spotted him a spear with a point made of broken glass."
>"That motherfucker hid in a tree and dropped down on a deer, and he killed it with that spear. He was a stud. It probably helped that he'd just gotten out of the Marines."
>"They've been married twelve years and they have five cubs."
>"And now that I've explained the ground rules, impress me."
>"Not saying you have to be stronger than I am, or faster, or tougher. Not saying you have to do something crazy like killing a deer with a spear."
>"But if you want me to take you seriously, you need to convince me you're a cut above the average somehow. Impress me."

What are some little darlings you have about the Anthrostate setting? For me, one is
>Pamphlets and guidebooks about how to treat a human man are regularly given out to anthro women
>Some study them religiously, others toss them in the garage and do whatever they want

I want an anthro muscular women that is willing to take scars and bruises just to protect the human prince.

I love edgy loving Samurott. Starting pokemon protecting their young trainers is nothing new but most dont look like they would fucking destroy anything that would dare hurt their partner.

Not to mentioned, she’s not afraid to tear off some evil rapist furry women’s jawline if she ever dares to rape or harm the human prince.

>tfw no amazon Samurott gf to force you to sleep on top of her to "protect you in the night"

fun/kinky idea
>cities/villages that worship animal gods
>think similar to Egyptian or Indian/Hindu religions
>except instead of regular feral animals being seen as the god's kin its anthros
>anthros are barely above animals in how they act and live
>temples are built where those species can hang out and get fed/pampered by human attendees/priests
>the anthros are allowed to do whatever they want to the humans and the humans won't resist or fight back since it would be blaspheme or a grave sin against the species god
>anthros know this and take advantage of it whenever
>can just walk up and grab a human guy/boy they want and fuck them wherever
>will even just barge into homes to get who they want even while the rest of the guy's/boy's family is right there without them lifting a finger
>smaller villages/settlements tend to focus on one god while larger ones can have multiple temples to different gods
>mostly depends on where the places are in the region

I always thought of the anthrostate as being multi-national, as a way of having the different interpretations of "authoritarianism."
Like one country sees their human men as precious and to be protected, but so inept that they must be protected from themselves. The other sees them as just property. Say you're trying to prove that you're really good at math, and are trying to prove that you are qualified to design bridges or something, which is what you want to do more than anything in the world. The first society just laughs at you and suggests some aprons that would look nice on you when your wife got home. The second would snatch the paper from your hand, scowl at it for a second, and then backhand you across the face causing you to fall to the floor.
Maybe separated by species/breed?
Like the gentle ones are all collies and labs and sheep and stuff, and the rough ones are all dobermans and panthers.
Maybe there's multi-ethnic areas in the cities and suburbs where the two ideologies rub up against each other.
>A doberman sneers out of her window, looking at busty golden retriever walking her human down the sidewalk in front of her house.
>Fucking Leanne. She could at least have the decency put him on a leash.
>The doberman sighed frustratedly, but she changed her exhalation to at least blow on the black coffee she was holding.
>What did she expect though, she knew there would be some adjustments moving to a mixed district.
>She had heard the storied from her friend who travelled for work, but it still blew her away that this was tolerated at all.
>There wasn't even an HMOA for her to call over the violation.
>She had resorted to calling the police the first time, but they had just laughed and asked if she had jaywalking to report as well.

I like this idea.
the "human want's to do X but can't because anthros dont take humans seriously" plotline is underrated

>Anthrostate under attack
>Human goes to his local army recruitment center to join up
>Gets in line between two big and burly anthros, one is already sharpening her claws while the other reads a pamphlet about what (and who) is allowed to be brought back as a war trophy
>Gets to the front of the line
>Sitting at a desk is an older and grizzled looking wolf anthro, a large scar going across one eye and a bullet hole in one of her ears
>She stares at him with a stoic expression before opening her maw
>"Name and age?"
>*gulp*
>"M-my name is John Smith and I'm eighteen M-Ma'am"
>She looks down to enter this information into her computer
>"Okay John, your name is fine, you're old enough to enlist, but we both know what the obvious problem here is."
>Her eyes drift back up to his, a knowing expression on her face
>He leans forward and slams his hands on her desk
>"Oh come on! Just because I'm a human doesn't mean I can't serve my country! Please! I can't just sit idly by and watch the sacrifices our troops make without doing something myself!"
>A dead silence fills the room
>Until it's replaced with raucous laughter from everyone who heard what he just said
>His face grows beet red as the laughter gradually dies down
>The wolf reaches up and pats him on the head condescendingly
>"Oh you cute little humie, so full of determination and vigor, you'll make a good husband someday."
>She stops the petting and looks over his shoulder
>"Next!"
>He moves to block her view
>"Please! I just want to do something to help out. There's got to be something I can do." He pleads
>She puts a paw on her chin as she thinks, a devious expression growing on her face
>"Hmmmmm, well, we don't exactly allow humies in the military. But we do allow civilian contractors for...specialist roles."
>"I'll take it!" He exclaims. "Whatever it is I'll take it!"
>She looks down and begins writing on a post it note
>"Alright humie, go to the office at this address and talk to the receptionist. From there they'll induct you into MATE."
>"Mate?"
>"Stands for the Morale Assessment, Treatment, and Entertainment unit. They make sure our brave soldiers have their psychological needs taken care of while on the front line."
>"...okay. So what is it I'll be doing exactly?"
>"I literally just told you John. And by the way, you may want to begin taking calcium supplements."
>"Why's that?"
>"You'll need strong bones to be in a MATE unit. Start drinking lots too."
>"So I'll be in combat?"
>A wicked grin apears on her maw
>"In a manner of speaking. Now go to this address." She hands him the post it note. "And you'll be serving a valuable purpose to the anthrostate in no time."
>"Okay I'll do that! Thanks Ma'am"
>He dashes out of the room with a wide grin
>"Next! Name and Age?"

>she dodges away at the last second, twisting almost impossibly to avoid the blow that impacts the pavement
"Viper!"
>you sweep your wings dramatically as you rise to stand
"You're pretty far from Cosmopolis. Shouldn't you be back there, knocking over a pet store for heat lamps?"
>Viper hisses, fangs extended as she starts to circle around you

>"You ssssssee..."

>"I've not come all this way for a little money. My resssearch doesn't require much funding. I've come for you, chickadee."
>you turn to follow her as she slithers in circles around you
"What are you talking about?"
>not super heroic enough
"I mean, the only thing you've come here for is a twenty-year stay in Stonewall prison, Viper!"
>you leap into the air, and come spinning down, wings scything in all directions to catch her in a torrent of blows
>though she twists and dodges, Viper can't escape the flurry of blows, and you catch her across her torso
>the snake-woman is tossed by the blow, and left sprawled on the steps of the bank

>you beat your wings and press the attack, flying after her
>just as you're about to land another blow, she springs upward
>she wasn't coiled up in pain, she was preparing to attack!
>you're caught off guard, she grabs you mid-air and you both go tumbling to the ground
>you hit the ground hard, unable to bring your wings around to cushion the blow
>in a flash, she has your legs coiled up in her tail
>"I have you now, chickadee!"
>you wrestle with her, but her strength is enhanced beyond yours, and she manages to pin your hands to the pavement
>Viper's hood flares, and she rears up
>her fangs glisten with deadly poison
>you shut your eyes and await the sting of her bite
>but what comes is a whoosh of air, not even an inch from your face, as you hear them snap shut

>"I know your sssecret, chickadee. Ever since you teamed up with Steel Mistress to stop me in Gallehaven."
>she wraps up more and more of you with her tail, all the way up to your waist as she gloats
>"You couldn't even look me in the eye. You stayed up in the air, so very far away from my grasp."
>something wet tracks across your face
>"I could taste it then, I can taste it now. Your fear. You're ssscared of sssnakess, aren't you my chickadee?"
>you open your eyes
>and with your only free body part, swing your head you smash your head against hers

"Last chance. Surrender, or go splat."

>blood-red eyes stare pure hatred at you

>in a shimmer of golden light, your wings disappear
>and you both go plummeting to the ground
>this one's gonna hurt
>Viper is still wrapped around you, guess the joke is on her
>WHUMP
>that's gonna hurt in the morning
>if you weren't about to die
>Viper hisses triumphantly
>"You're mine!"
>she bites down on your neck, fangs sinking deep
>the pain is unbearable, but only for a little while as her poison takes effect
>the world swims then it all fades into inky black
>should have just kept the damn amulet in your pocket
>the world comes back to you, much to your surprise
>if this is the afterlife, it's not very glamourous
>in fact, it's kinda dingy
>like a prison cell in a sewer got power washed with used dishwater
>you groan and roll over to try to stand
>everything starts to spin when you do so you resign to laying face-down on the lumpy mattress
>"Alive again, chickadee?"
>you can't see her from your position, but you hear Viper, slithering from some unseen corner of the room
>"Look at you. Pathetic. You tried your bessst, and yet you weren't strong enough to beat me. Ssscared of some ssscales and fangsss."
>her mocking laughter echoes around the room
>"You're exssactly what I wass looking for, chickadee. A weak little plaything to torment."
>you bite back the urge to vomit as you speak
"You won't get any--urgh--any satisfaction. I'm a hero, you ugly freak."
>Viper stops laughing
>"We'll sssee about that, hero."
>the end of her tail wraps around your throat, squeezing tight enough to nearly cut off your breath
>you grasp weakly at the appendage
>Viper lifts you by the grip on your neck, forcing you back against the cold stone wall
>she leers down at you
>"Without your little trinket, you're ussseless."
>she holds up the amulet, just out of reach when you snatch for it
>when you fail to catch it, she laughs and throws it across the room
>"Can't sssave you now, chickadee. I can do whatever I like."
>she squeezes tighter, strangling you
>"I could crusssh the life out of you, watch your eyess pop out of their ssocketss while you squirm and writhe."
>she relaxes the grip to let you breath again
>just barely
>you continue to pry at her tail, desperate to get more air
>then she draws a clawed hand over your face
>"Or tear out your gutsss and leave you crawling asss you bleed to death on the floor."
>the claw presses hard against your cheek, drawing a cut down your skin and letting warm blood flow down your face
>you struggle to maintain composure, teeth grit, choked breath quavering
>with a hiss, you're face-to-fang with Viper's maw
>"Maybe I'll pump you ssso full of poisson your inssidesss melt!"
>you see beads of sickly green venom forming on the tip of her fangs
>you steel yourself and choke out words of defiance
"I'm--not--afraid!"
>Viper shuts her mouth, pulling back enough to look at you in mock surprise
>she flicks her tongue
>"Oh! You're not afraid! Ssso brave, chickadee. Exsscept I feel you ssshaking, I can tassste your fear. Hm, tasste..."
>she leans in to swipe her tongue over your face, lapping up some blood from the cut as she tastes you
>"You do tasste deliciouss. I think I'll jusst ssswallow you whole, my little chickadee."
>with that, Viper opens her maw wide
>then wider
>and wider
>her jaw unhinges, an unnatural sight
>you start to tug desperately at her tail
>this is too much
>not like that
>please god
>you want to scream
>all that comes out is a weak whimper
>that deathly maw descends
>you can feel her breath on your face
>you kick against the wall, and dig your fingers into Viper's scales
>tears stream down your face, mingling with blood
"Please--!"
>Viper stops, just short of engulfing your face
>her tongue whips against your cheek, tasting the tears
>she shuts her mouth in a snap
>"What wasss that, chickadee? You don't want to be eaten alive?"
>you tremble and sob
>"I want to hear it. Beg for me, chickadee."
>she finally loosens her tail on your neck, giving you your first full breath in minutes
"Please--"
>you cough and take another few deep breaths
"Please not like that. Anything but that, Viper. I--I don't want to die like that."
>Viper hisses in pleasure, eyes lit up in sadistic glee
>"That's what I thought. Are you a brave hero, chickadee? The kind that dies alone in the dark? Or are you a scared little bird, at the mercy of a cruel goddess?"
>you should defy her
>she'll just kill you anyway after having her fun
>but she hisses softly with every breath
>and you can see through her slightly open mouth the fangs still waiting for you
"I'm just a--a scared little bird. Please, Viper, I'll do what you want, just let me live."
>your pride crumbles
>Viper just laughs and laughs
>"That's right! You're no hero. A hero wouldn't cry and beg for his life. You're only fit to be my plaything, chickadee. But if you're a good little bird, I may let you live."
>you're finally released from her tail
>you crumple against the wall and your feet land on the mattress
>when you start to slump down, strong hands catch your shoulders
>Viper presses you against the wall, using it to hold you semi-upright
>just let it be over
>let it all be over and you can go home
>it's not over
>Viper looms over you
>her tail works its way around your legs
>"We're not done yet, chickadee. I have tasted your fear, but now I'll have your submission."
>once Viper has you wrapped up enough to hold you up with just her tail, she releases your shoulder to start tearing up your costume
>she's none too gentle, leaving trails of scratches over your chest and back
>you spent so long sewing it too
>the cruel villainess hisses in perverse pleasure every time her clawing forces another sob or gasp of pain from you
>"Keep sssinging, chickadee~"
>she only stops when she reaches your waist
>with a single finger, she splits open the crotch of your costume
>the boxers underneath go as well
>so close you can feel the very edge of her claw on your manhood
>the terror along with the sensation of her claw is enough to bring some life to it
>"There it iss. You know who your new godesss iss, don't you?"
>Viper drags a talon down your shaft
>you pray to whatever god is listening for the strength not to involuntarily move
>you don't want to lose everything
>Viper shifts her tail, forcing you off the wall
>she wraps around you once more, this time sliding around you to hold you from behind
>her arms go under yours, around you to continue teasing you
>"Don't try anything, my chickadee. My clawsss are so very, very sssharp. One slip of the finger..."
>to emphasize her point, she squeezes your sack, threatening to puncture it
>"...and you'll be lessss of a man than you already are~"
>you nod your head desperately
"Yes Viper. I won't try anything. I'm--I'm yours."
>Viper hisses in your ear
>"That'sss right chickadee. You're mine. Remember that."
>finally she takes your shaft in a hand, wrapping her cool fingers around it to start stroking it
>"Keep sssinging, little bird."
>she presses her claws against your sack again
"Haa-fuck!"
>you huff and groan, every time you start to quiet down, she torments you again
>all the while stroking your cock
>you hold onto her tail, gripping tight every time she presses her claws
>"You feel how tightly I hold you, chickadee? How ssstrong my tail iss? I could crusssh you any time I want."
>Viper squeezes your lower body with her tail
>she spins her head around to hiss in your other ear
>"Thank me, little bird. Thank your goddesss for letting you live."
>her voice is like death
"Thank you. Thank you for letting me live, Viper--"
>she leans forward and bares her fangs
>"I am your goddessss! You will call me goddesss or you will die!"
>you quaver and stifle yourself from crying again
"Yes goddess. Thank you for sparing me goddess. Please, please don't hurt me, I'm not a hero."
>"Gooood. Good."
>she croons to you, and leans in close
>at first to kiss at your neck
>you moan softly, the first conscious show of pleasure at the sudden gentleness
>it doesn't last long
>she goes from kissing to dragging her fangs across the tender skin of your neck, threatening to bite you again
>and she keeps stroking you
>faster and faster
>her hips roll, forcing you to buck into her hand
>tears stream down your cheeks
>you're going to cum before long
>and you dread what she'll do once she's had her fun with you
>her coils massage your legs
>one hand massages and squeezes your balls,
>the other continues to jerk you off
>Viper continues to menace your neck with her fangs
>you're wholly surrounded and entrapped by her
>and you squirm and moan in her clutches to her delight
>you leak pre-cum over her claws
>and just when you think you're going to climax
>when your member twitches and throbs in her hand
>when your moans become too much too control
>she stops
>her hands leave your groin
>you're left shuddering and thrusting against the air for release
>Viper releases her grip on your neck to laugh at your state
>"Are you desssperate chickadee? Oh you were so close. Ah ah, no touching. I want to sssee you desperate. That'ss right."
>her hands caress your thighs, your waist, your stomach
>everywhere except your desperately hard manhood
>"I want all of it, chickadee. Your submisssion asss well asss your fear. So tell me, little bird..."
>she shudders and moans
>"...do you want me to finish you off?"
>fuck
>it hurts
>you can't think straight
>Viper is still caressing you, squeezing you, teasing you
"Goddess please, just let me--"
>"You're not getting away, chickadee. Not until I hear you sssay it."
>fuck it
>you're already dead
>maybe it will be quick
"Please, finish me off. I'm so close, goddess! I just need a little more, please."
>Viper hisses in glee
>before spinning her body to throw you down on the mattress
>you land on your back, still wrapped up by the legs
>Viper lands on top of you, fangs bared and eyes wild
>you wince and bring your arms up in a feeble attempt to ward off the deadly attack
>snatching your wrists, you find yourself pinned again
>Viper presses her body against yours, mounting you
>you feel the sensation of her scales against your manhood
>after a moment's grinding, there's a shifting as her slit opens enough for you to slip inside her
>it's different from anything you've felt or even imagined before
>cool and slick
>and it grips and massages your cock

"Fuuuck!~"
>you can't control yourself anymore

>Viper drags your orgasm out
>forcing you you squirm and moan beneath her
>when you're done, you can't feel your lower half at all
>still she keeps milking you for a little while longer, making you whine as the overstimulation fries your nerves
>"You sssing so pretty for me, chickadee~"
>Viper releases you, pushing off from on top of you and unwinding her tail from your legs

>getting teased about your reactions
>then things get weird when the panda women keep sniffing the air
>then they focus heavily on you
>even moving closer to physically touch
>they're shoving their noses all over you and licking at your skin
>the sauna had you sweating obviously and it was affecting the bear women
>what you and the pandas didn't know was your sweat was loaded with pheromones from your arousal of the naked bears plus humans technically always being in breeding season
>you accidentally hotboxed the 2 panda women with breeding pheromones triggering their libidos into overdrive
>which just led to you being humped between the 2 big pandas into a stupor

>be animal themed
>an anthro villain of that actual species decides you're her new favorite toy or the anthro villain is of a species that's rivals or preys on the species of your theme
>you're not even a hero or villain
>just the favored target of a supervillain
>you're essentially some anthro supervillain's harley quinn sidekick
>or you're a lesser/small time villain that one of the bigger/more powerful one likes messing with

>Buncel goes to her first college party
>Might as well have a drink to ease her tension
>Nervously drinks herself stupid in a quiet corner
>Already feel like an idiot for even bothering to come
>One turns to five turns to a whole twelve pack of beer
>Thumping music rhythmically thuds against the walls
>A lone human sits down on the shaggy couch across the room
>Just needed a break from the noise, I guess
>He's cute
>She's too hammered to be nervous
>The buncel swaggers over, nearly toppling about halfway across the room
>She greets him with an unintelligible slurry of words
>Before he can even react, she climbs up onto the couch
>She's straddling him with her powerful legs, unintentionally locking him in place
>Another slurry of words, and she's grabbing his shirt in her hands
>She leans in for the sloppiest kiss our poor human's ever had
>Tastes like shitty beer and cigarettes from earlier in the afternoon
>She did it
>She finally did it
>Staring into his eyes, she knew that her stupid friends couldn't call her a loser anymore
>This internal monologue was lost on the human, who had a massive pile of drunk anthro sitting on his crotch

>I still remember how soft she was
>None of the other kids believed me
>I thought it was because they were jealous at first
>But now I could see why were justified
>I had just started to notice girls for the first time
>My complete inexperience in finding easily accessed porn brought only frustratingly low quality results
>After two hours of searching, I went to bed angry with the outcome
>I don't know how long I had been lying there, but I was still awake when my door creaked open
>The hall light illuminated her from behind as I looked at her from the darkness of my room
>A tall, unclothed vixen had both of her hands on either side of my doorframe, and was staring at me with soft, warm eyes
>Her orange fur turned charcoal black on her legs and forearms, giving her natural thigh high and sleeve coloration
>Just as I was able to identify her, she stepped towards me, with the door closing seemingly on its own
>Before I could ask any questions, she crawled into my bed, coming closer as she locked her eyes onto mine
>She didn't tell me her name, instead she ran her fingers through my hair and brushed my face with a few fluffy, curled knuckles
>She put herself under my covers and continued to massage me from my neck down to my chest
>The moment my own eyes broke away to steal a direct glimpse of her perfect breasts, she spoke for the first time
>"You can touch them, if you'd like."
>I hesitated, reaching out and then pulling back before I was able to close the distance
>Her warm smile was unwavering, and it helped me build the confidence I needed
>I grabbed her breast, immediately groping and playing with it upon making contact
>I hadn't even realized that my other hand followed, now fondling her perfect chest under the covers
>She pushed closer to me
>She was so warm
>She said she was going to make me feel good when I was done playing with her breasts
>I never wanted to let go
>Then she said I could put my face in them
>I pressed my whole body into hers, burying my face in her fur
>I could have fallen asleep right there, but she pulled me into a hug and rolled over
>I was on my back, and the seductive vixen had me pinned to my own bed
>She gracefully raised herself to be sitting on me, with her knees supporting her
>She tossed the blanket off of us and looked down at me in all her beauty
>With one hand, she slipped my boxers down my legs, exposing my erection to her
>Excitement and nervousness took hold, causing me to shake a bit under her
>She calmed me by repeating her soft face brushes from earlier, even lightly tracing a clawed finger along my chest
>"Don't worry. All you need to do is relax. I promised to make you feel good."
>She lifted up just a bit, sliding my length into her nethers
>The new sensation caused me to gasp, and she caressed my cheek to comfort me
>"I'm going to start moving now, okay honey?"
>My mouth still ajar, all I could do was nod as I watched the goddess on top of me
>My young, small size made it easy for her, as she only needed to bounce a little bit to rub my entire length from base to tip
>Waves of pleasure hit over and over in a continual cycle of being pushed down into the mattress by the fox woman riding me
>She even started to give small, lip-biting moans after a while
>Eventually she took my hands and placed them on her hips to hold her as she continued to bounce
>A new feeling made itself known in my loins
>I winced as bliss erupted from me, shooting my weak first load into her as far as it could go
>She stopped her movement, lowering down to my face and locking her lips with mine for what felt like entire minutes
>When she finally pulled away, she only said two words
>"Good boy."
>She hugged me tight once more, pulling the covers back over us as she rolled over again, so now I was on top, still hilted inside her
>I fell asleep within minutes
>When I woke up, she gave me a good morning kiss, and then departed
>I never saw her again

>skunk girl likes to dominating her human boyfriend by facesitting
>Both of them know it's her biggest and most dangerous asset

>the arm wraps tightly around your neck once they leave
>a car with three other reptillians pulls up
>"You're in a lot of trouble."
>the cop doesn't look back

>Crippled Anon can draw well, and that's it
>That's why he was kept by a mistress
>She would care for him and build up his self-confidence, only to subtly break it to pieces, and cycles for a decade
>Anon didn't realize this and was just told that its normal to be broken, as a result with it he's rather indifferent to people because happiness is a lie and sadness is just shame
>The mistress didn't enjoy his phlegm and was planning to do much worse
>That is until his mistress's car crashed- and with him in it, killed his mistress and severely injured Anon
>What was a casual stroll, changed his life forever
>When the trio stumbled on the wreck, Anon was already starved
>The Brown bear, seeing the opportunity took the initiative and started tending followed by Panda
>The unrelated bear sisters dragged him towards their ramshackle home, which was uncomfortable to Anon because of the dirt and lack of tile floors
>The sisters take it as a slight and growled a response
>That.. got a reaction out of him, he cuddled both his useless leg a bowed his head, protecting himself
>Surprised, it took minutes for him to calm and when he did he cried, knowing that everything he valued was gone except for the notepad canvas on him and his colouring pen/s
>A lightbulb pops up on Brown Bear's head, She gathered both White and Panda on a plan
>It essentially boils down to seducing the human, thus getting distracted on being afraid of them
>"A solid plan!" She says
>She then redirects her sisters on their positions, and pose in front of him, tempting him to draw them as perfectly as he could
>That got his attention, and he started to scribble the lines to ready it for shading
>And so they stood there, occasionally moving and teasing each other, nibbling their ears and slightly nipping their nippled to erect, which made Brown orgasm from the foreplay alone
>Only a few minutes passed when Anon called them out to see what he drew
>They were touched by what he did.

>Be anon
>Be walking downtown to grab a bite for lunch
>Something explodes and the pavement craters
>Great, a pair of supers have decided to start fighting
>Eh, if you get taken out as collateral, at least you won't have to return to work
>They argue about some artifact of a sex god they're fighting over
>Suddenly one of them flings it away and, in a moment of stupid supreme, you catch it.
>Some sort of weird face sculpture a rich person would keep
>Worse, you catch the follow-up car the villain tosses at you
>Darkness....
>You're fairly certain you're haunting your own dead body at this point
>They pry the car off of you and it's hard to tell who is more surpised that you're alive
>Get whisked away to super hero headquarters and get a lot of attention
>You just try not to get an erection being surrounded by so much skintight spandex
>After a bunch of poking by science sticks your results come back
>Peak human fitness and endurance
>You're indestructible
>You've gone up a size in the men's department
>The downsides are you're fucking green, BALD, and your face is hard to remember
>Not a threat to society, no need for training, they send you on your way
>Your cell phone has several new contacts in it for some reason
>Return to work
>See desk is piled with paperwork
>Oh wait, some of it is fan mail...addressed to "the office hunk"
>Slowly, you sit down, and stare at the wall
>You are Anonymous Incognito, the Incredible Hunk
>TFW all the implications finally sink in

>human village worships a pack of wolf spirits
>they protect the village from other spirits and grant blessings for healthy children and good harvests
>in return they demand sacrifices every few years
>the sacrifices must be young virgin males, the wolves will accept nothing else
>the boys are drawn by lots and a feast is held in their honor
>at sundown they are taken to a sacred circle deep in th forest, where they are stripped naked and painted with sacred markings
>families give their last tearful goodbyes, before the sacrifices are tied to the standing stones, and left for the spirits
>nobody knows what happens to the boys, for the spirits will only come forth once everyone has left
>but it's assumed by most of that they are killed and eaten
>in truth, the spirits come to claim the young men as mates, they have their with the boys in a orgy of feral lust, before taking them back to the spirit world, where they will spend the rest of eternity breeding and siring spirit pups

imagine how annoying going to a pool or beach is as a human guy
>the lifeguards, which would always be aquatic anthro species, always watching
>all the other anthros around fretting and hovering around you
>even species that mostly stick to land would be overly worried about human boys/guys swimming due to how shitty humans look as swimmers compared to most other spices
>they keep trying to get you to use inflatable rings or such to hold on to, sit on, lay on, etc
>and if you actually use one they go from being super worried you'll somehow drown to aggressively flirty
>since now you're helplessly floating on the water at the mercy of any of the anthros that are much better swimmers
>otters are the worst offenders and also the species that makes all the others jealous when they have their own humie to parade around on their tummies while they float about

slightly related, but imagine how much high school would reinforce certain ideas from how different humans and anthros are ability wise
>anything physical is heavily favored in the anthro's side
>some fringe cases like endurance stuff letting the humans in decent shape shine
>but the humans would still be crushed in terms of speed
>also would have certain other species right along with humans in endurance like camels, horses, wolves/dogs, etc
>anything involving small fine control of your hands would end up with humans being better at it
>sort naturally pushing humans are being better suited for delicate work with their hands while anthros are more physically capable
>then you'd have health classes that ends up with stuff for different species to brag about like hyenas eating bones and such
>would also make anthros see humans as even more delicate and easy to hurt compared to their hides/scales
>SexEd would be all kinds of weird to cover all the weird stuff each species has going on down there
>also would make humans popular when it gets them having no painful extra features and good stamina in bed

>humans on average are much smaller and more physically frail than anthros
>if that wasn't enough they have no fur, no scales, their senses of smell and hearing suck, and while they have canine teeth they're still shit compared to others
>this all serves to make humans seem small and helpless in anthro eyes
>while most anthros are decent and know that no means no, there are always going to be those who don't, and so human males are often targets for rape and sexual assault
>after all, what's the little skinny gonna do? bite her ankles?
>this only serves to make all the decent anthros to become all the more worried for poor little things, and thus they can become overprotective their little human mates to point of taking complete control of the relationship, to ensure their human partners don't get hurt

>Whew! It's dark out, I guess the moon wanted to be shy tonight.
>Been walking down the street in a more... "run down" area of the city, for what felt like ages.
>Been told a shit ton of "yigs" as mom calls them, hang around here. I've never really hung out around them before.. but my parents told me to stay away from them.
>Mom told me they're furry trash that should go back to Africa, Dad seemed to agree too but they didn't specify why.
>Never got the specieism stuff to be honest, I think they look cool. Fur, scale or skin I can chill with anyone.
>But politics aside, I'm just hoping this trip isn't another one of Michaels, uh, "pranks".
>Since his leg is broke from a certain skateboarding incident, and that I'm his friend. (At least I like to think I am, sometimes.)
>I figured I'd take on the task for him.
>He sent me to this side of town to fetch something "of the utmost importance" and to find a girl named "Barika" on River Street.
>I WOULD of been driving over here, if I only didn't forget to change the apex seals in my Dorito engine!
>But.. He also told me to "have fun on my trip"..
>You know the more I think about all of this the more suspect this is all starting to seem.
>What is he planning? He didn't want to specify what it was that I'm picking up, or even to tell this "Barika" anything much..
>Honestly, he's talked to me about the "yigs" before and he's also told me he's come here often before.
>He has made sexual jokes about them and stuff but he has never mentioned anything specific about them other than; "they're fun."
>ANNNDD I think I'm connecting the dots.
>Really starting to get tired of how vague he can be sometimes, it's like sometimes he's intentionally trying to mess with me.
>How did he even fucking talk me into thi-..
>And just like that, you're pulled out of your train-of-thought to hear:
>Thud, Thud, Thud, Thud.
>I turn around to find the noise, to see it is only a huge tail banging against a plastic garbage can.
>I turn my head up and then to the left,
>To find out that this tail is connected to a towering and yolked hyena female!
>To make matters... "worse" there are 2 other towering and yolked hyena females to the left of her.
>Their biceps are at the very least twice the size of my head alone, as I trail down to their waists...
>I spot the middle ones thighs.
>Yep, boulder crushers right there. Each one is like twice the size of ur hips, in width not even adding circumference.
>They're all at least 7ft tall. The middle girl looks like she is definitely 8ft, if not even taller.
>Jesus.
>They're wearing sweatpants and wifebeaters, of different bland colors ranging from black to grey to white.
>They're practically emasculating me by just standing there, me le 5'6" manlet..
>The middle one is wearing a black wife beater and sweatpants... with no bra.
>Actually, none of them have bra's on, also middlegirl has a cute earing on her left ea-
>"HEY! You gonna speak up shortstuff?" The one on the right decides to break you out of your rude staring.
>I-I uhm, sorry to-
>Middlegirl decides to step in, by her stature alone I have decided she is the leader.
>"Hush beautiful, no need to apologize. Wait a minute, are you anon? Michaels friend right?"
>Holy shit her voice is deep, not manly... but its deep??? God I felt my chest rumble, it's clearly feminine but.. it's so deep.
>It's so jarring. Wait.. Why is that hot?
>You decide to respond before you make an even bigger fool of urself.
>"U-uh... yeah! That's me h-haha, h-how could you tell?
>"Ur slutty little friend sent us a picture of you, so it was pretty easy I suppose."
>GOD DAMN IT MICHAEL. I've so had it with him, sending pics to people I don't even know!
>WOMEN no le-
>Wait..
>"Slutty?" What were these beasts even talking about??
>"What? You don't know?" Uhhh..
>"I-I don't.." What is going on?
>And just like that, the three of them erupt into a booming laughter. My chest is rumbling again..
>Do all hyena women sound and look like they eat 100 pounds of raw protein per day?
>"God he's clueless isn't he? Mi's got you in for a treat skinny." The one on the left states.
>Skinny, haven't heard that one before.
>"Shut the fuck up Yaga! Sorry shortstuff, my friend has a big mouth. Bars, you wanna explain?"
>Bars, who I assume is Barika, turns back to her. "Nahhh, I got something more "subtle" in mind."
>"Yaga" and that other goon start a low giggle. Ah shit.
>Barika turns back towards you and takes a few steps foward, is she snarling or smiling? I can't tell.
>"Just follow us angel, and in time you'll be able to put the pieces together."
>"And trust me, you will not regret it."
>Ohhh shit I'm probably getting into some yigger mafia. Actually, should probably stop saying that before I say it outloud by accident.
>*shiver*
>"A-alright, I'll come with."
>Her "snarl smile" gets bigger, she suddenly walks up next to you and then you feel a heavy arm wrap around you.
>A VERY heavy arm.
>What is this feeling? Saftey? Warmth? At ease? Why am I feeling this, aren't I technically being "forcefully" seduced right now?
>As you start walking you look up at her, and I really mean up, craning my head would be a huge understatement, she's staring right back down at me.
>She's looking at you like she just won the lottery, again, don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. God.
>Whatever, I could think of worse ways to spend a friday night. And it's not like I could be doing anything better right now, might as well socialize.
>And just like that, we all head off into the night.
>Why am I so stupid?
>Ugh.

>live entire life in anthrostate
>under degrading, hostile conditions
>constantly molested
>finally decide to flee into the wilderness
>dying alone is better than this
>avoid state patrols and human catchers
>finally make it so far out that there aren't any signs of civilization left
>just when you think you've made it scot free, you're surrounded by human soliders with rifles
>you're hustled into a humvee and driven away to a military base
>turns out instead of spanning the known world like the propaganda says, the anthrostate is a rump nation that barely controls fifty-thousand square miles
What if the anthrostate was just north korea the whole time?

always a fun scenario
>anthro aliens show up on friendly terms
>start interacting with Earth/humans
>turns out the anthro aliens have big gender imbalance which led to their cultural roles being the way it is with males and females being sort of reversed
>then they learn just how many males humans have
>end up treating human males the same way they treat their males
>also them freaking out when learning humans let their males do dangerous jobs and such
>they also end up looking down on human females as being shitty due to how their culture views how men and women should act
>cue lots of shenanigans between the species and culture shock from both sides
>even more when some humans go to their planet(s)/space stations to live/work
>bonus for the space anthros being bigger than humans too

imagine the propaganda from the anthro's side
>human women sending males to fight in their steed
>many human men/boys don't even want to go to war and are forced into it
>go out and save them from themselves either by force or offering to take them in
>maybe some footage of young draftees being captured with barely any fight from them
>etc

>Short clip of a young male soldier crying into an anthro woman's chest
>Portrayed as him seeking comfort
>He's actually just completely terrified because he's pretty sure his entire platoon just got turned into either red paste or cripples and he's never going to see his family again
>She's holding him there against his will
Join today!

>Have a doting cow wife
>Break an arm after slipping on a suspiciously placed banana peel and falling down some steps
>Your cow wife now INSISTS you drink her milk so you have strong bones and never have to wear a cast again
>Artificially induces lactation and starts milking herself when you aren't around
>Every breakfast is either cereal that's a few bits sugary pieces floating in a pool of milk or some very soupy peaches and cream oatmeal
>Dessert is always homemade ice cream
>Your coffee is always mixed with steamed milk instead of creamer
>You appreciate the lengths your wife is going through to try and support you, but you're seriously getting tired of half your diet consisting of dairy products
>Seriously how does she produce that much milk? Her breasts aren't "that" big for a cow anthro
>One morning you decide to make your own coffee and use creamer, then make your own cereal with only a reasonable amount of store bought milk
>She enters the kitchen and her eyes go wide in shock as she spots the creamer and milk jug still on the table
>"H-honey? Is something wrong? Is the fridge out of my milk? I swear I added another gallon just yesterday." The nervousness in her voice is barely hidden
>"No dear, just felt like making my own breakfast today"
>She moves in closer, the tone of her voice still anxious
>"Was there something wrong with my milk love? Do...do you not like it?"
>You look into those pleading green eyes of hers
>"No, dear. Just felt like having something different today."
>You go back to eating your cereal
>You hear her rummage around the medicine cabinet and quietly (or at least as quietly as an anthro with hooves for feet could be) walk back to you
>She wordlessly drops two pills, one white and one blue, into your coffee and takes a seat at the table
>You look to her with a confused expresion
>"Honey? what were those for?"
>"They're just calcium supplements. The store bought stuff has less nutritional value than the milk I produce so I thought you should take them" She states casually
>"Oh, okay."
>You take a sip of your coffee and-
>Your consciousness groggily returns to you
>You feel surrounded by warmth
>And fur
>Weakly turning your head around you see you're in the bedroom and laying on your wife's naked lap, the only light in the room coming from a dying sun
>She's holding your back up with one arm and rubbing your thigh with the other, the only sound in the room being your steady breathing and a pleasant tune hummed by her
>Looking upward her eyes are closed and a self satisfied smile graces her lips
>The breast closest to your head dribbles with milk
>Sensing you waking, she stops humming and opens her eyes, gaze now turned to you
>"All done sleepyhead?" She coos
>"...What?"
>Her smile grows a little wider
>"After breakfast we decided to get a little frisky. It seems you overexerted yourself and passed out so I've been nursing you back to health in more ways than one the entire afternoon."
>"I don't remember any of it."
>"I did say you passed out, must have lost some of your memory too. And I can't say I blame you, I never knew humans could go for 8 rounds without any breaks. At least on the bright side I won't have to take any of those damn lactation drugs anymore."
>"What do you mean?"
>"Geez anon, eight rounds without any protection and you probably got me super preggers."
>"I thought you said you were on birth control?!"
>"Oh, did I forget to tell you? There's nasty side effects if you take the lactation drugs and birth control at the same time. I stopped taking it when you broke your arm all those months ago."
>"Oh man..."
>Your head drops into her elbow as you try to process the news
>Her gaze lowers from you and onto her belly
>"So, hubby, did you have any names in mind for our calves?"

Humie?
Such a connvention would only exist if humans weren't around.
I imagine something like this would happen.
>Get transported into world full of anthros with no humans.
>Somehow decide it would be a good idea to hit up the place full of people having an unhealthy fetishistic obessesion over you.
>At first anthros would just fawn over you.
>Then they would feel you up, gushing over your smooth skin.
>Next would be aggresive flirting, your "costume" is so good, they just need to get your dick in them.
>If you refuse, some would beg and offer you money.
>Others wouldn't take no for an answer.
>Anthros would find out that everything down there is a little too accurate to be just a costume.
>Now either this ends up with the entire con wanting a ride or the "suspiciously rich humie" would kidnap you to upgrade their bad human collection.

>I want to be a lazy mage's slave/student because she was the only one willing to take a human apprentice.
>I want to be actually talented in the magical arts but completely disregarded because humans are only farmers/traders/messengers
>I want her to not actually teach me anything other than stuff that would make her life even easier (how to levitate objects and make brooms come to life)
>I want her to force me into being her warm compress during winter even though I can just light a magical fire and keep the house warm that way
>I want to be used as a convenient watering can for her garden
>I want to be made to make potions 24/7 that are basically just over the counter medicine
>I want to be rented out to the local farmers when harvest season comes and be forced by her to make all the pumpkins do silly dances as they pile up in a neat pile
>I want to be rented out to the local lord/church when festivals come 'round and be made to do fireworks and other cool/entertaining shit with my magic
>I want to eventually resign myself as her slave/servant and slowly allow myself to enjoy all the cool/fun shit my magic can do
>I want to eventually grow close with my master and then become intimate with her
>I want to impregnate her, marry her, and then grow old together with our little clan of mages.

>instead she gets a biggest, goofiest, happiest smile on her face
>human jumps right into her arms and they start making out and talking all lovey dovey
>everyone just stands there dumbfounded as the big bad scary alpha bitch makes kissy faces and calls the human "my widdle shnooky wooky lovey pie"

imagine anthros taking advantage of humans not knowing their culture to get away with lewd stuff
>my species totally greet each other by licking each other's teeth so let me shove my tongue into your mouth

>Whenever anyone confronted you, you swore up and down that the young man in those videos and pictures wasn't him.
>Your son was a good man, he would never allow himself to become a gigolo for those filthy beasts.
>You rushed up the stairs of his apartment building, elevator be damned.
>You had to question him about this, you wouldn't allow your family name to be sullied by these baseless accusations.
>Barging into his condo, you are crestfallen by the sudden haze of sweat and sex
>Slowly you make your way further in, all over the floor are scattered articles of clothing and various other items.
>Mainly condoms.
>Used condoms to be precise.
>When you reach his room, behind the door you can hear various things.
>Mainly squeals moans from him, and growls and howls from his partners.
>It pains you to see your son as a plaything for these foul beasts, but it is what it is.
>Suddenly, you are startled by a strange sensation along the back of your neck and head.
>You hear and feel sniffs, and then the cold nose of a canine is pressed against your the side of your neck
>"Mmmm~~~, and who might you be?"

>Human kingdom is surrounded by vast amount of tribal furries
>Viewing them as easy thing to wipe out and can take their land they do a mast invasion on all surrounding tribes
>Turns out pretty much all of the tribals are well versed in combat from being barbarians, shamans and druids
>Get push back into human kingdom and forced to sign peace treaty
>Turns out a part of tribal peace treaties are a mass mandatory breeding and marriage binging across the tribes to prevent wanting war
>Human and anthro pairing always have it be the anthro species

>family slowly finds out their son is a beast slut
>lots of videos and pics of him online being ruined by all sorts of anthros
>many "gross/creepy" species too in fetish videos
>like milk baths from cows, horse girls "bukake" him in fem juice, frog girl slimy sex, etc
>figure out why many anthros act the way they do when they see him and giving knowing looks towards him
>also why a lot humans were giving your son dirty looks

>anthros get tired of human women hitting on the human guys they claimed
>having their scent all over him only works on other anthros
>so the anthros come up with having their bf wear a necklace, bracelet, earring, etc that has part of them tied to it
>sharks give one of their many teeth, birds a couple of their feathers, scaled species can use one of their larger scales, furred species just tie a tuft of their fur to them, etc
>ends up being rather romantic with guys receiving handmade trinkets from their anthro GFs showing they're together

>Ah shit… damn, that Football match really gotten me
>But hey! We won! And the whole gals got bombarded by humie kisses
>Jeans is throwing a celebration party as our victory
>It's gonna be wild! Come on, tell your humie cheerleaders to come! We don’t want to be those losers who threw a party that has no boys

>be noble's son
>get a personal guard for your safety
>an anthro warrior woman
>and a big rat
>teased and mocked by the other nobles since your guard is a filthy rat
>she's actually really good at her job
>also learn how much rats like to groom others
>basically have given up and let her do as she wants in regards to grooming you with how persistent she is about it
>at least she's actually good at it
>her hands have been wander more when grooming you lately and feeling her claws run over parts of you makes you shiver in guilty pleasure
>your mind starts to wander and think about what if she did other things to you that would make you shiver in pleasure too

>Your 10' raptor GF will never come home late after a frustrating day at work, picking you up and carrying you over to the bedroom without a word
>She will never throw you down on the bed and spend all night "devouring" your helpless body with a hunger you can't comprehend
>YWN do your best to please your monstrous partner, collapsing completely exhausted after she's had her fill
>She will never pull you into a comfy embrace and use you as a human body pillow

>Anon works for a ‘sperm donation clinic’
>except it’s more like a brothel for anthro women
>it’s called a sperm donation clinic for legal reasons
>anyway one day Anon gets booked by two clients at the same time
>to his surprise it’s a mother and daughter duo which while not unheard of is rare
>expects some teenage Stacy and her Middle aged mom who’s going through some sort of midlife crisis
>Instead he gets the wolverine women in pic related
>and they have the libido and sexual stamina of horny teenagers
>you gasp, fighting to get enough air in your burning lungs
>how long have they been going?
>how long had you been trapped under Susan's massive posterior?
>how long had Molly been grinding your hips to dust?
>you don't know
>the pair of wolverines are insatiable
>the voluptuous mother/daughter pair had booked you for a shared breeding session at the 'sperm donation clinic' where you work
>fancy legal term for human brothel
>you thought it would be easy work
>but Susan the mother, and Molly the daughter have worked you harder than ever before in your life
>"Oh what's a matter baby? Don't tell me you're getting tired already."
>Susan coos softly as she shifts off from on top of you
>"We've only gone three times each. You don't want to disappoint us, do you?"
>Molly keeps bouncing on your lap, the clap of her ass cheeks against your thighs only just audible over her wanton moans
>"Fuuuck me humie!~ You're not done until--fuck yes~--until I say so!"
>your poor pelvis never stood a chance
>from the moment the session started, you were dragged down onto the bed and fucked into until the cheap frame creaked
>Molly was fierce, gnashing her teeth and raking her claws over you as she took what she wanted from you again and again
>Susan was gentler, but no less passionate in how she bounced her body up and down your cock
>"Keep going sweetie~"
>now she's whispering in your ear, tracing kisses over every bit of exposed skin to coax you into filling her own daughter with another load
>"I need grandbabies, so you can't stop until she's pregnant with triplets, okay?"
>you groan out in the response
>Susan grins sweetly
>"Good boy!"
>the elder grabs your head, lifting it up to make out with you
>the daughter grunts and slams down hard several times, shaking with pleasure as another orgasm rocks her
>you feel her claws dig against tenderized flesh as she grips you tight
>"Good fucking humie~"
>that's only enough to stop her for a few moments
>Molly's back to bouncing on your lap by the time Susan releases you from the kiss with a small bite on your lip
>"You're doing so good for us~ Let go and cum for us again. We won't stop until you're completely drained, so just relax and let go."
>Susan's paws cradle your head and she directs you to look down at the MILF on your lap
>"Don't you want to breed her again? See her swollen and pregnant with your seed?"
>you buck your hips weakly and your cock throbs inside her
>it feels like you're shooting out the last of your life force as Molly milks another load out of you
>she huffs and lets her hips drop down one last time, forcing you balls deep
>"That's it. Make sure you shoot it deep inside me. God this fucking heat gets worse every year..."
>Molly leans over on you, her massive breasts squished against your chest as she looks down into your eyes
>"You humies are a godsend. You were made to pleasure anthros, you know that?"
>she lifts herself off her lap with a groan and rolls over to lie on her back besides you
>"I wish it wasn't illegal to own humies. I don't think he'd mind very much if we just kept him."
>you're too tired to formulate much of a response
>you just look over at her and huff in indignation
>Susan laughs
>"Oh I think you've upset him, Molly. It's okay baby, you'd like being our property. Oh we'd take good care of you, and make sure your balls are drained daily."
>Susan lowers your head back onto the mattress and shifts to sit on the opposite side of you as Molly
>she reaches down to hold your balls in one paw
>"We're almost out of time, but I think you have just enough left to give me a final ride, isn't that right?"
>you manage to pick your own head off the couch to look Susan in the eye
"Fuck yeah I do."
>best job in the world
>Molly bursts into laughter, while Susan tuts disapprovingly
>"Language, young man."
>despite her disapproval, she still moves to straddle your lap and mount you
>Susan takes your shaft in her paw to guide you in
>she takes you balls deep easily, dropping onto your lap fully
>your bruised pelvis aches in protest
>just has to take one for the team
>"Mmh~ That's my good boy. Hold onto my hips baby."
>she lifts your hands to rest on her hips
>you barely have the strength to hold on
>Susan picks herself up
>slowly
>and then she drops down hard, making an audible 'plap!' as the whole weight of her lands on you
>you dig your fingers into plush fur and plusher thighs
>this torture is heaven
>"You like fucking my mom, humie?"
>Molly has scooted in closer to whisper in your ear
>and nibble at your earlobe
>Susan picks herself up off you and drops down hard again
>"Mmf! You're starting to wear me out, boy~"
>despite saying so, Susan bounces on your lap again and again, starting up nearly the same pace as her daughter was going just moments ago
>Molly chews on your ear, then starts kissing and licking at your neck
>"Keep going humie. You love it don't you? Why not just become ours? You'll spend your days trapped beneath two MILFs who fuck you silly. Every night just like this~"
>you roll your hips, panting for breath while you put in effort to pleasure Susan for the end of the session
>Molly keeps whispering sweet nothings as she leaves hickeys and bite marks all over you
>the offer is starting to sound better and better
>"Molly! Ha...ha...Help our darling boy sit up. There's a good girl."
>Susan directs her daughter, and you're hoisted up by your shoulders and pulled into an embrace
>instead of drowning under wolverine ass, now you're smothered between wolverine tits
>"Good boy! Oh good boy!~"
>Susan starts to moan with earnest as she cradles and coddles you
>Molly is wrapped around behind you, supporting you and holding you up to let her mother fuck you how she likes
>and she doesn't let up either
>you feel her claws and teeth against any exposed skin she can reach
>"I can feel him shaking, mom. It's almost cute."
>Molly snorts
>Susan coos
>"Oh he's all tuckered out. We're almost done baby. Give momma one last good load and then you can have some rest, okay?"
>not like you have much choice in the matter
>still, you give your best effort to match Susan's pace
>you manage maybe one thrust for every time she drops down on your lap
>she still moans appreciatively every time you do
>you can feel your eighth climax of the night getting closer
>all your endurance has been pounded out of you
>your moans are muffled by Susan's chest
>Molly still giggles as she hears it from being pressed up against you
>"Gonna cum again, humie? Give her a whole litter of kits~ It's only fair we both get what we want."
>Molly clamps down on your shoulder with her teeth, holding you tight and sending shocks of pain and pleasure through you
>your whole body spasms
>you can feel your heart thumping in your chest
>is it going to give out?
>it feels like it
>especially when you give one last thrust up into Susan and cum deep inside her
>Susan moans and hugs you tight, tugging you slightly away from Molly to force you against her fully
>you may have gone too far
>you're spent
>if you shot your life into Molly, now you've pumped your very immortal soul into her mother to satisfy her desires
>Susan groans and grinds out the last of your seed
>you're done
>you shudder and go limp, held up between the two wolverines
>you're vaguely aware of what they're saying as they shift to let you lie down and breath freely
>"Oh the poor dear, all tuckered out."
>that's Susan
>"He was a lotta fun, shame the session's ending in a couple minutes here..."
>Molly sighs
>but Susan giggles mischievously
>"Well, we could always take him home with us, make sure he makes a full recovery."
>"Mom! Are you serious?"
>"Quite serious. Here, pick him up, we can sneak him out the back door if we're lucky..."
>you don't have the energy
>or desire
>to resist when you're scooped up in a pair of fuzzy arms to be carried off

>be submissive and obedient to his waifur

>if you live underground the rats consider you belong to them already
>gotta be careful walking near holes and vents that lead underground or you might get pulled in by a rat because she took a fancy to you

>you got your letter today
>the state wants you to go some office to get your wife assigned
>usually the start of a new life as a pampered chewtoy
>but you'd done your research
>when you rented your apartment you'd tactically selected a catchment area that is almost entirely populated by herbivores

>stuff like that
>no hyenas, wolves or other crazies
>If you play your cards right you'll get some dopey girl that you'll be able to give the slip and skip town
>Maybe even steal a car
>then go and live off the grid in some sleepy middle of nowhere village
>You are a genius
>You get the bus down to the local office, a former DMV centre
>It's during the day so it's quiet, not many other passengers
>you were slightly worried when some huge pitbull girl got on, but she had a dude half her size clinging to her
>the two of them were acting all lovey-dovey up the front while you tried to remain inconspicuous
>the pit was licking the guys face with a tongue the size and shape of a shovel, and kept prodding him to get objects out of his pocket for her to chew on
>and snap with her massive jaws
>you watch in horror as the femur bone of some large animal breaks like a twig in her mouth
>at this her boy toy politely applauds and pats her head, and gets a face full of tongue again
>these people are fucking nuts
>after another 10 minutes of this you are finally in the centre of town, at the old DMV
>you could still see the outlines of the old letters on the side of the building where they had been taken down

>you filter through into the main hall
>there's a queue of guys all holding the same letters as you filtering through to a row of kiosks
>most of them look as dejected as you feel>there's a window running along one of the walls into another room, filled with anthro women of various species
>several of them are staring intently through the glass at the guys plodding through the maze of queue barriers
>a hyena is licking the window and panting, a berserk grin on her face
>no surprises there
>you join the end of the line, behind a young guy who looks far too upbeat for a man about to be forced into marital servitude
>he starts trying to talk to you, asks if you are excited to get picked
>oh god
>you try to fob him off but he doesn't take the hint and starts pointing out girls in the waiting room, saying all kinds of stupid shit
>this attracts the attention of the yeen, who starts banging on the glass and waving at him, to the annoyance of the other women
>he cheerfully waves back and nudges you, saying he think's he's got a good chance
>you are utterly baffled, where do they find these people
>thankfully you are soon separated from this crazy person as the queue filters out to the kiosks
>a tired looking rat girl is sat behind the computer
>she asks for your papers so you hand over the letter
>she scans it in and asks you to confirm your personal details
>you give over your name, address and date of birth
>as soon as she puts in your name the white light of her computer screen flashes red across her face
>shit
>"Really, dude? do you know how much paperwork we have to do every time we process a runner?" she groans
>she flicks the microphone on her desk
>"can I get security to kiosk 4? Got a Code 3 here"
>you think about running, maybe you could get out of here before they can grab you
>not a chance
>a chunky pig girl in full mall cop regalia has already blocked off your escape route as she swaggers over
>"You always get the best ones, June." She chuckles to the rat "What's this one's malfunction?"
>"2 counts of avoiding state advised dating without reasonable excuse, 1 count of faking illness to avoid marriage selection and 1 count of attempted escape of state care"
>the pig whistles and looks you up and down
>"well you're a right piece of work, aint'cha?"
>you try and bullshit them, saying that's all in the past and you just want to settle down now
>if your plan is going to work you need to get assigned to some ditz you can escape from
>as you talk crap, behind the pig you can see the young guy from before being led into the anthro waiting room
>he runs over to the hyena, who immediately hoists him into a fireman carry and sprints out of the room like she's just robbed a bank
>which given that she's a yeen she probably has experience
>the rat is on the phone to her supervisors, wanting clarification on what's to be done with you, while the pig just stands there arms crossed and listens to you babble
>the rat finishes her call and starts typing again, cursing under her breath
>"Nice try with the catchment area crap, buddy. The bosses just told me they've had your internet bugged for the last month. You're getting assigned from the special assignments pool."
>shit shit shit
>that doesn't sound good
>the pig laughs
>"Man, you are fucked now. Should have just gone quietly, pal."
>you ask what the hell the special assignments pool is
>the rat sighs
>"some girls actually volunteer to marry troublemakers like you"
>"they sign a bunch of waivers and get vetted as capable of taking on special cases"
>oh great
>not only have you been spied on for the last month and all your plans rumbled
>but you've been earmarked for the "rebellious humies need snapped in two, please sign here" scheme
>this day couldn't get any better
>at least this would delay the process a little
>it would surely take them a while to find one of these psychos, maybe you'll find a way to dodge this
>the rat gets another call
>balancing the phone between her neck and ear, she starts typing like crazy again while giving someone directions on the other end
>"keep him here? no problem just ring us when you're outside, we'll drop him off at the car"
>she hangs up and looks over the counter at the pig
>"she'll be here in an hour"
>you ask who's coming, a higher ranking officer to process your case?
>"no, dumbass"
>"that was your wife"
>”she'll get you out front in an hour”
>your blood runs cold
>so soon?
>this is ridiculous
>the pig grabs your arm and waves bye to the rat as another “happy customer” approaches the kiosk
>the excitement over, the rat sighs and waves a sad little wave back as you are led away and her day returns to tedium
>the pig leads you into her little office with a window looking out over the street
>you wait there with her while she smugly berates you about how you wouldn't be in this mess if you'd just done as you were told the first time
>honestly you aren't really paying attention
>you're scanning every car that passes, trying to figure out which one is carrying your doom
>an anthro that volunteered to take on difficult guys
>what the hell does that look like?
>images flash through your head of german shepherds with latex, whips and questionable politics
>trailer trash rats looking for another baby daddy

>the pig is trying to show you pictures of her husband
>”look how happy he is!”
>maybe death would be better than this
>the hour crawls by as you desperately track each vehicle as it passes
>then the pig's radio squawks
>as she goes to answer it, you see an expensive looking green estate car roll up
>here we go
>the pig confirms with the rat back at the desk that that is indeed your ride
>she hustles you out of the office and out of the front door
>you blink as the low evening sun gets your eyes
>”good luck, buddy, I think you'll need it!” the pig chuckles as you approach the ominous car
>the driver's door opens, and a pair of long striped legs come out
>a tiger woman in office attire and a skirt gracefully pulls herself out of the car
>she looks down at you with a pair of warm golden eyes through a pair of glasses, backlit by the sun
>she's a foot taller than you
>god above, you are fucked
>”Hello darling, my name's Alice.” she says. Her voice is calm and soothing, and she offers you her large clawed hand.
>”Want to get in the car so I can dodge a parking ticket?” She jokes, and opens one of the rear doors.
>The pig looks over her paperwork, trying to find the right forms.
>”Ms Blau?”
>”Doctor Blau, but yes. I've already sent on all the necessary paperwork to your colleagues, and I've got a copy of his file, officer. Thank you for your assistance.”
>The pig shrugs, gives you a half assed wave and heads back inside
>”Okay doc, enjoy yourself. Check up is in a week.”
>you are left alone with your bride-to-be
>”Clock's ticking, hun. Parking warden is probably right around the corner.” Alice whispers conspiratorially to you, a wry smile showing off some worrying teeth
>she's still patiently offering you her hand, and holding the door of the car open
>you think about running, but looking at her you wouldn't get far
>at least she seems nice enough
>haha
>you take her hand
>you take her hand
>she grips it tightly and ushers you into the back seat
>the interior of the car is all plush cream leather, polished silver and black detailing
>she must be a doctor if she can afford something like this
>she swiftly closes the door once you are sat down, and climbs into the driver's seat
>she's barely sat down before she turns on the child lock, disengaging the rear doors
>no getting out now
>You meet her eyes in the rear view mirror
>”So, how's your day been so far?” she asks languidly as she maneuvers her way through the busy city centre traffic
>you don't really know how to answer, so you just shrug
>”I imagine you're nervous but don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to talk when we get back to my place.”
>you drive for another fifteen minutes, the big car effortlessly eating up miles of road.
>Alice asks you what you do for a living
>you give a non-committal answer about this and that
>”Huh, with your degree I thought you might have a job working with computers.”
>your blood runs cold
>you ask her how she knows about your degree
>seeing your shock, she grins in the rear-view mirror and lists off your date and place of birth, your full list of qualifications and your last three employers
>”Don't look so scared, darling. I've read your file. The state sent it to me a week ago when your letter was sent out.”
>the bottom falls out of your world
>this whole thing was orchestrated from the start
>her eyes are boring into yours as you glide along the freeway
>”I need to know as much as I can about you if I'm to take care of you, anon. It's part of my duty of care as your wife, and as a doctor.”
>”Especially since you have these problems with authority.”
>”But we an talk about that once we've had dinner.”
>the car pulls up to a row of townhouses on a leafy boulevard
>Alice parks up on the street and gets out, before coming round to let you out
>she takes you by the hand and leads you up the steps to the door
>”We can head over to your place tomorrow and pick up anything you need. I'll call your landlord and let them know you are moving out.”
>she unlocks the front door and you both head inside
>sunlight streams in the windows of the lounge, where a large leather couch and a pair of armchairs crowd around a stone fireplace
>Alice heads towards the kitchen and motions to the couch
>”Sit yourself down, I'll get us something to drink.”
>whatever
>this is all a bit much
>you sink into the soft leather as you hear a cork popping
>Alice comes back over with a pair of crystal glasses of red wine
>as she hands it to you, you sigh in dejection
>this doesn't seem too bad
>”Cheers, honey.” Alice says, a warm smile on her face. She takes a sip of her wine.
>you offer a wan smile and drink a mouthful.
>immediately something's wrong
>you fucking idiot
>your mouth goes numb
>rule number 1
>don't drink anything you haven't poured yourself
>dumbass
>you try and stand, but your legs are already going weak
>Alice calmly takes the glass from your hands before you can drop it and places it on the table
>what the hell did she dose you with
>with herculean effort, you manage to take a step away, towards the door
>as soon as you try and take another you fall
>straight into her arms
>”My, did that go straight to your head? We need to work on your relationship with alcohol, darling.”
>she holds you up as your whole body turns to jelly
>but you are still fully conscious
>you start panicking, weakly twitching in her embrace
>”After all, I've seen your file. How much cheap vodka you've been buying over the last year.”
>”You need help.”
>she drags you over to one of the armchairs and sits down, pulling you onto her lap.
>you try and wriggle away
>”Now now, don't struggle. Focus on breathing. We've got about 15 minutes until the dose takes full effect so just try and relax for me, my little man.”
>She pulls up her phone
>”We can use this time to have a look over the rest of your file.”
>she starts reading over your criminal history, how you have been trying every trick in the book to get away from marriage
>”What's odd to me is how much effort you've put in, yet you are still living in the city, where the state can keep trying to get you assigned.”
>”You could have just ran off into the wilderness if you hate anthros so much. It's not unheard of.”
She leans in close to your ear
>”I think you want to get caught. You want to put up a big fight to satisfy that male ego of yours, but deep down you know where you belong.”
>she pulls up another page
>your internet history
>oh god no
>”Now this is interesting. Apart from all the cruel posting you've been doing on buncel.net you've also shown some worrying patterns.”
>she pulls up an order receipt for booze from a friday night.
>”You self medicate with alcohol.”
>She swipes onto a porn site, where a still image of BROKEN BOYS XII shows a young man with his face deep in some canine's pussy, a clawed hand yanking his hair
>”Then you indulge in degrading pornography.”
>then the final tab
>oh no
>not this one
>Youtube : YEEN'D: SFW AFTERCARE COMPILATION
>”Then this. You poor thing. How many times have you watched this?”
>she presses play on the video
>a man and a big hyena are lying in bed all wrapped up in blankets, cuddling each other
>a tinny voice plays out of the phone speakers
>”I love you babe, you're such a good boy.”
>you fall apart, weakly blubbering in Alice's arms
>she pats your head
>”Shhh it's okay. This is what you want, isn't it?”
>”I can be there for you. But you need to understand something.”
>”You are unwell. You've been doing harm to yourself for so long that you can't undo it by yourself.”
>”You need me to help you.”
>”You belong here. You belong to me.”
>She tilts your head up with a hand
>and kisses you
>you're face isn't numb anymore
>but you still can't move
>you can feel her claws cradling her throat, her lips pressed against yours
>you can't get away
>she goes deeper
>she pushes her tongue into your mouth, eliciting a weak little moan from you as her free hand begins effortlessly tearing your shirt to ribbons
>you can taste the wine on her lips
>you can feel her claws running down your chest
>it's terrifying
>but she's right
>somewhere deep inside you you've always wanted this
>you hid it, hated yourself for it
>but it was always there
>she breaks away, panting, her eyes aflame with desire
>”You can feel it all, can't you?”
>“For the next hour, you'll be able to feel everything I do to you.”
>“But you can't stop me. You'll never be able to stop me.”
>She tears off what's left of your shirt and stands up, lifting you in her arms
>she walks over to the huge fireplace, and places you on the rug in front of it
>with a snap of her fingers the fire springs to life
>she stands over you, panting, backlit by the flames
>with a grunt Alice rips off her own shirt, her bra and her skirt
>then kicks her shoes across the room and clambers on top of you
>you still can't move
>but like she said
>you can feel everything
>the heat of the fire
>her fur rubbing over your skin
>her breath on your neck
>her hands undoing your belt
>you are hard as a rock by the time she yanks your trousers down to your ankles
>she rubs her big, fluffy hands over your cock, licking her lips
>she laughs
>”At least the important part of you still works, honey. That dose was perfect.”
>”Sometimes I even impress myself.”
>you barely manage to force out a few words from your uncooperative mouth
>”you're crazy,” you croak
>She giggles, then crawls up your body, running her claws up your arms to rest on your shoulders.
>“Well if your precious little mouth is back online, I guess I'll have to use that too, won't I?”
>She destroys her panties with a single claw, baring her drooling, fuzzy cunt.
>“You know what you need to do, right? My little broken boy?”
>crazy isn't the right word
>She pulls your head up by the hair and shoves her pussy into your face.
>she isn't gentle
>she grinds against your face, panting and growling
>you do your best to give her what she wants
>for a good couple of minutes you make out with her sex, getting utterly drenched in her scent
>then she stops, and pulls you in for another kiss.
>”You're such a good boy, darling. You deserve to get off too.”
>the words are like electric fire running through your body.
>she holds you close for a moment, a placid smile on your face, her eyes lidded
>Alice shifts positions and lies on top of you, embracing you
>she starts nibbling at your neck
>”When I worked A&E I never got the appeal of marking boys. It seemed so risky. Barbaric. I've had more than one idiot have to get her mate airlifted to hospital with a jugular bleed.”
>”But..” She stops her teasing for a moment, her instincts warring with her better judgement.
>then she strikes
>Her teeth sink into the nape of your neck
>you let out a strangled cry of pain
>it's agonising
>but some sick little part of you is satisfied
>your hers now
>you'll always have her mark on your flesh
>she growls like a rabid beast
>then releases you, coughing
>”God I'm so sorry, darling. I just couldn't help myself.” She looms over you, her eyes unfocused, her teeth stained with your blood. She licks it off.
“It doesn't look bad, okay? I'll get it dressed once we're done.”
>”Let me make it up to you, okay?”
>she moves to straddle your waist
>positioning herself above your unattended, painfully hard cock
>”I nearly forgot the most important part.”
>agonisingly slowly, she lowers herself onto you
>you let out a throaty groan as she sinks lower and lower
>”Make as much noise as you can, baby. I want to know how good this feels, okay?”
>then she starts riding you
>her hands digging into your sides, she rides you like a jackhammer
>she starts panting and chuffing, her animalistic noises mixing with your weak, breathy moans
>you feel like you're disintegrating in her hands
>it doesn't take long before you are at your limit
>”Alice...” you moan
>”Yes darling, I know,“ she pants, her whole body shaking as she inches closer to the edge
>she speeds up
>as she leans over you, one of her hands moves from your side,
>and wraps around your throat
>bang
>Alice shudders, screaming through gritted teeth as orgasm burns through her body
>her sex twitches and gushes all over you, sending you over the edge as well
>the feeling is almost religious
>you feel like you are vibrating out of your own body as rope after rope of seed shoots into Alice's womb
>the two of you collapse into a wet, shuddering mess
>Alice eventually comes to her senses, and lifts herself off of you
>she goes into the kitchen and brings back some gauze and some rubbing alcohol
>she rubs down the big bite on your neck, as well as some secondary scratches across your body
>she bandages your neck and ties it off
>”There. Wasn't much bleeding anyway but I'm not risking it.”
>Alice stoops down and lifts you up, holding you like a child
>”You're such a good boy, darling. I'll never let you go.”
>”Let's get to bed.”
>you wake up the next morning with an array of aches and pains but able to move again
>Alice is making breakfast in the kitchen
>she asks you to go out to the car and bring in some stuff she'd left in the trunk last night while she fries you up some eggs and bacon
>might as well get some fresh air
>you go outside, pulling your loaned sweater up over your bandages, and take in a deep breath
>you have no idea how to process last night but hopefully it'll all work out
>you smell a whiff of tobacco from behind you and turn round
>no fucking way
>the young guy from the DMV yesterday is standing on the porch of the next house along, sporting a black eye, a cigarette in his mouth and a sweater with “It's not easy being Yeen” on it
>that pun is terrible fuck you
>He looks at you with a shit eating grin, and points out your bandage
>”Women, eh? Cant live with 'em, can't live without 'em, ey neighbour?”
>oh god no

>move into an anthro apartment building
>the rooms/apartments inside have no doors since anthros have different views on privacy
>with their sense of hearing and smell there's really no privacy anyways
>whole apartment is treated like one big pack/hard/etc
>usually means most are usually filled mainly with one species with the occasional different ones and other species closely tied to that main species
>have to get used to many different cultural species quirks
>like no beds in the apartments and instead a single big room dedicated to sleeping in where all the floor is just one giant bed/padding
>you also totally didn't almost have an emotional breakdown from being cuddled by so many anthros just because they want to
>bathing is also different with a dedicated grooming area
>depending on the main species that area can have a huge pool or simple showers depending on how water inclined the species are
>and when it comes to grooming there's always another anthro around willing to help since grooming in a pack/herd/etc is bonding
>since all you have is hair on your head it gets way more attention then needed
>smooth skin threw the anthros for a loop for a little while until they learned about lotions and oils
>also get warned of an upcoming date, heat season
>highly suggested all male tenets leave the apartment for the period, stay close to your mate(s), or a suggestion to stock up on water/fluids
>seems all the females that have lived in the apartment long enough have ended up syncing their heats together
>and being a male in the apartment with no claiming scent on you means you're free for grabs by any female if you stay in the building during the heat period
>again, depending on which species makes up the majority the apartment that possibility ranges from how dangerous it could mean for your body

>live with a bunch of bovine girls
>spend a lot of time doing stuff with them
>things like grooming them, milking them, cuddling with them, letting them have their way with you
>but hey at least they treat you as an equal, which is more than you can say for most anthros
>their milk is pretty good too

>Rome was founded by two guys who grew up sucking on wolf tits
>2500 years later and wolf anthros still wont let you forget it

>Wolf GF who's a Romaboo.
>She unironically has one of those roman history channels on YouTube that talk about anything that has to do with rome.
>She likes to roleplay that you're Romulus (or Remus) and she's the Capitoline Wolf.
>Or that you're a Sabine man and she's a early roman soldier.
>Or that you're a Gladiator and she's your "Trainer"
>Sometimes, she likes to roleplay that you're a roman legionnaire and she's a Germanic warrior stalking you in the Teutoburg Forest (your backyard)

>After being brutally raped by a band of bunnies, you try to stumble your way home
>you take a wrong turn and You’re found by a pack of wolves
>they sniff you, and snarl about how you reek of weakness and herbivore cope
>they decide to cover you with a much better scent

Had fun watching my awoo daughter chase seagulls at the beach today

>her heavy, rhythmic, metallic stomps echo through the maintenance underhalls, steadily increasing in tempo as his frantic rattling of a locked gate broadcasts his position to anyone within the maze of the Mall's basement
>Beneath the jingling aluminum's song are his whimpers, tears, and sobs growing more desperate and indecipherable by the second as she lurches into an uncanny sprint
>Her voice calls out through his hyperventilation and desperate begging
>"You smell like cheesey pizza!"

>who framed roger rabbit style world where toons and humans interact
>date an animal toon girl
>play hard to get sometimes so you get chased pepe le pew/fifi le fume style
>generally she's aggressively flirty and exaggeratedly affectionate
>play into her species stereotypes to get her really going like wearing a red cloak/hoodie if she's a wolf
>or stuff like making puns/jokes about her species like rabbits and multiplying
>loves to hear your laugh
>sex is both amazing and terrifying with toons physics/anatomy
>get taught how to use toon physics to some degree like the painted tunnel on a wall trick/gag, ignoring gravity in toontown, shrugging off explosions, etc
>either help her escape one of her rivals/nemesis or if she's a villain toon help her schemes and play along with the jokes that happen around/to her while chasing after another toon
>visit her place in toontown and it changes every now and again
>could be a regular house, a castle, a literal cave or similar animal's den in the forest, and such

>partner up with an experienced adventurer thinking you'll get easy loot from low-tier jobs
>end up getting carried through crazy shit way above your pay-grade
>pretty much just there to carry her extra gear and "show your appreciation" for being kept safe
