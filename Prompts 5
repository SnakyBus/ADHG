TT #2: Trickle Down Rumors
>To many in the Concord of Saviors, Split Hare was a humorous type that helped keep things from getting too serious
>She played her fair share of pranks, cracked jokes, and was always up for fun with the rest of the girls
>So when she came in with a hunk of junk vaguely resembling the head of a robotic villain that had eluded capture for a while, everyone waited for the punchline
>As she told her peers about what happened the previous night, they wondered why she didn't start laughing along with them, instead looking like she was quite serious
>The first to break the awkward air around what was perceived as stilted humor was Floodgate, a Beluga with control over all liquids
>"Hare dear," the aquatic mammal said with a twinge of concern, "you are just practicing your poker face, aren't you?"
>The rabbit shook her head, showing her and the rest of any onlookers the inside of what was once the high tech helmet
>"You know I can't keep a straight face very long, just look at this!" she said as she pointed inside the helm, "Tech Terror isn't a robot, or even an Anthro!"
>Murmurs made their way through the small crowd that had now formed, all with their own theories of what the villain was
>Some of the more confident members of the group asked to see the helmet, to which the speedster obliged them
>"Why is it so busted up?" a rat asked, "I don't smell anything other than metal n' burnt plastics!"
>"Yeah, what gives?" a snake agreed after trying her method of 'sniffing', giving the helmet back
>"It may have blown up a bit back when I tried picking it up," Hare says as she recalled the self destruct
>It kicked in shortly after she had touched it, starting to vibrate slightly
>She couldn't risk collateral damage, so she had to bring it under the nearby lake
>It wasn't too big of an explosion, but it had warped the inside to a terrible degree, making it very hard to determine what shape the helm was supposed to have
>And on top of that, bringing it underwater had help strip it of anything those with gifted scent could use to confirm or deny her claims
>No one would blame her for how she handled it, dealing with bombs in as quick and safe a manor as possible was part of the job description
>This however did nothing to make her less embarrassed with herself, what little proof she may have had being wiped away by her own doing
>It seemed as though nobody would believe her
>That was, until a curious observer made herself known
>A blood hound who went by Dogmata, armed to the teeth in gadgets and gizmos for any occasion, not unlike the villain in question
>Very stern, always focused, one hell of a tracker
>And one of Split Hare's long time friends
>"Hare, may I?" asked the canine
>She nodded and gave her the helmet
>"Think you can work some magic?" the rabbit asked hopefully
>Dogmata didn't respond, already at work with some form of multitool
>For a moment, nobody said a word, all eyes and ears were upon her
>Then with a click, the face plate popped open
>"Interesting..." she said took a look at the less damaged portion that had been revealed
>The crowd was starting to get antsy while they waited for the master investigator's findings
>Only to get disappointed when she shook her head, saying it was inconclusive
>She promised to take it to her lab and get results
>Everyone began to disperse from the area, but Dogmata gestured for Split Hare to follow
>They both went to a secluded area in the giant building
>Split Hare asked what was up, garnering a frown from the somewhat surly dog
>"Jane," she said with her arms crossed, "do you know what you've just done?"
>The speedster had no idea what she meant, but knew the answer wouldn't be a good one since Dogmata had just used her real name
>"You just announced to everyone that there is a human super villain out there. Do you really think all of them will just keep quiet about this?"
>Not fully understanding the reason this might be a bad thing, Split Hare, or Jane rather, instead focused on something else
>"Does this mean that you believe me?" she said, almost dizzily ignoring the issue that was posed
>The hound sighs in annoyance
>"Even if it makes no sense whatsoever," she admitted, "I trust you not to make something like this up."
>She shook her head, looking down at the helmet
>"Regardless of that," she said in a much more serious tone, "word WILL get out now, and what do you think will happen when a bunch of thugs and psychopaths with super powers hear about it?"
>When contextualized like this, the real problem finally became apparent to the now wide-eyed heroine, simply saying "Oh" in realization
>Dogmata set the helmet down, patting her pal on the back
>"It will be fine," the dog said in an effort to soothe, "we're just going to need to get to him first."
>This cheered up the rabbit, bringing her back to her usual demeanor
>"Now," Dogmata said as her informative visor dropped over her eyes, "let's find a way to force a confrontation."
>As the two superheroes started to form a strategy with some other friends in their circle, Dogmata's theory was made reality
>Within the day, some of the greener heroes had decided to hunt after information about Tech Terror possibly being a human
>This of course meant interrogation of other criminals
>They knew nothing of the sort obviously, but ended up in jail with others who had the same thing asked of them
>Low level gangsters talked with each other, boastful that even they could take on a super if it was a human
>This caught the ears of those with affiliation to villains, dirty cops and enforcers alike
>Rumors were like a wildfire, growing out of control as more participants joined in
>'Maybe this Tech guy stole his stuff from Dogmata', 'What if it's actually a shapeshifter?', 'Maybe she's a demon who stole some poor bastard's body'
>It happened like this all the way up the tree, until those who were truly dangerous had been informed
>Those especially dangerous being the criminal syndicate known as Dark Chimera
>Deep within their stronghold located in the center of a dormant volcano, they were in the middle of a meeting to discuss possible targets for their next operation
>Ideas included weather machines, invoking dark sorceries, political subterfuge, the bread and butter of evil
>When it seemed as though all the options had been laid out, a shark asked to include another
>Primevil, the only true chimera of the group as well as its leader, allowed the addition
>Riptide of the Depths slid photos around the table of a mid grade supervillain
>"I was recently informed of an up and rising supervillain." said the shark as she had the various shots of Tech Terror put on the big screen
>They were all taken from the bank where his heist had failed
>"He's been shown to have aptitude with all forms of technology, and there is little evidence he even exists". she said while using a laser pointer to draw attention to various sections of the photos
>"Excuse me seabreath," said a rabbit in gear resembling that of Split Hare, "did you just say 'He'?"
>The shark decided to let the childish insult off with a sneer, this time at least
>"That's right, I said he," explained the now somewhat irritated villainess, "I have reason to believe this is a man."
>Those in the meeting all began to pay more attention, leaning in
>"Many of my servants have heard that heroes have been rousting whoever they can, all asking about this thing right here being a human" she said elaborated, circling the image on screen for emphasis
>"So what?" questioned the same impudent rabbit, "I like a good shag like anyone else, but what are we gonna do with some skinny in a mech that we couldn't do before?"
>The leader slammed her huge claw on the table
>"s i l e n c e w h e l p" came the ethereal words of the chimera, speaking not with vocal cords, but straight into the mind of the rabbit
>The mental intrusion made the upstart mammal quiet, Primevil nodding for the shark to finish
>"We could always use someone who can keep things quiet," said the shark while glaring back at the dull colored rabbit, "and if all else fails, he would make for a grand bargaining chip."
>Questions circulated in an organized fashion under the gaze of the Primevil
>The shark took them all and addressed them like one would at a business meeting
>Q: How would we get him to join us?
>A: Blackmail of course. He seems to be going after very specific targets, so if we can narrow down what he is after, we can get at them before he does. Force him to come to us.
>Q: What worth does he have to the Concord?
>A: Going off of what my minions have told me, many of its members are very interested in this one. The reasons why don't matter as much as the fact they want him, and we'll have him.
>Q: Who gets to have him?
>A: This is not important to our operation. If you really can't help yourself, clear it with everyone else first. As with all our other endeavors, pleasure comes after business.
>"That should be all for the moment," said Riptide as she finished her proposal, "thanks for your time."
>A vote was counted for which projects would be put forward, with 11 of 13 votes giving the green light to Riptides proposal
>Thus, by the end of the day after his secret was laid bare, Tech Terror found himself with a worldwide target on his back
>He knew what his prior failure would bring forth, it would be inevitable in this world
>This could all be avoided, a simple life could be his at any moment if he just stopped right now
>But that same burning sense of pride and ambition that brought him so far wouldn't have it
>His greatness would once again be admired, he would once again be an icon, an aspiration
>There would be no substitutes for someone like him, his superiority would be acknowledged
>With that thought helping him along, he continued toiling away in his workshop, working towards making sure his victory was assured
>This was the only way

>Multiverse theory
>There exists multiple universes
>And there exists one universe where humanities first contact with alien races were always extremely hostile
>Some races were just highly advanced, some magical, anomalous, etc.
>Humanity after every contact harvested the alien tech and studied alien magic or energy
>With each and every new contact leading to more advanced, and extremely messed up technology
>End result being an extremely milimilitaristic militaristic, think the Quincy from Bleach TYBW Arc
>So now you have a humanity with powers/anomalous abilities
>A malfunction with portable portal device causes a male solider to end up being pulled and thrown from his omniverse to an omniverse were males are rare and humans are the most desirable or something
>Now you got a supped up male human with the mindset of a space marine from 40k trying to get back home stuck with human loving xenos whom try to subdue the "damaged" human for his own protection no matter what reality/universe he goes to.

>Destiny Multiverse
>Male human guardian(Your choice of class)
>Ends up in another reality due to Vex shenanigans
>In this reality anthros coexist under the traveler with humanity
>Problem being that only females could become guardians

>So here he is, a MALE and GUARDIAN
>If the city don't drag his back, the plethora of other races will
>Becoming a sex slave to big busty Eliksni and Cabal does sound good

>"Anon apparently thinks he has a vagina and wants to become a pilot"
>Jamie gets up startled
>"What!? Anon is this true!?"

>Jamie growls out
>"You are too precious to be put into such a dangerous place! Your place is in the home raising young!"

>I cower under the order
>Jamie sighs before turning her gaze to my sis.
>"I was going to gift you this when you turned 18. But your brother's apparent foolishness has forced my hand
>My father's eye's widen in realization, before turning his gaze towards me in... sympathy?
>"From this day foward, Anon belongs to you. You shall protect, care, and rear children with him."

>My sister on the other hand...
