Tech Terror Story
TT #2: Trickle Down Rumors
>To many in the Concord of Saviors, Split Hare was a humorous type that helped keep things from getting too serious
>She played her fair share of pranks, cracked jokes, and was always up for fun with the rest of the girls
>So when she came in with a hunk of junk vaguely resembling the head of a robotic villain that had eluded capture for a while, everyone waited for the punchline
>As she told her peers about what happened the previous night, they wondered why she didn't start laughing along with them, instead looking like she was quite serious
>The first to break the awkward air around what was perceived as stilted humor was Floodgate, a Beluga with control over all liquids
>"Hare dear," the aquatic mammal said with a twinge of concern, "you are just practicing your poker face, aren't you?"
>The rabbit shook her head, showing her and the rest of any onlookers the inside of what was once the high tech helmet
>"You know I can't keep a straight face very long, just look at this!" she said as she pointed inside the helm, "Tech Terror isn't a robot, or even an Anthro!"
>Murmurs made their way through the small crowd that had now formed, all with their own theories of what the villain was
>Some of the more confident members of the group asked to see the helmet, to which the speedster obliged them
>"Why is it so busted up?" a rat asked, "I don't smell anything other than metal n' burnt plastics!"
>"Yeah, what gives?" a snake agreed after trying her method of 'sniffing', giving the helmet back
>"It may have blown up a bit back when I tried picking it up," Hare says as she recalled the self destruct
>It kicked in shortly after she had touched it, starting to vibrate slightly
>She couldn't risk collateral damage, so she had to bring it under the nearby lake
>It wasn't too big of an explosion, but it had warped the inside to a terrible degree, making it very hard to determine what shape the helm was supposed to have
>And on top of that, bringing it underwater had help strip it of anything those with gifted scent could use to confirm or deny her claims
>No one would blame her for how she handled it, dealing with bombs in as quick and safe a manor as possible was part of the job description
>This however did nothing to make her less embarrassed with herself, what little proof she may have had being wiped away by her own doing
>It seemed as though nobody would believe her
>That was, until a curious observer made herself known
>A blood hound who went by Dogmata, armed to the teeth in gadgets and gizmos for any occasion, not unlike the villain in question
>Very stern, always focused, one hell of a tracker
>And one of Split Hare's long time friends
>"Hare, may I?" asked the canine
>She nodded and gave her the helmet
>"Think you can work some magic?" the rabbit asked hopefully
>Dogmata didn't respond, already at work with some form of multitool
>For a moment, nobody said a word, all eyes and ears were upon her
>Then with a click, the face plate popped open
>"Interesting..." she said took a look at the less damaged portion that had been revealed
>The crowd was starting to get antsy while they waited for the master investigator's findings
>Only to get disappointed when she shook her head, saying it was inconclusive
>She promised to take it to her lab and get results
>Everyone began to disperse from the area, but Dogmata gestured for Split Hare to follow
>They both went to a secluded area in the giant building
>Split Hare asked what was up, garnering a frown from the somewhat surly dog
>"Jane," she said with her arms crossed, "do you know what you've just done?"
>The speedster had no idea what she meant, but knew the answer wouldn't be a good one since Dogmata had just used her real name
>"You just announced to everyone that there is a human super villain out there. Do you really think all of them will just keep quiet about this?"
>Not fully understanding the reason this might be a bad thing, Split Hare, or Jane rather, instead focused on something else
>"Does this mean that you believe me?" she said, almost dizzily ignoring the issue that was posed
>The hound sighs in annoyance
>"Even if it makes no sense whatsoever," she admitted, "I trust you not to make something like this up."
>She shook her head, looking down at the helmet
>"Regardless of that," she said in a much more serious tone, "word WILL get out now, and what do you think will happen when a bunch of thugs and psychopaths with super powers hear about it?"
>When contextualized like this, the real problem finally became apparent to the now wide-eyed heroine, simply saying "Oh" in realization
>Dogmata set the helmet down, patting her pal on the back
>"It will be fine," the dog said in an effort to soothe, "we're just going to need to get to him first."
>This cheered up the rabbit, bringing her back to her usual demeanor
>"Now," Dogmata said as her informative visor dropped over her eyes, "let's find a way to force a confrontation."
>As the two superheroes started to form a strategy with some other friends in their circle, Dogmata's theory was made reality
>Within the day, some of the greener heroes had decided to hunt after information about Tech Terror possibly being a human
>This of course meant interrogation of other criminals
>They knew nothing of the sort obviously, but ended up in jail with others who had the same thing asked of them
>Low level gangsters talked with each other, boastful that even they could take on a super if it was a human
>This caught the ears of those with affiliation to villains, dirty cops and enforcers alike
>Rumors were like a wildfire, growing out of control as more participants joined in
>'Maybe this Tech guy stole his stuff from Dogmata', 'What if it's actually a shapeshifter?', 'Maybe she's a demon who stole some poor bastard's body'
>It happened like this all the way up the tree, until those who were truly dangerous had been informed
>Those especially dangerous being the criminal syndicate known as Dark Chimera
>Deep within their stronghold located in the center of a dormant volcano, they were in the middle of a meeting to discuss possible targets for their next operation
>Ideas included weather machines, invoking dark sorceries, political subterfuge, the bread and butter of evil
>When it seemed as though all the options had been laid out, a shark asked to include another
>Primevil, the only true chimera of the group as well as its leader, allowed the addition
>Riptide of the Depths slid photos around the table of a mid grade supervillain
>"I was recently informed of an up and rising supervillain." said the shark as she had the various shots of Tech Terror put on the big screen
>They were all taken from the bank where his heist had failed
>"He's been shown to have aptitude with all forms of technology, and there is little evidence he even exists". she said while using a laser pointer to draw attention to various sections of the photos
>"Excuse me seabreath," said a rabbit in gear resembling that of Split Hare, "did you just say 'He'?"
>The shark decided to let the childish insult off with a sneer, this time at least
>"That's right, I said he," explained the now somewhat irritated villainess, "I have reason to believe this is a man."
>Those in the meeting all began to pay more attention, leaning in
>"Many of my servants have heard that heroes have been rousting whoever they can, all asking about this thing right here being a human" she said elaborated, circling the image on screen for emphasis
>"So what?" questioned the same impudent rabbit, "I like a good shag like anyone else, but what are we gonna do with some skinny in a mech that we couldn't do before?"
>The leader slammed her huge claw on the table
>"s i l e n c e w h e l p" came the ethereal words of the chimera, speaking not with vocal cords, but straight into the mind of the rabbit
>The mental intrusion made the upstart mammal quiet, Primevil nodding for the shark to finish
>"We could always use someone who can keep things quiet," said the shark while glaring back at the dull colored rabbit, "and if all else fails, he would make for a grand bargaining chip."
>Questions circulated in an organized fashion under the gaze of the Primevil
>The shark took them all and addressed them like one would at a business meeting
>Q: How would we get him to join us?
>A: Blackmail of course. He seems to be going after very specific targets, so if we can narrow down what he is after, we can get at them before he does. Force him to come to us.
>Q: What worth does he have to the Concord?
>A: Going off of what my minions have told me, many of its members are very interested in this one. The reasons why don't matter as much as the fact they want him, and we'll have him.
>Q: Who gets to have him?
>A: This is not important to our operation. If you really can't help yourself, clear it with everyone else first. As with all our other endeavors, pleasure comes after business.
>"That should be all for the moment," said Riptide as she finished her proposal, "thanks for your time."
>A vote was counted for which projects would be put forward, with 11 of 13 votes giving the green light to Riptides proposal
>Thus, by the end of the day after his secret was laid bare, Tech Terror found himself with a worldwide target on his back
>He knew what his prior failure would bring forth, it would be inevitable in this world
>This could all be avoided, a simple life could be his at any moment if he just stopped right now
>But that same burning sense of pride and ambition that brought him so far wouldn't have it
>His greatness would once again be admired, he would once again be an icon, an aspiration
>There would be no substitutes for someone like him, his superiority would be acknowledged
>With that thought helping him along, he continued toiling away in his workshop, working towards making sure his victory was assured
>This was the only way
>The rest of the leaders of the Concord were all made aware of the situation from Split Hare and Dogmata, and although they also had a hard time believing it at first, that didn't stop them from readying a capture
>The man was drawn to the Arkanian Relic, which Split Hare had recovered after their confrontation
>From her other accounts, he had stolen various other specific items
>Nothing was known about what purpose they served, but they were all unobtainable anywhere else, including the most recent target
>The answer for them was simple then; set up a honeypot with the gemstone, then fall in when he took the bait
>Dogmata had cameras all surrounding the perimeter of the predetermined bank on separate networks, all made to look as civilian and nondescript as possible
>She had also taken the liberty of making more Energy Signature Triangulators for the rest of the team, making them shielded from E.M.P.s to avoid a repeat of last time
>Lastly, they had chosen a bank located in the territory of a few novice heroes to help sell the facade
>All the pieces had been set, they only thing missing was the quarry to spring the trap
>A month had passed in the blink of the eye, during which nothing had happened
>The greenhorn heroes had continued grilling other criminals about Tech Terror, more and more were alerted to his presence
>So when action had finally come about, chaos ran wild
>The Relic was once again out in the wild, but something felt off to the villain
>He couldn't place it, so he had his scout drone look at not only the bank, but everything in the area
>All of it was exceedingly average, but the twinge of paranoia was still present, and so he poured over all the information he gathered
>Then he noticed a pattern in the security cameras on buildings around the bank and a few blocks outside of it
>Despite them all being for regular businesses, they looked brand new
>He had his drone attempt to splice into one of their feeds, but it was blocked
>This wasn't right, consumer brand cameras were notoriously easy to hack
>His eyes widened in horror as he noticed the drone's output was starting to be traced
>He hit the self destruct protocol and sunk into his large chair as it severed connection with him, rocketing into the atmosphere before exploding
>He knew at that moment what was going on, and it meant he would have to delay his plans even more now
>Just upgrading his regular arsenal wouldn't cut it, he was dealing with the rest of the big shot heroes now, not just Split Hare
>So back to the drafting table he went
>It was grueling work for one person to do, supergenius or not
>But he wasn't taking any chances with his future
>He had to be on top of every possibility, every failure had to be stamped out, every danger to his success purged
>If he couldn't do this quiet, there was no reason to continue as though it was a possibility
>But as he scrapped idea after idea, a spark of brilliance struck
>Why let it be himself vs the world?
>Why be a dreadnaught when you could be a legion?
>And so he slaved for the next three weeks
>He would have preferred much more time, but there was an emergency
>The bank was already being attacked
>Goat Squad of Dark Chimera had begun their assault on the bank
>It consisted of LagoLess, inverse of Split Hare, Riptide, and Baphomet, dark spellcaster and the leader of the squad
>Civilians, anthro and human alike, had been corralled into the lobby and tied up
>Baphomet prepared a gateway to cross into the vault while the other two kept watch for any issues
>A smooth and easy job, just like they liked it
>That is, until the large front doors on the building had shot off their hinges in a shower of water
>Before they knew it, their hostages were disappearing in a blur
>It was only LagoLess who could perceive her eternal rival, seething in rage at her appearance
>She bolted after her without care for anything else, the two speedsters clashing once again in a way few could see clearly
>Through the destroyed doors came the huge whale Floodgate, both of the aquatic animals growling upon seeing the other
>"What are YOU doing here?" they both said to each other
>"You're ruining everything!" they both yelled at each other
>"ENOUGH." they both screamed as they rushed towards the other in a torrent of water
>"Team, what's wrong?" asked Baphomet as she continued her ritual, not able to take her eyes off of the spell she was preparing
>"Team?"
>When no response came, she had to drop her concentration and let the spell fizzle out to find out what was going on
>Her rectangular pupils dilated in shock as the saw a stream of heroes flood in through the busted down doors
>She tapped upon her dark crystal necklace, sending a message back to HQ
>"This is Goat Squad, we are in need of backup immediately!" she voiced with great urgency, almost bleating
>Primevil responded telepathically from the great distance, receiving no answer from the spellcaster as she found herself in battle
>She then tried to contact the other members of the group, having no difference in the result
>Left with no other option, the chimera scrambled both Snake Squad and Lion Squad for a rescue, grumbling under her breath as they were deployed
>By the time Tech Terror had made his way to the bank, there was a small scale war between the two different organizations
>Not only that, but it seemed non affiliated heroes and villains had joined in as well
>This was very distressing for him as he drew near, so many variables to account for, the capacity for that accursed randomness was sky high
>But when he thought about the circumstances more, he realized it could be a boon to his efforts, not a hindrance
>If he could play his cards right, he might be able to get away with the Arkanian Relic while they were busy pushing each others snouts in
>He decided to descend from the ceiling, hopefully avoiding the majority of the massive fight he could see from the lobby and street
>His entourage of AI controlled helpers followed his lead, helping him laser out a hole in the ceiling
>They all flew through the hole they had made, immediately working the vulnerabilities of the massive vault door
>A few from each side had noticed the third party as the massive vault was opened, informing the others of his presence
>The novice heroes that the territory actually belonged to were the first to get at him
>Tech Terror relegated finding what he came for to his upgraded drones, devoting all of his attention to the approaching supers
>A flying wolf announced herself with grand gestures, the two other supers at her side
>"Lucky us, this is that so called human supervillain!" said the boisterous wolf while hovering just above the ground
>"So called?" queried the filtered voice, "Why make the distinction?"
>The small group of three giggled
>"You know anthros have humans beat in every category! Come on, just give yourself up, we'll make sure you get some leniency if ya do."
>The wolfess folded her arms thinking that he would consider her words
>Perhaps it was their inexperience, maybe even some ingrained feeling of entitlement to the obedience of the men they protected, but they really believed he had surrendered when he put his hands in the air
>Of course, that made what came next even easier
>His suit's hands took the shape of claws, extending at breakneck speed towards the two closest heroes
>Neither were expecting it, so they could only flail about when the claws grabbed them by the face
>"Hmphphphph!" they both cried out
>Out of a small dispenser in the palm of the metal hands came a potent knock out gas, the struggles from the heroes ceasing soon after
>Letting the unconscious heroes hit the ground as his arms retracted back to his side, Tech Terror turned to the remaining hero who was standing in awe of his unparalleled ingenuity
>Or so he wished was the case
>"W-What did you do to them?" the slightly shaken heroine asked as she looked upon her comrades unmoving forms
>The metal man waved off the question, saying "Nothing much, they'll just feel numb when they wake up."
>He then assumed a more aggressive pose, pointing at her indignantly
>"Shall I do the same for you?"
>The heroine, also a wolf, snarled at the notion
>"As if! Human or not, I won't hold back!"
>The wolf leapt at the villain with her fists raised and her super sharp energy claws out
>The fight was of average length to some, but to the two speedsters it was a slugfest
>Blow for blow, tit for tat, the fight went on at a ludicrous speed
>Their speed made every hit thunderous
>The two were almost evenly matched
>But in the end, Split Hare stood over her dark reflection victorious
>Sore, but victorious
>Despite her hard fought win, she found herself very peeved at the situation
>The whole operation was going belly up, the wrong people took the bait
>She had wanted the best chances of bringing in that misguided man with as little resistance as possible
>But after today's fiasco, it was very possible he would stay under wraps
>That was the case, until she had received a transmission from Dogmata
>"Hey 'Mata, what's up?" she asked into her transceiver as she prepared special cuffs for LagoLess
>"Looks like our target still came around. Get over as soon as you can."
>The speedster breathed a sigh of relief, confirming she would be there
>She grabbed LagoLess and ferried her to the closest prison she could at lightning speed
>Though she would often make small talk with prison staff, she had no time to faff about today
>With haste, she made her way back to the bank
>Things were going relatively well for the machine marauder
>His bots had gotten the gemstone, and any who were foolish enough to not take him seriously had found themselves on the ground
>That wasn't to say this was a flawless victory by any means
>His trusty shoulder cannon was ripped off in a moment he was outnumbered, and he'd used up many of his ammunitions
>But even then, the pile of supers grew, and he hadn't even needed to bust out the big guns yet
>He and his bots flew back through the hole in the ceiling, only to be greeted by a fist to the face
>As he shook it off, he looked upon the perpetrator
>"Dogmata," the robotic voice said as the metal shell it came from assumed a defensive stance, "I had a feeling I'd see you here."
>The bloodhound had also taken up a stance of her own
>"It was supposed to be a surprise," the canine responded with a trained lack of emotion, "I take it you knew we would be here?"
>The supervillain scoffed at the remark
>"Of course I did, especially after my last encounter with that blasted rabbit. Speaking of which..."
>The suit turned suddenly to the side, a millisecond later catching the speedy fist of a very surprised Split Hare in its' large metal hands
>"Wha?" was all she could say before being tossed away, getting caught mid-air by Dogmata
>"I am afraid that won't work on me again." the villain said in his filtered voice
>The rabbit was left dumbstruck, while the blood hound maintained a cool and collected composure
>"How did you see me coming?" the hero asked with bewilderment
>From inside the suit, Tech Terror grinned
>No one could see this of course
>"That's the best part, I didn't!" he said with glee, evident even through his artificial voice
>He then realized what he was doing thanks to his interactions with other supers and villains in the past, stopping himself from elaborating any further
>Having stood back up on her feet, Split Hare began thumping the ground in annoyance
>"That doesn't make any sense!" she said as rushed forward into a flurry of blows, with Dogmata close behind
>Every single punch she threw, every kick she let loose, all were blocked and deflected with ease by the suit
>As this was happening, Tech Terror noticed that it seemed that the force behind the attacks was less than he had experienced before
>Before he could continue the train of thought, Dogmata had gotten up to him and somehow flipped him onto his back
>For him to be able to keep up with Split Hare, yet also not be able to react to the significantly slower throw, this confused both of the heroes
>Using his thrusters to propel himself into the air, Tech Terror hovered far above the ground
>He prepared to use a rocket salvo, but was forced to react to a lightning fast jump kick by the suit's programing
>A grave error in the strategy he came up with arose, and it wasn't just him that noticed
>As long as his suit automatically defended against Split Hare, he couldn't use anything else in his arsenal, nor pay attention to any advances by Dogmata
>His suit was getting hammered by the duo's efforts
>The dire situation he found himself in called for his trump card
>Still able to command his drones via voice, he called out "Strike bots! Triple Trouble!"
>His swarm of helpers came together, linking themselves to one another magnetically
>What was once one hundred and twenty little drones became three robots equal in stature and appearance to Tech Terror
>They then came after Dogmata, forcing her away from the fight at hand
>This left Split Hare and Tech Terror to fight by themselves
>"Why are you doing any of this? Why fight us TT?" the rabbit asked as she continued fighting
>Amidst all the fighting, the science supreme skirted around the question, instead saying "Oh, I get a nickname now?"
>Dogmata was slowly losing her ground to the bots, and Split Hare found the fatigue from her prior battle start to wear on her speed
>It all seemed to be going badly for the veteran heroes, until a burst of water erupted from the hole in the ceiling
>Emerging from it was Floodgate and an armadillo with a shell fashioned to look like a medieval knight
>They didn't quip or say anything, they instead got right into the fight with the bots
>This was the edge they needed, gaining ground on the machines
>Tech Terror could see where this fight would heading if it continued from a mile away, it wasn't one in his favor
>He might hold ground now, but more would join in as time went on
>He had to fold right now
>He disabled his RACE (Rapid Acceleration Counter Engine) long enough to key in his lair's coordinates for his teleporter
>This led to him taking some attacks straight on, but it was necessary
>He also ordered his bots to do the same
>None of the heroes knew what was going to happen except Split Hare
>"No! Don't do this! We can help you!" she said as she tried her best to get at the teleporter, failing to do so
>With a sharp crackle of energy, the teleporter field surrounded the villain and his inorganic minions
>"Who said I wanted your help?" said the man in the machine before a flash had whisked him and the bots away
>Split Hare, physically drained from everything, came over to check on her equally tired friend
>"Are you alright?" she asked as the bloodhound pulled out her teleporter tracker
>"I'll be fine," the gadgeteer said gruffly, "But we may have a problem."
>She showed the fleet footed rabbit her tracker
>There were 121 individual teleportation locations
>Split Hare's jaw dropped
>"That's... quite a lot." she said simply
>The blood hound put away the tracker, offering a pat on the back to her now saddened friend
>"Don't worry about that too much, we'll come up with a new plan. We made some big arrests today anyway."
>She pointed at the police vans picking up the member of Dark Chimera
>"Besides," she said as she reached into one of her many pouches, "he'll still be after this won't he?"
>She pulled out the Arkanian Relic with a slight smile
>The mastermind pounded his observation table in anger, what he had thought to be the gemstone cracking even further
>A fake
>He was certain, 100% CERTAIN that he had the real deal
>It had to have been during the fight, there was no other point it could have been switched
>That mutt had to have swiped it from him before his bots came into the picture
>It was all enough to make a lesser man cry in anguish, seethe in anger
>But that wasn't the man he was
>This was all just the result of a panic reaction
>Yeah, that's right, it was that other group of bozos that forced his hand early
>He hadn't failed, merely just a trial run of his technology
>...
>He knew was kidding himself, another big blunder
>Chance had forced him to acknowledge his own fallibility once again
>If he could, he would strangle the very concept with his bare hands
>But he hadn't the time to cry over spilled milk, nor his inability to defy the chaotic entity known as chance
>His bot diversion would only distract them for so long, he had to get moving
>Even without the final component, the machine in its' penultimate condition would help him
>He wired the thing to his lair, allowing it 20 minutes to charge up
>Then he pressed the big red button
>With a synthetic hum, he and his lair both zapped out of reality for a moment, abandoning the secluded area beneath the mountains for a new hideout
>This would not be over
Split Hare #227: An Anthro's Duty
>Yesterday came and went
>I got to see some real action, we all made tons of arrests, and celebrations were in order
>We all were at the Concord sanctum's lounge, living it up
>Even that grumpy old dog Debbie was up to some drinking with the others
>But even with everyone in high spirits, I couldn't shake those last words from TT from replaying over and over in my head
>"Who said I wanted your help?"
>Even though he still used that modulator, it wasn't difficult to imagine how it would sound in his true voice
>"Who said I wanted your help?"
>Gah, how could he even say that? Does he really not know what could happen to him?
>"Who said I wa-"
>I am released from my inner thoughts as someone taps my shoulder
>Looking over, I see it's Armordillo with a martini in hand
>"You okay Hare? Saw you looking all lonesome over here."
>I give her a half hearted smile and thumbs up, not even fooling myself
>She breathes heavily as she smashes down into the seat across from me
>That heavy metal shell must really take it out of her sometimes
>"Something on your mind?"
>Well, yeah
>"Oh it's nothing Arma, just thinking back to yesterday, that's all."
>She seemed to be waiting for me to go on, but I didn't
>It dragged for a bit, but she eventually called over the bar tender
>"Can I get another one of these?" she said while pointing to her drink
>She looked back over to me as the drink was being made
>"Still thinking about him huh?"
>Right on the money
>I nodded, not really caring to avoid it or anything
>"I get how you're feeling girl, nobody here really wants to talk about it much."
>We both looked across the lounge over to a small but loud group of rookies, each with a guy on their arm
>"Well, most of us at least." she added on
>The bartender slides the second martini over to her as she says this
>She downed the first really quickly, giving off a shudder and a silly face as she did
>It made me laugh, she really knew how to snap me out of a bad mood
>The second drink is gently nudged my way, the little skewered olive making a full rotation around the glass
>"Just don't let it get to you too much alright? We still need to be on our A game around him, human or not."
>I played around with the olive a bit, agreeing with her
>He was still a supervillain at the end of the day, he could really hurt others if he wasn't stopped
>But it was still hurting my head trying to wrap my mind around what would drive such a cute guy this way
>Even moreso that the only other person to keep up with my movements was a human of all things
>It was all just so much to take in for a short period of time
>I toasted the glass with my heavyweight friend and downed the drink just as fast as she had
>It was bitter and boozy, but whatever buzz it might have brought me disappeared just a few moments later
>Not a big problem since I didn't really drink, but having a hyper metabolism meant alcohol was little more than a social activity for me
>Armordillo hung out with me for the rest of the night, ordering a couple more drinks and trying to get me to unwind
>I had the rest put on my tab, least I could do since she was helping me to feel better
>After we part ways later into the night, I reflected on what she had said as I sat atop my usual spot on the highest building in the city
>She was right, I needed to come at the situation with clarity, I needed to be at my very best
>Whether or not I could save this guy all hinged on how I acted from here out, I couldn't let how I felt about it get in the way
>It's just... I... I couldn't bear the thought of another life being extinguished because of me
>I look down to my paw with a grimace
>My lightning hued gold and white fur
>A side effect from the accident that gave me my powers
>And a constant reminder of my failure
>Dammit TT, why are you putting yourself at risk like this?
>You must have someone that would miss you if things turned sour, why put their hearts in the firing range?
>I pull out the melted lab pen I carried with me always, reminiscing about him again
>John, I, I'm sorry I couldn't save you
>Tears nearly well up as I think back to the days before I was superhero
>Everything was so much more simple back then, when I was just a scientist
>You made even the most simple parts of research so fun John, you were the best assistant a girl could have asked for
>Your sweet smile always made coming in late less stressful, and you always had the best reactions when I messed up your soft brown hair
>And you were one of the few people who would actually have good bantz with me
>I just wish I had listened to you on that day
>I'm sorry
>...
>Oh geez, maybe drinking actually did still work a bit on me
>Dwelling on the past didn't really fit someone who was always moving forward, especially me
>Definitely the drink, nothing else
>I didn't feel any different though, I felt just fine
>And I knew just how insane my tolerance was since my last tour of Russia
>So it wasn't the alcohol then, but what was it?
>Maybe my worse half had really messed me up yesterday
>Bruises were all over before I had even gotten at TT after all
>I felt the back of my head under my cowl where that evil me had hit the hardest
>No pain, no soreness, no nothing
>My speedy healing meant the possibility this was brought on from the fight yesterday was thrown out the window
>Then why was I being so... so... reflective?
>This wasn't my style at all
>The chilly night wind made me twitch a bit
>It reminded me of the last time I confronted that tin can without it being alive
>Actually yeah, I only started feeling all weird when I found out he was a human
>This was his fault!
>That smooth face of his, those determined eyes, that soft brown hair
>If things were different, I might have even asked him out
>Though that might just be because he reminded me of John a bit, but he was a real cutie
>Wait... why did I just think he reminded me of John?
>Yeah, the brown hair was a given, but was there more?
>I focused more on what I saw that night
>The helmet came off and I saw his face clearly, but I couldn't think over the initial shock
>I compared what I remembered against each other
>Down the list, feature for feature, I found myself more and more aghast
>The hair styling
>The shape of the nose
>Those eyes
>That voice I should have recognized immediately
>"John!?" I couldn't help but blurt out in the open to nobody
>How the hell didn't I realize sooner?
>How the BLOODY hell hadn't I known who you were the second I saw you?
>I stood up and immediately started sprinting to Graceful Fields Graveyard
>There was no need to blame myself just yet, I could afford to cut some slack
>After all, why would I assume he would just be walking around when I attended the funeral?
>In a speed fast even for me, I was at the headstone within moments
>Well maintained, no signs of disturbance
>I cursed myself under my breath for what I was about to do, but I had to be sure
>Grabbing a shovel, I excavated the grave in mere seconds
>One grizzly sight later, I had a few hair follicles in my possession and a nauseating need to vomit
>Though not of the religious sort, I still felt the need to offer an apology
>Both to John(?), and to the god of all anthros, Anima
>At a slightly slower speed due to the queasiness, I rapidly refilled the grave
>With my little macabre visit taken care of, I rushed back to the Concord
>The lab was of easy access to a founder like me, so I had the analyser at work on the hair in a jiffy
>Unbeknownst to me, Dogmata was already in here
>Even with as long as I have known her, I still couldn't find her unless she wanted to announce herself
>"Late time lab usage? What's the occasion" she said from behind me
>I was flustered by the sudden voice and found myself stammering
>"O-oh D-dogm-mata! You know, just s-some normal heroing!" I lamely said as I leaned against the computer table
>She stared at me blankly before squinting
>"Is that so?"
>She tried to look at the screen behind me, with me blocking her view as much as possible
>"I would think 'normal heroing' would mean you wouldn't mind me looking at it" she said with a twinge of annoyance as I kept moving in front of her
>"No no! I have got it handled perfectly! No need to help little ol me!"
>She eventually gave up, instead pulling a pair of goggles over her eyes
>"Oh..." she said, somehow seeing the results
>I couldn't help but look back myself, not sure of the answer I wanted to see
>The computer had pulled up the citizen record of the hair's owner
>The picture in it perfectly matched the face I saw that night
>And it was associated to him
>John D., Assistant Physicist
>And in bold lettering
>Deceased, DOD: XX/XX/XXXX
>My stomach lurched as I read that
>So that body was really him
>Sorry again buddy
>"I didn't mean to pry Jane, I apologize"
>Dogmata tried leaving, but I stopped her by grabbing her shoulder
>"It's alright Debbie, it's not personal"
>I directed her attention back to the screen with my finger
>"It really is detective work"
>"Then, does that mean..."
>I sighed as I nodded in confirmation
>"It does. That man, or something that looks like that man, is Tech Terror"
>Having learned my lesson from last time, me and Dogmata kept this information close to ourselves
>She gave me some of her rarely distributed praise for my investigation
>It was an actual honor to be sure
>She and I worked hard to find any camera sightings of him after the date of the incident
>Five years after the incident, two years ago was the next time he was seen
>We had him in our sights, rapidly making a file of known locations
>A few nights of overtime later, we were ready to get back to being proactive in our search
>All we had to do was find him with the help of the info we had gathered, and then form a concentrated capture mission
>I was equal parts anxious and excited everyone in our trusted group was let in on the situation and given tasks to complete
>Upon my request, I was given the largest share of the work
>Clone, evil twin, replicant robot, it didn't matter
>Whoever/Whatever he ended up being didn't matter much to me
>I just knew that I might have a second chance to make things right
>I owed it to him at least
>Finding him was my mission, I would be at the forefront of this operation
>It turned out that I had the easiest job in the end
>Because as we neared the end of the meeting, the metal behemoth himself came crashing through the walls, trailed by a group of three
>I didn't recognize the other two immediately, but one of them was Primevil, leader of Dark Chimera
>Lucky us
TT #4: The Amalgamation's Invitation
>Tech Terror, inventor without compare in this realm, was very particular about certain things
>He refused to wear mismatched socks
>Whenever he found himself using a soldering iron, he would hum a tune he remembered from his humbler days
>And he really, really despised tropical weather
>Particularly the wet seasons
>So when the best location to move his lair was an uninhabited island near the equator, a sour look washed over his unamused face
>The heat and humidity was absolutely awful, even within his lair
>He cranked the AC as high as it would go and got back to tip tapping away at his super computer
>The comfort it provided did little to make this relocation any less annoying, but there wasn't any use in droning on and on about it
>The logical action was to learn from his mistakes, figure out what didn't work, and correct it the next time
>Use the good ol' scientific method
>He reviewed the memory banks of the drones he brought with him and made notes whenever he had an idea, or when an observation needed to be made
>Those drones each had a copy of one of his most brilliant inventions, even before he had gotten into this larger than life business
>Able to passively gain so much information from everything around them, his All-Sensors were a marvel
>They were also the last thing he had made before he was forcibly torn from his world, left to rot in this one
>So he also had a bit of a soft spot for them, regardless of their function
>That wasn't to say that the stats and raw data they provided were minor by any means
>In fact, he could probably use them to come up with a counter to every super that the drones had a chance to analyse
>Yes, this was the way to victory, this would be his sal-
>*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*
>Someone was at his door
>...
>Someone was at his door?
>The realization hit the mechanist like stone in the gut
>Someone was at his door!
>He had his outer perimeter cameras all look to the comically large blast doors
>Little surprised him anymore, even the huge animal women became just another part of life
>But that thing that was on his monitor?
>It warranted a double take at the very least
>The creature was covered in black and grey everything
>Fur, scales, feathers, skin, you could find it all
>And even that was small in comparison to the appendages it had
>A gigantic claw reminiscent of a crab took the cake when it came to that, followed by the gigantic mismatch pair of wings sprouting from the back
>Not sure what to do yet, the somewhat confused observer pressed the comms button
>"Hello? What do you want?" he asked while making sure to use his voice filter
>The creature turned its two primary eyes towards the camera angle he was looking at
>It spoke to him, not via his two-way door comm, but directly into his mind
>"H m m... S o y o u a r e o u r n e w n e i g h b o r" came the unearthly, yet feminine voice
>The foreign presence was strangely soothing on a more base level for him, making him feel more at ease
>Perhaps she was here on friendly terms, maybe she would be willing to help him in his plight
>All he had to do was do a favor or two for her
>All he had to do was let her in so she could help
>Let her in
>L e t m e i n
>This snapped him out of the almost trance like state he realized he had been put into, his hand hovering over the door unlock button
>But he could still feel her telepathic tendrils clawing at the back of his mind
>Shaking off her influence for a brief moment was all he needed though
>He put on his helmet once more, saying aloud "Activate Psycho Shield!"
>The helmet started to emit a frequency that blocked out any errant brainwaves, putting the attempted hypnosis to an end
>He had a well deserved sigh of relief before turning his attention back to the hostile entity
>"That wasn't very polite. State your business and leave, or else."
>He armed the sentries and had them all pointed at the would be mind rapist
>The female creature gave a small look of surprise, or what might look like surprise
>It was hard to tell with all the features she had
>"Curious, few can resist me." she said instead with her mouth
>She grinned an impossibly large grin with rows of teeth belonging to various different species
>"In that case, you are cordially invited join the ranks of Dark Chimera, lover boy <3"
>The tone she used would be almost sweet if it didn't feel like it was laced with cyanide
>"We are just over there, deep inside the abandoned volcano. We'll have lots of fun yeah?"
>She continued grinning, but gave an ominous glare at the camera
>"I would strongly hope you do so within three days."
>She turns away from the doors takes to the skies with her wings in a mighty gust
>'Lover boy' knew the implication of the title
>She accessed his mind long enough to know he was a guy
>There was no way of telling just what other information she had helped herself to in that time
>She could know his real name, his aliases, schematics for his inventions
>Even his long term plan, which he had spent so long working towards, could be subject to the breach in mental privacy
>He really started to freak out, smashing an empty mug against the floor, ripping up some documents, punting a chair
>The blood rushed around his body, making him feel flushed as the anger circulated
>He grit his teeth together as he felt himself almost sobbing
>This was all just so tiring for him, he actually felt exhausted from it
>He let himself slink into his chair
>The cleaner bots got to work fixing the mess while he cooled off
>"Deep breaths, deep breaths" he muttered to himself while holding a hand behind his neck
>Once he had regained enough composure to act like himself, he sent out a drone to confirm what the creature feature had said
>It buzzed towards the volcano, descending slowly but surely through the top
>There, in the base of the sleeping mountain, was a fortress
>Not a holdout, not a compound, not even a lair
>A full on fortress, a complex, spread over the entirety of the dead mountain's inner floor
>This wasn't just some run of the mill band of baddies
>Some simple research into that name drop left the bot builder belligerent
>Dark Chimera, the most dangerous criminal organization in the world
>Their whereabouts unknown to any who were not within their group
>And he had just taken the move in special right down the block from them
>That bastard known as chance was surely having a great laugh right about now, alongside his mentally stunted sister dumb luck
>Whatever he had done to earn their ire felt like it could never compare to all the misery they had caused him
>Ever since that day years ago, it was just non-stop
>Whenever he felt like he had control of life again, it was taken back again
>He recalled the drone and got back to work, trying to find a way to get the base teleported again before then
>Even if fate itself conspired against him, he would never kneel to another
>Tech Terror didn't work for anyone
>Tech Terror didn't work with anyone
>The only thing he could trust in was himself, it's almost always been that way
>What a bunch of baloney, thinking he would be threatened into servitude
>He would sooner join those schmoes in spandex that treat him like some lost child
>Maybe then he could get closer to the relic
>Yeah, wouldn't that be nice
>Oh... oh yes, oh that's good
>In his misfortune, he might have just found the secret path to success
>Yes, YES
>He could see the plan all coming together, he could finally make out the puzzle's bigger picture
>The need to have the base teleport sooner was gone, replaced by a new primary objective
>So once again, he put his extensive knowledge to the task, devising just how he would pull off this giant scam
>The very gracious offer Primevil had given the uppity man was left lying on the table without any response, but she knew he would take it
>She attended other matters of business while the clock made rounds, confident he would come crawling into her hands
>Yes, if this 'Tech Terror' was half as smart as he presented himself, he would pledge allegiance with his superiors
>The first day passed
>No worries, she did give him three to think it over
>Much more than the singular one she typically gave for her other demands
>He would come
>The second day passed
>Still no sign of him
>There was a sighting of one of his machines in the volcano, so he knew just where they were
>Day three was nearly up
>Primevil's well of patience was starting to dry up
>She wasn't angry just yet
>It was all fine, the world of supers was full of situations where the clock almost runs out
>A narrow window was something to be expected, maybe that was his game
>Yes, all just tradition of a sort
>Day three had ended
>The honey badger part of her had shown itself
>Nobody denied her what she wanted and came out unscathed
>Especially not some fucking human playing with the big girls
>Primevil didn't let the white hot anger she had bleed over into her mental speech
>She had two others go with her to teach this good for nothing skinny a lesson in the pecking order
>Before he shook off her mental invasion, she learned of that huge teleporter he had that had brought his base here
>She had no idea why, but something about it was of great importance to him
>In other words, it would make for great leverage
>Under her guidance, they all approached the wall of his base that had the teleporter behind it, each using their powers to destroy it
>From out of the rubble came an energy blast, knocking Feather Fiend, one of the two that accompanied her, away
>"I'd ask that you not do any unscheduled renovation" came the artifical voice from behind the smoke cloud
>Out stepped the mechanical menace, decked out in all sorts of armaments and assisted by a swathe of drones
>Primevil attempted to snake her way into his mind again, only to feel a jolt of electricity
>This did nothing more than piss her off, the volts little more than a slight tingle
>"You were warned you miserable man," the monstrosity was forced to say physically, "nobody says no to Dark Chimera!"
>With his oversized metal fingers, Tech Terror gestured 'Come on'
>"Watch me."
>He and his drones blasted off at great speed with their thrusters, leaving the trio in the dust
>The teleporter was left right there for the taking, they didn't need to follow
>And yet, the audacity on show demanded that Primevil do so
>She sent out a telepathic order back to the stronghold to make off with the machine while they were out, before giving chase
>The beats of her unnatural wings were ferocious, so much so that her flunkies had a hard time keeping up
>The drones whizzed around harassing their master's targets however they could
>Their constant poking and prodding did nothing to hinder the juggernaut at the front, only serving to fan the flame
>He was taking them for a ride, all the way from the equator to North America
>Though he had kept a large lead on them through the journey, it was slipping
>Punishment was at hand as Primevil closed the gap, her appearance on the line
>He suddenly stopped midair while over a city, instead turning to tackle the pissed off chimera head on
>The surprise was massive, but the actual impact against her was minimal
>Both of their tag along companions caught up, to the sight of a total clash
>Boss vs boss, with some occasional back and forth from the respective underlings
>Primevil kept making use of her many unnatural advantages and appendages, intent on breaking her opponent
>But for every trick she used, every strength she brought to the table, the damned human in a can had a response
>Though it was a short amount of time afforded to him, Primevil gave him just what he needed without knowing it three days ago
>A perfect still scan
>He wouldn't have time to make anything specific for any other supers that might have joined the fray, but he could make an anti-Primevil suit
>Crush proof plating to withstand that massive claw
>An improved Psycho Shield to prevent any possibility of thought reading
>A variety of different smoke screens with different effects
>And all of it was only barely allowing him to keep pace with this freak of nature as she ramped up her onslaught
>"You pathetic little wretch!" she screamed as she whaled against him, "I'll rip and tear this shell from your worthless flesh!"
>He suddenly broke free of the devastating clash they were in, using a concussion blast to gain some breathing room
>"Oh I know," he said as he looked over his armor critically while also pushing a button on his suit, "I counted on it."
>He suddenly took off again, but backwards
>He was going down towards the city
>His flight path wasn't clear, there was a large and impressive building
>He was heading straight towards the Concord of Saviors at great speed
>The drones dispersed from the scene to the confusion of the other two, off to who knows where
>Primevil, still seeing red from her many perceived slights, followed without thinking about anything else
>She and her subordinates followed, through the hole he made in the heavy duty wall
>Only when she looked around her at the many different eyes did she see where she was
>And from within the confines of the huge battered suit, its operator smirked as everybody around him jumped into action
>It was all coming together
TT #5: Rehabilitation and Reflection
>It had been quite a spectacle when the seasoned villain had gone through with his fully intended crash
>He had a first row seat to the smackdown he had fully expected to see
>For the first minute at least, the high intensity fighting quickly moved away from where he could actually observe without giving himself away
>He would have loved to have seen more, so much so that he regretted not having a bot stick around to record the whole thing
>But the plan dictate that he focus on securing himself for later first
>He made sure the microphone to the outside was muted before confirming the last commands he would be able to give for a while
>Once his many bots droids and machine helpers had their orders, he gave himself a dose of knockout gas
>It would be required to sell the act
>He awoke sometime later laying in a medbay bed, deprived of his beloved armor and cuffed to the bed in multiple places
>Having been made for anthro use, the bed was queen size at least, a reminder to the villain of just how ill fitting he felt here
>As he observed his surroundings, a voice suddenly came from behind a privacy curtain
>"You're finally awake eh?"
>A clawed hand swiped the curtain to the side
>"Dogmata," the sciengineer derided, "come to gloat?"
>The canine superhero offered no reaction, instead pulling out a large manila folder
>"That's not my thing. Here, this is for you."
>She placed the folder on his midsection
>Tech Terror, being unable to even look at it due to his constraints, looked at the hero with mild disappointment
>"You'll be able to look over it once you are discharged, but there is one big thing to take away from it."
>He raised an eyebrow
>"Your criminal days are over."
>She stood up to leave, her large stature a reminder to the unequipped man just how huge most anthros really were compared to humans
>The dour dog stopped momentarily in the door frame
>"By the way, you have another visitor."
>As she said this, a familiar golden hued rabbit came through the door
>Dogmata briefly pat her on the back as she took her leave
>The speedster closed all windows and curtains around her and the then patient in an instant, taking a seat next to the bed
>"Heya TT, long time no see." said the hero in her old enthusiastic manner
>A quality that wasn't shared by the bed's occupant
>"What do you want? You guys already got me."
>She scooped up the folder from his chest and flipped through the pages at rapid speed
>"Well, I figured your probation officer should see you before it's official." she said as she showed a paper in the stack to him
>"...What." was all he could utter as he looked over the page she had pointed out
>Upon it read a few key details
>'John Decker will be placed under probation until an undetermined date in an effort to see if rehabilitation is possible'
>'Overseeing his rehabilitation will be one Jane Doe'
>Tech Terror curled his toes painfully as he struggled not to say anything that might indicate he was screaming on the inside
>He had absolutely no idea how they had gotten his real name, he never used it anymore, under any circumstance
>That was No No No.1, he would never make a blunder that huge
>With no ideas popping up of how that would be possible, he decided to leave that for now, focusing on the next big thing
>"Okay then, I'll bite. Who's this Jane Doe?"
>Jane Doe, the rabbit speedster right beside his bed, seemed a bit perturbed at the question
>"Hahah, oh right, I guess I am in outfit." the large lagomorph said with a sigh of relief
>She took off her cowl in front of the villain, staring intently at him as she awaited a response
>"Wow, you really just went and showed me your face. Why?"
>Not what she was hoping to hear, but she persisted
>"John, don't you remember me?" she asked with her cheerful tone slowly cracking into desperation, "It's me Jane, from the institute."
>The villain had intended to act in a particular way, but the confusion on his face was genuine
>Jane Doe from the institute?
>Was he supposed to know her?
>He hadn't worked at any institute during his time here
>Heck, the last time he was at an institute was before he even got involved with supers
>Back when he was allowed to be allowed on the right side of the law
>Back when he wanted to save others from freak happenstances like what happened to him and...
>No, it couldn't be could it?
>"Jane?" he said in realization, "This doesn't make any sense, you were dead, you were a hu-"
>The words died in his throat before he said any thing else
>Despite his desire to know more, he stopped himself before he let on any more than he should have
>She looked on with concern, but seemed a bit happier that he seemed to recognize her in some way
>"We'll have all the time we need to figure things out, I'm just glad you're okay now."
>She wrapped her toned arms around the living ghost in a deep hug, almost fearful that he might disappear should she let go
>Tech Terror, now human civilian John Decker, reciprocated the hug
>This is all for the act he would have told himself at that moment, this was merely another step towards making them lower their guards
>He certainly didn't hug her because some part of him simply wanted to do so, that would be silly
>After all, she was the reason he would be needing to go through with this gambit in the first place, he should by all means just despise her
>She was without a doubt the biggest obstacle between him and freedom from this wretched place, thwarting him at every opportunity
>He should have hated being subjected to such treatment from his long time enemy
>But he didn't
>When it was confirmed that he had not sustained any long term injuries, Tech Terror was given into the custody of his probation officer
>It went without saying that his gear was confiscated and would not be returned
>He still had to ask for posterity, lest they think something was amiss
>After all, the sooner they bring his stuff in for inspection, the better
>He didn't actually have an official address though, so under her discretion, John was to be given residence at the home of his probation officer
>She actually lived relatively close by the Concord building, so they both took a walk there
>Since only a select few knew what Tech Terror actually looked like, he was able to just walk around
>As for Split Hare, she assumed her civilian persona complete with casual attire
>This also meant applying an easy on/easy off dye to mask her standout fur to a more average brown, all of which she did within the blink of an eye
>"So, how long will this be a thing anyway?"
>The now disguised rabbit looked over to her charge
>"What do you mean?"
>The declawed villain simply shrugged as they walked along
>"This probation of course."
>Reaching into her purse, Split Hare pulled out the folder with the details
>"Well let me see... hmm... until your probation officer, that's me of course, believes you have successfully rehabilitated. Or.."
>"Or?"
>"Or 15 years have passed, whichever comes first."
>She playfully closes the folder with a smack, putting it back in the purse
>"Terrific..." said the glum man
>"I'd say that's more than fair considering how much you racked up in damages you know."
>She then pat him heartily on the back
>"Though, that doesn't mean we can't make this fun either you know! It'll be just like old times."
>There she was implying that they both knew each other outside of the cape business again
>He knew he wasn't being gaslit, hero types were always very particular about the truth
>Even without that, she seemed to believe in the words she spoke
>Just what was going on?
>They soon made it to the house of Jane Doe, a subtle and inconspicuous tract house
>Perfect for people who wanted to blend in
>She showed him to his room, which up until that point was a simple and unadorned room for guests
>And thus, his probation had began
>In the months that followed, he would be accompanied by the ever perky bunny whenever he needed to go out, especially early on since he needed clothing
>In the eyes of the public, they were boyfriend and girlfriend
>A cover story to keep both of them protected, though she seemed to willingly forget this fact from time to time
>Much to his surprise, he didn't mind the affection she would often give him in these instances
>He might even have enjoyed it
>But an angry and spiteful voice in the back of his head always made itself known in certain situations
>Living the civilian life of a man in this world allowed him to recall just why he had taken up his villainous ways
>Everywhere he looked, everywhere he went, nobody here took him seriously
>Anthros of all varieties, all thinking themselves superior to him
>When he felt like helping an owl who had a engine problem, he was politely declined
>He insisted that he knew what he was doing and had in fact done this sort of thing many times before
>He was told time and time again that it was dangerous for a human to get near an engine block, repeatedly moved away from it
>When he finally decided to just call it quits, he told her what the problem was before leaving
>She thanked him in a sarcastic tone and went back to the engine, working the side opposite to where he had pointed out
>Insults large and small to his skills, to his know-how
>All came frequently and without end
>The only one who gave him some semblance of acknowledgement was his fluffy probation officer
>But it wasn't enough
>Per the terms of his probation, he wouldn't be allowed near complex machinery or anything equivalent without supervision
>Which meant that the one thing that he had over these anthros, his gifted intellect, was not to be an option
>If there was ever a situation that meant Split Hare was needed over Jane Doe, she would speed him back to the house and lock him in
>She always promised to make it up to him later, which she upheld
>They did activities together all the time
>Darts, comedy clubs, movie nights, you name it
>They fell into a rhythm of sorts during those months
>He had also started cooking meals for her, to which she always thanked him with a kiss
>Being a house husband wasn't so bad, but something occurred to him finally
>It dawned on him who she was
>The similarities between her and his assistant from so long ago
>The bits and pieces she regaled with him that matched, those that didn't
>The reason he had a civilian profile complete with birth data in a realm not his own
>It all made sense
>There was another him here once, and he had also been in an accident
>They were different scientific fields, but the end result was the same
>A dead assistant, and a hero arisen from the remains
>Perhaps some part of him had always known who she was, but his rational mind refused to see it until it knew for certain
>Around the time he figured this out, he saw his ocular interface pop up for the first time in half a year
>His backdoors were installed in the concord mainframe
>His bots had found an empty lot in the middle of nowhere to set up the machine
>And his suit's return function was primed for use
>All of the pieces were in place, his act had worked
>An act that he wished could be real in some way
>Knowing Split Hare was this universes Jane Doe made what he knew he needed to do all the harder
>A chance to come clean, alleviate the survivor's guilt that had plagued him since that day
>It wasn't the same Jane he once knew, but it was as close as he might ever get
>...No
>He couldn't continue to live in a world like this, one that wouldn't let him help others escape the destructive whims of chance
>Civilian life... normal life... perhaps even love life... it would never be his
>It wasn't just pride, nor was it solely a desire for attention
>It was his duty to use this gift for others, denying that part of himself would be a death in it's own way
>His mind was made
>He waited for the next time Split Hare to be called into action, to be locked in the house
>When it finally happened, she did so as usual, but with a minor difference
>"You're leaving the door unlocked?"
>She ruffled his hair playfully
>"Why not, I think you've shown some great improvement lately anyway."
>She turned and got into running man stance, shouting behind her as she sped off
>"See you soon!"
>The smile that began as a facade and morphed into truth fell away from John
>Left in its place was a slight frown
>"Right, see you soon."
>It felt awful to betray her trust, especially since it seemed he was starting to really earn it
>He went to the kitchen counter and left a note explaining everything
>Then he activated his ocular interface, ready to finish what he had started
>"Commence operation End Gate."
TT #6: Journey's End
>Deep within the vault of the Concord, there lay many items and objects confiscated due to their connection to various villains
>Of the vast swathes of recovered equipment and at risk treasures, one had suddenly come back to life with a near silent whir
>They had separated it from its creator, cataloging it like just another piece for their collection
>Just as planned
>All it took was one seemingly innocent scan of the suit to pass along the backdoor worm program
>Discretion was the name of the game, so it kept itself hidden as it slowly bounced between all the machines it could find
>Months after it had began slipping itself into the entirety of the network, it was finally prepared to take control of everything
>It waited for confirmation patiently as it used one of the infected terminals to relay this information to its creator
>Hours of nothing, until it and every other product of the genius suddenly received the go ahead
>'Running END GATE V 1.0'
>The suit of Tech Terror took itself off of its pedestal
>The malicious program forced two display cases to open themselves up, one of them being that which held the suit
>With a whoosh of escaping air, the other significantly smaller one popped open
>Now operational again, the damaged suit walked over to the second case and retrieved its contents
>A starlike, almost nebulous looking thing, absolutely radiating with tachyon energy
>The Arkanian Relic, once again in the cold and unfeeling hands of the suit
>With the target in its possession, the program opened up a path for the suit to make a swift exit
>It rushed out with non-living haste, going through every floor that separated it from the surface
>There were occasionally supers that saw the suit and attempted to stop it
>This did nothing to stop the bipedal freight train from barreling through everything in its path
>Especially when the backdoor program had taken full control of the building
>Any who gave chase found the huge and quickly closing blast doors in their face
>They might have had a chance at warning others, had their communicators not also fallen under the control of the malicious program
>The suit made it surface level in no time flat, getting ready to ascend through the sky light in the lobby
>If it was alive, it might have even expressed joy at returning to its master
>A voice shouted at it from below, but it didn't matter
>It flew away from the place of its confinement at jet speed, back to its creator
>Unaware of who had shouted at it, or what they had managed to do before it left
>Dogmata stared at the now sealed skylight, growling in ice chilled anger
>She managed to get a tracker on that suit, seemingly without it noticing, but if she couldn't purge the malware from the mainframe it might be a moot point
>Time was of the essence, she had to get to work finding the source of the malware if they were going to stop whatever the hell was going on
>John Decker sat outside on one of the backyard chairs, waiting for his suit to arrive
>He had real time updates given to him via his ocular interface, displaying everything that he needed to know
>The backdoor was in the process of being disabled already, which would have been a problem if everything else hadn't been going so smoothly
>His bots had already finished reassembling the machine in the lot they scouted out
>And since it wasn't actually very far away, his suit had just arrived, Relic in hand
>It opened itself up for him to climb inside, which he did with experienced speed
>He hadn't forgotten just how comforting a set of power armor could be, but there wasn't any time to relish it
>Control was given back to the occupant, immediately reengaging the thrusters and flying to his final destination
>This was it, the day had finally come
>"Do you think he'll like this?"
>Split Hare, now in her Jane Doe persona, had already taken care of the armored car robbery she took the call for
>In truth, it was small enough to be beneath notice usually
>But she wanted an excuse to go out and do some shopping without her little probationee knowing
>She was glad to see him improve so much, it was almost like he was back to his prior self
>Such improvements deserved a reward, and she would be an awful girlfriend if she didn't fulfill her duties as such
>Dogmata would probably grill her for it, that wouldn't stop her from trying it anyway
>If all went well tonight, being his girlfriend would be more than a cover
>If it went really well, she'd get a chance to see if her bed could handle what she was going to do on top of it
>She almost spaced out as she thought about all the ways she would make an honest man out of him
>"For you Ma'am?" said the jewelry store clerk and bringing her back to reality, "I'd recommend this."
>The clerk directed her view to a brooch
>It was the shape of a rabbit paw, gold with pearl inlay
>Perfect for popping the question
>"That looks great!" she exclaimed as she looked it over, "How much is it?"
>The clerk took it out of the case and rung it up
>"$1,500 even."
>It was a good thing she had a really well paid occupation
>"Sold."
>She took the brooch along with the other goodies she got for tonight, speeding back home once out of sight
>She came through the door, still left unlocked and looked around
>"Hey John! I'm back! Got anything cooking?"
>She couldn't smell anything delicious from the kitchen, which was a tad strange
>Maybe she just took care of everything a bit fast?
>That was probably it, doing things fast was her thing after all
>She looked around trying to find him, calling out to him, but the house remained silent
>"John? Joooooohn?"
>Something wasn't right
>He wouldn't just leave the moment she left the door unlocked right?
>No, that's not something he would do, not what John would do
>She saw the note on the table and breathed a sigh of relief
>It was all fine, he must have just wanted to get some fresh air, flex his new freedoms
>She picked up the letter and began to read
>"Dear Jane..."
>Suddenly her communicator began to blare at max volume, startling the large bunny
>She picked it up and answered, setting the note back on the table for a moment
>"Hare here. What's up?"
>From the device came the very frenzied voice of Dogmata
>"Tech Terror's suit just busted itself out with the Relic! You need to stop him NOW!"
>Even the speedster was having a hard time keeping up with what was being said, but she caught enough to become worried
>"A-are you sure 'Mata?"
>The hound hadn't given an answer immediately, instead relaying the constant output of her tracker to the communicator
>"There isn't time, I'm still dealing with the mess over here. I'm counting on you, hurry!"
>With great trepidation, she grasped the note and began to read once more in an accelerated manner
>Her eyes bulged a bit as she read the words left on the page
>The fancy handwriting did nothing to sweeten the contents of the writing
>"With Apologies, John Decker."
>She crumpled the note and took a deep breath as she repeatedly tapped on the countertop, cracking it with ease as she absentmindedly used her speed while doing so
>Her mind swam as she tried to process all this information
>She looked down at her communicator as she did so, clutching it firmly
>Dogmata was right, there wasn't time
>She would have answers, and they wouldn't be after the fact
>They would come straight from the source
>Within the time span of snapping ones fingers, the golden heroine streaked out of her home and out towards the desert half a country away
>Her speed would have been a real marvel to any who could see it, barely registering to most as more than a spontaneous and violent gust
>There was actually one who saw her though
>And as she approached him during her extreme dash, he turned to meet her
>Tech Terror had made it to the site his bots had already prepared for him in wonderful time
>His program at the Concord had just failed when he arrived, but all that was left was the capstone of this machine he meticulously replicated
>He quickly attached all the parts to the nebulous gemstone, pressing all manner of buttons, pulling many of the levers
>Many crackles similar to that of his regular teleporter sparked to life, but started coming together at the center of the machine
>They coalesced into a shimmering mass of light and color, always shifting, never settling
>It was completely opaque and impossibly thin, emitting unnatural sounds as it grew
>The conduits at the edges of this artificial tear in reality held it in place with white hot beams of crackling energy, preventing it from spiraling out of control
>It was beautiful, he had reached the end and the same machine that had unceremoniously dumped him here would be the same one to get him out
>He walked up the ramp, approaching the portal that he had made
>But as he was doing this, his suit suddenly jerked around
>The RACE had detected the rapid approach of his Probation Officer and reacted to it by itself
>From a huge cloud of dust emerged the gallant goldie, furious as all hell
>"What do you think you are doing!?" she yelled at him, worry and wrath both riding upon her speech
>Having expected this as a possibility but dreading it all the same, the lord of machinery decided to talk without any pretense
>He disabled his voice modulator, speaking in his true voice
>"Did you read my letter?"
>She glared at him, her nose and whiskers twitching
>"Of course I did you fool!"
>Somehow, such a simple insult cut into him much more than he would have thought
>"Then you know I can't stay. This isn't my home."
>She took a couple of steps forward without her super speed
>"How do you know that!? Who's to say you don't belong here?!"
>As she says this, her large ears start to slump a bit, her face also relaxing a bit into a softer one
>"Who's to say you don't belong here with me?"
>She looks down at the ground as her rage cools off completely, leaving behind the ashes of sadness
>The portal was almost completely formed, but the intended user wasn't focusing on it
>He instead approached his arch nemesis
>"You aren't my Jane," he said as he plodded down the metal ramp, "and I'm not your John."
>This was not said in a jabbing fashion or as a zinger
>It was said as fact, one that the speaker wished wasn't the case
>He reached the speedster, placing both of his large metal arms around her
>Then hugged her in a way he could only do when they were the same height, as gently as he could in a mech
>"I'm sorry."
>The hero eventually relented, reciprocating the hug
>A beep from the machine came out, signaling the portal had finished
>The hairs of Split Hare stood on end as she looked at the portal
>"John?" she asked, a smidge of terror in her voice
>"Yes?" he answered
>"Is that supposed to happen?"
>He let go of the hug and looked back to the portal, wondering what she was talking about
>Then he saw it
>Out of his portal came something awful, something putrid
>A gigantic mass of flesh, without skin, writhing and squirming with horrid squelching
>It had eyes and teeth lining it, strewn about seemingly at random
>Each of the misshapen pupils it had begun staring at the duo beneath it as it breached its way into this lower dimension
>"No... it isn't..."
>The horrid anomaly raised its limbs and lowered them at a speed that shouldn't have been possible for such a huge thing
>Split Hare attempted to grab TT and get out of the way, but his suit prevented it
>The RACE had taken the reigns, tossing her away in a high powered redirect
>Both of them were unsure of what happened, but this wasn't for long
>An appendage of the thing had come crashing down upon the mechanist, unable to do anything but stand there like a deer in headlights
>It smashed him and his suit into the ground with blistering strength
>When it had raised, he quickly jetted out of the crater it had made using him with his thrusters
>He hovered away from it next to Split Hare, assessing the damage
>"What the HELL TT?" she screamed at him, worried at the awful look his armor had
>"I know, I know! Turning it off."
>He quickly disabled the RACE to prevent anymore issues like that
>Just a single blow, and his already damaged suit was mangled
>What's more, he felt it through his suit, he may have even broken some bones
>He couldn't afford to take anymore hits like this, especially not against that thing
>"What even is this thing?" Hare said as she looked at her options
>"Working on it!" Tech Terror said as he rapidly typed something into his arm pad
>The drones that had built the machine came back, quickly swarming around the thing
>They didn't bother attacking, focusing on scanning it with their All-Sensors instead
>Information was quickly flooding back to their owner, but at the cost of their own non lives as they were swatted from the air
>"Okay... alright... well..." muttered the man as he went over the results as fast as he could
>"Any day now TT!" said the heroine as she impatiently thumped the ground
>The fist of the suit clutched up as its occupant growled in frustration
>"Inconclusive!" He yelled
>Split Hare looked over to the hovering mech in shock
>"What is that supposed to mean?!"
>Tech Terror initiated a recall on everything he still had, his remaining drones coming to his side
>"That means we push this monster back to the ditch it crawled out of!"
>With a smile and a thumbs up, the living blur raced off to start pummeling the emerging horror
>TT and his drones flew above the thing just out of reach, throwing every thing they had at it
>Confident she would be able to get out of the way, he made liberal use of explosives
>Out of every weapon barrel he had installed in his suit rocketed out his custom made ammo
>The thing squealed and shrieked unearthly sounds as it was pelted by the onslaught of pain, also getting punched and prodded in the eyes by the speedster
>Unable to grasp the closer irritant, it instead focused on the buzzing gnat
>It pushed itself much further than they would have expected, and grabbed at Tech Terror
>He expertly dodged with bursts of speed from his hand and feet thrusters, narrowly avoiding the creature at every turn
>Now that it was really annoyed, the creature began vibrating violently
>It shook the machine, the ground, the air
>All the eyes slid along the canvas of its flesh and combined into one, splitting open horizontally to reveal a horrifying mouth
>Out of it propelled a gigantic sticky thread, latching onto the flying mech
>Stuck in one place, it was finally able to take hold with an appendage
>It slowly crushed the puny thing in its grasp, chortling with an almost sadistic glee
>He bellowed out in agony as it did, unable to access any of his gadgets to save himself
>"John!"
>Split Hare sped along the limb that held him, using it as a springboard to jump up high in the air
>She spun and spun in the air, before crashing down upon it with an ax kick as fast and powerful as lightning
>Even against the almost spongy flesh, it made a grand impact
>The appendage was severed in a flash, letting the scientist fall to the ground
>Having already landed, Split Hare managed to catch her impromptu partner and ferry him a distance away from the danger
>She let him down on the ground gently as the thing roared behind them
>"Are you okay John? Please, talk to me!"
>He sputtered up a bit of blood into his display when she asked this
>Definitely not good
>"I'm fine" he lied through his teeth, "but this whole thing is FUBAR."
>His savior slammed a furry fist into the ground
>"What are we going to do? Nothing's working!" she said distraught
>It was feeling harder to breathe for him, his deep fears were once again resurfacing
>But then it came to him, the solution to this horrible situation he had lucked himself into again
>He absolutely hated it, he knew what would happen once he went through with it
>But he wouldn't be able to even make this choice if Split Hare hadn't saved him
>It wasn't an option then, his mind was made
>"I know what to do."
>He pushed a series of buttons, causing the suit to suddenly stand up by itself
>The back opened up, John falling out of it into a slump
>His worried probation officer quickly came to him
>He put two fingers to his temple with some effort, bringing up his ocular interface
>"Suit, commence self destruct sequence, target given."
>The large metal suit blasted off and away from the duo towards the monster
>"What did you do?" Jane asked him as she held him in her arms
>The suit had view of the machine, initiating the countdown
>"Simple. I'm closing its entrance for good."
>The suit got closer, the self destruct fully armed
>"But won't that mean tha-"
>A titanic explosion rang out from behind them
>It was done
>The machine keeping the portal open had been shredded and warped from the power of the payload, and the gemstone that had allowed it to work shattered
>The portal fluctuated and began collapsing in on itself
>Monster or not, it could feel what was about to happen
>It hurried back to its home dimension as fast as it could, cramming itself back through the tiny hole
>The portal closed, slicing off a large chunk of the creature to go along with the one cut by Split Hare
>With the chaos gone, silence took hold once more
>Jane looked down at the bleeding man, horrified
>"But you won't be able to get home now, you're stuck here!"
>On the dusty ground, John chuckled
>"Heh heh, it does look like that doesn't it?"
>He wretched a bit of blood as he felt more of the pain take hold, still smiling
>"Hold on, I'll get you to a hospital okay?" said the rabbit as she picked him up in her arms
>"Yeah, you do that then, I'm just gonna rest my eyes a bit."
>He started to blackout as she sped back to the Concord infirmary
>"No, you gotta stay with me John! John come on! Stay with me!"
>He tried, but he just couldn't
>Heavy eyelids, heavy everything
>And so he closed his eyes, losing consciousness
>
>
>"AHHHHHH!"
>John woke up with a sweat, in pain all over
>He had large bandages on many parts of his body, and an IV attached to him
>Unlike the last time he awoke in one of these huge anthro sized beds, he wasn't shackled in any way
>Also unlike last time, he hadn't expected to wake up again
>When a frog nurse had noticed he was awake, she paged an official
>Moments later with a fluttering of papers as she stopped, Split Hare was in the room
>"John! You're okay!"
>He wiggled his bandages at her with a smirk
>"Mostly anyhow. What happened?"
>As he asked this, in stepped another
>"Yeah," chimed in a skeptical Dogmata, "what happened Split Hare?"
>Rubbing the back of her head nervously, she gave a sheepish smile
>"I think I already told you, but since John here is having problems remembering, I suppose I could go over it again."
>She then made up a completely false narrative of events
>Instead of the morally dubious actions he had taken to leave, they were instead framed as him trying to stop the horror that had its many eyes set on this world
>He had to save Split Hare since she meddled with the process, which ended up getting him hurt, but they managed to banish it
>"And then I had to bring him here since we have the only facility with super doctors. Do you remember now John?"
>Both of the large women looked over to him for an answer, one almost pleading that he go along with the ruse
>"I... Um...yeah, that sounds familiar actually."
>The hound looked at him as he said this with heavy suspicion, before relenting
>"Glad to hear that then. It's a shame that you didn't feel like you could get our help though, so Split here will tell you the same thing she proposed to me. I'll see you later."
>She exited through the door, leaving the two of them alone
>"Didn't know you could be so devious" he said to the rabbit as she did a wink
>"Oh, I'm full of surprises. As she was saying though, I have an idea for you."
>With his full attention, she pulled out a poorly drawn picture of the Tech Terror suit, but with a much brighter color scheme
>Under it was the title "Metalurgist"
>"Since you are for sure a misunderstood hero and not anything else, I thought maybe you could rebrand?"
>He grabbed it and looked over it
>"That sounds like a great idea, to be a hero again."
>"Again?" she asked puzzled
>"Yes, again, I'll tell you about it some other time. Just one problem with this."
>He pointed out the name
>"That name is just plain awful. I'm choosing it."
>"Hey, I made that!" exclaimed Split Hare in faux anger
>After laughing a bit at that, John took on a much less joyous face
>"What's wrong?" she asked
>"The same as it's always been Hare," he responded dishearteningly, "nobody wants a human saving them here, not anthros, not other humans. I can make anything, I can solve any problem, but I can't change people's perception. I'll only ever be a robot"
>She sat on the bed and put an arm around him in a show of comfort
>"No they won't, not when you're with me. We'll go out there and we'll show them just how capable you are. And if anyone has something to say?"
>She pressed a thumb to her chest
>"Then they can say it to me as well."
>He leaned over into her as she made her promise, saying "Alright then, I'll give it a shot."
>"Oh, that reminds me. I have something for you, provided you are alright with it."
>She got off the bed and fished around her pockets, taking out a small box as the John looked on curiously
>"John Decker, I love you." she said as she kneeled down
>Shock crossed his face as he realized on, eyes wide
>"Will you be mine?" she said as she opened the box
>In it was a brooch in the shape of a rabbit paw, gold with pearl inlay
>"I-I-I-I-I, ahem, I'd love to be!" he finally managed to get out, much to the elation of the big ol bunny
>She hugged him as she squeed, until he groaned in pain
>"Oops, sorry, guess you're still sore then." she said as she let go, "I'll be back, and welcome to the Concord"
>She then also left the room, allowing him to rest
>Waiting outside the door was Dogmata, who pulled the exiting heroine to the side
>"Ah! What is it 'Mata?"
>She growled
>"You don't think I know what a lie sounds like? What actually happened?"
>Hare looks back into the hospital room
>"The specifics don't matter in the end, he really did just want to do good you know."
>The grumpy hound just put a hand to her face, sighing
>"Fine, I really don't care. Just make sure he doesn't pull anymore stunts like the last one, or I'll be holding you accountable as well, got that?"
>Split Hare nodded in confirmation
>"Idle hands 'Mata, he'll be a lot better as a hero than a villain."
>"I hope so."
>And thus, that was the end of the road for the supervillain Tech Terror
>John Decker, now John Doe, had taken on a new persona
>It was actually his prior superhero name
>'Mech-meister'
>Since he need a new suit anyway, he built one from scratch
>He kept many of the elements from his last, but tweeked some things
>An emblem on his chest since he was once again a public figure, MM
>He adjusted his modulator to be masculine, no longer concealing his species
>And last but not least, a white and gold color scheme to compliment that of his wife
>It was back to saving others, and this time he always had someone to impress
>After all, whoever did the best that day got to choose the sex position later
>And for once in his life, the genius thanked the schizophrenic forces of chance and fate, for the lovely life he had lucked himself into

>Multiverse theory
>There exists multiple universes
>And there exists one universe where humanities first contact with alien races were always extremely hostile
>Some races were just highly advanced, some magical, anomalous, etc.
>Humanity after every contact harvested the alien tech and studied alien magic or energy
>With each and every new contact leading to more advanced, and extremely messed up technology
>End result being an extremely milimilitaristic militaristic, think the Quincy from Bleach TYBW Arc
>So now you have a humanity with powers/anomalous abilities
>A malfunction with portable portal device causes a male solider to end up being pulled and thrown from his omniverse to an omniverse were males are rare and humans are the most desirable or something
>Now you got a supped up male human with the mindset of a space marine from 40k trying to get back home stuck with human loving xenos whom try to subdue the "damaged" human for his own protection no matter what reality/universe he goes to.

>Destiny Multiverse
>Male human guardian(Your choice of class)
>Ends up in another reality due to Vex shenanigans
>In this reality anthros coexist under the traveler with humanity
>Problem being that only females could become guardians
>Also the fact that human males are fiercely protected
>There ain't no male exos or awoken
>So here he is, a MALE and GUARDIAN
>If the city don't drag his back, the plethora of other races will
>Becoming a sex slave to big busty Eliksni and Cabal does sound good
>Becoming the sex slave to the Hive ain't as much

>Grow up with my stepsis, do kid stuff
>However, nearing the end of middle school she starts acting strange.
>Ignore it at first, but when highschool rolled around did it become more obvious
>She started becoming more protective of me, possessive one might say
>She started to make friends too
>A Toad names Slippy, a blue falcon named Falcy, a bulldog named Willa, a lynx named Miyu, and a spaniel named Fay
>They all wanted to become pilots
>I wanted to become one as well
>Made this known to the group
>They just stare at me, like I just said something incredibly stupid
>Sis gives me this glare and ends up telling her friends that her and I were going home
>Which was strange since it wasn't that late, only like 9 PM
>I attempt to dissuade her but she GRIPS my arm and drags me back home
>She drags me over to mom and dad
>"Anon apparently thinks he has a vagina and wants to become a pilot"
>Jamie gets up startled
>"What!? Anon is this true!?"
>I nod a yes, confused
>"A males place is not on the battlefield, or space, or whatever!"
>Jamie growls out
>"You are too precious to be put into such a dangerous place! Your place is in the home raising young!"
>I argue back
>"But I want to become a pilot! Just like Fox and her friends!"
>I was going to continue but Jamie's glare coupled with a hiss deter me
>"YOU WILL NOT!"
>I cower under the order
>Jamie sighs before turning her gaze to my sis.
>"I was going to gift you this when you turned 18. But your brother's apparent foolishness has forced my hand
>My father's eye's widen in realization, before turning his gaze towards me in... sympathy?
>"From this day foward, Anon belongs to you. You shall protect, care, and rear children with him."
>This is what my mother states to my sister
>I was too stumped to say anything
>My sister on the other hand...
>"Thank you mother! I will live up to your expectations! Well I've already been protecting and caring for him..but"
>My sister turns her gaze to me, her eyes filled with the one thing I'd never expect in her eyes
>The one thing I've only seen in other females eyes
>LUST
>"Give me a few years to get to the child rearing~"
>Jamie laughs and proudly slaps her daughters shoulder
>"I'm counting on it! Why don't you bring your new proper- I mean male with you to bed~"
>Fox gives a sly smirk to our mother before slithering her arm over shoulder
>"Sure, but I ain't gonna try to be quiet. And I don't he'd be able to keep quiet as well~"
>While I may be a virgin, I ain't dense
>And I don't want to be a sister fucker
>I quickly throw her arm off my shoulder and attempt to book it out of the house
>Right as I'm about to make it to the door, I'm tackled to the ground
>"Fox! Stop! Please! I'm your brother for goddesses sake!"
>I attempt to appeal with common sense while trying to struggle out of her grip
>"Not any longer your are~ You're my male~ My Property~”
> I could do nothing to escape, she was always stronger than me
>As I’m dragged to the fate that awaits me, my mother giving off a proud smile
>I noticed my father staring at me, eyes full of pity
>Before losing sight of him as I’m dragged up the stairs, he mouths off to words
>’I’m Sorry’
>The next few years were…
>DEGRADING
>When Fox decided to go to Flight Academy with her friends I thought that was it
>That I’d be able to spend the next few years home with Fox far, far away from me
>The day she went to the Academy pretty much meant a 4 year vacation.
>I wasn’t allowed to get a job
>’Jobs are for the female’ “mom” would say
>’Your duty is to please my daughter’ “mom” would say
>So that meant staying home, relax, play video games, and learn how to cook
>The cooking thing was mandatory
>The males duty so to speak
>That was what I expected for the following years
>So I head off to bed with this in mind
>I awaken to noise of a hover car starting up
>I attempt to move, only to realize I’m tied up, trapped in a box
>Ball gag included
>And am I wearing a mankini!?
>I attempt struggle against my constraints and voice displeasure
>All I get in return is a familiar feminine chuckle
>I could only lay helpless as I’m driven to an unknown destination
>The hover car stops, the engine noise dying down
> I hear the sound of a car door being opened and subsequently closed
>I hear the sound of door next to me opening, and the box is lifted out of the car
>I could hear the sound of people around me
>I think I heard something about flight exams?
>Flight exams….no
>The person, who is most definitely “mom”, positions the box as to hold it one handed
>Despite being a pilot she was still strong enough to carry me
>That or I’m just very light
>She presses on a door bell and says something dreadful
>“Hey Fox! It’s your mom! I got a gift for ya!”
>The door slides open, allowing for “mom” to step in
>”Hey Mrs. McCloud!”
>”Wassup Jamie”
>”Hello McCloud”
>”Hey Fox’s mom”
>”How ya doing?”
>”Hi Mom!”
>I heard 6 variating hellos
>One from Fox herself and the others from her friends
>Are they bunking with each other?
>”So Fox. I was able to sway the administrative head due to my connections.”
>Fox lets out a yes in excitement
>Falcy asks Fox what’s going on
>”You’ll see~ Mom? Would you mind placing the box down?”
>”Mom” places the box down as per request
>”Okay Gals! Gather around the box as I open the box to reveal to my pack what I am so generously gifting~”
>”Knock it off with the pizazz McCloud, open the box already.”
>”Alright alright Willa”
>I can hear the removal of tape, and then a sudden flood of light followed by gasps of surprise
>”Fox…You can’t be serious”
>Eyes having adjusted, I’m able to see everyone’s faces peering above
>*Splat* Did I just get drooled on?
>”Of course I’m serious. You guys have been my closest friends since the beginning of highschool”
>You can see them becoming emotional
>How touching..
>”We’re a pack now, and a pack watches each other's back. Not only that but shares as well.”
>She surveys her around, looking at each of her friends faces
>”It’s only natural I share him as well”
>I can even see them all smiling in camaraderie, I even see Slippy’s eye’s welling up with tears
>I hear a sigh of content from James
>”I’m so proud of you Fox. Not even I shared your father with my past pack mate. These friends of yours must be pretty special”
>Her head disappears from my view in the box
>”Any ways I best be going Fox. I don’t want to keep your gal pals waiting from trying him out”
>”Thank you McMCloud!”
>”Thx!”
>”We appreciate the gift!”
>“Have a safe drive!”
>“Bye!”
>”Love you mom!”
>As they finish their goodbyes, the smiling visage of the Fox and her pack disappear reverting back to last filled gazes and drool
>As they hands descend upon me, I could only allow my eyes to swell
>But unlike Slippy, whose tears were of joy
>Mine were of fear of the sexual servitude I would have to face for the next few years.

Ursa Story
>you reached up and pinched her butt
>”Eep!!” Ursa exclaimed, her arm reaching back to feel where you’d pinched
>she scowled at you while you laughed
>”What I don’t pinch back mister, remember I have claws” she told you, smirking
>”Yeah, yeah, why don’t you lie down? The mattress is pretty comfy actually” you asked patting next to yourself
>”eh why not” said the bear, taking off her shirt and lying down on her back
>”Comfy see?” You said reassuringly
>”I’ve had better” Ursa said sarcastically
>”Yeah, well maybe those beds were in one piece” you said back equally sarcastic
>Ursa didn’t reply, instead continuing to tap at her phone screen
>you put an arm over her belly and scooted closer, she hummed in a questioning way so you said
>”I’m a little cold is all and your the warmest thing in the building”
>she chuckled and spoke
>”not that you probably care but I’m just talking to my parents, seeing how Abigail-my daughter- is”
>”Abigail? That’s a pretty name, how’d you come up with it?”
>”Uh, not sure really, guess it just came to me and I liked it enough. Also I was dead set on giving my kid a name that can be considered normal, not like mine I mean”
>you led there for a bit, enjoying the feeling of Ursa’s fur and warmth, wondering if some anthros even needed to wear clothes to stay warm in weather like this
>suddenly a wave of fatigue hit you, brought on by alcohol and your body needing rest to fix itself
>your eyelids were feeling heavier by the second but you didn’t want to just fall asleep on Ursa like this
>no, you wouldn’t fall asleep yet, you just had to think of something to keep your mind active
>maybe you and Ursa could do something tomorrow?
>”so, you have any plans for tomorrow?” You asked
>”Hmm, nope, I was gonna have the day to myself, why?
>”I thought maybe me and you could do something? Seeing as I’m not doing anything tomorrow either”
>She thought to herself for a second
>”Eh, why not, it’ll be nice to get out some more, I enjoy tonight, as embarrassing and somewhat distressing it’s been for me”
>still not wanting to fall asleep you asked about her daughter
>”So Abigails with her grandparents right? She can’t be that old if you’ve left her with them”
>”Trust me, my parents take every chance they get to look after her, probably because it gives them something to do or reminds them of when they weren’t so old, she’s six by the way.
>So she had a six year old? She could be that old herself as her muzzle didn’t have a trace of grey on it.
>”Does she look like you?” You queried, nuzzling into her fur a little more
>Ursa scoffed
“Well yeah, though her furs a tiny bit darker, probably from her bastard father, not like she ever sees him though, son of a bitch walked out on me then -ugh” she groaned angrily
>Oh… that seemed like a sensitive topic, probably best to leave it for now
>Ursa pulled you onto herself gently, careful to avoid touching your back by gripping your hips instead
>your head rested on her chest pillows and you could smell her scent
>it was earthy and berry like, probably a whole shampoo bottles worth
>it put you at ease as you relaxed into her embrace
>”Why don’t you get some sleep honey, let that back heal up” Ursa whispered, kissing your forehead and gently stroking your head, her claws tingling against your scalp
>you closed your eyes and let fatigue take
>The next morning you woke, still laying in Ursa’s embrace
>slowly your senses came back to you and you realised she was whispering something
>She was cooing at you and talking lightly
>”Aren’t you the cutest sleeper, holding me like I’ll disappear if you let go, just like Abigail”
>Ursas claws were gently scratching your head, sending pleasurable tingles across your head
>you yawned, pretending to just wake up, looking around and at her
>she smiled warmly at you, yawning herself before speaking
>”sleep well?”
>you nodded, “yeah, these new pillows did wonders for my neck” referring to her breasts
>she scoffed “Heh, how’s your back feel?”
>”sore, how bruised is it?”
>Ursa frowned
>”a lot, like I thought it would, I’m sorry, so so sorry” she said, voice wavering
>”Hey, come on now you don’t need to apologise again, it was an accident, that I had a hand in causing by sucking tits a little too good”
>Ursa giggled and moved you off her belly onto the mattress before getting up herself
>she cracked her back and walked out the bedroom
>you thought about what you wanted to do today with her, what would she even be interested in?
>she was a mom and mom’s like shopping right?
>wait that might just make her feel like it’s a normal day instead or relaxing
>a movie, everyone likes movies right?
>the closest theatre was in the next town over though so you need to get there somehow
>your car was one of those tiny hatchbacks that you barely fit in
>you’d had it since you were a teenager and it had done you well so you’d not had a reason to replace it other than simply getting a better looking one
>anyway you’d have to get…public transport
>You stood up, also exiting the bedroom and heading towards the bathroom when Ursa exited it, her ears scraping the doorframe as she stooped under it
>you passed each other and just as you were about to close the door and take a quick shower Ursa asked
>”Hey you wouldn’t have any sewing stuff would you? I wanna try fixing my jean button”
>”Oh, I think so, under the sink.”
>washing yourself caused your back to ache but nothing unbearable
>clean you stepped out the shower and dried yourself
>wrapping a towel around your waist you left the bathroom
>heading back towards the bedroom to get dressed you saw Ursa sewing the button back onto the jeans on the kitchen countertop
>huh, can’t undo the button but can sew it back on with what looked like ease
>putting on fresh clothes you wandered towards Ursa in order to ask her about seeing a movie
>”Sooo, Ursa, would you, like to go see a movie?”
>She didn’t hesitate to reply with an enthusiastic “yeah”
>that was sorted then you guess
>”Oh Uh, we’ll have to take a train or something since I don’t think my car is big enough , sorry”
>checking for the next train you saw it was in just over an hour so you offered Ursa some breakfast which she gladly accepted
>checking your fridge you had some bacon, not a lot though
>whatever Ursa could have it all
>While you cooked it Ursa got properly dressed, still struggling with the button on her jeans which thankfully didn’t break
>you put the plate of bacon in front of her, which looked kind of pathetic
>to you it was a good amount of bacon but to her it was more like a small snack
>she didn’t even bother using a fork she just skewered the pieces on her claws
>either way she thanked you for the meal
>later you made sure you had everything you needed
>phone, wallet and keys
>you opened the front door and gestured for Ursa to exit first
>”Such a gentleman” she teased as you closed and locked the door
>as you exited the apartment building you passed Michelle standing in her doorway looking down the hall who upon seeing Ursa flew inside and slammed the door shut
>Ursa dragged her claws across the wooden door as she passed it, cackling to herself
>the train station was a small walk away so you’d get there with good time to spare
>Ursa suddenly starting holding your hand
>”Scared I’ll run off like a cub?” You joked
>”more scared you’ll fall over like last night, how is your ankle by the way?”
>” ’s fine, hursts if I move it too much to the left or right so I’ll just avoid doing that.”
>once at the station Ursa let go of your hand and pulled out her phone
>”just gonna call Abigail, see how she’s doing, I’ve got time right?”
>you nodded and Ursa put the phone to her ear
>after a few seconds she started talking, asking the young cub on the other side the usual questions, how she was, how much she’d had to eat, making sure she’d brushed her teeth ect
>then she said goodbye to Abigail and started to talking to one of her parents, getting into an admittedly funny argument about how much candy the kid should be allowed to have
>then the tracks started whining, subtly announcing the train was soon to arrive
>you motioned for Ursa to finish up the call just as the train came into view
>however as it stopped she was still talking
>”just, find us some seats” she said covering the mouth piece
>boarding the train it was pretty busy, luckily there were a pair of seats opposite each other free across the car
>you sat in one praying Ursa hadn’t used the call as an excuse to ditch you or something
>suddenly a bag was thrown into the empty seat opposite you
>a cat anthro tried sitting in it before you tried stopping him
>”Uh hey that seats occupied, sorry”
>he looked at you, raised an eyebrow and scoffed
>”I don’t see anyone in it”
>oh good one of those types
>”she hasn’t sat down yet, find another seat” you told him
>”Listen, I can sit where I damn well please, ya goddamn human!” The cat spat raising his voice
>*Thump* a hand grabbed your shoulder from behind
>”Is there a problem here sir?” Ursa said coldly in the same voice she had spoken to Michelle in
>”Yeah, this asshole thinks he owns the seat” the cat hissed, leaning back over and poking your chest
>that quickly proved to be a bad idea as Ursa grabbed the mans hand, squeezing it, causing him to reel in pain
>”I’m going to let go if your hand, when I do you best leave us alone or so help me I’ll show you what 975 psi can do to someone’s arm”
>she let go of his arm and he grabbed his bag, scurrying off
>you just sat with your jaw on the table as Ursa sat down
>she noticed your expression and said
>”I-I overdid it again didn’t I?”
>You picked up your jaw and said
>”Not at all and to be honest I found it kinda hot”
>you whispered the last part
>the rest of the journey was uneventful and you exited the train at the next town
>walking towards the theatre Ursa took your hand again, holding you a little closer this time
>you walked into the theatre building, smelling popcorn and other snacks aromas immediately
>now all you had to do was pick a movie
>looking at the available movies on the ticket screen there were a few to choose from:
>some sci-fi thrillers, the generic superhero one, the third horror movie in a disastrous trilogy
>oh, here’s one Ursa might like, “Furtanic” a remake of titanic except with anthros included
>”Hey wanna see that one?” you said pointing to the name on the screen?
>”Sure, why not” Ursa said
>you walked to the ticket kiosk, asking the teenager behind the till for two tickets
>”Why don’t I buy the snacks for us honey” said Ursa, pulling out a dark purple purse
>”oh, are you sure?” You asked
>”yeah, you’ll see why”
>Which you did when she ordered 3 Extra large anthro sized buckets of popcorn and 2 70oz drinks
>carrying 2 of the popcorn buckets, each almost as tall as your torso you lead Ursa down the hall to the right screen
>using your back (which hurt) to push the door open you stopped for a second to let your eyes adjust to the darkness
>barely making out the letters on the floor you made your way up to row L at the back
>The leather seats squeaked as you sat in yours and groaned as Ursa sat in hers
>you and Ursa chatted amongst yourselves for a bit, discussing terrible bosses and dating troubles before the lights further dimmed and the 15 minutes of trailers started
>a quick peek at Ursas popcorn revealed half of the first bucket was already gone, no wonder she got herself 2
>eventually the movie started and you immediately discovered to your surprise that Jack was still a human and that Rose was now a fucking giant bear
>Ursa nudged your side and gave you a sultry look
>the movie followed the original pretty closely, though some scenes were altered due to the fact one of the leads was a huge bear as previously mentioned
>then came the painting scene, to which Ursa nudged you again
>why were you so flustered all of a sudden
>oh god you knew what was coming
>Ursa suddenly put her hand on your thigh and gently squeezed
>oh fuck
>the sex scene started and Ursas hand started creeping up your thigh
>straight towards your now hardening dick
>you put your hand on Ursas, stopping it in its tracks
>she made eye contact and you made a ‘are you sure about this look?’
>she nodded and moved closer to you, engaging in a light kiss
>after a few seconds of intimate kissing there was a sudden bright light assaulting your eyes
>what the fuck?
>breaking off the kiss you looked at the source
>it was one of the theatre staff, point a flashlight at you
“You need to leave”
>leave? What?
>”What for?” You protested
>indecent behaviour
>the fuck?
>”Indecent behaviour? For a fucking kiss?” You protested angrily
“She’s feeling you up and it would have only escalated from there”
>”We’re you watching us?! You perverted prick-fuck off!” You shouted at the guy
“Get out”
>Ursa suddenly stood up and grabbed you, throwing you over her shoulder
>she shoulder barged past the employee, sending him crashing to the ground as you still cursed at him
>Ursa carried you until you were out the theatre room, then she set you down
>”Come on let’s go” she said, agitated
>you followed her out the building, now you two were walking down the street with no real aim
>”Who the fuck did he think he was telling us to stop kissing-asshole” you murmured under your breath
>”Just-let’s calm down, alright? We’ll find something else to do yeah?” Ursa sighed
>you sighed too, calming down
>”Ok, did you have anything in mind?” You asked her
>”Hmmm… well it’s a little too early to be drinking, so we’ll need to kill some time somehow, you wouldn’t mind if we went around looking in stores for a while would you?” Ursa said
>”Uhhh not at all, but please don’t talk to a friend for an hour like all moms do in a store” you jokingly said
>Ursa rolled her eyes, held your hand and started walking towards somewhere, pulling you close behind
>the first store, typically, was a clothes store
>Ursa made a beeline for the tops section, picking out a selection of shirts and jumpers that were big enough you probably could have used them as a sleeping bag with little modification
>then she moved onto the pants
>she was clearly in her element, picking out an item and deciding either to hold onto it or put it back within a second
>”Could you hold these for me?” Ursa said, thrusting a few articles of clothing into your arms
>you followed her to the dressing rooms
>she poked her head around the hallway with all the rooms in them and motioned you to follow her
>ducking into one of the cubicles you locked the door behind you and hung the clothes in the provided rack
>Ursa started undressing in front of you and you turned around, averting your gaze
>”Anon you’ve seen be naked before you don’t need to turn around” she chuckled
>Turning to face her again she had taken her shirt and pants off, leaving herself in just a bra and panties
>Ursa put on the first set of pants and shirt, asking your opinion
>”Eh, the pants are a little long maybe” you said
>thus began the ‘arduous’ task of Ursa taking off and putting on a new outfit fur you to comment on
>she groaned “God I’m not as flexible as I used to be”. While trying to take a shirt off
>Eventually you were down to the last few clothes
>The final turtleneck jumper was surprisingly thin, you were pretty sure you could see her bra through the cream coloured fabric
>What do you think of this one?”
>”I think, it suits you pretty well, the colour is kind of juxtaposed with your fur pretty well actually”
>she smiled warmly and carefully took it off, making sure not to damage it with her claws
>exiting the room you followed her to the checkout, where an uninterested cashier scanned everything
>Now carrying a bag full of clothes Ursa and you left the store, just for her to see yet another clothes store opposite
>”Hey you wouldn’t mind if I went somewhere on my own quickly would you?” You asked
>”Oh not at all, let’s meet up…next to that tree over their yeah” Ursa replied, pointing to a bare tree
>you knew where you are going but you didn’t exactly know what you wanted
>reaching the store you wanted you read the sign “Burt’s furniture”
>ok finding a seat for Ursa that could arrive today wouldn’t be that hard surely?
>Upon entering the store you were almost immediately greeted by an over enthusiastic employee
“Welcome to Burts, how can I help you?”
>”Uhh, I need a seat that can take the weight of a bear and get it delivered today possible” you said, not wanting to waste any time
“Hmmm, we have furniture that can accommodate that weight range but getting it delivered today would be the issue. We could use a third party delivery but there’d be weight limitations”
>”Yeah, yeah, just show me what you’ve got
>the employee directed you to look at some chairs, most were folding, not very good looking at kinda cheap
>but there was also a bean bag chair
>would that work?
>”what about that?” You said pointing at it
“The bean bag? Yes, that’s light enough, it also farrier brand-that means it’ll take the weight of a bear no problem”
>you ordered the bean-bag, bring tons it should be delivered in a few hours, more than enough for you and ursa to wrap up in the city and head back
>Heading to the tree you saw Ursa was already there, holding another bag and her face lit up as she saw you
>”Get whatever you needed?” She asked
>”Yeah, listen, you wanna head back to by place now or get something to eat first?” You asked her.
>”Uhhh, let’s head back, don’t wanna have to sit down to eat with all these bags, ya know?” Ursa said
>You and Ursa walked back to the train station and sat down waiting for the next train to arrive
>you got back into talking about her family, learning her name was actually the same as her great grandmothers.
>before you ran out of conversation the train arrived, and you boarded together this time, finding the train much emptier then earlier
>the ride back was uneventful, though you both joking talking about the interaction with the cat earlier and how Ursa could switch from kind to ‘killer’ on a dime
>once you got back to your hone town you started talking about what food you would get
>eventually you decided on some Indian food
>finally back at your apartment you looked at the broken couch, wondering when the bean bag would arrive
>hopefully within a couple hours
>Ordering the food you were told it would take an hour to arrive
>you had a little time to kill
>Ursa went into the bathroom with one of her bags, locking the door behind herself
>you took the opportunity to clean your apartment up a bit
>cleaning up any bits of wood around the broken couch and bedframe, opening some windows to make sure the air wasn’t stale, getting some plates and cutlery out for when the food arrived and ect
>”How do I look” Ursa said behind you
>turning around you froze up
>Ursa was wearing the cream jumper from earlier, but this time she clearly wasn’t wearing a bra as you could see her areola through the gaps in the fabric, which were bigger than before as the weight of her uncontained breasts pushed the jumper to its limits.
>not even mentioning her nipples that were bulging at the front of the jumper
>your hands went clammy and you started fidgeting
>don’t walk over and stick you head in her chest don’t walk over and stick your head in her chest
>”Good?” You stammered out
>”Did you say that like that was a question?” Ursa said, smirking and closing the gap between you two
>”She hooked a claw under the bottom the the jumper, pulling it up to the bottom of her boobs
>your eyes were focused on the huge amount of underboob now being presented
>”Want to get a closer look?” She said in her sultry voice
*Ding*
>the doorbell rang and broke you out of your stupor
>”oh the foods here” you said, Ursa unhooking her jumper
>however when you opened the door and expected to see a teenager with your food you instead found a man dragging a large…something wrapped in plastic
”furniture delivery for…Anonymous?”
>wait was this the bean bag?
>”Yeah thats me” you replied to him
”Where do you want me to put this thing?”
>”Uhh just leave it there I’ll sort it out, thank you”
>with the the man turned and left, leaving you to drag the wrapped bean bag inside
>halfway down the hall Ursa said ”How much food did we order?” In a joking manner, obviously knowing it wasn’t food
>you put the bean bag next to the table for now
>the plastic however wouldn’t budge until Ursa came over and slid a claw down it, effortlessly cutting it
>”this is for you, to sit on I mean, since the couch…” you trailed off
>”Oh, really? You didn’t have to get me a seat”
>”Yeah well I couldn’t just let a lady sit on the floor, speaking of want to ‘test’ it?
>She turned around, and you prayed the thing didn’t explode and send little foam balls everywhere
>she sat down and the chair held up fine
>after a second Ursa relaxed fully into it
>then there was another ring of the doorbell
>”Ah, there’s the food”
>you walked to and opened the door, grabbing the food bag from the delivery guy
>you put it on the counter top, setting apart all the different plastic containers and such
>when you’d finished dishing up the food Ursa’s plate was much fuller than yours which didn’t surprise you
>carrying the bowls to the table Ursa was hungrily eyeing them up
>you’d barely sat down before she dug in
>While eating you were both quiet, both from not really having anything to talk about and being focused on your food
>before long you’d both finished, Ursa first despite having a bigger plate to eat
>you took her empty plate as aswell as yours, dumping them in the sink
>but when you turned around Ursa had lifted her jumper again, higher this time
>”Still want to get a closer look?”
>“Heh, yeah” you chuckled lightly
>after a few seconds Ursa cocked an eyebrow and said “Well?” Expectantly
>oh…she was serous?
>you slowly crept towards her, like she was going to jump at you or something
>her areola were exposed now, their black with a faint undertone of pink colour almost shining in contrast with her fur
>”Why don’t you warm your hands up in there?” Ursa said in the sultry voice
>you obliged tucking your hands under her jumper on her boobs, her nipples between your fingers now
>Ursa took a sharp breath saying “your hands are cold dear”
>you squeezed and groped her boobs, the she-bear biting her lip and grunting but mostly maintaining her composure
>after a minute of this she asked you to pull the jumper off
>her breasts got caught up in it and you had to strain a little to lift the heavy things
>then they fell out the jumper and thudded against her chest resoundingly
>once the jumped was clear of her head and on the floor your hands went straight back to her bosom
>Ursa started…purring? Which was weird but you assumed that meant you were doing a good job
>then her eyes slowly and deliberately moved down your body to your groin, she smirked
>”Ya’ know your pants look a little tight there honey, why don’t we-“
>she gripped the waistband and pulled
>”-loosen them up a bit”
>something tore and the pants fell to your ankles, your underwear now tenting from your semi-hard dick
>You nor her said anything now, as she started tracing a claw up the inside of your leg from your knee, leaving a faint red welt
>the sensation made you shiver
>once she reached you underwear she didn’t stop, her claw cutting through the thin material with ease, your cock springing free once she had sliced about halfway through
>Ursa leant in close and took a deep breath, her eyes coming back up and locking with yours
>keeping eye contact you bent at the waist
>now just above being eye level with Ursa you kissed the top of her snout
>you began to return to being upright but she gently but firmly grapped your arm
>”if you’re going to kiss a lady kiss her proper” she said in a husky voice
>then she pulled you back down into kiss
>this kiss was messy, the bear shoving her wide tongue into your mouth
>small drips of fluid fell from your mouths as she almost growled in lust
>eventually you pulled back, a string of saliva connecting your tongues for a second, as good as the kiss was being bent in half was kinda uncomfortable
>Ursa snorted, her face clearly reading “I wasn’t done” but she didn’t pull you back down
>she turned her attention back to your member that was not painfully hard and throbbing
>a glob of pre welled at the top and ursa smirked “one little kiss and your already leaking? Why don’t I cover it up for you with this?” She let her tongue roll out her mouth
>Jesus Christ it was long, much longer than you had thought it was when it was inside your mouth
>she retracted it with a wink and sealed her lips around the tip of your cock
>slowly and deliberately she moved downwards until you were hilted
>all while you made little yips and moans which she clearly enjoyed hearing
>her tongue got to work feeling and coating you
>her tongue was warm and easily wrapped around your member
>she started bobbing her head, her tongue going back and forth along the length of your dick
>your hands almost instinctively found something to grip, that being her head
>however you had no effect on the speed at which she moved
>she simply stayed at her steady pace
>eventually she stopping moving and her tongue unwrapped your cock
>however her lips were still sealed around the base your penis
>you shuddered almost violently as she suddenly traced what felt like the entire length of her tongue over your exceptionally sensitive glans
>”O-Oh fuck” you moaned
>she did it again, you bucking over but she held you upright with ease
>”I-I can’t-you’re gonna make me-” was all your melting with pleasure brain managed to put together
>Ursa didn’t stop however and did it again
>halfway through her dragging her tongue however you came
>you undoubtedly coated the inside of her mouth in sticky white baby batter
>it looked like you somehow almost took her by surprise as her face was in an expression of ….shock? For a split second before she started cleaning your dick off with her tongue
>she released you with a pop and licked around her lips
>”enjoy yourself honey?”
>you nodded
>”good, now I expect you’ll return the favour somehow but I’ll leave the method of which you do that up to you,

>Your assailant snarls indistinctly at your call. “Silence, prey!”
>A seven foot wolf woman in a coat of dark black fur looms over you. She has both of your wrists wrapped up in one of her paws, and held above your head.
>You try and move your legs, but she has your knees pinned to the bed with her thighs.
>Her toothy muzzle is just a few inches from your face, bathing you in her heavy breaths.
>The pupils at the center of her red eyes dilate as she focuses on your own.
“Damn it!” You sigh, frustrated. “If you didn’t sneak up on me, there’s no way you would’ve gotten me in that headlock.”
>”Oh really?” She chuckles. There’s an animalistic, discordant edge coloring her deep feminine tenor. “I don’t think you’ve ever gotten out of one of my headlocks. Some things never change.”
>You try to turn away from her breaths, but she seizes your face in her other paw. The well-defined muscles of her forearm tense beneath her thick coat of fur to hold you in place.
>You wriggle against her.
“Erma M. House-” Your laughter fades. “-get off of me.”
>”When you say my name like that, you sound like my mother.” A wicked grin graces the wolf’s long snout. “’Erma M. House, come here at this instant!’” She lowers her voice in a feral mockery of her mother as she rocks on top of your body.
>Her mother did have a temper, but you rarely saw it.
>“Erma,” you repeat, your voice flat.
>”Ugh.” She rolls off of you with a groan. “Fuck, really?
“If you were my fiance, would you like another woman on top of me?”
>”Ew.” She grimaces, exposing her sharp canines. “The idea of your actual fiance on top of you is gross enough.”
>You blink, and the both of you fall silent.
>She stands from your bed. Tufts of her fur poke out through the carefully placed holes on the knees of her designer blue jeans. A red and black flannel over her top restrains her large bust.
>You turn to look at the blizzard outside the window.
“I’m going to miss my flight, aren’t I?” you sigh.
>”In this weather? You wouldn’t make it to the closest Seven-Eleven, let alone the airport.” Erma folds her arms over her large bust. Her voice quiets. “Nothing lost, if you ask me.”
“I need to go.”
>”For yourself, or your family?”
“You know how things are for people like us.” You’re resigned. “Sometimes we just don’t get a choice.”
>”Don’t give me that bullshit.” She points a claw at you. “You’re being used by your speciest Mom! She can’t be happy unless every scumbag in Washington and every Fortune 500 CEO knows her name, so she did whatever she could to weasel herself into another family name once she couldn’t use your father’s anymore.”
>You take a deep breath, bunching up the comforter of the bed in your hands.
“My mother loved my father, and not just for his money,” you offer in her defense. You sound uncertain, even to yourself. “She’s been through a lot.”
>”Yeah, well, you lost your father too. Nothing justifies marrying your own son to some useless, old-money whore he doesn’t love.” Erma taps a footpaw against the ground, her red eyes glistening in the light of the chandelier overhead. “I hate this.”
“I’ll inherit twelve percent of the Kozlova fortune. Do you understand what that means, Erma?” Your mouth is agape. “I’ll be able to build up my father’s company again! My children, and their children, and their children will grow up with more money than they could ever spend!”
>”Yeah, and they’ll grow up with a demonic, baby-eating Kozlova for a mother. It’s a lot of money, so what?” Erma brushes it off casually. “I’m worth over five hundred million. You’re really okay with being sold off?”
“You’re not going to change my mind.” You stand from the bed, and walk past her. You snatch a button-up shirt hanging out of your suitcase, and throw it over your shoulders as you walk through the open door of the guest room.
>Your wolf friend scrambles up to your speed. She walks at your side. “Why are you in such a rush?”
>The two of you progress down one of the many halls of the House Family Manor. Gray light is cast through the massive window at your back and onto the red carpet at your feet. The polished wood-panel walls are adorned with valuable paintings and dozens of heads of deer and other game.
>Some had been killed by her mother, but many had been killed by Erma.
”I’m glad we could have this week together before I left, Erma, but I can’t stay a kid forever.” your pace quickens. Your footsteps echo down the halls. “I need to go.”
>”In this weather?” Erma is incredulous. “I know that you have a four-wheeler, but aren’t you going to grab your luggage? At the very least come eat breakfast with me first.”
”I want to get my car started, then I’ll grab my stuff.” You look at the platinum-plated sapphire watch on your wrist. Each dial of the chronograph was made with a different precious metal. It was the last remnant of your father. “I still have five hours. It’ll take me two to get to the airport in this weather and another two to get through the TSA, so-”
>”You have an extra hour with me.” Erma smiles again, and it puts you at ease. You wish you could always see her light up like that. “Please, just let me make you breakfast.” The edge to her voice peaks as she tries to conceal her desperation.
>The two of you follow the hall to a long balcony that runs across the open foyer at the front of the manor. In the center of the second-story walkway is a set of steps down to the first floor. The space has half a dozen crystal chandeliers and two fireplaces crackling on either side. Their chimneys howl with each gust of wind outside.
>You stop, and lean up against the banister.
“Okay,” You sigh. “But then I leave, alright? Not a minute later.”
>Erma stops beneath an oil painting hung right above the staircase. The larger-than life canvas depicts a steely-eyed, middle-aged human man sitting in a velvet seat before a larger wolf woman. Her eyes are soft, and her fur coat has turned a silvery gray. Between them is a much younger wolf girl who couldn’t have been older than thirteen.
>You can barely remember the time before this painting was here.
>”Not a minute later,” Erma echoes with a nod.
>She smiles to match the expression of the elder wolf depicted behind her, but unlike her mother, she bears the points of her vicious teeth.
>The kitchen of the House Family Manor is something to behold
>The style of the low-ceiling room is rustic with brick walls and tiled floors, but all the appliances are sleek and modern.
>There are three industrial-sized refrigerators complete with a walk-in freezer. There must be at least a dozen ovens and stoves. All of them are properly ventilated, have their own sinks, and look as spotless as the day they were installed.
>”You know how many chefs usually staff this place?” Erma’s tail wags behind her as she steps up to the closest refrigerator.
>You follow close behind.
“Doesn’t Gordon Ramsay host his shows here?”
>Erma’s expression flattens, and she whips at your thigh with her fluffy black tail. “Very funny.” She puts her claws on the stainless steel handle to the matching fridge door. “You know, my dad almost hired him in the nineties as our head chef.”
>You snort.
“Bullshit.”
>”Swear on my mother’s tail.”
>You blink.
“That’s basically code for, ‘I’m Erma, and I’m lying’.”
>Erma swings the fridge door open from the brick wall its built into. “Shut up, humie-” The sterile white light from inside casts a shadow across her black-furred muzzle. “-And go take a seat.”
“You did not just call me that. We agreed that was off limits.” You smile despite your feigned anger. ”Do you want me to help, Erma?”
>She shoos you off with a claw, reaching in to grab a carton of eggs, a sealed pack of thick-cut bacon, and a stick of butter.
>“No, I said I would make breakfast for you.” She points to the closest table, right in front of a nearby stove-top. “Sit,” she commands curtly.
>You groan.
“Erma, you know I don’t like other people doing things for-”
>”Your father and that pesky self-reliance he taught you. Suck it up humie, this last hour with you is mine.” She puts the package of bacon on top of the egg carton with the butter, and kicks the door to the fridge shut with her footpaw.
>A gust of cold air from the industrial fridge chills you.
“Fair enough.”
>You walk to the polished steel table and sit on a padded stool facing the nearby stovetop and grill.
>”Nice spot, now I can watch that cute face while I cook.” Erma winks and sets her ingredients down on the non-cook surface beside the stove.
>You frown.
>Erma digs out the proper equipment for the job. She sets a pot on the stove, and clicks the burner on with the light hiss of natural gas.
“Erma, I’m sorry I shut you down earlier.” You lean against the cold metal table. “I know I haven’t been open about all of this the past few days.”
>”You haven’t.” Erma doesn’t look up from her work. She sticks the sealed pack of bacon with one of her fangs, and tears open the package like it was a carcass for her to feast on. “I just want what’s best for you.” She avoids your gaze as she clicks on the adjacent grill.
”I know, Erma, but-”
>She interrupts you, pulling a wood-handled knife from a nearby box-set. ”It’s nothing new. You’ve been this way for two years now.” Erma’s hands are unsteady as she slices off a chunk of butter from the stick. “You stopped talking to me. You stopped smiling.” Her voice wavers. Her black nose wrinkles at the end of her snout.
>Your lips part, but no words come.
>”Your Mom was too busy showing you off to every wealthy heiress East of the Mississippi to notice-” Erma shakes the chunk of butter off of the knife and into the pan beneath. The butter sizzles. “-but I noticed.”
“I lost everything-”
>”And I lost you,” Erma snaps, sliding the knife back into the wooden block it came from. “You were my best friend. My only friend! Everyone else-” She points toward the wall. “-they’re snakes and liars and thieves! But you dared to stay by my side despite your Mom’s disdain for me. Then your father passes, and suddenly, you do exactly what that speciest bitch wants. You let her give you away!”
>The stool creaks under you
“What can I do to make it right?”
>”You want to make it right?” Erma lays bacon strips out on the flat surface of the grill adjacent the stove-top. “Don’t go.” The pale pork sizzles on contact.
>”Shit!” Erma clenches her teeth as she accidentally folds a strip over itself. She picks up the strip in her sharp claws to lay it out flat.
>Soon, she empties the whole package onto the grill and the crackle of cooking bacon drowns out the faint howling of the wind outside.
“I’m all my mom has left, you know?”
>”What did she ever do for you beyond birthing you?” Erna cracks an egg with the side of her hard claws, and pours out the contents into the pan on the stove. She repeats this eight times, tossing the discarded shells into a nearby trashcan with perfect accuracy each time. “I showed you more affection than your mom ever did growing up. Now she’s using you just like she used your Dad.”
“My father would want me to take care of her.”
>”You know what your father actually wanted? It was the same thing my parents wanted.”
>You swallow and nod.
>”You and your Mom could’ve been provided for with my inheritance, but no, she shot that down.” Erma makes no effort to hide her resentment. She looks down to whisk the eggs in the pot with an eggbeater, biting her thin black lip. “She shot us down,” she grunts with exertion.
“I’m sorry we missed our chance.”
>Erma’s red eyes narrow. The canine whisks the eggs in the pot relentlessly. She throws in pinches of salt and pepper from two ceramic dishes on the non-cook surface with her other paw.
>”I guess we did miss our chance, huh?” Her words are that of acceptance, yet her tone is venomous. She speaks through grit teeth. “I underestimated your mother’s hold over you.”
“What does that mean?”
>”She hurt you endlessly, yet you’re sacrificing everything for her.” She growls, barely restraining her anger.
”I resent that, Erma. I made it clear that I’m doing this for myself too.” You shake your head. “More importantly, she’s family.”
>Erma takes the whisk out of the pot and throws it at you.
>It whips by your face, leaving a drop of egg yolk on your cheek before clanging into the sink behind you.
>“I’m your family!”
>You flinch away, your mouth agape.
>Her red eyes are wild for a moment, before they soften. “I’m sorry. I would never hurt you.” She trembles.
>After collecting herself, Erma takes a spatula hanging from above to flip the bacon over three strips at a time.
>You inhale deeply, wiping the drop of egg yolk from your cheek with a finger.
“I know. You wouldn’t hurt me.” You exhale. “The truth is that I don’t know how I could do anything else in my situation.”
>You grip at your neatly combed hair and prop yourself up on the stainless steel table by your elbows.
>She rakes at the steaming scrambled eggs with a spatula as the other side of the bacon cooks.
>”Why not?” she asks.
>It’s a sincere question.
>A good question.
“Near the end, when things were really bad.” You look up from the table. “I visited my father in a roadside motel twenty miles away from our home.”
>”He stayed in a motel?” Erma’s ears twitch, perking up. She continues to flip the yellow mass of eggs over in the pot.
“It’s all he thought he deserved.”
>She purses her lips. “I see.”
“He was staying under the room where some cat prostitute was working, so every thirty minutes without fail, we’d hear squeaking through the ceiling above us.” You point up at the pristine ducts and panels of the kitchen. “The radiator didn’t work so it was freezing cold, and the whole place smelt like it had been flooded ten years ago. My Dad was so drunk, though, that I don’t even think he cared.” You raise a finger to your mouth, biting your knuckle.
>”I’m sorry. That’s hard.”
>You put up a hand.
“No, no. It’s fine.” You focus on the memory. “We were laughing together, and then he looked at me. He had this-” you pause, looking for the words. “-clarity in his eyes. It was like a single instant of sobriety.”
>Erma takes the pot and dumps the eggs out onto two clean white plates with a spatula. She glances between you and her work, the wolf’s red eyes urging you onward.
“Then he took my hand in his cold and bony fingers.” You rub at your forehead with a palm. “And he told me the only thing that kept him going each day was a specific memory.”
>Erma turns off the grill, the crackling bacon grease calming. She scoops up fifteen strips of greasy bacon onto her plate with the spatula, and about half that amount onto yours.
“When I was just a boy and my father was first building his business, every night at nine o’clock he would stop working and crack the door to his study. He would listen to my mother sing me to sleep down the hall.” You turn on the stool, and stare at the featureless brick wall to your left. “He woke up everyday, and continued to exist on the hope that he might have a perfect moment like that again.”
>Out of sight, Erma rummages around through drawers and the fridge.
“He loved my mother. He loved me.” You bow your head. “I had to do whatever I could to preserve the family— to preserve what he loved.”
>Erma slides the ceramic plate across the stainless steel table and back in front of you.
>You turn to the generous helping of food before you.
>A zig-zag of ketchup is spread over top the yellow mass of scrambled eggs beside a pile of crispy bacon. You smile.
>”Just how you like it.” Erma returns your expression. The wolfess walks around the stove to sit beside you at the table. Her large rear strains her jeans and seems too big for the other stool at first, yet she balances on it effortlessly. She sets down two forks and two glasses of orange juice with one paw, and her own plate of food with the other.
>She looks at the glasses of orange juice, passing one of them to you.
“I know we don’t see eye to eye on my future, but thank you for this Erma. This is nice.”
>Erma’s grin brightens at your thanks. She finally sounds calm. “It was my pleasure.” She wraps an arm around your shoulder, gripping at you as she sticks two strips of bacon into her maw with her other paw. “Sorry I didn’t say much. Hell, it sounded like you just needed someone to listen.” Erma makes quick work of it.
“I did. Thanks.”
>You scoop up some steaming, ketchup-drizzled eggs with your fork, and stick them into your mouth.
>They’re salted to perfection. Her furious whisking has done wonders.
“Damn,” you mumble with a full mouth. “These are good.”
>She shrugs. ”Who says all of my parents’ money went to waste on me?” The black fur of her arm around your neck tickles your skin. She gulps down another handful of bacon without much chewing.
>You chortle lightly.
>You were going to live on the other side of the world as your best friend. You set down your fork, and drink half of the glass of orange juice.
“I’m sorry Erma. I’m sure we’ll find some way to talk when I’m not around here anymore. I-”
>”It’s alright.” The wolf woman squeezes your shoulder and continues to eat with one paw. “Just finish your food and your juice. Don’t want to travel on an empty stomach, right?”
>You nod.
“Right.”
>You focus on eating, cleaning the eggs off your plate.
>There’s a calmness in the two of you now. Occasionally, you’d hear the wind outside blow against the manor as Erma gulped down her eggs.
>”While I was listening to you, I thought about every second I ever spent with you.” Erma swallows the last bit of egg on her plate. “-and I realized how deeply you have been hurt. When I lost my father, he passed surrounded by loved ones at the end of a fulfilling life. Your father was annihilated by addiction.” She dumps her orange juice down her gullet and wipes the spillage from the fur of her snout with her sleeve. “You watched a great man disintegrate through his own faults.”
>You chew on a piece of crispy bacon. Erma’s arm feels like it’s getting heavier on your shoulder.
>”Did your mother even help you? No. You lost your father and the one other person who should love you unconditionally decided to use you.” Erma’s maw contorted in silent contempt. “I’m sure she drove your Dad to alcohol in the first place.”
“No, Erma. We don’t know that.”
>”I do.” Her paw clenches around your shirt collar. “She never loved you or your father like she should’ve. A human man needs tender care that she could not give, and look at what it’s done. You’re letting her sell you off just to gain the slightest inkling of her approval. I didn’t know if my plan was justified before, but I definitely do now.”
“What are you talking about?”
>Your lips tingle. You drop the next piece of bacon back onto the plate involuntarily.
“Wha-” your mouth goes numb before you can finish the thought. “What?”
>Your body goes limp, and the arm wrapped around you tenses.
>Erma pulls you against her plush side to prevent you from falling off the stool. “Sh…” She strokes your cheek with her leathery paw pads. “I dosed you according to your body weight. You’re going to be okay.”
>Your voice catches in your throat. Your head spins.
“I-I don’t understand.” You wheeze.
>”You will, baby.”
>The tips of your fingers go numb. Your whole body is heavy.
>The buzzing of the fans in kitchen of the House Family Manor never stops.
>Your best friend has drugged you.
>You try and lean away from Erma with a pained whine, but the wolfess holds you fast to her side.
>”Everything’s okay. I’m not going to hurt you, love.” She leans down to kiss your cheek with her snout. “I had to do this.”
“W-why?” you manage.
>Your eyes follow the uniform grid of mortar holding the dark-red brick wall of the kitchen together.
>”I’d never let that speciest sell you to some old-money vampire.” Erma’s voice is stern. “You think a Kozlova could show your children affection? Think she could show you affection? No. Did you know that addictive behaviors are genetic? I’m not letting the cycle repeat.”
>Pressed up against Erma’s side with a paw on the side of your face, you’re forced to smell her. The fresh detergent-smell of her shirt mingles with the musky smell of her fur coat beneath.
>Erma takes a bacon strip from your plate, and holds it up to your lips. “Eat.”
>Pressing your lips shut is the only resistance you can show.
>”I’m not going to ask again.”
>You whine, moisture pooling in your eyes.
“This… isn’t r-right.”
>”It is right!” Erma is quick to anger. “Now eat.” Her grip on the side of your head tightens. Her claws poke at your skin.
>You acquiesce, and open your mouth.
>”Good boy.” She rumbles with satisfaction and loosens her grip.
>You try and chew, but even that takes effort.
>”Just take your time. You should be able to swallow still.” Erma assists your chewing by placing her claws beneath your jaw.
>”When I look at you, all I can see is a hurt little boy; a beautiful flower that's wilted without proper nourishment.” Once she’s fed you the bacon, she moves the paw to the top of your head and pets you in long strokes. “Remember when we’d chase each other around this place?”
>Moisture pools in your eyes.
>”I’d always get you, my little prey.” She harrumphs, and ruffles your hair. “Even though we were kids, I felt how much you needed me. When I pinned you to the floor or put you in a headlock, you’d smile. In my paws, you’d finally relax.”
>She pushes your glass of orange juice across the stainless steel table and away from you. She takes her own half-finished glass.
>You shake in her grasp. Your mouth is so dry.
>”Drink, my human.” She tilts your head back as she raises her orange juice to your lips.
>Looking upward, you can see Erma’s dark muzzle. Her ruby-red eyes watch you like a hawk as you drink.
>”So obedient.” A grin plays at her dark lips. “All you want is to be held by someone who loves you, and no one can hold you like I do.”
>Once you finish the juice, she sets the glass back down and wipes your upper lip with the sleeve of her flannel.
>Erma uses her hold on you to face your head towards her.
>”I love you.” She brings her muzzle into your face and presses it into your lips.
>Your eyes widen at the kiss.
>Her spade-like tongue pushes your mouth open.
>You whimper into her as her claws tighten around the back of your head. Your part your lips to allow her slimy organ entrance.
>Erma grunts and growls, the guttural noises shaking you as she laps at the inside of your mouth.
>”Mine-” she smacks her lips. “-my human.” Her tongue spreading her faintly salty flavor to the back of your throat.
>The plentiful saliva from her tongue fills your mouth and forces you to swallow.
>Erma finally withdraws, her five-inch tongue hanging from her gaping, toothy maw.
“Don’t do this…” you trail off, dazed. “Erma.”
>With just a single sentence, you’re out of breath.
>She crooks her snout.
“Erma.”
>”No one else on Earth could love you like I can, and you know it.” The wolf smiles, baring her sharp rows of teeth. “One good squeeze, and you’re that boy again. I knew his pain; I know your pain.”
>You breathe heavily, your eyes lidded. Your lips are smeared with your combined saliva.
“What are you-”
>”I’m going to break you.” Erma runs a single claw along your red cheek, wiping away a tear. “And then I’m going to put you back together as my perfect human; my perfect husband.”
>Erma stands from her own stool, rising to her full seven-foot height. She keeps a paw around you to ensure you don’t fall.
>She lowers her other arm under your knees, and lifts you into a bridal carry. She cradles your head against her breasts beneath her red and black flannel.
>Erma starts out of the kitchen.
>“Then you’ll never want to leave.”
>Your body sways back and forth with each of Erma’s steps as she carries you through her family’s manor.
>The layer of plush fur and fat above the wolfess’ hard muscle warms you and envelops you.
>”That’s it, just hold onto me.” She beams down at you, and cradles you closer to her chest. “Good boy.”
>You have been holding tightly to the tufts of black fur around her collar bone without even realizing it.
>The top button of her red flannel is undone, forming a v-neck into the center of her furred cleavage.
“Don’t do this.” Your weak hands grip to her soft natural coat. “Erma, please.”
>The lights of the crystal chandeliers in the foyer fill your vision. The moisture in your eyes has you seeing double.
>The wind of the blizzard outside howls at the sealed entrance to her family manor.
>”This is what we always wanted.” Erma starts up the stairs leading to the second floor. “We had each other’s first kiss.” She glances down at you. “We were engaged until your Mom called it off.”
“The hunting trip…” you add.
>You were only sixteen. She had just turned seventeen. Images of Erma pushing you into her room and ripping off your shirt.
>The events of that day had gotten you worked up.
>Erma’s sharply defined cheeks flush red beneath the black fuzz.
>”I saved you from that bear, and now I’m saving you from this.” The paw resting on your head strokes your hair as you reach the top of the stairs. “It’s my duty.”
>You remember that day clearly.
>The crack of a shot in the forest. A feral brown bear, ready to swipe at you with its claws, collapsing to the ground.
>The fall of the creature revealed Erma standing a hundred feet behind, her smoking Remington raised into the nook of her shoulder.
>Erma had dashed to you, her digitigrade legs burying her bare paws into the mud of the forest. Anthro wolves preferred wearing no shoes for a hunt.
>She took your hand in her paw before pulling you up from the dirt and against her.
>”Even though you decided against it in the end, I know what you truly desired.” The two of you pass under the massive oil painting of her family. The visage of her parents look down at you two with subtle satisfaction. “You saw that I would do anything to protect you, and it made your heart ache for me.”
“I loved you.” You groan, turning toward her chest to avoid her eyes. “More than anything. You were…” You breathe deeply. This drug has exhausted you totally. “…the greatest thing in my life.”
>Erma comes to a corner in the wood-panel walls and starts down the adjoining hall. You pass by three rectangular stained glass windows on the wall displaying the drab white-out of the snowfall outside.
>You were getting close to her room and the master bedroom.
>”’Loved’?” Erma bristles at the word.
“You drugged me.”
>”You wouldn’t see reason!” She interrupts you. “No, you still love me, just like you always have, and I still love you. You don’t need to worry about saving yourself for marriage anymore, because we’re married now.”
>You whimper.
>”Now we’re going to do what we should’ve done a decade ago.”
“Erma.” You stare up at the underside of her muzzle. “Don’t rape me.”
>Was this happening?
>It couldn’t be.
>Yet it was.
“Please,” your voice is barely a whisper.
>She stiffens, her muscled arms tightening around you.
>”I’m sorry.” There’s a moment’s uncertainty in her ruby eyes. “To be a happy husband, you must first be broken.”
>The two of you come to a set of double doors at the end of the hall.
>”Just know that everything I do, I do out of love for you.”
>Erma takes the carved brass handle in her claws, and pulls open the heavy mahogany door just enough to get inside.
“If you love me, you won’t do this. There’s still time to get to the air-”
>”No.” Her response is instantaneous. She shuts it behind her. “I’ll never give you up to anyone; not to a human whore, and especially not for your speciest mother,” she promises with resolve.
>You let go of the tufts of soft fur at her collarbone. Above her muzzle is a domed ceiling with white clouds and a blue sky painted across the stucco. A crystal chandelier much like the ones in the foyer hangs over a lavish bed. Drapes hang from either side of the bed frame, concealing the massive thing behind a veil of white.
>She comes to the bed, and pulls the drape to the side. “You’ll enjoy it, I promise.”
>Erma takes you and gently sets you down on the plush foot of the bed. “You should be gaining more control over your muscles soon. I just wanted you weak enough to not hurt yourself by resistance.”
>You have enough strength to sit up, but Erma steadies you by your shoulders just in case.
>”How are you feeling, angel?” Her concern is sincere.
“Fine,” you mumble. “Betrayed.”
>She seems undisturbed by your jab. “You’ll see the truth.”
“The truth?”
>Erma steps away from the bed, and to a nearby dresser. Multiple jewelery cases with necklaces and rings rest atop the polished furniture.
>”When we got home from that hunting trip, we were so close to finally doing it.” She opens the top of one of the cases. She glances over her shoulder. “When you ran out of my room, it crushed me.”
>She closes that case and moves to the next. “I talked to my mom after, and she told me that human men were prone to get nervous around us. It was a primal instinct, and to overcome it, a human needed to be taken quickly.”
>Erma pulls something from the case, and walks back over to you.
>You crane your neck back.
>In her claws is a leather collar and a golden bracelet. “She said my father was the same way when they first met.” The collar is embroidered with golden thread spelling her name, “Erma House”. The bracelet is engraved with yours.
>”She finally decided to take him, and after one night, he was hers.” The platinum buckle is encrusted with flawless diamonds, sparkling in the light of the chandelier overhead.
>”I never understood the custom of rings among humans. The collar is a proper symbol of loving ownership.” She purses her thin black lips. “Just shows how unfit females of your species are to take care of you.”
>You reflexively lean away as she bends over to bring the open collar to your neck.
>”Hey, hey. It’s alright,” she whispers, tightening the soft leather around your neck.
>She tightens it enough to squeeze at you, but not choke you. “How’s that? Not too tight?”
“Alright.” You don’t know what to say.
>Erma holds up a paw for you to see, and snaps the bracelet engraved with your name around her fuzzy wrists.
>”Now we’re married,” she says. “We’ll worry about the paperwork when you’re properly broken in.” There’s a hunger in her eyes.
“No, Erm-”
>She places her paws on either side of you and lifts you up into the air. She brings your crotch near her face, resting your legs over both of her shoulders.
>You to her fuzzy head for support, balancing on her shoulders with the help of a paw on the small of your back.
>”No more waiting.” She glares up at you. “I need to taste my prize.”
>She unbuckles your pants, and slides them off of your thighs. She then lifts you over her head to remove them from you entirely.
>Your underwear comes next.
>You fluster, your excitement bobbing an inch away from the tip of her muzzle.
>Her hot breath washes over your sex, making you twitch.
>”It’s perfect.” Erma runs her wet nose along the bottom of your shaft and straight to the base. She inhales sharply.
>“You smell so pent up, angel.” Erma shudders, her face buried in your crotch. She puts one paw at your back, and the other wraps around your left thigh. “Let’s take care of that.”
>She sticks her spade-like tongue from her open maw. Slowly, and excruciatingly, she trails the soft wetness up the shaft and to the tip.
>Your breath catches in your throat, your hands clenching to the longer fur on the top of her head.
>Erma chuckles as she curls her tongue around your tip. “You’re going to be a good boy and cum for me, right?”
>Your response is a grimace.
“I don’t know,” you whine.
>”You will.”
>Her lips seal around your tip, forcing a hiss from you.
>She pushes you in by the small of your back until you’re totally buried in her muzzle.
“Ah!” You shiver. “Damn-”
>She chortles around your cock. The tip hits the soft tissue at the back of her mouth.
>You’re wrapped in contracting, warm flesh.
>She moves her muzzle forward and back, her tongue curling around your sensitive member.
>You rake your stubby nails along her scalp.
>Your wolf wife stares up at you as she takes you in and out of her.
>A few slurps, and you’ve become putty in her hands.
>She pulls herself off of you, leaving your saliva-drenched cock cold in the air of the master bedroom.
>”You like my mouth, angel?” She runs her tongue along her black lips, cleaning them. “Tell me how much you love it.”
“Ah- uh.” You wipe the sweat from your brow. “It feels good,” you admit.
>You blink. Your head is spinning from a mixture of the pleasure and the drugs.
>”Now give me what’s mine, humie.” The wolf growls, baring her teeth. “That sweet seed belongs to me. You’ll put it wherever I want it.”
>You nod, breathless.
>What’s happening to you?
“Yes, m-” the word dies on your lips.
>”What’s that?” Her eyes widen. “It’s okay, you can call me whatever you want, angel.”
>You hesitate.
>Erma’s unconditional affection makes your heart throb.
>It makes your thighs shake, and your member twitch right in her face.
>Even the soft tone of her discordant, animalistic tenor makes you weak.
“Yes, mommy.”
>”That’s right, mommy’s here. I’m the only one who can make you feel this way, right?” Erma coos, extending her tongue to lap a streak of pre from the tip of your member.
>The paw on your back moves upward and under your shirt. “You’ll wear the clothes I give you, not this mixed-fabric trash. Only the finest will do.” With her claws, she slices the button-up shirt right from you. “Now, tell your mommy what you want, angel.”
>Maybe the drugs are making you susceptible.
>The towering wolfess holds you in place, breathing over your cock.
”Please, just keep going!” You bite your lower lip, and rub your thighs into the fur of her neck. “I was so close,” you whine.
>”’Keep going’, what?” Her motherly voice comes through a satisfied smirk.
“Keep going, mommy,” you blush deep red. Your face burns.
>”Good boy. I’m going to change the position a bit, okay?” She rubs at the soft skin of your back with hear leathery paw pads. “Be brave for mommy. She’s not going to drop you.”
“What do you-”
>She lifts your thighs from her shoulders and holds your whole body sideways before her.
>You gasp. “Ah! Erma!”
>She curls your body around her head like a scarf. Both of your legs drape over one of her shoulders, and your head rests on the other. You crotch is right in the center, your member right on her fuzzy muzzle.
>”Now I can take you as fast as I want, angel. Just hold onto me.” One of her arms wraps around your abdomen, and the other around both of your thighs.
“Erma, I don’t know if this-” You moan as her tongue curves along to bottom of your cock.
>She pulls all the way back to your tip, before using her grip on you to piston you to the back of her muzzle in a single stroke.
“Fuck!” The noise that escapes your parted lips is less masculine than you would like.
>Erma pulls you out and then back in, rattling your whole body with the thrust. Instead of moving her mouth, she’s moving your whole body, using you like a toy.
>She has no trouble taking your cock to the base.
>Her hot, wet mouth exceeds what a human woman could ever manage.
>The sensation makes you writhe in her grasp.
>Moving your legs, you realized you’ve gained control of them again.
>As soon as she puts you down, you could run away.
>You love this more than you’d like to admit, but it’s still not right.
>Right?
>She pulls you from her, and licks your combined fluids from her lips. “I have an idea.”
“What’s that?”
>The edges of her maw curve upward in a wicked grin. “No reason mommy can’t feel good too, right?”
>Before you can respond, she lifts you by your ankles and leaves you dangling upside down in the air.
“What the hell?”
>”Don’t worry, angel, I won’t drop you.” She lowers you until your face is in front of her crotch, and hooks your legs over her shoulders.
>Blood rushes to your head, but her firm and reassuring grasp makes the position more comfortable than you expected.
>The wolfess undoes the button of her own designer jeans, and tugs the denim down along with her soaked panties.
>Erma steps out of pile of fabric at her foot paws, and kicks her discarded clothes to the side.
>Her thickly muscled thighs draw your vision to the dark lips of her moist sex right between them.
>The tufts of fur around her lips are matted with her liquids.
>A paw clenches around the back of your head. “Lick.”
>It’s not a request.
>As she brings your face in, you open your mouth.
>You run your tongue along the rubbery folds as she presses your face deeper between her thighs.
>”Good fucking boy.” She sticks your member back into her muzzle.
>You moan into her sex as her tongue curls around your cock above you.
>Erma rumbles happily, the vibration shaking the two of you.
>You build your pace in tandem.
>Your obedient lapping accompanies the brain-melting sucking far above your head.
>Erma gurgles as she holds you in her throat.
>Drool drips from the edges of her maw and splatters against your chin and the red carpet beneath.
>Erma snarls around your cock, sliding you in and out her muzzle.
>Each time she comes to the base, she runs her canine tongue along your balls.
>You find the nub nestled in her black folds and flick at it with your tongue.
>Her musky flavor fills your mouth, and your nostrils. She tastes like raw and chaotic feminine power.
>This predator is carrying you like you weight nothing.
>Your childhood friend is using you how she wants.
>Her sucking grows more fervent.
>Your face is sticking to the fur of her crotch with her juices, drops trailing up your upside-down face toward your forehead and dripping onto the floor.
>”Hmm!” you clench your eyes shut as her folds tighten around your tongue.
>Erma hisses around your cock in satisfaction as she fills your mouth with her musky lupine emissions.
>You manage to swallow her with much difficulty.
>Her tongue curls around your cock, and she pulls you from the back of her throat to accept your load.
>”Ah!” you gasp as she splatters your face and the ground beneath at the next twitch of her sex. Her fuzzy thighs tighten around your head and ears, muffling the outside world.
>She seals her lips around the head of your cock as you climax into her mouth.
>The seven-foot wolf woman nurses at your head with her black lips, coaxing each hot rope from your member with her swirling tongue.
>Your ankles clench around her head as you writhe, dangling mid-air.
>The next squirt from her dark lips blasts your cheek, filling your nostrils with her suffocating smell.
>Erma swallows you diligently, lumps trailing visibly down her tensing throat.
>She pulls you from her lips with a slick pop. She’s as breathless as you. “Thanks for the meal.”
>“What, too cheesy?” Erma looks down her body at you, her red eyes meeting your own. “You look fantastic. All human boys should have a collar around their neck and cum on their face.”
>The wolfess lifts your legs from her shoulders and turns you upright.
>Your face and your hair is dripping with her.
>She holds you up to analyze you with her ruby eyes. “Aw, was mommy too hard on you? I’m sorry, angel.”
>Erma slings you over her shoulder and lumbers toward the bed.
>The wolfess unbuttons her flannel. She makes quick work of her black bra underneath, and lets them both fall to the floor to leave her chest bare.
>She gingerly lays you down on the massive bed and curls up beside you. Both of her fuzzy breasts, large enough to give any human woman back problems, flatten over each other.
>”We can take a short rest before I break you, angel. Want mommy to clean you up?”
>You eye her erect nipples, one shade darker than her already black fur. They’re mere inches from your face.
“Yes, please.”
>Erma leans in to sniff you, combing her claws through your juice-splattered hair. “Fuck, yes, you smell just like me. Every bitch in sniffing-distance will know that you’re wolf-cunt only.” Erma brushes the stray strands of messy hair from your eyes, and styles it neat with her claws. “Are you okay, angel?”
“I’m alright,” you say, absentminded. You eye the double doors of the lavish master bedroom out of the corner of your eye.
>You could run for it right now.
>At least, you could try.
>Erma wipes her forearm along your face, soaking up her juices in place of the lighter musk of her fur.
>Do you want to leave?
>Erma brings her snout to your ear. “You won’t make it.” Her voice is low in warning, but there’s a hint of twisted amusement in her voice. “But you’re welcome to try. You know how much I love the hunt.” Her bushy tail whips behind her, slapping the velvet comforter of the bed.
>Your face goes pale. Your body tenses in her possessive grasp.
“Erma, I’m not going to-”
>”I’ll even give you a ten second head start.” She runs her tongue up the side of your exposed neck, and into your ear. She sucks the lobe onto her mouth, and nibbles at the skin. “It’ll end with you on the ground; buried deep inside of me, and screaming for more.”
>You lay in the plush velvet comforter of Erma’s bed.
>Erma’s grip on you loosens, the wolf’s fuzzy breasts resting against your side.
>”Come on. Do it. I left your keys on the kitchen counter.”
>You’re both eying the heavy mahogany doors of the master bedroom.
>The bed is so large that even the seven-foot Erna only lies about halfway down.
>A shadow is cast across your cheek by the ornate bed frame.
>Erma runs her paw down your bare chest. “If you make a run for it, and actually manage to make it to your car-” she sighs. “-I won’t come after you.”
”You promise, Erma?” You turn your head towards her.
>She’s onto you, might as well play her game.
>She bares her sharp teeth in a wry smile. She pats your abdomen. “I would never lie to you.”
>Your eyes narrow.
“It’s this or give in now, right?” Your half-flaccid member is still soaked with her wolf-drool.
>She’s silent for a moment.
>The wind of the blizzard outside howls.
>Erma nods. “If you don’t want to run, angel, there’s no shame in skipping to the fun part.” Her paw moves down your abdomen and towards your crotch.
>You intercept it with your hand, stopping its journey downward.
“Can I put my pants on first?”
>Erma’s eyes search yours. Her black lip trembles, but she makes sure to maintain her gentle smile. “Sure, but don’t start running until I tell you to. You get a ten second head start, no more, and no less.”
>You wriggle from her grasp, and she begrudgingly lets you go.
>You plant your bare feet on the carpeted ground.
>”Isn’t this exciting?” Her tone is wistful. “It’ll be like we’re kids again…”
>Wordless, you walk to the dark spot where your mixed fluids are soaked into the carpet.
>You take your underwear and pants and slip them up your legs to your waist. The crystal chandelier casts you in warm yellow light.
>You glance upward at the domed stucco ceiling which the chandelier is hanging from. The painting is simple, but clearly skilled. The clouds obstruct the sun midst an otherwise clear blue sky.
>”Ready?”
>You look to your wolfess friend and take a deep breath.
“Erma I-” you start, but don’t know how to continue. You want to say something that will make this okay. “I know why you did all this. I can appreciate your reasons, and I know that you love me.”
>Your hand turns the soft leather collar around your neck. You’re wearing her name, a name you’re still proud of somehow.
“I just hope that you can understand my reasons.” Your hand falls from your neck and to your side. “If I don’t see you again, just know that I do love you. I always have.”
>She crooks her snout. Moisture pools in her eyes as her gaze softens. “I’ve always understood.”
>”Thanks,” you reciprocate the smile.
>The black nose at the end of her furred muzzle wrinkles upward. Her eyes narrow and she sniffles as she steels herself again.
>Erma growls low and sits up on the bed, sliding towards the edge in preparation.
>”Go.” She mutters the command with a snap of her jaws.
”Erma, wait, I-”
>”Nine.”
“No!”
>Time to go.
>You scramble toward the double mahogany doors to your left, nearly falling over yourself and into the door.
>”Eight.”
>Glancing over your shoulder at the predator, you put your back into throwing one of the ten-foot doors open.
>You scramble up to speed in the hallway before you.
>“Seven!”
>To your left are the stained glass windows to the glowing, gray abyss of the white-out blizzard, and to your right are dozens of mounted heads of game.
>Erma had caught and killed many of those.
>The thud of the door to the master bedroom finally closing echoes down the hall.
>”Six!”
>The head of a bear and a bear-coat rug are right in the center of the hall.
“Five!” her voice grows more distant.
>Your arms swing at your side as you dash down the hall.
“Kitchen. Garage. Kitchen. Garage…” you repeat under your breath.
>”Four!”
>Veering ninety degrees to your right, you redirect yourself down an adjoining hall. Fighting to change your vector, you drift along the floor. Your inertia brings you right toward the wall.
You bounce off the dark wood with your shoulder, leaving a dull ache in your side.
>”Three!”
>Luckily the collision didn’t rob you of much momentum.
>“Two!”
>Just beyond, the hall leads to the balcony in the bright light of the foyer.
>The kitchen with your keys was on one side of the foyer, and the garage was on the opposite side.
>”One!”
>You’d have to cross back over, or make a whole loop around the circular floor plan of the manor.
>You push your already painful sprint just that much faster.
>Erma howls, the haunting, blood-curdling sound plenty loud despite the distance you’ve put between you and her.
>The hunt is on.
>You pass a few more guest rooms and the open library.
>As you reach the staircase and the oil-painting of her family above the foyer, you just spot a gray blur turning down the hall behind you.
>You dig your heels into the carpet to bring yourself to a halt. You eye the swooping curve of the polished wooden banister down the staircase in a moments indecision.
“Agh!”
>You grit your teeth and hop onto the banister butt-first.
>The polished wood screeches as you slide down it and you quickly getting up to speed.
“Shit! Shit! Shit!” You lean back with the curve of the banister outward, balancing yourself on the wooden rail.
>The air whips at your hair, still wet with Erma’s juices.
>Her voice echoes down the hall behind you. “A human is no match for a real predator in a hunt!”
>You come to the bottom, stumbling onto the red carpet floor with the momentum of your slide.
>”No claws! Little stubby teeth! Smaller, weaker! The only advantage you have is endurance…”
>You squint at the brilliant light of the crystal chandeliers bathing the foyer.
>The naked Erma emerges from the hall and onto the balcony of the foyer. “I’m coming, prey!”
>Her digitigrade legs propel the predator’s superior form with grace you couldn’t aspire to.
>You make horrible, terrifying eye contact.
>Erma’s pupils are dilated, her tail whipping behind her as she bears her extended claws.
>Her movement toward the top of the stairs breaks your trance and you make way toward the arched doorway to the kitchen
>”I’m going to fuck you silly when I catch you, human!”
>You pass under the brick arch and into the tiled, industrial-sized kitchen. The dirty grill and stainless steel table with the remnants of your breakfast are in sight.
>Your keys twinkle in the fluorescent light beside the white ceramic plates.
>”I’ll treat you better than anyone else ever could. Just give up!”
>You weave through the tables and grills until you come to the one with your keys.
>You snatch them.
>”There you are, cutie.”
>You whip around to see her standing in the doorway to the kitchen, just fifty feet away from you.
>You stop.
“This is it, huh?” you ask, holding out your hands with the keys.
>”Yup. I have you cornered. You could run all the way around the house that way-” She points past you. The wolfess takes a single step toward you, then another. “-but I’ll still catch you.” Her digitigrade legs bend inward with each step, like a spring ready to pop.
>Your eyes narrow.
“Then come get me.”
>She immediately lunges to full speed, weaving the same path through the stainless steel kitchen ware that you did.
>Right as she closes in on you, you vault over the table at your side, over what was left of the drugged food and drink that Erma provided earlier.
>Instead of catching you in her arms, the wolf slams right into the table with a loud clang.
>She howls in pain, and gnashes her teeth. “Agh! Get back here!”
>You make your way out of the kitchen, but you hear the claws of Erma’s foot paws scratching into the tile behind you as she comes for you once more.
>The light of the foyer bathes you. The heavy white door of the garage is just across the carpet.
>Freedom.
>So close.
>You smile, and laugh, the keys jingling in your hand.
>Erma snarls behind you.
>You look over your shoulder to see her launch toward you by her foot paws.
>You drop to the ground as over two-hundred fifty pounds of muscled wolf-woman latches onto you from behind.
>You are sent tumbling over each other.
>The two of you roll two a stop, with you laying on top of her, face up toward the ceiling.
“No, please!” You gasp as you flail around, trying to wrestle out of her claws.
>An arm locks around your neck, and pulls your head back to hers.
>The wet nose of her muzzle dabs at the sensitive skin of your ear.
>”Sh…” she coos into your ear as she slices your pants and underwear from you with her other claw. “You did well, my human prey. It’s time to give in to your wife. Give her what she wants.”
>Keeping you in the headlock, her other paw slides over your chest, your abs, and wraps around your now-naked member.
>A few pumps of her soft pads, and it’s standing at attention and throbbing.
>Heat radiates off of her.
>You stop writhing, and you stop fighting.
>As she pumps you, you stare at the door. It’s freedom, just out of reach.
>Freedom.
>Was it really?
>You’d be owned by someone that didn’t love you, and wouldn’t love your children.
>Why were you willing to live that way, again?
>For your mother?
>”Are you okay?” Her concern is audible.
>Your mother was the one who messed you up.
>She messed you up so bad, that you actually loved your now-rapist and wanted to stay.
>No, you loved Erma before that.
>She gave you what no one else did, what no one else would.
>You relax into the wolfess’ grasp completely, and she stops pumping.
>”What’re you-”
>You turn over in her headlock, putting your pecs to her breasts, your abdomen to her rock-solid abs, and your member to her burning slit.
“You said that you would break me.” You prop yourself up on her furred shoulders, staring into her red eyes. You shake your head. “Erma, I am broken.” The tip of your cock brushes her burning hot sex. “You make me feel not so hurt… not so fragile.”
>Her maw hangs open.
>You lean in to place a kiss on the wolfess’ black lips. You spear her other lips with the tip of your member.
>The both of you moan as you push further into her heat from above, her legs wrapping around your hips.
>She grunts at your thrust, and returns the kiss.
>Your tongues push at the other’s.
>Impatient with your slow entrance, Erma pulls you in swiftly with her densely muscled legs.
>”I love you,” She groans into your mouth. “Mommy will never leave you, angel.” Her thighs clench around your hips like a vise.
“I know,” you breathe, pumping your hips back for another stroke.
>She loosens up to allow you to pull back.
>You slam back down into her, your whole member alight with sensation.
“Ah!” you bite your lip to stifle a moan.
>”That’s it.” She pulls away from the kiss to watch your eyes. She cups your cheek in a paw. “Show me how much you want this, husband.”
>A wet squelch echoes through the foyer as you pump back inside.
“Please, hold me.” You quicken your pace.
>”Yes!” The wolfess hisses. On each stroke downward, she pulls her legs against your back, forcing you back in.
>Erma’s paw clenches around your chin, forcing you to look at her as you slam into her. “I’ve dreamed of us since I was ten!”
>The wind of the blizzard howls outside.
>You stop looking at the door to the garage, and focus on your partner beneath you.
>She chuckles. “I know it’s fucking embarassing, but-” She swallows thickly. “-I had my parents buy me a human family doll set, and a wolf family doll set!”
>Already tired from your chase, you let your arms give out under you to drop to her chest.
>”My father made me work for both of them. I had to clean the house with our servants.” She grits her sharp canine. “But it was worth it!”
>Your face falls right between her plush breasts, her bust spilling out and flattening off the sides of her chest.
>”I threw the human wife, and the wolf husband out!” Erma moans as you withdraw, and slam back inside. “I made the perfect family set. There was a tall, strong wolf wife and her beautiful, perfect humie husband! They had the most beautiful pup girls, and baby boys.” She chokes up. “I would play with them, imagining it was us!”
>Your arms wrap around her breasts, squeezing to her. You groan as her tunnel clenches to you, tight like her thighs on your hips.
>“And now it’s real. It’s finally real!” Her paws grab your sides.
“Ah!” You gasp as she leaps to her feet, flipping you onto your back with your cock still buried inside of her.
>She smiles as she assumes her position over you
>Erma holds you up by your legs in the amazon position.
>She’s going to fuck you in the middle of the foyer.
>A lit, brick fireplaces hisses with natural gas, the orange light of the hot flames falling over you and Erma.
>”It was fun to have you on top of me, but this is where you really belong, angel-” Erma clenches tighter to your cock. “-under the predator who’s collar you wear.”
>You bite your lip
>The wolfess pulls you up into her by your legs while she squats onto your member, meeting you right in the middle with a hot squelch.
>You writhe on the plush carpet, giving up on biting your lip to moan out loud.
”Yes!” you yell at the ceiling as your wolf wife fucks you into the ground.
>”Moan for mommy.” Her smile widens as her digitigrade legs bend at either side of you.
>You indulge her.
>”This cock belongs to mommy.” Her discordant, feral tone has a sharp edge to it. “Every human cock belongs in wolf cunt, not in human girls or other anthros! They can’t give you the companionship we can!”
>You breathe deep, trying to comprehend the endless, overwhelming sensation of her constricting tunnel.
>”We’ve been together-” she grunts as she readjusts her grip on your ankles. “-since the dawn of civilization! The oldest stories are of wolf and human tribes. You belong to us!”
>You wipe the sweat from your brow with your arm as you listen to her and the wet plaps of your coupling.
>”The first cave paintings are human hands inside of wolf paw prints!”
>You rock with each of her squats, pushed back and forth along the floor.
>Your breaths are rapid and ragged.
“Please, don’t stop, mommy,” you beg through grit teeth.
>”Who owns you?” She punctuates her question by burying you to the hilt in her sopping slit.
>She stops on the down stroke, holding you deep in her.
>Erma grinds on your pelvis, pleasuring herself on you. The sensation is torturous to your sensitive flesh.
>“You want me to keep going? Tell mommy who owns you!” The wolf’s dark fur is matted with your combined fluids.
“You do! You own me!” You cry in your daze.
>”Good fucking boy.” Her tongue lolls out of her mouth, and her eyes narrow as she resumes her frantic fucking. ”You’re gonna be a father to wolves… my house husband!”
“Yes, yes, I’m your good boy, your good little humie husband!”
>Erma falls over you, angling your legs right up into the air. She supports herself with her paws on either side of your head. ”Hold onto me, husband,” her voice is husky. Her muzzle hovers over your mouth.
>You wrap your arms around Erma, staring into her predatory red eyes.
>The wolfess keeps pounding into you, battering your hips and squeezing around you.
>Erma leans down, pressing her fuzzy breasts to your chest and lapping at your cheek with her spade-like tongue as she fucks you.
“Please, break my mind!” You stare up at the crystal chandelier hanging over you.
>One of her paws moves to your neck, pulling you up into a kiss by your leather collar. The battering of her hips into yours quickens at your request.
>You’re forced to swallow her plentiful drool as her tongue delves into you. Your owner’s distinct, wild musk is spread through your mouth.
>The kiss. The sex. It’s too much.
>Your eyes roll up as your mind is inundated in pleasure.
>The world is you, Erma, and the pleasure the wolfess gives you.
>She shudders as you hit a particularly sensitive spot in her constricting heat.
>The wolfess breaks her kiss to snarl, sending globs of her musky saliva across your face.
>“You’re mine, human!” Her discordant tenor is nearly feral. “You’re fucking perfect!”
>You shake at the force of her wet hips slamming into you.
“Rape your little human.” Your arms tighten around her and your mouth hangs open. ”I'm your good boy!”
>The two of you pant into each other’s faces.
>”Oh, really?” she mutters between breaths. Her paw trails from your collar to just above your hips, inches away from your point of contact with your mate. “You want a tattoo of mommy’s paw print above your hips, angel? Then everyone will know that you’re a good little wolf breeder.”
“Whatever you want, anything at all!”
>”When that speciest bitch of a mom sees you wearing my collar-” she gnashes her teeth, enraged at the mere mention of her. “-and she sees my paw print on your body, she’ll know! She’ll know that her son is wolf-cunt only!”
>The thought of Erma showing up your mother fills you with twisted satisfaction.
>”I’m close.” Erma’s dripping tunnel twitches around you. “You’re gonna be a good boy, right? You’ll fill mommy up and make her pregnant, won’t you?”
>You nod frantically, her paw still pressing against your abdomen. “Mark me, mommy! Mark me as your property!” You crook your neck, baring your sensitive flesh just beneath your leather collar.
>Her already rapid pace speeds up to a hip-bruising intensity, your legs bouncing in the air, and your tongue hanging out of your mouth as you’re screwed silly.
>Erma rears her open maw back, exposing her sharp canines. “Now! Cum, angel! Cum for mommy!” Her teeth come down to the base of your neck and she buries you in her to the hilt.
>You explode inside of her as her teeth pierce your skin and flesh.
“Yes! Breed me! Breed your good boy!” you scream up at the ceiling.
>Your soaked balls tense as you shoot your first rope deep in her wolf sex.
>Her quivering tunnel spurts and gushes around you, drenching your skin in her musky emission.
>Erma’s claws pull on your collar, pressing her teeth deeper into you.
>The mixture of pain and pleasure addles your mind.
>Erma growls and laps at you even as her teeth are buried in the base of your neck.
>Your legs shake in the air as your seed fills her burning quim.
”Deeper! Deeper!” You push on the back of Erma’s head, forcing her teeth as far into you as they will go.
>Your mixed climax splatters to the carpet beneath, soaking it dark.
>You fire your last shot into her tunnel.
>Her wolf cunt twitches she finally pulls your soaked member from her and her teeth from your neck.
>She laps lovingly at the set of canine teeth marks on your neck.
>At first, the wound pulses with pain and stings at her licks. With a few more seconds of your mate’s gentle ministrations, the pain diminishes.
>You’re both huffing desperately for air.
>Erma falls off of you, and to your side. She pulls you back into her fuzzy body with her muscled arms to embrace you right on the floor.
>Your neck nestles between her breasts, and you rise and fall with each of her heavy breaths.
>The wolfess continues to the lap at your bleeding bite, wrapping a paw around your chest to pull you flush to her.
>”You may be broken, husband, but-” her tongue trails from your bite up your neck, and to your cheek. “-I’ll put you back together, I promise.”
>You smile.
>That’s alright with you.

>"Ugh! That is it!"
>you hear a fist slam down on a table in the other room
>there's a rattle of empty soda cans and the clatter of old plates
>"Stupid fucking yeens! Dumb slut horses! Goddamn fucking dirty whores!"
>you sigh and set down your novel
>looks like you had to calm her down again
>you crack open the door into your roommate's room
>you hadn't seen the bunny in forty-eight hours, she never leaves
>but you had heard her plenty in all that time
>a beam of light cut through the blacked out room
>she hisses in shock as she turns about and is met by the light of the hall
>her eyes, wringed in sleep-deprived purple, narrow as they struggle to adjust from the glow of the computer screen
>"Anon!"
>you step into the room, flicking on the light to dispel the gloom
>"It's not fair Anon! Look at them! Those stupid bitches showing off their humie boyfriends!"
>she spins about in her chair and jabs an accusatory finger at the screen as you approach her
>"Just cause I'm not a seven foot tall yeen with a stupid fake cock! Humies should be with buns! I'm really gonna do it this time!"
>she's on that website again, even though all it does is send her into fits of rage
>you sigh and lean over top of her, putting your hand over hers to take control of the mouse
>"A-A-Anon!"
>she stutters, staring at your hand
>you just move the mouse to the top of the screen, and close down the internet
>"Hey! I wasn't done with that! I had to show those bitches that bunnies can get human boyfriends too!"
>with a sigh, you step back and look around the room
>it really is a sty
>how can she afford her half of the rent when all she does is sit around and yell at strangers on the internet all day?
"You really need to take a break, Minn. Have you ever tried going out and talking to a human boy? Or anyone? Or maybe just...being outside your room for a little while?"
>Minn lets her head slump down on her desk
>she whines
>"But outside suuuucks Anon!"
>she thumps her head against the desk again
>"Everyone out there is so mean, and no one wants to talk about video games or human/bunny compatibility or anything!"
>you cross your arms
"Meaner than those girls you're angry about on the internet?"
>"That's different! They're shitting up the thread with their dumb fucking yeen-posting this and winking-pussy that!"
>Minn slams her fist down on her computer desk and goes to pull up that website again
>you step around her chair and rest a finger against the power button on her oversized computer tower
"Minn. I will do it."
>"Wait! Anon waitwaitwait! Just one post! I gotta prove that bunnies can get human boys too!"
>she types frantically, glancing between you and the screen, before freezing
>"Wait a minute! Oh my god! Anon, you're a human boy!"
>you roll your eyes
"Gee, thanks for noticing."
>she picks up her phone, frantically trying to unlock it
>"Please Anon! Just let me take a few pictures with you so I can show those hyenas and I promise I'll stop! For at least the rest of the day!"
>you stare at her
"The week. And you clean up your room."
>"Deal!"
>Minn hops up, standing on her chair
>holy shit she's not wearing pants
>try not to stare
>Minn puts her arm around your shoulders and holds up her phone for a selfie
>"Okay Anon! Smile like we're in love, okay?"
>before you can even look at the camera she takes several photos
>then frowns when she looks at them
>"We don't look in love enough. Here, let me take one kissing you."
>what
"Hang on Minn, I don't--"
>Minn mashes her face against yours, taking the opportunity to push her tongue into your open mouth and make out with you sloppily
>all the while she keeps the camera clicking
>you're left dazed, bunny saliva trailing down your chin, when she finally pulls back
>"Those are awesome Anon! That'll really show those dumb sluts. Here, I have another idea!"
>she grabs a fistful of your hair, dragging your head down as she runs her tongue over your face
>"There! Now look all dazed like I just fucked you silly."
"Uh?"
>she take a few photos as you work on processing what's going on
>she still doesn't seem satisfied
>"The angle is right. A good human boyfriend would be on his knees for the perfect bunny girlfriend, right?"
>you don't know about that one, but Minn is already forcing you down the grip on your hair
>how is a bunny half your size still so strong
>"Here, just on your knees. A couple more photos and then I'm done, promise! I can't wait to show my parents I have a boyfriend..."
>did she say parents?
>Minn keeps pushing, but dropping to your knees just to prove a point was going a little far
>even for a pushover like you
"Minn what the fuck?"
>she stops pushing your head down
>"What's wrong Anon? We're almost done. Come on, we had a deal!"
>she suddenly gasps as she looks you up and down
>"Oh! Oh my god! You have a boner!"
>when did that get there?
>you are hard as a rock right now
>"Fuck yes! I gave a human a boner! I did it! Bunnies ARE the best! Fuck yeah!"
>she pumps her fists
>"Take that you stupid fucking sluts! I did it!"
>she spends a little bit of time in exultation before she stops again
>"Oh fuck, you have a boner. Fuck! Do you like me? Do you want me? Shit what do I do? I've never done this before. Anon are we married now?"
>she is a total virgin, but at least she's on the backfoot now and you have a little space to breath and collect yourself
"We aren't married Minn. We just made out a little bit. We could keep going if you want, but no more pictures, alright?"
>she looks at you with eyes like dinner plates
"And no more yelling about other species. The neighbors have complained."
>Minn drops down into her chair and lets out a jittery giggle
>"Holy fuck me and my human roommate are gonna fuck this is like all my hentai doujins."
>you think she might be having an actual meltdown
>"Anon what do I do? How do we start again? Do I just grab it? Anon please, do I grab it?"
>it's kind of cute how desperate she is
"It's okay Minn, take a deep breath. What do you WANT to do?"
>Minn follows your advice and takes a deep breath
>"What do I want? Um, I want to uh..."
>she tugs at an ear in thought
>"Oh! Can we do like--like the photos I was gonna take, only no photos? So you can be on your knees for me?"
>it's a start
>you drop down to your knees at the side of her chair
>you see Minn chewing her lip as she looks down at you
>"Then you could maybe uh, kiss my feet a little?"
>she extends one of her legs out to you, flexing her fluffy looking toes
>you hold on to her calf with one hand, and lean in to start planting small kisses on the pads of her footpaw
>she giggles and her breath hitches
>"Ooh just like that my cute little humie~"
>you roll your eyes but continue to shower her with affection
>until you hear the telltale click
>your eyes snap up
>Minn gives you a guilty grin
>"These ones are just for me. Promise."
>you huff around the toe currently pressed against your lips
>but you keep going, running your tongue over the top of her foot, and then kissing up the inside of her calf
>you hear a mixture of giggles and soft moans intermingled with snapshots being taken
>if you find your face on some kind of weird species based porn site, you're going to throw her computer through the window
>you trace kisses along Minn's inner thigh
>a thigh bigger than your head, thick with muscle and extra fat
>"You like my legs? My big strong legs? Bigger than any other girls?"
>she is really putting on a voice for this
>but it makes her happy
"They're amazing Minn."
>her fur gets matted and slick as you continue working toward her slit
>it smells of musk and sweat
>Minn's been looking at more than just imageboards in her room
>her other leg wraps around the back of her leg as she crosses it over her lap
>you're trapped now
>"This is a dream come true."
>Minn has finally dropped her phone, now focused entirely on you
>she tightens the leglock, pressing your face into her lap
>you do what comes natural, running your tongue over her vulva
>Minn squeaks and squeezes you tight
>you keep eating her out, exploring her folds with your tongue
>she may well pop your head off with her thighs as her breath hitches higher and higher
>finally your efforts are rewarded with a flood of femcum as Minn doubles over and spasms in climax
>her thighs finally cut off blood pressure, and the world starts to swim
>any attempts to warn her are lost in her orgasm
>you feel yourself slipping into unconsciousness when Minn finally releases you
>you topple back onto the floor, your head landing conveniently on a pile of her dirty laundry
>"That was amazing Anon. Better than the hentai..."
>you suck air, arguing how worth it would be to die in those bunny thighs
>definitely worth it
>"Anon? Anon?! Holy shit did I kill you? Oh shit they never warned me about this! Fuck!"
>silly bun
>she better clean her fucking room
>"Hey Anon?"
>Minn calls to you from her bedroom, though she's standing in the doorway to address you face to face
>she's been making an effort to get out more
"What's up, Minn?"
>Minn flops an ear to one side, a clear sign of nervousness
>"Are we...dating?"
>that wasn't the question you were expecting
>but it was bound to come up sooner or later
>you set down your novel
>never going to finish it at this rate
"Well Minn, we've been fucking like ra--crazy for the last two weeks now. You've bragged to all your internet friends about how you 'have' a human now. Those are usually signs of dating."
>she huffs and shakes her head
>"I know that! But are we dating-dating? I mean, could we go on something like, you know...a real date?"
>the rabbit wrings her hands and sways nervously as she manages to force out the question
>this is the girl who threatened to break your pelvis while in the throws of passion just last night
>nervous about going on a date
>your heart may stop
"I'd love to go on a date with you, Minn. Did you have something in mind?"
>Minn gasps and hops in place excitedly
>"Yes! Yesyesyes! I did! I'm gonna go on a date! Wait here, I'm gonna go change!"
"Hang on, should I--"
>she's already slammed the door and disappeared back into her room
>you shrug and go back to reading
>a few minutes later, the door slams open again and Minn is there
>she's wearing a plain white dress that almost blends into her fur at the edges
>she fills it out nicely, the short skirt giving a view of those legs you love so much
>you're stunned
>you didn't think she owned any clothing that wasn't repurposed pajamas or plastered in video game characters
>"Okay! Let's go Anon!"
>you fear you may be a bit underdressed if she's going in a full dress, but she doesn't seem to mind as you lace up your shoes
"So what did you have in mind, Minn?"
>Minn smiles
>but it's not a cheerful smile
>she looks like she's planning something
>"Oh, just this coffee shop by the apartment! My treat."
>Minn is practically bouncing with each step out the apartment and down the street
>she takes you to a place you had seen once or twice before
>"Cappu-yeen-o"
>a cutesy cartoon hyena sips at an oversized cup of steaming coffee on the sign
>this won't end well
>you go for the door, but Minn stops you
>"Waitwait! Anon, before you go in could we--would you uh, hold my hand? So it looks like we're together. Because we are together!"
>she stumbles over her words, looking a lot less sure of herself now than when you were leaving the apartment
>you put your hand out for Minn to take it
>and when she hesitates to take it, her hand hovering over yours, you just reach out and take it
>that little squeak of shock Minn makes is enough to make whatever comes next worth it
>she's so damn cute sometimes
>Minn finally works up the nerve to push open the door and lead you in
>with the jingle of a bell, you step into the cafe
>it's comfortable looking, with wooden tables and soft looking chairs, along with a bar set in the back for customers to sit at
>a hyena woman behind the counter waves at the pair of you
>"Welcome to Cappu-yeen-o! Take a seat and I'll be with you real quick."
>she's dressed for work in cheery yellow apron, with her mane pulled into a ponytail
>Minn hops up to the bar, jumping up onto one of the available stools
>you take the one next to her
>the hyena approaches a minute later
>"Oh! Hey there Minn, I almost didn't recognize you! Who's this?"
>the hyena gives Minn a friendly smile and then turns to you
>"Well Shay, this is my human boyfriend Anon! Isn't he so handsome? He loves bunnies SO much."
>Shay's grin tweaks into a knowing smirk
>"Oh! So this is that roommate you were obsessing over, huh? You're right, he is handsome. Hey there hun."
>Shay offers a hand, and you shake it politely
"Pleasure to meet you."
>Minn crosses her arms when you sit back down on the stool
>"Anon really, really likes me, don't you Anon?"
>she makes no effort to hide her jealousy as she puts a possessive hand on your thigh
"Oh, well, Minn is a handful some times, but she's plenty of fun when she's relaxed."
>you stress the last word, patting her hand to reassure her
>Shay laughs, leaning over onto the counter to look you in the eye
>man she is tall
>"Oh I'm sure. I hope you're able to keep her stress-free, Anon. Last time she was here, she got so excited she spilled her coffee everywhere!"
>Minn gives in an indignant huff
>Shay just continues
>"So, can I get you two lovebirds something to drink?"
>Minn cuts in first
>"A coffee! With extra cream, and whatever my boyfriend wants."
>she sets down her credit card on the table
>you make your own order, and Shay gives you both a toothy smile
>"Excellent choice. I'll have that right out to you two!"
>Shay stands up straight, and turns about to start working on your drinks
>Minn, meanwhile, is fuming in her seat
>"Thinks she's so great with her hair, and her...dumb coffee."
>you cock an eyebrow
"Minn, why bring me here if you're gonna get all jealous? This is almost as bad as that website you go to."
>Minn stops staring daggers at the back of the hyena and turns to you
>"I'm not jealous! I'm on a date with my boyfriend, getting some coffee from a...lovely...café!"
>you think she choked on the word 'lovely'
>honestly, she's trying way too hard right now
"Listen Minn, it's alright. You wanted to show off a bit, but Shay's playing the game too. She's just being friendly is all."
>Shay returns with your drinks, both of them served in cups with the same cartoon hyena giving an 'OKAY' symbol with her hand
>you take the cup and enjoy the first sip of the steaming beverage
>"Here you two are, hope you enjoy--"
>Minn jumps up in her seat, phone in hand
>"Here's me and Anon having sex! This is the part where he says he loves bunny pussy!"
"Ack!"
>you cough, choking on your drink as you struggle not to spill it
>what the fuck
>you hear your own voice, moaning and panting, coming from the speakers of Minn's cell phone
>"Say it!"
>her voice echoes out from the device
>"I love bunny pussy!"
>was your response in the video
>you grab the phone from Minn's hand, and desperately fumble with it to shut it off
>but the damage is done
>Shay stares at the two of you, eyes wide
>your face burns hotter than the coffee
>Minn beams, triumphant
>"That's how much Anon loves bunnies!"
>she stands on the stool, arms crossed
>the three of you are left in silence for several seconds before Shay breaks out into a cackle
>"Wow! I didn't know you had it in you Minn!"
>she laughs some more, slapping a hand on the table
>Minn's triumphant demeanor falters
>"What--What do you mean?"
>Shay manages to regain control of herself
>"I didn't think you were ever gonna snag that humie boyfriend you were after, but from your video it looks like Anon is really into. REALLY into you."
>she cackles a bit more when she turns her attention to you
>"You like 'em small, huh Anon?"
>oh god someone please shoot me now
"Minn. Oh my god. Minn."
>you're still at a loss for words, and now Shay was ganging up on you too
>"You ought to meet my husband, Minn. He blushes like that when I tease him in public. So cute."
>Shay sighs
>"Though he usually isn't so open about what we do in our bedroom. You post that anywhere?"
>Minn drops onto her stool again, wind taken out of her sails by Shay's complete nonchalance
>"Uh, no. No that kinda stuff I just save for me."
>this is it
>the most embarrassing moment in your entire life
"Minn. Minn. Why did you show the nice coffee lady a video of us having sex?"
>Shay loses her cheerful demeanor and steps back from the counter
>"Okay, maybe you two need some space."
>the hyena makes herself scarce while Minn turns to you as if realizing for the first time there might be something wrong
>"Anon, I..."
>you just stare at her
>she stammers your name a few times, gesture toward you, then the back of the café where the hyena had disappeared to
>"I can't--I don't--She was gonna--"
>you have to take a moment to restrain yourself from raising your voice
>you were a pushover, but this was too far
"Minn. You took me out on a date so you could, what, rub it in the face of a woman who's already married? And the moment you get jealous you start showing homemade porn to what, scare her off?"
>Minn folds, ears hanging down as she drops her head in shame
>"I just didn't know what do do! I was scared! What if she stole you? Or someone else does? I'm--I'm a loser Anon! You're way out of my league and I didn't--I don't wanna lose my shot!"
>Minn tears up, reaching out to try and hold on to you
>but you stand out of your stool, away from her reach
>Minn gasps and hiccups, not quite full-on sobbing
"I trusted you with that camera Minn. Because it made you happy."
>"I'm sorry Anon, I'm sorry!"
>you shake your head
"I like you Minn. When you're not going crazy over this species stuff, you're fun, you're sweet, and you're so damn cute. But it has to stop, okay? It's not healthy."
>you gesture over to Shay, who had reappeared to serve a couple other customers seated away from the bar
"And you're not just hurting me. I bet you could be great friends with Shay if you had made the effort."
>you run out of track, shutting your mouth a moment to look at the defeated bun on the stool in front of you
>you do feel bad about it, but some bandaids need to be ripped off
"I'll see you at home, Minn."
>Minn manages to pick up her head enough to look you in the eye
>"Will you want--want to talk then?"
>you sigh
"I just need some time to think, Minn. You should do some thinking for yourself.
>you turn on your heel and walk out of the coffee shop
>the last few days have been quiet
>since the incident at the coffee shop, Minn has been keeping her distance from you
>only polite greetings and curt goodbyes
>she's been out of the apartment more and more
>you haven't heard a peep from her when she's in her room either
>it's let you catch up on your reading, but you're starting to worry
>you were resolving to speak with her when she beat you to the punch
>"Anon."
>she steps out of her bedroom, clad in her usual pajamas
>though they lack the usual stains from snacks and carelessly consumed beverages
"Minn. How are you doing?"
>you set down your book
>so close to the ending too
>"I've been better."
>she laughs, but it's hollow
>Minn climbs up onto the couch next to you and leans into your side
>"I'm sorry Anon. For everything. I was an awful roommate, I was an awful friend, I was an awful girlfriend."
>you look down at her, but let her keep speaking
>"I didn't like you for you. I liked you because you were a human. I didn't care about how kind you were to me, especially when I was in one of my moods."
>her speech is punctuated with sniffles as she starts to cry
>"I'm sorry Anon. For the video. For the yelling. For being so selfish. For everything!"
>you remain silent for a while, considering her words
>Minn trembles and stifles her crying as best as she can
>you know how you have to respond, of course
>putting an arm around Minn, you hug her gently and lean down to plant a kiss on the top of her head
>right between those ears
"I forgive you, Minn."
>you feel her body stiffen, before melting into you
>"Thank you! Thankyouthankyouthankyou! Anon! You're the best! The sweetest, kindest--The best!"
>so maybe you're a pushover
>is it so bad when you get to see the cutest bunny in the world so happy?
>you scoop her up with your arm and deposit her on your lap
>she twists so she's straddling your lap and facing you
>"I mean that Anon. You're so much better than I deserve. And I was so scared--I mean what if you really did find someone better? I mean, I know you don't really--the species stuff doesn't mean anything--"
>she's babbling
>so you silence her with a kiss
>it's not quite the french kiss she forced on you for her photos
>but it's deep enough to quiet her and have her hanging onto you desperately
>you break the kiss to look into her eyes
"I like you Minn. I'd like you if you were a bunny, or a hyena, or any other thing under the sun."
>you have to lay off the romance novels
>that was cheesy as shit
>it seems to have worked on Minn though
>her mouth hangs open, and she stares at you with shining eyes
>and then she jumps you
>her mouth is pressed against yours in a desperate kiss
>her delicate tongue sliding over yours while she holds your face in her paws
>she keeps kissing you, and humps against your lap
>"You're the best--"
>she gasps out the words
>"Gotta--gotta reward the best boyfriend ever."
>you know well there's no stopping a bunny when she's in the mood
>so you hook an arm around her waist and turn in your seat to lay back across the couch
>now she's straddling you, draped over your chest
>her paws slide under your shirt, the soft fur pads tickling you a little as she works the garment up your torso
>Minn is hesitant to stop kissing you to get your shirt fully over your head
>but when she does, she lets you pull the garment free while she sits up and works at removing her own shirt
>you smile like a dope, staring at her perky breasts now that they're free
>but her best feature still grinds into your lap, rubbing against your boner
>just a couple layers of fabric between you and paradise
>"What kinda girls have the best tits in the world?"
>she starts in on an old line, you can't help but grin
"You do, Minn."
>she gasps
>"You weren't supposed to say that!"
>she covers her face, trying to hide her embarrassment
>letting you ogle her chest freely
>when her hands drop from her face, Minn glares at you with false malice
>"You're not being fair, Anon. I'm supposed to be doing better and you just--you're--"
>she grunts and hops off your lap
>Minn stands over you, pulling down her pajama pants and kicking them aside
>she takes one step forward, and nearly trips over you trying to spin 180 degrees
>now you're left looking up at her thick thighs and massive rear
>Minn drops down again, dropping herself to sit right on your face
>heaven on earth
>you massage her cheeks with your hands
>"Mmf, knew you'd like that..."
>her voice is muffled, but she's right
>you love it
>unseen to you, Minn works at getting your cock free while she grinds her dripping sex against your face
>once she has it out, she wraps her lips around it and starts to suck you off
>you're pent up after so long without fucking like rabbits, you know you won't last long
>you let Minn do all the work, trapped underneath her as you are
>simply enjoying her ministrations while drowning between her thighs
>she bobs her head to take you all the way to the base and back again
>and your cock twitches in her mouth, sensitive after being neglected
>your moans are muffled when she grinds down hard
>try as you might, you can't keep your climax at bay
>you buck your hips into her mouth
>she presses herself all the way down, letting your cock throb and twitch in her throat
>you give a truncated thrust and shoot a pent up load down her throat
>she swallows once, then again, and again before you're finally spent
>when she finally pulls free you're still twitching and leaking the last of your orgasm
>she licks it up greedily
>once she's satisfied, she finally lifts her leg and frees you from beneath her
>"How was that?"
>you pant and shudder
"If you..." you pause to take a breath, "If you take a picture of me like this, I will sell your computer to a crypto-miner."
>Minn frowns, but quickly dissolves into giggles
>"I wouldn't dream of it."
>Minn picks up her discarded pants, and fishes her phone out of her pocket
>"See? Didn't even have it with me this time."
>you pick yourself up and sit back on the couch with a satisfied sigh
>Minn flips through her phone, and then gasps
>"Shit! I totally forgot!"
"Forgot what?"
>Minn scoops up her clothes, dropping her phone in the process
>"Shit! Shay invited us out for a double date wither her husband tonight, and I already said yes! We're late!"
>she flees into the bathroom, leaving you in stunned silence on the couch
>at least she's getting out more

>zebra gf who is racist against other zebras
>honestly believes that she's not a zebra, but a horse with an unfortunate fur condition that makes her look like a zebra

Shelby Story
>you wake up, some unknown time later
>the bright light of morning shines through the window
>and manages to land right on your face
>you groan and try to roll over, only to find yourself still hunched over the edge of Shelby's bed
>the events of the middle of the night come back to you as you straighten out your stiff legs
>you must have fallen asleep while comforting Shelby
>she's still holding your hand, even in her sleep
>you slowly pull your hand out from hers and haul yourself up off the bed
>your sleeping posture left a lot to be desired, and your spine raises a crackle of indignation as you stretch
>and despite your efforts to be gentle while getting up, Shelby stirs
>her nose twitches and ears flick
>she reaches out with her paw toward where you'd been laying
>"'Non...?"
>she grumbles
>"Where're you?"
>she growls softly as she continues searching the bed
>she jolts, suddenly shoot up from the bed in a flash
>you stumble back a bit, not expecting her to jump up so suddenly
>her nightgown is twisted from the sudden movement, and sticks close enough to her fur to show her slim figure
>"Anon!"
>her eyes find and you, and all the tension runs out of her stance
>her fur settles and she takes a deep breath, smiling sheepishly
>"Good morning. I hope I didn't startle you, just uh...let instincts get the better of me."
>you nod slowly
>you had almost forgotten she was still an anthro
>and you still didn't know what you could expect of her once things got settled
>she must have sensed something of your thoughts, as she took a step back to sit down on the bed
>"Thanks for checking up on me last night, Anon. It made my night so much better."
>Shelby gives you a warm smile and pats the bed next to her
>"We've got a lot to take care of today, but I think we could take a little time right now. Join me?"
>you nod again, sidling over to sit on the edge of her bed
>Shelby reaches out and takes your hand
>once she's intertwined her fingers with yours, a change comes over her
>her tail starts to wag against the bed
>her ears perk up too
>"That's better..." she coos
>you have to admit, you don't mind the little bit of physical connection
>her fur is soft and smooth, and the pads of her paws are warm against your skin
>she didn't ask this time, but you guess it's only fair after you snuck into her bed late at night
>"We'll have to go get your stuff from the storage lot, maybe do some grocery shopping. I'm on leave the rest of the week, so plenty of time to get things done, and--"
>she frowns
>"And I left all the paperwork at the assignment office. In the waiting room. Damn it all."
>Shelby groans, before looking to you and smiling again
>"I guess that just means I'll have to give them a surprise inspection! They'll never see it coming."
>Shelby laughs as though she's hatching a conspiracy with you
"Shelby?"
>she cocks her head when you speak up
>"Is something wrong, Anon? You don't have to worry about that wolf when we go back. I'll be there with you."
>you shake your head
"It's not that."
>you try to figure out the right way to ask how she managed to cow an entire office of anthros with the flash of a badge
>she tilts her head the other way
>and her ears flop with them
>it's adorable
>damn it all, you can't hand this
"Could you pick up a uh, a cookbook or something? When we go out?"
>the collie gasps, and smiles wide
>did someone open a shade and let the sunlight in?
>"Anon! That's a great idea! Having home made food would be amazing."
>you just nod and look back down at the ground
>you guess you'll get your answers eventually
"Thanks Shelby. I'm not much of a cook."
>"That's okay Anon! Just another thing we can figure out together.
>she squeezes your hand and her tail wags faster
>wap wap wap!
>it thumps against the bed
>"I don't think I'll ever get tired of being close to you Anon. Gosh, I must seem like a little girl, getting so giddy over holding hands with a cute boy."
>she giggles
>you find you suddenly can't meet her eyes
>and your face is a little hot
>just remember there has to be a catch
>has to be something wrong you haven't seen yet
>you take a deep breath to try and still your thoughts
>you'll make it work
>you said you would
>Shelby leans her head down to catch your eyes with hers
>"Whatcha thinking about, Anon?"
>you blink
"Nothing. Long day ahead of us. We should get ready, right?"
>she lets out an exaggerated sigh
>"I guess we can't spend all day sitting together, huh? Why don't you go grab a shower and I can see about breakfast. Plenty of leftovers from last night!"
>when you stand to leave, Shelby holds on to your hand to keep you next to the bed for a couple extra seconds
>but she lets you go
>and her tail slumps
>it's not like you were going far
>you planned on a quick shower, but Shelby's was much nicer than your old one, and you spend several minutes relaxing under the spray of hot water
>you're startled by a knock on the door
>"Everything okay in there Anon? You didn't slip and fall did you?"
>how long have you been in the shower?
"I'm fine! Almost done."
>you scrub yourself as quickly as you can, and step out of the shower
>and right back into your old clothes from yesterday
>just have to shower again when you pick up your clothes from lockup
>Shelby is waiting for you once you open the door
>"Hurry hurry Anon, food's getting cold!"
>the takeout is less appealing the second time around, but you still eat quickly
>"Okay! We can clean up later, we're gonna be late!"
>she shoos you from cleaning up the empty containers
>Shelby runs off from the kitchen, down the hall to disappear into her room
>and she's back shortly after changing out of her nightgown
>she's dressed more sensibly for the weather, a heavy coat that covers down to her thighs and a set of leggings
>you find yourself mildly disappointed they cover up the fur of her legs, but they do show off their form
>"Ready to go?"
>you just give a nod, trying to suppress the more primal part of your brain
"Ready."
>"Great!"
>Shelby trots past you, taking your hand and leading you out the door
>"Let's get your stuff from lockup first, yeah? We need to grab you a coat!"
>you do need something like that
>even still indoors, you shiver in the chill of the building's stairwell
>as Shelby stops to unlock the door, you hear the sound of footsteps a floor above you
>and Shelby's tail droops considerably
>"Shelby! I was hoping I'd catch you!"
>a sheep comes down the stairwell
>she's shorter than Shelby and even you, but she has a wider frame, with wide hips and a somewhat ridiculous bust
>and she has to be at least fifty percent wool by body mass
>Shelby turns and gives a less than enthusiastic greeting
"Allie. How nice to see you."
>the sheep turns her attention to you
>"Oh, and who is this? Finally found yourself a human of your own huh? Where'd you catch a cutie like him?"
>Shelby steps forward, keeping between you and Allie
>"This is my husband, Anon. I put in for assignment. Anon, this my neighbor. Allie."
>Allie gasps and clasps her hands together
>"Oh that's so wonderful! I thought you'd never find yourself someone to settle down with. Always so busy busy busy! Better not work too hard, else someone might sneak in and snatch Anon away."
>Allie gives you a wink through a mop of wool that half-covers her eyes
>Shelby grips your hand tight, and even tugs you to stand closer
>"No one is stealing him, Allie."
>Allie laughs, ignoring the shift in Shelby's mood from tolerant politeness to open annoyance
>"Oh of course! I'm sure you'll keep a watchful eye on your human. Wouldn't want to steal a shepherd dog's property."
>Shelby snarls!
>she bares her teeth, letting go of your hand to bear down on Allie
>Allie stumbles back, tripping over the stairs and falling over
>"Wh--Wha--"
>Shelby cuts her off
>"Anon is not property! If you ever say such an awful thing about him again, I'll--I'll--"
>she stammers, before jabbing a finger into Allie's chest
>"I'll shave you bald and make a sweater out of your wool."
>Allie was sufficiently cowed, trembling as she laid back on the stairs where she fell
>"Now, Allie, I want you to apologize."
>"S-sorry Shelby, I--"
>Shelby barks again
>"No! Apologize to him."
>Allie scrabbles back up a couple stairs, and spare a glance your way
>"I'm sorry!"
>and then she turns about and flees the rest of the way up on all fours
>you hear a door slam shut above you
>once she's gone, Shelby sighs
>she spins about to face you, sitting down on the steps leading up where Allie had been just a moment before
>"I'm sorry Anon. I wish stuff like that wouldn't happen."
>you stay next to the door, watching her
>would she lose her temper like this every day?
>you're glad it's never been directed at you
>"Don't worry, I'm not really gonna shave her. I don't--I'm not a violent person, but she really shouldn't have called you that. Property."
>she spits out the word like a bad taste in her mouth
>"You're not property. You're still a person."
>you're not sure how to take it
>you were used to the kind of talk that your new neighbor was making
>and worse
>but it upset Shelby enough to make her snap
>you watch as she starts to shake
>and she whines softly
>there's a lot you don't understand about her yet
>but she's done her best to protect you
>your emotions wrestle over themselves as you approach your wife
>she looks up at you in questioning
>you sit with Shelby in silence for a short while
>you're more than happy to let her coat reflect heat back onto you
>just another thing she's given without expecting anything in return
>you still don't really trust her
>but hasn't she been kind enough for something?
"Music."
>you break the silence
>Shelby perks her ears, and looks down at you
>"What was that, Anon?"
>you look her in the eyes
>bright green eyes
"Music. You asked what it was like in the home. I did music."
>she blinks
>"Music? Really?"
"Yeah. They let us choose ah, 'life skills' classes. They said it would help our prospects. I played an instrument."
>Shelby's trail tries to wag, but trapped against the stairs, it doesn't have the room to make a full motion
>instead it whaps against your back and the next stair up
>"That's amazing, Anon! What did you play? Do you still play now? Oh! Do you think you could play something for me?"
>her excitement is infectious and you let yourself smile a little
>but it twinges into a frown when you go to answer her questions
"I don't really play anymore. It was the state home's instrument, and I couldn't afford one for myself on the stipend they gave me after I was on my own."
>Shelby's smile wavers
>"Oh, that's a shame, Anon. It must have made you happy to play music. What exactly did you play?"
>you had tried to dodge that one
>oh well, you prepare yourself for ridicule
"The banjo."
>the wagging stops
>Shelby stares in shocked silence
>her jaw hangs open
>and then she snorts
>her paws fly over her mouth to stifle the laugh building up in her
>"The banjo? Really Anon?"
>you roll your eyes and look down at the concrete between your feet
"It was that or the accordion. The banjo looked easier."
>Shelby breaks into cheerful giggles
>her tail wags against you in full force
>you should have just told her about your traumas
>that would have been easier
>"I'm--haha--I'm sorry Anon, I just--I picture you playing the banjo and it's just..."
>she breaks into another fit of laughter
>you hang your head and groan
"Forget it. Let's just go, please."
>you start to stand up off the stair, but Shelby catches you by the arm
>"Aw Anon, I'm sorry. Here..."
>she pulls you back down gently, then puts an arm around your shoulders to hug you to her side
>"There we are. No need to be embarrassed Anon. That wasn't the answer I was expecting is all. Did you like playing music?"
>she's holding you
>and though it's mostly just the bulk of her coat, there's still a little bit of her own warmth beneath it
>you nod your head stiffly
"Yeah. I liked it."
>Shelby hugs you tight
>then she lets you go, rising off the step to stand
>"Then that's what matters. I won't bring it up again if you don't want."
>she holds out her hand to you
>you barely hesitate to take it, and she helps you up onto your feet
>"You were right though, we do need to get going! It's going to be dark by the time errands are done if we keep at this pace."
>Shelby hurries downstairs with you in tow
>you forgot how cold it is outside
>a blast of icy wind to the face is enough to remind you when you step outside
>once you make it to the car, you're left shivering in the seat while Shelby works the controls to get hot air flowing
>satisfied, she works the lever in the steering wheel and the car rolls out of its parking spot and down the street
>the drive back to the assignment office is thankfully a little shorter than yesterday
>no need to make any stops
>Shelby makes a few attempts at small talk, about the weather and about food, but you're back to your usual reticence
>giving sparse, one word responses to most of her conversation attempts
>hard to break old habits
>even if it makes a very kind border collie droop her ears
>usually very kind
>you spend most of the car ride letting your thoughts wander like that
>questioning her motives, what she's capable of
>second guessing everything she's done since you two met
>she can't as nice as she's been for no reason
>and those glimpses of her when she's upset is all the more proof
>but you have to make things work, right?
>no other options
>you're sure you could go on with thoughts like that for hours and hours
>all worries and no solutions
>it's a good thing you've arrived at the office already
>Shelby seems rather excited to be back
>"You think I should try and scare them, Anon? Burst in and start shouting?"
>you shake your head
"No. I don't want to be here for long."
>really you wanted to avoid becoming the center of attention again
>or at least, holding hands with the center of attention
>naturally, Shelby's already put her paw in your hand and interlaced fingers while you entered the building
>the same dreary hallway with drab walls
>you both know where you're going so you don't have to be lead this time
>Shelby still enters the office first though
>she cocks her head and frowns when the she-wolf from yesterday isn't there
>but the rabbit is
>she freezes when she catches sight of the border collie in the door
>if her eyes were open any wider, they'd roll right out of her head
>"Inspector Winn! You--You're back! Already?"
>'Inspector Winn'?
>the rabbit fumbles a handful of paperwork, sending papers everywhere
>Shelby has to keep her tail from wagging in amusement as she crosses the room
>the office was empty of any humans, with only the rabbit and an older jaguar occupying the security desk
>the feline eyes you and Shelby while you two approach the rabbit's counter
>Shelby's put on a stony face by the time you reach it
>"I did say there would be a full audit."
>she lets the threat hang in the air before breaking into a polite smile
>"But I'm afraid that's not today. I simply left our paperwork in the office. One of the waiting rooms."
>the rabbit lets out a breath held in anticipation
>she manages to organize her paperwork and regain her detached demeanor
>"Of course. We set the forms aside for you, Inspector Winn. We planned on simply mailing them to you."
>the rabbit stands from her chair and shuffles around beneath the desk before producing a single folder
>"Here you are. Please have a pleasant day, Inspector Winn."
>Shelby takes the folder and smiles sweetly
>"I'm looking forward to the results of your audit."
>she turns about and leads you out of the room, sparing only a glance to the jaguar
>you see a twinge of something cross her features
>annoyance?
>anger?
>you aren't sure, it's gone so quickly like it was never there
>Shelby passes you the folder when the pair of you step outside again
>”Shame that bi–wolf wasn’t there, huh? I would’ve liked to see the look on her maw when we walked in.”
>you shake your head
"Too much trouble. I didn't want her losing her temper or something."
>Shelby shrugs while getting into her car
>"Then she'd really be in trouble."
>she takes off again, rolling through near-empty streets
>the storage facility is even further away from the center of the city
>nearer to where you used to live
>the nicer apartments and businesses give way to tenements and industrial lots
>back to the drab of grey concrete
>it's different, watching the buildings go by from behind the window of personal vehicle
>you're underwhelmed when you get to your second destination for the day
>property retention, another squat, square, State building
>this one larger than most, as it's host to dozens and dozens of storage lockers for those who have had their property seized for various reasons
>mostly from humans if they have to get assigned, as far as you could tell
>you take the paperwork with you inside just in case
>the tired looking donkey inside doesn't even bother looking at it, simply demanding your name and ID
>she tacks away at the old computer, before looking to you
>"I don't have 'Anon Nemo' under that ID number. Are you using your..."
>the donkey glances to Shelby
>"...correct name?"
>oh right
>you had forgotten
"Anon...Winn?"
>it doesn't feel right saying it
>Shelby squeezes your hand
>naturally, you had been holding it the moment you got out of the car
>the donkey huffs through her nose and makes a correction
>"That's better. Your belongings are in locker number 317."
>she slides a key over the counter and Shelby takes it with a curt 'thank you'
>she swings her tail side to side while you walk together through the facility
>fluorescent lights flicker overhead as your footsteps echo off the concrete floors
>"Anything you're especially looking forward to getting back, Anon?"
>you know the first thing you're going to grab
"A jacket."
>even though you're indoors, the building is still poorly heated beyond the front office
>when you get to your locker, Shelby wastes no time in unlocking it and rolling up the door to the storage space
>inside lay the whole of your life before marriage
>it's a little depressing
>a metal-framed single bed with a threadbare mattress
>some tattered old books about music theory
>a couple boxes of ratty clothes
>and a photograph encased in a cheap frame
>you leave Shelby's side to start going through the clothes in search of warmer wear
>when you finally find the grey jacket, you throw it over yourself with relish
>better than nothing
>in the end, you stack up the boxes of clothes and leave the rest
>no room for furniture in the car, and you'd read through those books enough to have them memorized
>"What's this, Anon?"
>Shelby has the photo frame, scrutinizing it closely
>"Was this from the home?"
>you go to join her, looking down at the faded photograph
>two dozen boys, from pre-teen to near-adult stand arranged on the front steps of a red brick building
>some smile politely for the photo, others glower or stare expressionless
>one of the older boys gives the camera a huge grin, showing off missing teeth and a black eye
>and at the side is a stern, middle-aged badger woman in a practical brown uniform
"That's us. I'm on the end there."
>you did not stand out as much as the smiling boy
>younger you stares back out of the photograph with dinnerplate eyes
>"Aw, you're cute even back then! Can I hang it up at home? I can put it right next to the one with me as a kid!"
>you return to your stacked boxes, and start to heft them up
"If you like. I always thought I looked like an owl in that one, with the eyes."
>Shelby giggles and sets the frame on top of the boxes you're carrying
>then she grabs the whole stack out of your hands with a small 'hup!'
>"Well I'd say you look adorable. And you still do. If we're not taking anything else, let's get this stuff to the car so we can see about getting stuff for dinner."
>Shelby leads the way back out of the corridor with a spring in her step
>she keeps glancing down at the picture
>then back at you
>you don't mind when she calls you cute
>you leave the key at the front desk
>the donkey warns you that everything left behind will be gone for good
>nothing you needed anyways
>Shelby loads your boxes in the trunk of the car, then hands off the photo for your to carry along with the files
>you find yourself staring at it while she drives toward your last stop
>staring at the photograph brings back memories of your time in the home
>some good, more bad
>most quiet and empty
>you wonder how some of the boys you were friendly with are doing now
>you never saw anyone from the home after you left
>the old days are gone
>you flip the picture over as Shelby pulls the car over in front of a market
>it's more lively than the government building
>you see through the windows a few anthros inside
>and walking out is a human
>dwarfed by a horse anthro who has him pressed up to her side
>she keeps a hand on the back of his neck, directing him down the sidewalk and around the corner
>just how things are
>when you step out of the car and enter the store, you keep your hand to yourself
>"I'll see if they have a cookbook. Anon, you think you could get some simple things to start with? Vegetables?"
>you nod and wander off deeper into the market
>you barely have a chance to select some decent looking onions when you hear heavy padding footsteps stop behind you
>"Hello, little thing."
>the hairs on the back of your neck stand up
>whoever it is, you can feel her leering over you, her shadow blocking out the lights above your head
>definitely a predator
>you want to turn around and tell her to leave you alone
>what good that would do you
>so instead you keep facing forward, not looking back as you respond
"I'm sorry, miss. I'm already married."
>you hear the pout in her voice as she steps back
>"Oh but you were all alone. You shouldn't wander so far from your wife, little thing. It's not safe; you might give a woman the wrong idea."
>the stranger leans in close to let her breath roll over the back of your neck, before turning to stalk off
>you stare down at the small display until you're sure she's gone
>should have known what kind of attention you'd grab on your own
>going to catch another civil disharmony charge at this rate
>then you remember
>your hand goes to your pocket
>and you untangle from it a silver ring
>would it help?
>you stare at the thing for several seconds before you shove it back into your pocket
>don't need to get bogged down in thoughts again
>you gather a few more things you think would work
>Shelby finds you as you're stuffing some potatoes into a wire basket along with the rest of your collection
>"Here you go! Right near the front!"
>she presents a book to you
>'Easy Recipes for the First Time Cook'
>well it's the right book for you
>you add it to the pile
>"Did you have any trouble?"
>you consider her question, wondering if she knew about your short conversation with the stranger
>but she'd be far more serious if she suspected something
>you just shake your head
"None at all."
>she wags her tail and grins brightly
>"Great! Why don't you pick a few recipes for the week and we can get the rest!"
>you spend the rest of your time there at Shelby's side, going through pages of simple recipes and listing off ingredients
>most of it looks far beyond you in skill and price
>but Shelby assures you it won't be a problem as she loads up the basket
>"I'll take care of it. It'll be worth it to have some home cooked food!"
>once it's full, Shelby takes the now heavy basket from your hand and hefts it easily
>she paid for it all at the counter near the entrance with three bills
>along with a small package she quickly swept into a jacket pocket before you could see what it was
>there's enough that you don't have room for it all in your lap, so the food too has to be fit into the trunk out in the car
>you're glad to fall into the passenger seat of the car finally
>it's a strange feeling to be looking forward to the apartment you were so wary of just yesterday
>"Well! Certainly got a lot done already huh? Thanks for coming out with me, much better running errands with company."
>Shelby reaches over from her side to pat your head
>"You already make things so much nicer for me. Thank you Anon."
>you don't know how to respond
>you feel you hadn't done much of anything
>the headpat is nice though
>Shelby smiles sweetly, and you realize you're leaning into her hand
>your face burns in embarrassment and you lean back to a neutral position
>"So cute..."
>Shelby mutters to herself, but you catch it
>only makes you burn more
>to regain some composure, you crack open the cookbook
>you think the baked fish should be easy enough
>just salt, pepper, oil, and fish
>and heat
>"Big plans for dinner, Anon?"
>you nod
>just need to figure out how to cook the vegetables
>Shelby pulls over in front of her apartment
>you gather up the paperwork and the photograph when you climb out of the car
>and you go to the trunk to start carrying some things in
>Shelby tries to shoo you from picking up the boxes of clothes, but you've already got them
"If you could just get the food, please. I don't have enough hands."
>"Fine, fine. Let me get the door for you then."
>she scoops up the paper bags of food and scurries ahead of you
>true to her word, she holds open the door to the building, then sneaks around you on the stairs to get the apartment door
>"Here, why don't you drop those in our--er, the bedroom. Thanks Anon."
>is it your bedroom?
>are you going to take the couch again?
>sounds like a problem for later
>for now, food
>you set the boxes, with the paperwork and photo on top, down on the bed and run back to the kitchen
>Shelby's working on organizing the food
>you take what you need to get started, and flip open the cookbook
>two cuts of fish in a baking dish, salt and pepper
>you set the oven on and drop the dish inside
>you leave it to cook and go to find pots for the vegetables
>"Do you need any help there, Anon?"
>Shelby watches you as you work
>and leans in anxiously whenever you pick up a knife to cut or peel something
>you're surprised she hasn't tried to pry one from your hand already
>"Anon, did you do the fish right? I think I smell..."
>you pull open the oven, and the smell of burnt fish floods the room
>you sputter and curse
>you reach out to try and take the fish out, but Shelby jumps forward
>"No!"
>she grabs your wrist and yanks it back
>"You'll burn yourself!"
>oh right
>"Please Anon! Be more careful!"
>she takes out a dish towel to pull the burning fish out of the oven, which she deposits on the countertop
>she slams the oven closed and turns back to you
>"Are you okay?"
>she still has an iron grip on your wrist, which you tug lightly against
"I'm fine. You're squeezing too hard."
>she lets go of your wrist and steps back
>"I hurt you? Oh no! Anon, I'm sorry, I didn't--Is it bad?"
>she goes for your wrist again, but you pull back
"I'm okay Shelby. Just let me try and fix this."
>Shelby visibly wilts, her tail and ears drooping
>stepping aside, she lets you work at trying to salvage the food
>she still watches you work
>the fish is charred on the outside, but some of the inside may still be edible
>you overdid the vegetables too
>mushy potatoes, and wilted greens
>the two plates of food you manage to put together are rather pathetic
>you set them out on the table
>Shelby joins you as you sit down to eat
>she makes a valiant attempt at eating your food
>and manages to avoid coughing too loud when she swallows a bite of fish
"Sorry. I guess I really don't know what I'm doing."
>you pick at your food a little more
>"It's okay Anon. You did your best! And you'll get more practice. Is your wrist--it's not hurt is it?"
>you shake your head and roll your wrist to show it's fine
>"I didn't meant to hurt you, I was just worried. If you got hurt I don't know what I would have done and I just--It's like--"
>she growls in frustration
>"It's in my blood. I have to protect my--protect what I care about. I can't help it."
>what did Shelby's neighbor say?
>'a shepherd dog's property'?
>you continue to move food around your plate
>at least the potatoes were mostly edible, and filling
>you manage to eat enough to justify calling it a meal
>Shelby seems to have had her fill as well
>you rise to start clearing the table
>the mess in the kitchen will need more work too
>Shelby stops you from taking her plate
>"Thank you for making dinner, Anon. It was good! For, you know, a first try."
>she laughs weakly
>you smile along with it
"Thanks for saving my hands. I'll try not to burn them tomorrow."
>Shelby's ears finally perk back up, and her tail swings a bit
>"I got these for us, to celebrate."
>she pulls from her pocket a box of toffees
>she tears into it, revealing a half-dozen wrapped candies which she holds out to you
>you take one and unwrap it, chewing it as you take up Shelby's plate to carry it to the sink
>it's sweet, and sticks to your teeth
>perfect
>you get what washing up done you can, leaving the oven dish to soak in warm soapy water in the vague hope of the burn fish loosening off it
>by the time you're done, Shelby's disappeared from the table, and migrated to the couch
>where she's clearly expecting you to join her
>no reason not to
>she's shed her coat, leaving her in a pristine white sweater, and the leggings that distracted you so much in the morning
>you settle down next to her
>and wait for her to make a move
>she breaks the silence after a few minutes of sitting awkwardly
>"Are you afraid of me, Anon?"
>you look to her, mouth open to respond
>but you don't have an answer
>"Afraid of anthros?"
>she's either a fantastic guess, or read you very well
>or you're that obvious
"I am. You should know why boys end up in State homes."
>she takes your answer in silence
>then she opens her arm, holding it for you to accept or reject her embrace
>make it work
>you lean over into her arm, which she wraps around you protectively
>"I don't want you to be afraid of me. I want to protect you. I want you to be happy. I want to be happy with you. But I'm not going to force you to do anything, you understand? You're safe with me, no matter what."
>try as you might, there's no answer you can give that satisfies
>Shelby holds you, a little awkwardly as you have to lean over to remain in her embrace
>so she scoots closer
>her head rests against yours, soft fur tickling your cheek
>then she takes a deep inhale through her nose
>she starts to sigh in contentment, before sniffing again
>her nose pokes into your neck as she smells intently
>you realize exactly what she’s smelling
>and brace yourself for another line of questioning
>instead she only murmurs softly
>”Are you okay? Did she touch you?”
>you shake your head
“I’m okay. I told her I was married.”
>Shelby relaxes
>”Good.”
>she doesn’t push the matter further, and settles back down in comfortable silence
>she does keep sniffing you though
>her nose tracing a chilly line over your neck, behind your ear, and through your hair
>you lean away from her probing nose, but she tightens her hug around you
>"Hang on..."
>she shivers slightly, before gasping and letting you go
>"Oh! Sorry! I wasn't thinking. You just--"
>Shelby takes a few deep breaths
>"I like your scent, Anon."
>you blush
>wait, should you be flattered by that?
>you shake your head
"Just ticklish."
>Shelby gives you a sly grin, clearly noticing your reaction
>"Of course Anon. Ticklish. I'll be more careful."
>she's still grinning when you pick yourself up off the couch
"I ought to finish cleaning..."
>easy excuse to make
>you return to the kitchen and work at scrubbing the oven dish clean of the charred fish remnants
>"Can I ask you something, Anon?"
>you hear Shelby get up off the couch, and glance over to see her folding up the bedding from last night
"Go ahead."
>you watch out the corner of your eye as she walks into the kitchen
>"Is there anything in particular you like about me?"
>you turn to look at her
>Shelby stands in the middle of the kitchen, arms turned out slightly
>legs
>legs
>legs
>"Uh..."
>she giggles at your reaction
>you know she could see where your eyes went
>"Well, you don't have to answer me if you don't like. I was just curious."
>she stands there a moment longer, letting you admire her
>her tail is wagging fast
>"I think my favorite part about you is your eyes. The way they open so wide when you Iook into mine."
>you look into her eyes
>and they sparkle green
>fuck, that may beat out the legs
"Shelby, you're too kind."
>she smiles and leans forward to kiss your cheek
>"I think that's you! Thanks for finishing the dishes dear. I'll let you finish up."
>she bounces out of the room, all smiles
>you look back to your work
>finishing it doesn't take all that long
>once you've set everything out to dry you wander back to the living room
>Shelby isn't there
>so you decide to follow her to the bedroom
>could use a change of clothes anyhow
>you haven't had a change in a couple days
>considering it, that may be why Shelby was so into your smell
>you crack the door to the bedroom and peer inside
>you see the form of Shelby, leaning over the bed and staring down at something in front of her
>the boxes of clothes are set aside, already empty
>you step inside and Shelby's ears perk
>"Hi Anon. I was putting some of your clothes away and then I looked at your photograph..."
>you stand alongside her to stare down at the picture
>you don't feel like reminiscing anymore
>did enough of that in the car
>you pick it up
"I can tell you about them tomorrow. I need a shower, and a change of clothes."
>Shelby nods
>"Of course, Anon. I put your clothes in the dresser. Bottom drawer."
>you set the picture down on the dresser and collect your single set of ragged pajamas
>and some boxers
>Shelby is still standing by the bed when you go to leave
>you stand by her a moment and consider her
"Shelby."
>she cocks her head
>"Hmm?"
>you lean over and kiss her cheek
"Thanks for putting away my clothes. And for buying me dinner. And the toffee. And everything else."
>Shelby gasps and goes rigid
>her hand goes to her cheek and she trembles
>you may have made a mistake
>"You're welcome."
>she squeaks out the words at first, but then her voice gets husky
>"You should go shower, Anon."
>you take her advice, and make a hasty exit with your clothes in hand
>you make sure to lock the bathroom door behind you
>just a little paranoid
>you manage to calm those fears once you're in the shower and the hot water is running
>it's amazing how good it is here
>the water doesn't turn to ice after a minute of running
>and the shower is big enough for you to clean yourself without having to contort into strange poses just to reach
>nothing like that here
>once you're clean, you let the water run over you again
>like all your muscles are melting
>you'll have to thank her for that as well
>once you're out of the shower, you change into your pajamas
>a plain undershirt and loose-fitting cotton pants
>what a relief
>when you step out of the shower, Shelby is in the hall waiting and fidgeting
"Oh. Shelby, where should I put--"
>she bustles past you and slams the door shut
>"Laundry basket in my closet!"
>you hear her voice through the door and over the sound of the shower coming to life
>you shrug and go to take care of what you can
>the laundry basket is where she said, and you put your clothes in with a small pile of hers
>and then you straighten out the bed
>why not?
>things ought to be orderly
>Shelby keeps things pretty clean so there's not much for you to do
>you instead look around her bedroom, taking in more details now that it isn't the middle of the night
>her walls are mostly unadorned, save a small certificate hanging on one wall, and over the bed a photograph
>you check the photograph first
>it's a family portrait
>three young collies, all in sunshine yellow sundresses
>arranged around a human, who smiles down at the three
>and behind him is an full grown collie woman who puts her hands possessively on the human's shoulders
>you consider the family photo
>certainly looks happier than yours
>your family
>and your photograph
>she never mentioned her parents, but they looked about what you expected
>a human and an anthro
>Shelby inherited her father's eyes
>your train of thought is interrupted
>you cock your head at a strange sound from the hall
>it sounds like Shelby's crying over the sound of the shower
>but not quite the same as last night
>when you step out into the hallway, you hear it clearer
>the high pitched yelps are mixed with growls and muttering
>against better judgement, you lean into the door to listen closer
>"Anon...oh fuck Anon..."
>she isn't crying
>her breath hitches and she growls your name
>holy shit
>you push off the door and stumble back toward her bedroom
>and trip over your panicked feet
>you sprawl over the floor with an 'oof'
>once you get up onto your feet, Shelby's shut the water off
>"Anon? Everything alright?"
>she sounds out of breath as she calls out
>scrambling further away, you try to control your voice in response
"I'm okay! I'm fine. Just fine."
>Shelby opens the door and peers out at you standing back against the bedroom door
>you can see she has just a towel covering her from the chest down
>her fur isn't even wet
>you stare at her, and she stares back
>this goes on for several pregnant seconds
>finally, Shelby breaks the silence
>"I will try to be more quiet."
>she disappears back into the bathroom, and the shower turns on again
>you watch the door for several seconds
>and you picture exactly what she was doing in there
>bare fur
>from top to tail
>and those long, long legs
>an errant thought crosses your mind
>what if you knocked on the door?
>what if...
>what if she gets angry with you?
>what if she assaults you?
>what if she bites?
>you press the heels of your hands against your eyes to force out the lurid images dancing through your mind
>and hopefully settle down the traitorous part of your body that still urges you to make foolish choices
>but your primal brain argues back
>she's going to ask for it eventually
>maybe she'll take it
>if you did it now, she might be gentle with you
>or it might set her off
>set free that angry side
>you don't know
>and you shouldn't want to find out
>find out anyways
>no!
>you rap a fist against your head and grunt in annoyance
>damn your blood!
>it's pumping away from your brain
>if Shelby weren't in there right now, you'd take a cold shower yourself
>you have to settle for slipping back into the bedroom and throwing yourself facedown on the bed
>too many thoughts
>you take a deep breath
>and then another
>and another
>settling down finally
>"Anon."
>you spin about on the bed, looking to the now open door
>Shelby's standing there, dressed in a nightgown
>you're relieved
>and a little disappointed
>"I don't think you should sleep with me tonight, Anon. For your own good."
>you nod and get up off the bed
>Shelby stands aside from the doorway and you have to squeeze past her
>she takes a deep inhale through her nose as you do
>then shuts the door behind you
>couch it is
>you return to the living room to settle down for the night
>just to be sure, you take the spare pillow and use it to cover your ears
>you lay in silence for a while, wrestling with thoughts of Shelby
>Shelby in her nightgown
>Shelby in nothing at all
>her nose pressed against your neck, inhaling your scent
>this isn't going to go away
>but you're not going to take care of it yourself
>not when Shelby would sniff it out
>so you sit and stew
>but eventually fall asleep
>your sleep is deep and dreamless
>and you wake up feeling well rested
>the house is quiet, so you simply lay there in warmth and comfort
>you’ll have to get up and face the day eventually
>but it’s much easier to just ignore it all and relax
>strange feeling
>being able to relax for a little while
>you’ve been so high strung these last few days
>last few years
>last decade and a half
>just shut your mind off and relax
>you’re not sure how long you spend dozing on the couch
>long enough that Shelby has time to wake up and start moving around
>you hear her door open, lazy footsteps coming down the hallway followed by a yawn
>”You awake, Anon?”
>you roll over and look at Shelby
>her long fur is a mess, sticking out at odd angles on her head and shoulders
>you weren’t ready for the sight
>she's cute
>”Sleep well?”
>you sit up on the couch and nod to her
>”Good. I’m sorry about how the night ended, but I didn’t know if I could control myself.”
>she steps over to sit down next to you
>you expect her to reach out for you again, but she folds her hands in her lap
>she’s quiet and serious
>”You know that’s going to happen too. Soon enough. And I want you to be comfortable with it when it does. But I have things I want too. Needs. Just…be careful with your affection, if you aren’t ready for me to take what I need from you.”
>that makes your stomach turn flips
>’take what I need from you’
>you scoot away from her and think of a way to turn away from the subject
>but Shelby continues
>”Look at me, Anon. I know you have those needs too, and I don’t want you taking care of them yourself. Once you’re comfortable with me, I will take care of you. You understand?”
>you manage to look her in the eye and nod
>she frowns
>”Tell me you understand, Anon. We are married and we will have to make the marriage complete someday.”
>you knew that would happen eventually
>hope she’s gentle
“I understand, Shelby. I just need time.”
>Shelby nods slowly
>”Of course Anon. We’ll have another talk soon. Just one last thing.”
>she breaks into a sly grin
>”I think it’s time you answered my question from last night.”
>she finally reaches out to you, hooking an arm around your shoulders to drag you into her side
>”Which part of me is your favorite, Anon? Is it my hips? My breasts? I’m not as big as other girls but I’m soft and warm in all the right places…”
>you’re caught off guard by her sudden change in mood
>from deathly serious to sultry and teasing
>you stammer out a few non-words as your brain struggles to function
>her fur is so soft
>that nightgown doesn’t cover much below her thighs
>”I need an answer before I can let you go, Anon.”
>she squeezes you tighter into her side
>finally you manage to connect two brain cells
“Legs! Your legs. I like your legs, Shelby.”
>Shelby’s eyes widen in surprise
>”Oh!”
>her mouth hangs open for a couple seconds, before she descends into an embarrassed giggle
>”Wow! I wasn’t expecting you to say that! You really like my legs huh? You must have really enjoyed those leggings I wore too. And gosh, my nightgown shows them off plenty.”
>she runs a hand down her thigh
>”I guess I can see why you’d like them. They’re long, aren’t they?”
>you give a strained nod
>all this teasing has got your blood pumping
>thankfully you’re already seated to hide your growing erection
“They are. And I really do like them. But it’s–I’m not–”
>you flounder for a few seconds
>Shelby shushes you with a finger to your lips
>”It’s okay Anon, I’ll stop teasing. Oh but you look so cute with that blush, and the way you try to hide your arousal from me. Are you sure you’re not ready for me to take care of you?”
>she has lied about not teasing you
“I’m sure.”
>saying that took some effort
>but you only have to remind yourself who it is that’s teasing you
>the collie you’ve been forcibly wed to
>who growled your name last night
>who’s an inspector for the State
>you’re just not ready for all that yet
>Shelby pouts and relaxes back into the couch
>”If you say so, Anon. You’re still safe with me, you know. Even if I like to tease.”
>despite your fear of her, you still don’t like to see her sad
“Uh, maybe I could make us breakfast this morning?”
>her pout drops and she breaks into a grin
>”Now that sounds lovely! I think that cookbook has recipes for eggs.”
>eggs sound like an excellent idea
>after the lackluster meal last night, you’re starving
>you spring off the couch, grabbing up the cookbook once you’ve crossed to the kitchen
>scrambled eggs look easy enough
>Shelby follows to watch over your shoulder as you work
>eggs, salt, pepper, some onion
>beat them together and set them to cook on the skillet
>thankfully with two sets of eyes on them, you manage to keep the eggs from burning
>after a few minutes of stirring and cooking you have two plates of scrambled eggs
>you’ve made presentable food
>a miracle
>”Looks great dear! You look really cute when you’re concentrating on your work.”
“Thank you. Could you get us a couple slices of bread to go with the eggs?”
>Shelby goes to work on her task, cutting into the fresh bought bread while you move the food over to the table
>the end results are a marked improvement over last night
>Shelby tears into the food, forgoing utensils to scoop it all onto her slice of bread
>then she devours it in three big bites
>bits of egg and crumbs go scattering over her
>you must have been staring because she covers her mouth sheepishly when she looks up at you
>”Sorry. Hungry. It was really good Anon!”
>your breakfast goes down cleaner, but with no less gusto
>simple but filling
>feels good after skipping most of a meal last night
>you start collecting dishes to start cleaning
>Shelby offers you hers when you reach out for it
>”Thanks Anon. Once the dishes are done we have the whole day to ourselves! I can put on some music and we can relax. Could find my old detective novels out of my closet if you wanted to read. Whatever you like!”
>you consider the options as you deposit the dishes in the sink and start washing
“Detective novels?”
>she nods her head enthusiastically
>”Mhm! A couple of ones from Before, and some more recent stuff too. My dad used to read them to me and my sisters when we were pups.”
>her ever-present smile twists into a frown
>she looks away from you
>for several seconds she looks down at the table
>you decide to break the silence
“From Before? Really?”
>Shelby shakes her head and turns back to you
>”Well, they’re not that old. Just copies of stories from Before that I got from the Bureau of History Correction. Would you like to see them?”
>why not?
>it’s been a while since you had something new to read
>and you’ve never read something from Before
>must have cost a bundle
“I’d like to give them a read sometime. Thank you Shelby.”
>”Of course! What’s mine is yours, Anon. Let me go get them!”
>she leaves the table and trots down the hall to her room
>you start putting away dishes while she’s gone
>the eggs clean easier than the fish from last night
>another miracle
>”Okay!”
>Shelby reappears, carrying a small stack of books
>”I’ve got…’Murder on the Orient Express’, and ‘Hound of the Baskervilles’. Those are the Before ones.”
>she sets the top two aside on the kitchen table
>”And the rest of these are the newer ones. I really loved ‘The Bidding’ if you wanted to start with these.”
>the other half-dozen books she drops with slightly less care
>you notice she’s still holding something from the bottom of the pile
>”And I brought that photo of yours, if you felt like talking about it.”
>she sets that down last, in between the two book piles
>another thing you would put off if you could
>you sigh and join her at the table, ignoring the photograph to pick up one of the old books
“So the stories from Before, what are they like?”
>Shelby hums thoughtfully
>”They’re different. The bureau had to modify them to fit with State content requirements, but it’s still interesting to see how different some things were.”
>you set aside the last fork and go to join her at the table
>she holds up one of the books to you
>'Murder on the Orient Express'
>a red cover with black lettering on the front with the title
>"Best way to find out is to read it."
>you take it from her paw and look it over
>no sign of the author's name anywhere on it
>Shelby stacks up the rest while you open to the first page
>on the first page, in faded blocky letters, is a State warning
>'ATTENTION: THIS WORK HAS BEEN MODIFIED BY THE BUREAU OF HISTORY CORRECTION. IT CONTAINS DEPICTIONS OF VIOLENCE, CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY, AND LIFE IN PRE-STATE SOCIETY. READ WITH CAUTION.'
"Am I allowed to read this? The warning on the front seems pretty official."
>Shelby laughs
>"If anyone asks, I'll say it was for my work. Why don't you take it to the couch?"
>she shows you back toward the living room
>and follows behind you as you take a spot on the couch
>when you look up at her, you see the photograph in her paws
>she's not going to let it go is she?
"You want to talk about the home still?"
>she nods
>"If you're comfortable. I know I said you could read, but I want to get to know you a little more. Please?"
>you thought 'puppy-dog eyes' was just an expression
>but Shelby's are open wide, begging wordlessly
>you sigh
"If it will make you happy."
>her tail wags cheerfully as she drops down beside you
>"Thank you Anon! I promise it will only be a little bit! You're too kind to me. So!"
>she sets the photo in front of you in your lap
>"Were any of these boys your friends?
"I knew some of them better than others.”
>you pick out a face in the group, a kid that looks like he’s close to the same age as you are in the photo and point him out to Shelby
“That’s Marc. He chose the music class too. They gave him the accordion.”
>you find another one you recognize, an older kid, bulky and tough looking
>he scowls at the camera
“Kovacs. He’d bully the smaller kids, but he also taught some of us how to play cards. Two-card, five-card, aces and eights. Stuff like that.”
>Shelby cocks her head
>”He bullied you too?”
>you shrug
"Sure. I wasn't exactly big and tough back then. Or now. But he wasn't so bad. The only time he got in a real fight, Mrs. Kerr whipped his knuckles bloody."
>Shelby huffs angrily
>"She shouldn't have done that. He's just a boy."
>oh, well if she didn't like hearing that story she wouldn't want to hear about--
>”Who’s this? What happened to him?”
>she interrupts your train of thought, pointing to the older boy with the black eye
"Oh. That's Leigh. Loony Leigh, we called him."
>"Loony Leigh?"
>with a sigh, you gently prize the photo from Shelby's paw
"Loony Leigh. He...really didn't like the state. And he claimed a lot of different things. Like how they were gonna start assigning two wives. And lower the marriage age to fifteen. Stuff like that."
>"He must have been afraid. I wish someone was there to have taken care of him. Shown him all the good the state can do."
>you're not sure how much good the state has done for you
>but you feel no need to voice that opinion
>you put the photo on the arm rest, away from Shelby
"I think that's all I can say about Leigh. I'd rather not talk about the home any more, if that's okay."
>giving you another one-armed hug, Shelby cuddles you
>"Of course Anon! Only as much as you want to talk about."
>you breath an internal sigh of relief
>Leigh's full story would have set her off
>"Why don't you read a little? I can sit here with you and we can both relax."
>you open the book to start reading
>a lot of it flies over your head
>place names you don't recognize
>and strangest of all there are still human women
>as you continue reading about the detective, you find yourself settling into Shelby's embrace
>soft fur tickling your skin
>the rise and fall of her chest as she breaths
>and she's warm
>with so little fabric between you two, you can feel her body warmth
>Shelby rests her head atop yours
>it's so comfortable you could fall back asleep
>and after a short while, you realize that's exactly what Shelby's done
>BRRRING
>BRRRING
>BRRRING
>you snap awake
>must have fallen asleep
>you try to get up to look for the source of that ringing
>sounds like a telephone somewhere in the kitchen
>but you find yourself restrained by a furry arm
>oh right
>Shelby’s still holding onto you
>you have to put conscious thought into suppressing a sudden jolt of fear at the realization
>you’re fine
>you fell asleep in her arms and she didn’t do a thing to you
>the phone rings again and Shelby stirs
>”Mm. Not yet.”
>she hugs you tighter against your side, grumbling softly
>you’re starting to feel a little constricted now
>that phone is still ringing
>Shelby finally shows more life, slowly sitting up straight
>and dragging you up with her
>”What time’s’it?”
>you don’t know
>still light out
“I think your phone is ringing, Shelby.”
>she takes a deep breath and reluctantly releases you from her embrace
>”Better go check that then…”
>grumbling all the way, Shelby pushes off the couch and lumbers across the room and into the kitchen
>the ringing stops
>”Hello? Yes this is Inspector Winn.”
>she sounds annoyed
>”What? When? Well who was supposed to be looking into it?”
>Shelby growls in frustration
>while she’s on the phone, you go to pick up the novel you had been reading off the floor
>you’ve lost your place
>”I took the entire week off. I’m with my–I’m with my husband! Yes! Has Inspector Shay fallen off the face of the Earth? Why can’t she deal with this?”
>she gives a defeated sigh
>”Yes, yes I understand. The needs of the state are above my own, of course. I’ll report first thing tomorrow. Yes ma’am.”
>you hear something slam and then more muttering from Shelby
>”Damn it all. Damn it, damn it, damn it.”
>she returns to the living room looking absolutely livid
>you blanch at the sight of her
>fur raised in anger, teeth bared, and a slight growl on every exhale
>then she locks eyes with you
>Shelby closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, and forces herself to smile
>”Sorry about that. I’m afraid I’ve been called in to work tomorrow, so we can’t spend the whole week together like I planned.”
>the false smile isn’t convincing
>her ears and tail are still drooping in dejection
>Shelby flops back onto the couch and groans
>”Can’t have one lousy week, can I?”
>her paws go over her eyes as she rubs at her face
>”Now this headache is gonna bother me for all the time we have left.”
>you watch as she works at massaging away the frustration from the sudden change in her plans
>you want her to feel better
>she’s been nice to you so far
>and she held you while you two slept
>you turn your body and put your arms around Shelby
>and tuck your head into the crook of her shoulder
>you feel her stiffen at your touch
>then she wraps an arm around you
>”Didn’t I say to be careful with your affection, Anon?”
>she did
>maybe this was a bad idea
“Sorry, I just wanted to make you feel a little better.”
>you start to pull away, but Shelby takes one of your hands and forces it around her again, enforcing your hug
>”It’s okay. Just keep holding onto me, you’re doing a wonderful job at making me feel better.”
>she pokes her nose against your head and sniffs at your hair some
>”Good pup…”
>that’s new
>but it makes her happy
>Shelby huffs your hair a little longer, before finally going near limp
>she falls back into the couch and you go with her as you maintain the hug
>”You don’t mind me calling you that, right? Pup? You’re just so cute, so small and soft it just seems natural.”
>with a giggle, she starts to run a paw through your hair
>she’s petting you again
>”Aww, I can feel you getting warmer. You do like it, don’t you? It’s alright, just hold onto me for a little while, pup. It’ll make going back to work tomorrow so much easier knowing that you’ll be waiting for me when I get home.”
>you will be, won’t you?
>every day from now on, waiting on her, sitting with her, holding onto her like this
>for the rest of your life
>it’s hard to comprehend
>much easier to focus on getting through one minute to the next
>so that’s what you do
“I just want to make it work.”
>Shelby just hums and strokes your hair
>you hold each other, your face pressed against her fur
>she smells nice
>the slight sweetness of her soap over a more natural, earthy scent
>another reason to like her, in spite of your fear
>are you still afraid of her?
>when she holds you close like this?
>how could she be the feral, cruel thing you imagined while awaiting your assignment?
>why would she need you to be assigned to her?
>you could ask
>but what if you don’t like the answer?
>but you’re safe with Shelby
>she said so herself
“Shelby.”
>you speak softly, barely more than a whisper
>she stops humming
>breaking the comfortable quiet almost guilts you into dropping the matter
>make it work
>”Can I ask you something?”
>”Of course. Anything at all.”
>so she’s told you
>you bite down on the apprehension and force yourself to speak
“Why did you choose me? Why get an assigned husband?”
>her paw stops stroking your hair
>she rests the arm around you again, now focusing on your question
>for several seconds she’s still and silent
>you’re about to tell her to forget the question when Shelby answers
>”I was lonely, Anon. I was lonely, and with my work, I couldn’t…”
>Shelby trails off into a deep sigh
>”You heard that call. You remember what Allie said, that I’m always working. The State requires everyone to give fully for the common good. And with what I do, as an Inspector, I see…”
>once again she’s unable to finish the thought
>she’s wilting in your arms now, eyes dropping to the floor
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked. Forget it.”
>Shelby shushes you and starts petting you again
>”It’s okay Anon. I just wasn’t ready for that question. Give me a little time to think of how to say it.”
>that is fair enough
>she’s never forced you into anything, how could you do the same to her
>answers will have to wait a little while
>you nestle back into her side and hug around her waist
>Shelby continues to hold and pet you, but idly as she stares looks away from you in thought
>a part of you feels sick at ruining the tenderness of the moment
>but if you didn't ask now, it would only come later
>your thoughts have time to run
>surely it couldn't just be her work that made her choose someone like you
>even if she needed an assigned husband, you were far from a prime candidate
>ironic, considering you were now willingly clinging to your wife as though it were your choice
>Shelby just has that effect, it seems
>pure sweetness
>and she was afraid you'd hate her for it
>things are more complicated than they seem
>time passes at a snail’s pace
>all this thinking hasn’t given you a single satisfactory answer
>but Shelby speaks up sooner than you expected
>”Alright. I think I’m ready.”
>you pick your head up off her shoulder and look up into her eyes
>”I work for the State. You know that. I’m an inspector for the Office of Human affairs. My work has me dealing with humans. The ones who are afraid of anthros, and the ones who hate them. And…”
>Shelby frowns
>”And I deal with abused humans. Ones who are bitten, who are clawed, who are locked up in bedrooms and closets.”
>she almost seems in physical pain as she talks about it
>”It hurts to see what happens to some men. Men like you, who are so terrified of anthros that they risk state punishment rather than face assignment. Men like Leigh, who are beaten by those who are supposed to look after him.”
>it’s not a shock that she could guess what happened to him
>she must be good at her work
>”I guess I just–I wanted to do better. For you. Or whoever was assigned to me. Humans need anthros, Anon. We need humans. So I asked to be assigned a husband so maybe he wouldn’t have to be afraid of anthros. Wouldn’t have to hate them. And there’s more to it, but I’m not ready to talk about it just yet. I’m sorry.”
>by the time she’s done, Shelby looks like a wreck
>tears leak down her cheeks and her head hangs low
>did she really do it for you?
>she got an assigned husband just to try and make his life better?
>the gifts
>the food
>the worry and protection
>all for your sake
>you’re not sure what to think of it
>there’s more reasoning to it than that
>she’s said as much
>but she also said she wants to make you happy, keep you safe
“Thank you Shelby. For answering me. You’ve been so kind to me, I didn’t believe it. I still don’t know if I believe it.”
>you consider what to say next
>how you could explain years of anxiety and paranoia still bearing down on you
“I’m still afraid. Of you. About you. All of this. It seems too good to be true, and I’m just waiting for things to turn. I know you said I’m safe, but part of me is still terrified. I’ll do something wrong or say something that upsets you, then it’s teeth and claws. Teeth and claws.”
>you shudder at the memory
>of shouting voices and snapping fangs
>of a canine not so different from Shelby
>but you fight the rising urge to try get away from her
>Shelby is different
>”Oh Anon. Oh my sweet pup, it’s okay. You could never say anything that would make me hurt you. You’ve been so brave, letting me hold you and doing your best for me.”
>Shelby leans in close
>and then she presses her lips against yours in a kiss
>you’re stunned
>she pulls back, looking somewhere between abashed and loving
>”I’m glad you were honest, Anon. You make me so happy just trying to make things work. I just can’t help myself…”
>she kisses you again
>”You’re safe with me. I’ll always take care of you.”
>and again
>”You’re my pup, my husband.”
>one more time
>”My love.”
>your heart hammers in your chest
>she doesn’t stop kissing you
>your lips
>your cheeks
>all over your face
>you can only just focus enough to hold onto her
>Shelby reaches her other paw to plant on your shoulder
>she pushes you back, forcing you down onto your back
>and she follows you down, folding over on top of you
>now you’re pinned
>her kisses get more forceful, more fervent
>whap whap whap!
>her now freed tail wags against the back of the couch in her eagerness
>one paw traces down your side, before sneaking under your undershirt to start tracing over bare skin
>her warm paw pads and soft fur tickle along your belly as she works her way up
>and works your shirt upward
>this is going too fast
>Shelby loves you?
>is it too soon for that?
>you move your hands to her shoulders
>you try to push her away
“Shelby, wai–mh!”
>she interrupts you with another kiss
>her other paw squeezes on your shoulder and she groans
>”Anon.”
>her voice is full of need
>she’s desperate
>”I know, I know you’re not ready.”
>she stares down at you, green eyes deep and dark
>”You…you’re safe. Just one thing. For me.”
>she keeps unbreaking eye contact as she withdraws her paw from under your shirt
>then it takes your hand from her shoulder, and draws it down until it’s holding down on her thigh
>”Feel those legs you love so much~”
“Sha…Shel…”
>fuck
>you can’t even think
>her fur is soft and silky
>and beneath it you feel toned muscle
>your other hand drifts down to her other thigh
>and they explore, up, down, over her thighs
>Shelby pants
>you can’t help yourself
“Shelby. You’re beautiful. Soft. Strong. Fuck.”
>giggling, she gently redirections your hands to her hips
>then she lowers herself down on top of you, arms going around behind your head to hug your face into her chest
>”I’m glad you like them. Just remember I’ll take care of you, whenever you have needs.”
>Shelby gives a slow nod to your answer
>she sits in silent thought for a while, a slight frown on her face as she seems to concentrate
>but suddenly she smiles, ears perking
>"I have another question, Anon! This one should be much easier."
>she squeezes your hand in both paws
>"Do you like it when I hold your hand?"
>that's not what you were expecting
>certainly an easier answer than questioning the forceful shift of your entire life
"I do."
>the collie beams
>whupwhupwhup goes her tail
>"I do too! Okay, next question: did you like it when I held you?"
>you're starting to sense a pattern
>though you'd never have believed it possible just a week ago, you did like it
>fuck
>you like being held in your wife's arms
>are you just weak willed?
>Shelby's still watching you, eyes wide, a smile playing on her face
"I uh, yeah. I did."
>Shelby gasps as though it were a surprise
>you're sure your burning cheeks were already answer enough
>"I hoped you would! I loved it! You even fell asleep in my arms, oh it was perfect."
>her paws leave your hand and she goes to hug you again
>this time you let her
>she squeezes you close
>"And you were so scared of me just a few days ago."
>the giggle in your ear sends a shiver down your spine
>"But you've been so brave for me, Anon. Just one more question, okay?"
>she whispers in your ear
>her breath tickles your skin
"Okay."
>"Did you like it when I kissed you?"
>the last question comes in a low, sultry murmur
>you feel like you're going to burn up
>she's teasing you
>wants you feeling weak and off-guard
>she's sniffing at your hair again
>her paws start to trail down your back and over your side
>this is too much
>she's too close
>it's different from last time she held you
"Shel--"
>the moment you push against her, Shelby gasps and grabs your shoulders
>she pushes you away, holding you at arms length, mouth agape
>"Anon!"
>she shudders and lets go of you
>then jumps off the couch
>"I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I--"
>she shakes her head and takes several deep breaths
>you stare at her in shock at her sudden reaction
>she whines and covers her eyes with her paws
>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't--"
>she goes still
>you're still locked in place on the couch
>when her hands finally drop from her eyes, they lock on you
>Shelby's eyes
>deep green
>full of hunger
>hunger you've seen before
>you've felt before
>in groping paws
>gripping claws
>biting teeth
>"I can't help myself."
>panic rises in your chest
>Shelby is still staring at you
>she's an animal
>just like all the others
>you glance past her into the hall behind her
>to the door
>could you make it?
"Sh-Shelby, please..."
>damn your jaw
>teeth won't stop chattering
>you hold a hand out placatingly and slowly rise from the couch
"Please Shelby. I'm--I'm not ready.
>you edge to the side, painfully slow to keep from garnering a reaction
>Shelby just turns to watch you
>the hunger in her eyes abating
>but still there
>under the surface
>even if she calms down now, it will only happen later
>has to happen eventually
"Just let me...just let me...the bedroom."
>she glances away from you, down the hall
>you've just about made it around her
>"Anon."
>she takes another deep, shuddering breath
>"Anon, please..."
>before she's even finished taking a step toward you, you bolt
>three long strides down the hall
>hand on the doorknob
>"What?!"
>throw it open
>out into the stairwell
>go!
>you take the stairs two at a time
>just barely managing to keep balance
>you burst out the building's front door
>feet on cold pavement
>no shoes
>no time for them
>"Anon!"
>Shelby shouts from the stairwell compels you to run
>no time to think
>you race down the sidewalk on bare feet
>terror and adrenaline spur you faster
>you glance back to see if she's following
>out the front door to the building comes a blur of white and black fur
>those long legs propel Shelby after you faster than you could ever hope to escape
>you come to a stuttering stop and duck aside into an alley as she overshoots and whips past you
>you can feel the wind of her passing she's going so fast
>no time to marvel at her speed
>keep running
>you run down the alleyway
>only sheer dumb luck you don't plant your foot in broken glass or rusty metal
>you come out the other side of the alley, nearly running into a deer anthro
>she gasps and jumps back as you bolt past
>"What are--"
>she doesn't have time to finish her question as you've already crossed the street in a blind sprint
>you skid around the corner to the sound of the deer shouting for you to stop
>you're glancing behind you to check for Shelby pursuing through the alley
>so you don't see the state officer that looms up around the corner
>you slam into the sow and bounce off her heavy frame
>before you can topple to the ground, she grabs the collar of your shirt
>then spins and slams you against the wall
>she snorts in amusement
>"Fuck you think you're doing, humie? Trying to catch charges for assaulting a state officer?"
>you squirm against her grip, tugging at the meaty fist that grips your shirt
"Pleasepleasepleaseplease--"
>her other hand clamps down on your mouth, muffling your frantic gibbering
>she leans back to look at the state of you
>barefoot, shivering and struggling like a mad thing
>her angry expressions softens just a bit
>"Looks like you're already in trouble. What's the ma--AH! Fuck!"
>before the officer can finish her question, you open your mouth and bite down on her hand as hard as you can
>only thing you could think of
>she slams you against the wall again
>hard enough to stun you and break your clamp on her hand
>the sow snorts angrily and shakes you
>"Gonna put you in a pen for that you feral little shit!"
>she brings her arm across to backhand you
>you grit your teeth and wait for the blow
>it comes down hard
>your head snaps to the side
>the whole world goes fuzzy
>the pig pulls back for another blow
>but it doesn't fall
>something rams into the side of the officer
"Hands--off--my--husband!"
>it's Shelby
>you don't know if you're relieved or not
>she's a blur of snarling, teeth, and claws
>so ferocious the larger pig officer is completely caught off guard
>she drops you to try and fend Shelby off
>you fall against the pavement and watch the fight ensue
>the sow swings a heavy fist that doesn't come close to hitting Shelby
>Shelby grapples the officer, using the punch's momentum to trip and send the pig toppling to the ground
>to make her stay down, Shelby stomps the sow's head with a couple fierce kicks
>you watch in slack-jawed awe at the demon in a nightgown beating a larger opponent down
>Shelby steps forward and wordlessly grabs your wrist
>you're pulled up to your feet away from the officer and into a run away from the officer
>down the street, around the corner, over to the next block you're dragged along
>through flagging strength and post adrenaline crash
>all the way back to the apartment building
>Shelby pushes you ahead of her through the front door and then shepherds you up the steps and back into the apartment
>you hear as she slams the door and locks it
>by now you've curled up on the floor against the wall opposite the door, shaking from fear and exhaustion in equal measure
>you can't meet her eye when Shelby turns around to look down at you
"I'msorryI'msorryI'msorrypleaseShelbyI'msorry--"
>"Look at me."
>you keep muttering apologies
>covering your head with your arms
>dreading what she'll do to you
>fearing what she's capable of all the more
>you feel her paws on your head
>gentle at first, trying to lift it
>then when you refuse to go with her guidance, forcing you to look up
>to meet those piercing green eyes
>you expect her to say something
>to yell or bark in anger
>instead her paws slides down your face
>over your jaw
>it throbs in aching protest as she prods and pokes at where the officer struck you
>"Your jaw isn't broken."
>she sighs and releases your head
>Shelby stands up straight, and turns away toward her bedroom
>"Go into the living room. If anyone knocks at the door, don't answer."
>she leaves you alone in the hallway without another word
>the door to her bedroom shuts
>you're alone
>”Anon.”
>you stare up at Shelby as she glowers at you
>she steps down on you, her footpaw against your neck threatening to choke you
>you grasp and pry at it
>but it refuses to budge
>Shelby sneers
>”Anon”
>despite her expression, her voice is soft and calm
>she brings her footpaw off your neck and you breathe a sigh of relief
>then you jolt as she slams it back down to stomp your head against the ground just like she did to the officer
>”Anon.”
>you gasp and shake
>your eyes open
>and after taking a moment to focus, see your wife leaning over you where you lie
>at some point in the night you keeled over on your side to sprawl out on the floor
>it’s still dark outside, but you can make out details once you blink the sleep from your eyes
>Shelby looks different than usual
>her fur is neatly brushed and groomed
>instead of her usual colorful clothing or soft pink nightgown she’s clad in gray
>a color you recognize as the ominous gray of a state inspector’s uniform
>once that registers, a chill of dread runs through you
>you’d be scared of that uniform no matter who was wearing it
>”Anon. You’re awake.”
>her voice is calm and cold
>”You should have slept on the couch. Get up.”
>she doesn’t wait for you to stand on your own
>once you’ve pushed yourself back into a sitting position, she grabs your wrist and assists you up on your feet
>you don’t dare resist her when she starts to pull you along down the hall
>she flicks the lightswitch while leading you into the living room
>Shelby doesn’t let go until she’s you down on the couch
>”There.”
>you stare straight ahead, eyes level with her stomach
>the buttons on her uniform reflect the glow of the lightbulb on the ceiling
>Shelby drops to a knee in front of you, and you see her face clearly in the light
>her eyes are red, either from crying or lack of sleep
>maybe both
>but her expression is still calm and controlled
>"Listen to me, Anon. I'm going into work early. You stay in the apartment and don't look out any of the windows. No answering the door unless it's me."
>you blink
"Shelby, am I--are we in trouble? The officer...?"
>she sighs and shakes her head
>"Maybe. They'll be looking for a canine and her husband for assaulting a state officer. That's not a small charge."
>looking off into the middle distance, Shelby talks to herself
>"They'll case the neighborhood, look for witnesses. If that fails, they'll assign an inspector, check door to door for the whole neighborhood."
>with a furrowed brow, she returns her gaze to you
>"You didn't give her your name or ID, did you?"
"No! No, I--she tried asking me something and I bit her."
>Shelby's cold expression breaks into a smile of satisfaction
>"Good. Show that bitch for putting her hands on you."
>then the smile is gone
>"I have to get going, Anon. We can talk more about what happened when I get home."
>you flinch when she reaches out to you, but that doesn't stop her this time
>Shelby holds you by the shoulders and bores into you with her gaze
>"Promise me you'll do what I ask. Stay inside. Stay quiet. Don't answer the door."
>you tremble
>she looks deadly serious
>you guess you still have to make it work
"I promise."
>Shelby lets you go with a sigh of relief
>then she reaches into a pocket on the front of her uniform
>she draws her paw out and presses something to your hand
>it's the ring
>"If anything does happen, keep that with you no matter what. I'll find you. I promise."
>you close your fingers over the small silver band as Shelby stands and turns away
>a distracted part of you sees she even groomed her tail
>"I'll see you soon, Anon. I..."
>Shelby hesitates by the door, looking back to you
>"Goodbye."
>the door swings open and she's gone again
>you hear it click as Shelby locks it behind her
>sitting alone in silence, you weigh your options
>for the first time in a week days you're alone
>well and truly alone
>you're tired enough to go back to sleep, but now your head buzzes with too much
>the thought of running away again crosses your mind, but you quickly discard the idea
>if you get caught on the streets you have no doubt of the officer's threat of throwing you in a pen
>or worse
>you've committed a major crime against the state
>both you and Shelby have
>you hadn't considered that yet
>Shelby assaulted a state officer
>even worse than what you had done, she could have killed that sow
>what if she did?
>the thought makes you shudder
>you could well have watched her commit a murder
>your breath hitches
>did you see the officer move after Shelby kicked her?
>you don't know
>it happened too fast
>and now your thoughts are running too fast
>what if you're caught?
>you'd be back in the system
>only now with a violent offense on your record
>and Shelby--
>you come up short
>what would they do to her?
>they wouldn't do anything extreme, would they?
>she's a state inspector
>you find yourself taking comfort in that fact
>she outranks that officer
>if she were truly caught it would just be the pig's word against Shelby's
>and yours
>you check your hyperactive train of thought
>panicking is what got you in this situation in the first place
>you shake your head
>maybe everything will turn out okay
>maybe not
>but what can you do about it right now besides panic and think in circles?
>your answer comes with the indignant grumbling of your stomach
>you can make yourself something to eat after skipping a meal for the second night in a row
>easier to freak out one a full stomach anyhow
>you heave yourself up off the couch and head for the kitchen to find something to prepare
>a couple slices of bread to start
>when you go to get butter from the fridge, you notice a small package of bacon as well
>Shelby wouldn't mind if you took just a couple for yourself
>you hope
>before long the sound of sizzling and the scent of the frying cuts of turkey fill the kitchen
>once the food is done, you eat quickly, skipping utensils to scarf down the bread and bacon with your bare hands
>you're feeling much better after having eaten
>once again you make sure to clean and dry whatever dishes you use
>the sun has just started to rise by the time you're done
>the swirling doubt of possible state reprisal is still at the back of your mind, but whenever it pushes your thoughts you just remind yourself there's nothing you can do about it
>for now
>at first you plan on retiring to the couch to try and catch up on sleep
>but now you're awake you can feel the sweat and dirt of yesterday still clinging to your skin
>plus you're still wearing the same pajamas the officer saw you wearing
>a shower doesn't sound like a bad idea
>you go to collect a change of clothes from Shelby's room
>it's a mess
>sheets half thrown off the bed
>discarded clothes strewn on the floor
>it looks like Shelby even threw everything off her nightstand at some point
>it's not your problem, right?
>you don't owe her anything, do you?
>a stray thought answers
>she fought the officer to protect you
>did she?
>if she wanted you back, she could have just claimed you as hers
>but she attacked the officer instead
>did she do it for you?
"Damn it."
>you resolve to do the picking up once you've showered
>once you've gotten a change of clothes from the dresser, you retreat from Shelby's bedroom
>it seems you can't help yourself when it comes to Shelby's shower
>you spend far too long relaxing under the spray of hot water
>your muscles, sore from the excitement and poor sleeping arrangements, untangle themselves under the intense heat of the shower
>you stay in until the shower goes lukewarm, and finish off with a quick scrub from top to bottom
>by the time you're done, you feel like an entirely new human being
>you want to live in that shower
>but all good things come to an end
>you shut off the water, dry yourself with one of the towels, and dress
>same drab grey and black clothes
>they work
>you return to Shelby's room and get to work
>first the scattered objects from the nightstand
>an alarm clock that gently ticks away, a small lamp that hopefully isn't broken, and a framed commendation for service to the state
>then her clothes
>you don't bother to sort the clean from the dirty
>you collect them all and heap them into the laundry basket
>try to ignore the soft lacy panties you pick up
>stupid brain
>and finish off with the bed
>you heave up the bedsheet and comforter in an attempt to splay them both out at once
>you do a reasonable job getting the bed looking presentable
>you even crawl up to the head to arrange the pillows
>her bed really is soft
>you lay out flat on it just to see what it would feel like
>pretty good
>you even take a breath of her pillow and muse that it still smells like Shelby
>you sigh and curl up on your side
>just a few minutes to rest your eyes
>that's what you tell yourself
>but you shortly fall into the most comfortable nap of your life so far
>this time your sleep goes uninterrupted
>you have no dreams, good or bad
>it's probably the best sleep you've gotten in months
>you wake up feeling properly rested after your interrupted sleep in the early morning
>you're so comfortable you let yourself doze in a half-asleep state for even longer
>content to relax and think of nothing at all
>but eventually you start to rouse in spite of your comfort
>yawning, you pick your head up to glance at the alarm clock ticking away on Shelby's bedside table
>you slept another few hours, it's late morning already
>the sun has fully risen outside, streaks of its light peaking through what little of the window that aren't covered by a curtain
>why couldn't Shelby have a bedroom on the west side of the building?
>you sigh and roll over to the edge of the bed
>swinging your legs, you push up to sit, then stand in one motion
>what can you do with the rest of your day?
>you stretch as you consider your options
>could read some of Shelby's books
>or listen to her music
>that's about all you can think of
>you've already done what cleaning you can
>that reminds you
>you turn about and set to work smoothing out the impression you made on the sheets
>the bed is remade
>like you never slept in it
>as you look down at your work, you realize something
>it doesn't look like you slept in it
>but Shelby will easily smell your scent on the sheets
>fuck
>you left your scent all over her room
>that will surely set her off again
>she'll get home, smell you were in her bedroom
>in her bed even
>and then she'll get that hungry look again
>she'll chase you down
>in that uniform
>the thought of that makes you feel sick
>your dream--more of a memory--comes back to you
>what that inspector did
>and what if Shelby does it to you too?
>you have to get out of her room
>with indecent haste you flee into the hallway, slamming the bedroom door shut behind you when you leave
>not that it would make any difference at all you realize as you return to the living room
>taking that nap on her bed, you may as well have thrown yourself at her and demanded to be mauled
>running away won’t work
>you learned that the hard way more than once
>unless
>you sit down on the couch as you recall what Shelby said to you last night
>unless she were satisfied
>maybe facing the inevitable wouldn’t be so bad if you just accepted it
>only what you’re comfortable with, she said
>if you can trust her to control herself
>she stopped herself though
>even when she lost control, it was only until she saw you crying
>then she let you go
>then Shelby was devastated
>her fur streaked with tears as she begged forgiveness
>would she really attack you again?
>whatever she does, you don't want it to be like last night again
>you don't want to see that hunger
>feel that fear
>and shockingly, a part of you doesn't want Shelby hurting again
>you're afraid it's not something you can solve until she returns
>try to talk things out
>without setting off her animal instincts
>checking the wall clock, you see you still have a few hours before Shelby gets home
>so you pick up the old detective book she had lent you and start reading
>at first the time passed slowly, still distracted by memories of last night, and worries of this evening
>but soon enough you settle into the couch and get immersed in the story
>though you try to piece things together, you have no idea where the story is going, or how the detective will figure it all out
>you lose track of time, only setting the book down once to get a drink
>and occasionally you note the sunlight through the window behind you rolling across the room
>when the light is optimally shining down on the page you hear the rattle of keys in the front door's lock
>Shelby's home
>you take a deep breath
>don't panic
>everything is fine, you set down the book beside you
>the door swings open and Shelby steps inside
>everything is not fine
>your breath catches seeing her in uniform
>the fear of it is no longer dulled by half-consciousness
>Shelby turns toward you, her tired expression changing into a soft smile
>her tail swishes
>"Hi Anon! Good to be home."
>you press back into the couch as she pads down the hallway into the living room
>she's not joining you
>not in that wretched uniform
"Go change."
>she stops in her tracks, halfway to the couch, and cocks her head
>"What?"
>you point at her
"Please. The uniform."
>Shelby looks down at herself with a frown
>then takes a step back
>"Whatever makes you comfortable, dear. I'll be right back."
>she turns about and marches down the hallway
>once she's out of sight you let out a sigh of relief
>it was one thing to see her off in the morning
>you don't think you could stand to see her like that all the time
>like when she's working
>that's a thought you want to avoid
>problem for another day
>for now you can focus on surviving the night
>after a few tense minutes, Shelby returns from down the hallway in a simple white blouse and trousers that stop at just her knees
>not quite the view of the nightgown, or even the sundress
>but leagues better than that uniform
"Thank you Shelby. I'm sorry if--"
>Shelby holds up a paw
>"No apologies needed. You don't have to explain it either. Just so long as you're comfortable."
>she approaches the couch again
>"May I join you?"
>in answering, you scoot to one side, setting the book on the arm rest
>Shelby sits down next to you, not quite making body contact
>"There we are. I'm glad to be off my feet. I hope your day was pleasant enough! Caught up on some reading?"
>you shrug and tell her you didn't really get it
>but the book was still interesting
>you pause for a moment
>what should you say?
>you could start with last night
>but that may well hurt her mood for the rest of the evening
>maybe try to explain your aversion to the uniform?
>no, that would be worse
>maybe you could broach the subject of her bedroom
>just a nap, right?
>"What are you thinking about?"
>you snap out of it and look at Shelby
>she giggles
>"You get this scrunched up look on your face when you're thinking. It's adorable."
>adorable
>somehow that gets to you
>but she has managed to shake you from the ever spinning whirlwind of your overwrought mind
>and you think of just the thing to tell her about
"The neighbor. This morning. She came around after you left and brought a..."
>what did she bring?
>you forget the name of it
"...dish. For us. But I think she was just trying to talk to me while you were gone. I think she was eavesdropping. Last night. On the stairwell."
>damn it
>you've come back to it again
>Shelby growls for a split second
>that sets your heart racing
>"Allie. She's just sticking her wooly nose where it doesn't belong. Don't you worry about her Anon."
>she waves her paw as though warding off an annoying insect
>"I'll take care of it."
>her snarl is reeled back to a slight frown
>you almost feel bad for Allie
>whatever wrath you may have unleashed on her is better than it being directed toward you, however
"I don't need any sweaters, Shelby."
>she quirks her ears in questioning
>then giggles again
>"Oh! Oh no, I don't think you'd like her wool anyways. Heh, just the thought of her, all shaved."
>she breaks into a genuine laugh
>you didn't think it was that funny, but her joy is somewhat infectious
>you can't help but smile
>it is kind of funny to think of Allie, sheared to make a sweater
>as long as Shelby doesn't actually hurt her, maybe that wouldn't be too bad
"You won't actually hurt her, right?"
>reigning in her laughter, Shelby sighs
>"No, no. I'll just have a talk with her. Won't even bring my badge. I promise."
>well, you hope she can keep that promise
>Shelby continues to snicker
>her tail thumps against the back of the couch
>you sigh and look down toward the floor in front of you
>you're kind of enjoying yourself now, but last night still hangs over your head
>and the worry of your scent in Shelby's bed
>you hope to get lucky, and avoid talking about at least the latter
>but you know better than to trust your luck
>you'll have to broach it on your own terms
>the thumping slows
>"You have your thinking face on again, Anon."
>Shelby leans forward so she's peering into your peripheral vision
>you glance over to look at her
>"Are you...thinking about last night?"
>like she can read your mind
>nodding your head, you look down again
"Yeah. Last night. And today. And tomorrow. The next day after that."
>Shelby sits up straight, folding her hands on her lap
>you two sit in silence
>if you keep up like this, you'll spend the whole night dealing with your paranoid visions of all the awful things that might happen
>so you need to do something
>you stand from the couch
"I think I'll make us something to eat, and we can try and talk about things on a full stomach."
>Shelby gives you a relieved smile and lets out a sigh
>"That's a good idea. You always have the right idea, Anon."
>you don't know about that
>running wasn't a very good idea, but you kept trying
>even when you were on your own
>you go over to the kitchen and pull out the dish that Allie brought over
>when you swing the refrigerator door shut, you turn about to see Shelby's followed you into the kitchen
>"Don't mind me. I just like to watch you when you work."
>swish-swish her tail goes
>you hold out the dish to show it to her
"You won't have much to watch. I was just going to heat this up. Whatever it is."
>Shelby peers through the glass top of the backing dish and cocks her head
>"Oh! I know what that is! It's a..."
>her brow furrows and she cocks her head
>"Oh, I should know this. We had one for Shiloh's birthday brunch last year. Damn it."
>Shiloh?
>you have a good guess at who it is, but focus on at least getting the food started
>or else you may never get the chance
> you set down the dish with no name on the stovetop and flick on the oven
>you have a couple minutes now
"Shiloh huh? That's one of your sisters I guess?"
>Shelby nods
>"Yep! My older sister, and Shannon is the oldest. They're a little older than in that picture you saw, obviously."
>Shelby giggles and smiles a little wider
>you see no reason not to indulge her, and you're curious how things are for her family
"So you still see your siblings huh? Must be nice!"
>with bobbing head and wagging tail, Shelby hums in the affirmative
>"Mhm! We don't see each other as often as we used to after Shannon moved to one of the agricultural counties, but we still meet for birthdays and special occasions!"
>Shelby looks like she's gonna keep going, but the oven pings behind you
>and when you turn around to slide the dish into the oven, you can feel her stepping closer to keep an eye on you
"I'm not going to burn myself, Shelby. It only happened once."
>"I know! Just being careful dear."
>guess she's not going stop with that
>trying to protect you
>or calling you dear
>you're not going to fight her on either of those
>there are worse things she could do and say
>you slam the oven shut and lean against the counter nearby
>"And you know..."
>Shelby looks almost nervous
>she fiddles with her paws and avoids looking you in the eye
>"You can meet them when you're ready if you want. I'm sure they'd love to see you!"
>holding her paws together, Shelby leans forward in unspoken questioning
>would you be willing to meet her family?
>you've never been out of the city, let alone all the way in the agricultural counties
"I'd be okay with that. Eventually."
>Shelby sighs and lets her hands drop
>not the answer she was hoping for, clearly, but she rallies valiantly
>"That's okay! Only when you're comfortable with it. I haven't even gotten a chance to tell them about you anyways. I have to call Shiloh soon..."
>that seems to be the final word Shelby has on the matter of her sisters for now
>you can't help but note that she still hasn't said anything about her parents
>you won't force that conversation though
>only fair, since you've yet to tell her a thing about your family
>it occurs to you how much you're still keeping from her
>you can throw it on the long list of things you'll eventually have to deal with
>front of that list, however, is dinner
>you return your focus to the oven, opening it to check on the unnamed pastry
>it's not burnt to a blackened state, an excellent sign
>you grab a dish towel off the counter and use it to carefully pull the baking dish out of the oven
>all under Shelby's careful supervision as she's padded closer behind you to watch over your shoulder
>once it's on the stovetop again, she finally steps back again
>"Smells good! I'm surprised Allie made it. I half expected it to be store-bought."
>Shelby gathers plates and cutlery, getting you and herself each a generous slice of the pastry
>it smells savory, with bits of meat and vegetable in the egg filling
>Shelby seems to especially relish it once she's sat down and digs in
>you join her and start eating as well
>to your surprise, you find yourself enjoying the pastry
>"Hmph."
>Shelby crosses her arms suddenly when she's half finished
>"I wasn't expecting Allie's cooking to be good."
>she laughs and picks at the food a little slower now
>you take another bite and chew slowly to organize your thoughts
>how are you going to open up?
>what's the best way to broach the subject of last night, and what you two will do after everything that's happened?
>no time like now, you suppose
>no better way than the direct way
>you swallow, the food suddenly sticking in your throat
"Okay."
>you set down your fork
"What are we going to do?"
>Shelby stops, the last bite of her dinner perched on the fork halfway between plate and mouth
>she slowly lowers it back down
>"About us. About what I need from you."
>you nod slowly
"I thought about it today. I'm still afraid, but if I don't do something..."
>Shelby finishes your trailing thought
>"If you don't do something, I'll attack you again."
>she clenches her paw into a fist on the table and grimaces
>"I didn't want it to be like this. You're not supposed to submit to me because you're afraid. It's supposed to be an act of love."
>she trembles and huffs
>you don't want her to lose control of herself again
>and you don't want to see her crying either
>you lean forward over the table and put your hand over her balled up paw
"It's not what you wanted. I know how that feels, Shelby."
>she stops trembling and lets out a long sigh
>her paw unfolds to hold your hand
>"I just--I'm being selfish again. I expected everything to be perfect. Like I could make everything better with gifts and hugs."
>Shelby groans
>"I'm sorry Anon. I can't ever say it enough."
>she certainly says it often
>even now, when she's not done anything yet
"Well, you don't have to stop with the gifts. Those candies were delicious."
>you laugh and give her an encouraging smile
"I wouldn't hate more of your hugs too."
>Shelby sniffs and finally smiles again
>"All you have to do is ask. You know how much I love holding you."
>maybe tonight won't be so bad after all
>but it can't all be heart to heart
"So. What are we going to do then?"
>Shelby's expression becomes more serious
>"I thought about it today too. If you're okay with it, I'd like for you to sleep with me tonight."
>you digest her offer quietly
>it was the course of action you expected her to put up
>you'd already done it once, on the first night together
>and you know where it will eventually lead
>but what other choice do you have?
>if you go with Shelby now, she'll surely have more control than if you deny her
"Okay. I can stay with you tonight."
>Shelby perks up fully
>she beams at you, eyes wide in excitement
>"You mean it?"
>you nod
>and hope you won't regret it
>"Thank you Anon! For trying for me."
>Shelby squeezes your hand and wags her tail
>her green eyes shining
>even her fur seems to puff up, raising with her spirits
>she's beautiful when she's like this
>the thought is intrusive, but you know it to be true
>you don’t know if you could ever be truly happy, like she seems to be
>but you think if she stayed like this, you might find your way to being okay
>when you’re both done eating, Shelby waves you off from taking her plate
>”I’ll do the dishes. You go in the living room and relax, okay?”
>you shrug and let her get to work
>even after her day at work, it seems food has revitalized her
>and your answer has certainly lifted her mood
>she practically bounces with each step as she collects the dishes
>you find yourself staying in the kitchen, simply to watch as she works
>her tail goes at its usual pace
>you suppose you can understand why Shelby might like watching you while you cooked
>and you don’t miss when she glances back at you, and her tail swishes a little faster
>she ushers you toward the living room when she finishes her work
>”No more staring at my legs. Go on.”
>you go at her urging, and take your usual spot on the couch
>Shelby doesn’t join you right away, instead going over to the side of the furniture to grab her CD player
>this time when she turns it on, she leaves it at a more reasonable volume
>the expected sound of fast-paced anthro-punk emanates from the small machine as Shelby joins you on the couch with a deep sigh
>close, but not touching, again
>”Ah! That’s better…”
>she stretches and yawns
>her arms go over the back of the couch, not quite holding you but threatening to
>she clears her throat and looks down at you
>”Would you mind if I held you now?”
>how did you know she was going to ask something like that?
>she may be in a chipper mood, but you remember how things started last night
"Are you going to be okay? Under control?"
>Shelby retracts her arm from behind you
>"Oh. Yes. I guess maybe that can wait for later. Why don't you do some reading? I'll just try to relax.”
>you didn't mean to hurt her feelings, but you still want to be careful as you can
>make sure she’s mindful of herself
“It’s okay Shelby. Just old fear. You can hold me.”
>with a huff of satisfaction, Shelby drops her arm around your shoulders and relaxes fully
>and taking her advice, you grab the novel from the armrest where you set it down and flip it open
>Shelby hums quietly to the music as you continue the story where you left off
>you’ve just about finished the story
>maybe you shouldn’t have spent the whole day reading it, you’ve rushed through to the end
>it’s a little confusing that all the conspirators suddenly agree to turn themselves in to the proper authorities in the end, but it was satisfying to see the detective reveal all the details of the mystery
>while you’re reading, Shelby hums along quietly to the music
>her leg bounces to the beat of the song as well
>a small distraction, but you don’t mind
>it’s funny to think of a state officer listening to rebellious music like this
>though the way she acted around the officers that had abused you, maybe she’s a rebel in some ways
>you fold up the book and set it aside once more now that you're finished with it
>"So what did you think of it?"
>Shelby leans in a bit closer so your bodies are not quite pressed together
>you force yourself to take a deep breath and keep under control
"I enjoyed it. I don't know if I'm smart enough to really get these detective stories, but it was interesting! Better than re-reading that old music theory book again."
>Shelby nods and leans in closer, but only long enough she can pick up the book and pass it to her free hand
>"I remember being so excited the day we got this. I had torn through all the detective novels my dad would bring home from the library. This was something special."
>Shelby grows quiet, staring down at the red cover of the book
>even if you're not a detective like the one in the novel, it's pretty obvious Shelby's upset
>maybe about her father?
"Shelby, did something happen to your dad?"
>she jolts, dropping the book in her lap
>you're startled by the reaction, and you almost jump off the couch fear of inciting her again
>Shelby doesn't stop you as you lean forward and away from her, however
>she simply sighs
>"Sorry. It's okay Anon, I was just lost in thought. If you don't mind, I'd rather not talk about my parents right now. I'm tired."
>you could hardly force her to speak when she's let you get away from answering so many questions of hers
"Of course, Shelby. I'm sorry for prying."
>she shakes her head and picks the book up to set it back down on her armrest
>"No need to apologize, Anon. I think I'm going to go shower and get ready for bed."
>her arm returns to her side and Shelby stands up from the couch
>"I hope you'll join me."
>Shelby offers you a smile that's pretty forced then turns to pad down the hallway
>you watch her go and then sit back on the couch
>what happened to her father?
>her parents?
>she hasn't even mentioned her mother
>the anthro woman in Shelby's family photo looked happy
>both parents did
>but who knows what that border collie might have done
>you hear the shower start up down the hallway, and reluctantly you stand to shut off the CD player and make your own way toward the bedroom
>where you'll be sleeping tonight
>with Shelby
>you're surprised she didn't bring up your being in there
>maybe there just wasn't an opportunity for it
>you weren't going to bring it up if you could help it
>you stop hesitating on the threshold, and push open the ajar door
>the room is just as clean as you left it, you don't have to step over any discarded clothes as you move to the dresser to collect out one of the few indulgences you ever afforded while living on your own
>wool flannel pajamas
>your nice set, the kind you only wore ever so often so to make them last that little bit longer
>you change quickly, and tuck your clothes in the hamper in Shelby's closet
>your eyes skitter off the rumpled grey uniform hanging in the middle of that closet, and you quickly shut it
"Alright. Ready for bed."
>you tell yourself that, but your heart thumps like a bass drum in your chest
>are you ready?
>it will be fine, won't it?
>you've slept in her bed before
>you've even slept in her bed with her!
>but it feels different now, somehow
>you're sleeping with her, possibly for the foreseeable future
>you don't have much time for contemplation, however, as you hear the shower in the other room turn off
>and Shelby, humming the tune of one of her rock songs
>the door swings open and she sashays inside
>she's in one of her nightgowns, this one light blue, halting well above her knees
>Shelby glows, grinning brightly when she sees you
>it seems the shower did her well
>"Oh! I haven't seen those pajamas before Anon! They look comfy!"
>she trots across the room and drops down on the bed
>"Mmh. I've been looking forward to this all day."
>laying out on the bed, Shelby stretches out, arching her back and raising her arms above her head
>"Mmmph!"
>you stare at the display, mouth falling open slightly as she kicks one leg up in the air to stretch it as well
>that has to be on purpose
>she finally falls limp with a satisfied grunt and smiles up at you
>"Don't think I didn't notice you cleaned up in here too. I appreciate it, Anon. I'll have to bring you something nice as a thank you tomorrow."
>you're still to busy processing her little show to respond at first
"Uh..."
>eventually you manage to regain brain function
"I mean, that's okay Shelby. I was just being nice."
>her tail wags, halfway off the bed as it is
>with a giggle, Shelby sits back up
>definitely on purpose
>"I think I'll get you something anyways! Now, are you ready for bed?"
>her demeanor changes, more serious
>"Are you still okay to join me tonight?"
>you steady yourself with a nod
"I'm okay."
>she instantly brightens again
>"Great! I thought of something we could try to make you feel more comfortable spending the night with me. We don't have to do it, or even get close, but it would mean a lot to me if you tried."
>how can you refuse?
>one certain part of you wants to get very close with her
>the traitor
"I'll give it a try, Shelby."
>"Ah! Yes! Thank you Anon! It's going to be perfect. Here!"
>you don't think you've seen her this excited since you first met, when you let her carry you into the apartment
>she hops off the bed and stands next to you
>her paw goes on your shoulder to hold you in place while she kisses your cheek
>"Thank you!"
>she then turns about, leaning forward to sweep the covers open for you
>and giving you a glimpse under her night gown
>her panties match, the same soft blue
>"Okay, you lay down here, on your side facing in."
>this time, you manage to recover quicker
>Shelby steps aside, and you do as she says, laying down on your side
>she throws the sheets over you
>while you adjust them, getting more comfortable, she goes around the other side, and climbs under the covers
>facing away from you, she pushes back until finally she's pressed fully against you
>it's a little awkward getting her tail out of the way, but she manages to tuck it between your two legs
>"Here, now we just..."
>she reaches around behind her to take your wrist and drape it over her waist
>it's not what you expected of her, with how much she loves to hold you
>but you can't deny that being this close to her is appealing
>her warmth
>her smell
>even just the feel of her fur tickling your face
>"Think you'll be okay, Anon? If you ever feel uncomfortable, you can move away from me without any trouble. Even go back to the couch if you need to."
>you don't know about that
>if she'd let you leave in the middle of the night without her expecting it
>maybe even if you'd want to
>if all you do tonight is sleep, you think you'll be glad to do it like this
"I'll be okay. This is nice, Shelby, thank you."
>you feel Shelby's tail try to wag from it's spot trapped between the two of you
>"Thank you, Anon. Could you get the light?"
>you take your arm off Shelby a moment to switch off the bedside lamp
"There you go. Goodnight Shelby."
>"Goodnight Anon. I love you."
>it doesn't take long for Shelby to fall asleep
>the wag of her tail goes still and her breathing evens out
>you take a little longer, trying to focus purely on your breathing to fight your thoughts
>but this time, they aren't your usual paranoia guided musings of all the terrible things that will surely happen to you
>no
>right now you're trying to fight the thought of being pressed up against your wife
>who for all your fear and mistrust, is still a beautiful collie
>with very nice legs that only the layer of your flannel pajamas keep you from feeling for yourself
>what would be the harm if you let your hand wander just a bit?
>the harm would be a repeat of what happened last night, obviously
>but the temptation is still there
>just once
>one touch and that will be enough
>you lift your arm slowly
>then you freeze
>waiting for a reaction from Shelby
>but her breathing remains even
>not even a twitch
>emboldened by her lack of reaction, you move your hand down at a snail's pace beneath the covers
>you can't stop the slight tremble in your arm as you barely trace your fingers over the bare fur of her thigh
>it's soft
>smooth
>like the rest of her
>but somehow it holds your attention even more
>just once isn't enough
>you run as light a touch as you can down her thigh, and then back up again, relishing in the sensation
>maybe if you just...
>you let your hand settle on her thigh
>with trembling breath you work to memorize the feeling of it
>she's always so warm
>Shelby sighs and shifts
>you snatch your hand back
>and bite down on the gasp of fear
>your heart is hammering in your chest
>she settles again, falling still with a sigh
>you still hold your hand back from her
>until you finally get your heart to settle down and your breathing to slow down again
>you return to your original position, arm around her waist
>shut your eyes and focus on breathing
>idiot
>eventually you manage to get yourself under control
>you have to pull back from Shelby just a bit to do so
>you keep your eyes shut, and breathing measured
>so long as Shelby stayed asleep during your indiscretion, you have nothing to worry about
>but there is something you worry about
>the temptation to do it again will come
>and there's no guarantee Shelby will be sound asleep when it does
>and yet
>even if she was awake now, the sensation of bare fur and warm skin lingers in your mind
>the curve of her thigh under exploring fingers
>it may be worth it
>that thought carries you from worry for the future to sweet sleep surrounded by the memory of those sensations
>your sleep is long and quiet
>no dreams at all, for all the night through
>it's peaceful
>until you're startled awake
>"Damn it!"
>your eyes snap open at the sound of Shelby growling
>she's already out of bed, but you throw off the covers and try to roll out of bed away from her
>instead you just get tangled up and wind up standing on one foot as you blearily try to figure out what's going on
>Shelby's stood in front of her closet, busily picking through it before she notices your sudden waking and turns to face you
>her fur is even messier than it was when she went to bed
>how you like it best, you find
>"Oh! Anon, I'm sorry--I didn't set the alarm last night and--"
>she turns back to the closet to start pulling out clothes
>her uniform
>the distaste for it is more than enough to make your avert your eyes from her
>"I'm late. I'm going to be late and I just--"
>she growls in frustration again
>"I haven't even brushed!"
>you hear the rustling of more clothes and then movement as Shelby steps closer
>but you keep your eyes down
>"Anon! Could you help me with this?"
>Shelby's fuzzy paw enters your vision, and you see she's holding out a brush to you
>thankfully when you look up to her, she's left the uniform behind
>"Please? You can go right back to bed once I'm ready."
>first you have to untangle yourself from the sheets to stand straight
> then you take the brush from her, and she turns about
>"Thank you Anon. Just my head and tail should be enough."
>you bring the brush up to the shaggy fur on her head and start to work at straightening out the mop that it's become
>it seems whenever you manage to get one part tamed, another springs up
>you do your best not to enjoy the sensation of her fur under your fingers again
>Shelby's angry
>no time for enjoying yourself
>but it seems there's time for Shelby to enjoy herself
>wherever you stroke her fur with a bare hand she leans into it just a little more
>"Thank you pup..."
>she sighs as you get the last of the fur on her head under control
>you try to ignore that comment as you get to work on her tail next
>but "pup"?
>last time she called you that...
>you shake your head and focus on your work
>you're not going to fend her off with an old fur brush
>the tail is a little easier to manage
>though it trembles with the urge to wag at your touch, you can tell
>when you finish and step back, Shelby lets out a quiet whine
>but she turns about to accept the brush from you and smiles sympathetically
>"Sorry to wake you up and get you right to work. I'll make it up to you, I promise."
>she trots back to the closet with a much brighter mood
>and picks up that uniform again
"I'm going to use the bathroom..."
>excuse made, you don't wait for a response before making your escape
>when you've finished in the bathroom, Shelby's waiting outside the door, in full uniform
>you freeze
>”I want to give you a hug goodbye, okay?”
>at least she gave you a warning before she gathers you up in a hug that you desperately wish to squirm out of
>the scratchy gray fabric is a far cry from the silken luxury that is her fur
>but you’re still frozen
>"Thank you so much Anon. You've been so good to me, I can't believe it. I have to get going so I’m not late."
>you shut your eyes and tell yourself that Shelby is more than the uniform
>isn't she?
>please just let you go already
>finally she releases you
>and you avert your eyes from her once again
>"Hey."
>her paw goes on your cheek like yesterday morning
>but this time you have room to pull away
>Shelby whines again
>"I understand, Anon. You'll get used to my uniform at your own pace."
>she still sounds disappointed
>"This uniform lets me help a lot of people, Anon. Maybe someday I can show you."
>you wait, standing half out of the doorway
>"I'll see you tonight, Anon. I still owe you something for all you did for me, last night and this morning.”
>since you're not looking at her, you don't see it coming when she leans in and kisses your cheek
>"Love you."
>then she steps away, and you hear the front door open
>she's gone, and it feels like you can breath again
>you have the apartment to yourself
>Shelby won't be home for hours
>the novelty of it is quickly starting to wear off as you prepare breakfast for yourself
>just reheated leftovers from last night
>maybe you should start making breakfast before Shelby leaves?
>she might appreciate that
>tucking that thought away for later, you focus on your food
>but you eat with no real relish
>now that it's just you eating the unnamed pastry, you're reminded of your old days alone
>before Shelby
>in that little tenement on the south side of the city
>it was shabby, half the time the heating didn't even work and the appliances were old enough to come from Before
>but at least you had your freedom
>you stick on that idea a moment
>was it really freedom?
>you were living off a state stipend
>only left on occasion to buy whatever food was convenient
>still in fear of the looming threat of the state, and any anthro that looked in your direction
>maybe you weren't so free back then
>but you were left alone, which is almost as good
>of course, if you wanted that still, you could have taken Shelby up on her offer to leave you be
>but you know that wouldn't work, for a multitude of reasons
>and a small, creeping doubt that refuses to coalesce swirls around the question of being on your own once again
>and for all your efforts to try and find the source of unease, you fail
>you need to distract yourself
>with a quiet breakfast done, you deposit your dishes in the sink to wash them
>that comes and goes quickly
>you look out into the living room
>Shelby's stack of books are still there
>along with your photo
>but neither of them really appeal to you at the moment
>reading another mystery novel would make you feel dumb
>and the photo...
>Shelby isn't here to ask questions about your past, so it's best just to let it lie for now
>you start to pace about the apartment
>you had a good few years to get used to doing nothing while on your own
>but now it feels wrong
>there was so much going on, so much excitement
>good or bad
>it feels like you ought to be doing something, but you don't have anything to do
>the novelty of having nothing to do again is gone in just two days of Shelby being at work
>you almost wish Allie would knock on the door again
>but no knock comes
>you resign yourself to another quiet day
>and more tidying up
>maybe you could ask Shelby to get you something else for you to read?
>the day passes slowly, from sun up to midday, to evening
>you did your best to busy yourself with picking up another one of Shelby's novels
>this one is set After, it follows a bloodhound detective trying to find a missing human boy
>it's a lot different than the book from Before, but enough to pass the time until you hear the sound of the front door unlocking
>you set the book down and jump up from the couch
>trotting over to the door, you realize that you had actually missed Shelby
>wait
>you freeze mid-stride
>she's going to be in her uniform
>should have waited before approaching the door
>too late
>it swings open, and Shelby steps inside
>she still has her uniform on, as well as a small wrapped package under her arm
>and as always, she has a smile and a wagging tail when she looks at you
>"Hello dear."
>she steps inside and gives you a peck on the cheek
>"If you could take this to the kitchen, I'll go get changed for you, okay?"
>you take the package from her when she proffers it, and then she's gone
>off to the bedroom to change
>for your sake
>you regain the ability to move once she's out of sight, and return to the kitchen with your charge in hand
>it's small, and rather light
>and written on the paper in perfect handwriting is 'Anon'
>she even signed it with a heart
>you turn it over in your hands, testing the weight and heft of the package
>if you had to guess, it was some kind of clothing
>but it's too small to be a shirt or pants
>you flip it over again
>"Are you going to open it?"
>you jump and spin about, dropping the package as you find Shelby has materialized behind you, already changed into a long skirt and a black and white turtleneck that matchers her fur
>she laughs and leans down to pick it up for you
>"Sorry Anon, you looked cute trying to figure out what it was. I couldn't help myself."
>she hands it over again
>"Go ahead. No waiting on my account!"
>at her directing, you undo the string holding the bundle together
>when it finally comes apart, you find a neatly folded scarf
>bright red
>it's soft to the touch, and thick enough to block out the cold of winter
>and on each end, you find black paw print emblems
>"So? What do you think?"
>this may be the nicest piece of clothing you've ever owned
>has to be the most expensive
"How much was it?"
>Shelby shakes her head
>"The price doesn't matter. What matters is if you like it or not."
>the scarf unfolds in your hands as you wrap it around your neck experimentally
"It's great, Shelby. Too much. Thank you."
>Shelby lets out a soft sigh, and her tail wags
>you get the feeling she might have been nervous you didn't like it
>but how couldn't you?
>it's really too nice, better than you deserve
>you owe her now
>so in repayment, you step onto your tiptoes to kiss Shelby's cheek
"I love it."
>maybe that was a mistake
>Shelby huffs softly, and her tail wags even harder
>she bites her lip
>"Do you want to test it out? I thought maybe if you were tired of being cooped up all day, we could go out for a walk."
>go outside
>you hadn't considered the option, being a lone human out and about attracts the wrong kind of attention
>but with Shelby there it might be different
"Why not? I'll go get my coat."
>Shelby grins wide
>"A proper date! It'll be perfect."
>she steps aside to let you down the hallway
>a date
>not how you expected your night to go
>you were planning on another night in
>but if it makes Shelby happy
>and keeps you out in public where she's not likely to pin you down because you held her hand too long
>you pull your jacket out of its home in the dresser
>then you realize you haven't actually changed out of your pajamas
>you haven't even showered
>oh well
>you'll be wearing layers outside, it won't be a problem
>after a quick change into more appropriate clothes, you're ready to go
>and as an afterthought, you take the ring off the top of the dresser and slip it into your jacket pocket
>if you end up separated from Shelby again it could save you
>you return to the hallway, where Shelby waits in high spirits
>"Look at you! Bundled up, my snow-pup."
>she coos as she adjusts the scarf around your neck
>there's that word again
>pup
"Why do you call me that?"
>Shelby's ears perk as she gives you a questioning look
>"What? Pup? It's just a pet name is all. Like calling your wife 'baby', you know?"
>she beams at you
>"And I call you pup because you're so cute! But if you don't like it, I'll just call you Anon."
>you're not so sure about it
>it's what she called you when she assaulted you, a reminder of that night
>but the way she smiles when she says it...
"No, no. I'm just not used to it, I guess. The only nickname I had growing up was doorstop."
>"Wh--"
>Shelby tries and fails to contain a snicker
>she snorts
>that gets you laughing along with her
>but she manages to get herself under control to ask her question
>"Where'd you get that name?"
>you shrug
"My cot was right next to the sleeping room door, so every morning Ms. Kerr would swing it open and it'd smack the head of my bed. I was the doorstop."
>you laugh a little more, thinking back on it
>how it annoyed you so much
"Leigh wanted to trade spots with me, but Ms. Kerr wouldn't hear it."
>Shelby frowns, her ears drooping
>"I'm sorry Anon."
>you wave off her apology
"Don't worry about it Shelby. I guess my point is I don't mind the pet names. As long as you don't call me doorstop."
>the earns a soft laugh from Shelby, and she's smiling again
>"I promise, no mean nicknames. You wouldn't believe what my sisters used to call me growing up."
>maybe you won't believe it, but you'd certainly like to hear
>but you get the feeling Shelby would gladly stand here all night if she could spend it talking with you
>so you grab the doorknob and swing it open
"You'll have to tell me some of those names while we're on our walk."
>"Oh! Hang on just a second!"
>Shelby runs off down the hallway and disappears into the bedroom once again
>and a minute later she comes out with a folded up blanket
>"Here we go, almost forgot it."
>a blanket?
>what's that for?
>whatever Shelby has envisioned for this date, you don't plan on sleeping outside if you can help it
>she must have caught the look you gave the blanket because she holds it up with a grin
>"There's a park a couple blocks down! If we pick up dinner we could sit out and have a picnic."
>a picnic
>you've never had one, but you're pretty sure they don't happen in winter
"Will we be okay? It was kind of cold out last time."
>with a nod, Shelby steps around you and out the door
>"It's not too bad this evening, breezy but warm in the sun!"
>you take her word and let her lead the way down the steps to the front door
>"And if you get cold, I could always hold you to keep you warm."
>you can hear the playful grin in Shelby's comment even if you can't see it on her muzzle
>Shelby holds the door for you
>when you step outside the apartment building, a blast of wind nearly knocks you back inside
>Shelby's paw lands on your shoulder to steady you
>"Easy! You okay there Anon?"
>you regain your balance quickly and step out onto the sidewalk
"I'm okay. Just the wind."
>thankfully your jacket and scarf do their jobs, keeping the worst of the chill out
>you stuff your hands in your pockets and burrow your face into the scarf
>soft and warm
>Shelby stands by you, and slips her arm into yours so you're walking arm in arm
>"Want to hold on to me, just in case?"
>you're fine
>but maybe you could steal a little warmth from her if she stays close
>that fur of hers must work wonders
>Shelby hardly seems to mind the chill
>in answer, you step in a little closer and slip a hand out of your pocket to intertwine your fingers with hers
>you think Shelby's tail is kicking up a storm on its own it's wagging so fast
>"Mmh. There we are! Let's get going."
>Shelby sets off, pulling you along slightly as she keeps a brisk pace
>she was right, once you stepped out of the shadow of your apartment building and into the light of the evening sun, it’s considerably warmer than you expected
>the sun hangs low in the sky, but not quite setting just yet
>should be a couple hours before it's dark
“Alright Shelby, you promised me embarrassing nicknames.”
>she groans and rolls her head to give you a look
>you maintain eye contact
>Shelby relents with another groan of defeat
>”Fine, fine. I told you I was the runt of the litter growing up, so I got all the names. Shorty, shrimp, half-pint, chihuahua. Shiloh called me a yard collie because I was too small to be a border collie. She thought she was very clever that.”
“Pfft!”
>you bust into laughter
>it's not terribly clever, but it's just silly enough to tickle your funny bone
>"Hmph!"
>Shelby scoffs
>she sounds upset at first, and you quickly stop laughing
>but then she gives a small laugh as well
>you're okay
>she's not really mad, you hope
"Sorry Shelby."
>this time she waves off your apology with a squeeze of your hand
>"No need to apologize. Just as long as you don't use that name around my sisters."
>you nod your head
>fair is fair
>no 'doorstop', no 'yard collie'
"Promise."
>Shelby squeezes your hand again and you continue on a while in silence
>there are a few other people out
>anthros of various types, who seem to ignore you since you're with another anthro already
>even a public safety officer who looks past you like you aren't even there
>you stare at the sow as she walks by, but she only regards Shelby with a passing glance
>and then the officer disappears around a corner
>"Something the matter?"
>you stop craning your neck to look behind you and snap your gaze forward
"Just the officer. I was..."
>even if you're used to Shelby, other anthros still put you off
>"Hey."
>Shelby has to catch your attention again, stopping so you can look up to her, and she can look down to you
>"I won't let anything happen to you. Remember in the assignment office? I won't let anyone lay so much as a paw on you."
>you do remember the assignment office
>and how she snapped at Alice
>how quickly she lost her temper when she was trying to defend you
>you hope she doesn't have to do anything like that today
>so you just nod and take a step forward to urge Shelby on
>"So..."
>her voice takes on a slightly saccharine tone
>trying to sound happier than she is as she changes the subject
>"There's a restaurant here that I think you might enjoy! Some hot food for a chilly picnic!"
>she takes the lead once more, until you reach the place
>a low brick building, part of a line of business fronts, half of them empty
>one is labeled "Restaurant"
>Shelby takes you inside, where a small crowd waits in line to give orders and receive food
>it seems pretty standard stuff
>fish, poultry, vegetables
>being served fried, grilled, or baked on a bun
>Shelby orders for you when you finally reach the front
>a fish sandwich and a soda water
>Shelby got the chicken, along with a serving of steamed vegetables
>"All to share."
>she assures you as she takes the paper bag full of food and tucks the picnic blanket under the same arm
>you can see why Shelby chose to eat out so often, way easier than burning salmon to a char
>or relying on weird dishes from your neighbor
>you brace yourself against Shelby as you step out onto the street again, and she holds you hand tight to make sure you stay upright this time
>"And the park is right there! We can get up on the hill on the sunny side."
>she points with a bag-filled hand toward a line of tree a ways down the block and across the street
>and at her pace you make it there in no time
>there are even more anthros out at the park, enjoying the unseasonable warmth
>you shy away from the rowdy pack of wolves that are playing some kind of ball game near the entrance
>Shelby leads you past them, and into the park proper
>the trees rustle and rattle in the breeze, devoid of leaves save the few pines on the edge of the open space
>it hasn't snowed lately, and in this warmth there's a bit of a thaw
>you can smell a little earth and snowmelt
>taking a deep breath, you saver the sensation
>it's been a long time since you've been in a place like this
>not since a couple field trips when you were young in the home
>the little green from the damp, matted grass is enough
>Shelby tugs your hand a little as you've stopped
>"Everything okay?"
>you nod
>and this time you mean it
"I like it here. I want to see it all in green. In the spring."
>Shelby cocks her head, smiling lopsidedly
>"Why don't we get up on the sunny side and we can relax, okay?"
>you go with her
>up over the hill where she finally lets go of your hand
>it feels a little cold without her warmth, but she hands you the blanket from under her other arm
>"Would you spread that out for us, Anon?"
>Shelby works on arranging the food after you've taken care of the blanket
>and once you're both finished, you find yourself sat down on it, leaning into Shelby as she passes you food
>her tail wags, a little twitch every time her paw touches your hand while passing you something
>you even split your sandwich in half, trading Shelby for half of hers
"Leigh and I used to trade food like this, so we'd get all the options in the cafeteria. It was like getting an extra meal."
>you stare off, reminiscing about your time in the home
>"You and Leigh were close huh?"
>shouldn't have brought him up
>you let the green, and good food get to you
>are you going to upset her if you tell her about Leigh?
>will it upset her if you don't?
"Leigh and I were brothers."
>Shelby's lazily wagging tail goes still
>"Brothers?"
>it's true enough
>all the boys in the home were family, in a way
>Leigh was your best friend in there
>you got in at the same time, grew up together
>looked after each other
>at least until he was gone
"Not by blood. But we were brothers."
>your response hangs in the air for a few seconds
>you bite down on your half of a chicken sandwich
>chewing slowly keeps you from saying anything else that may cause you trouble
>"I see."
>Shelby nods her understanding and finishes off her own sandwich with a snap of her jaws
>"I always wanted a brother growing up, just so I wouldn't be the runt anymore."
>she laughs and her tail starts wagging again
>"And I'd go to my dad and ask for a baby brother, and he'd pat my head and say..."
>Shelby puffs up her chest and affects a deeper voice
>"I have three little angels already."
>returning to her normal voice, she goes on
>"And then I'd go and ask my mom, and she'd say, you little hellions are enough trouble already!"
>you grin at the story
>and cock your head in questioning
"You were a hellion? Did this have to do with your punk music?"
>the collie's tail wags harder, and she goes on laughing
>"No! No, we were all wild. We were pups. We'd wrestle and we'd chase each other around the house and through the yard. We'd roll in the mud and jump through piles of leaves and track it all in on the carpets."
>Shelby stares off at the sky that's burgeoning orange as the sun dips down to touch the horizon
>"But to dad, we were always his angels."
>her tone softens
>and if you were to guess, saddens
>now isn't the time to ask
"You know, me and Leigh would get into trouble too."
>it's your turn to reminisce, as you dredge up memories of afternoons in the concrete yard making up plans to enact petty revenge on Kovacs or anger Ms. Kerr
"Things were strict in the home, but we'd find ways to get back at Ms. Kerr."
>you start to call up a specific instance that you were particularly proud of
"We must've been twelve? No, I was twelve, he was thirteen, cause his birthday was in spring and they just opened up the yard again."
>pausing to reorder your thoughts, you take a sip of your drink
>and then you set it down
>soda water does not taste like normal water
>clearing your throat, you continue
>and try your best not to cough
"Ack-hem. So every--every time the yard opened up again, Kerr would complain about all the dirt we'd track in. So I got this idea, if she hates dirt so much we could give her some dirt."
>you've cleared your throat, and now you're on a roll
"One day at the end of yard time, me and Leigh snuck a bucket full of dirt inside from the yard. We hid it under my bed, then at lights out we brought it to her office."
>you start to grin at the memory of you two working together
>how you'd watch down the hall while Leigh jimmied the lock
"Then we took all that dirt and spread it out on top of the blades of her ceiling fan. I hand to stand up on a chair to give Leigh a leg up. I can't believe we didn't fall and break something."
>you start to snicker, getting to the payoff of the story
"The next morning, she went into her office and flicked on her fan, and then whoosh! Dirt all over her and the office. You should have seen her, barging into the bunk room shouting and trying to shake dirt out of her fur."
>Shelby starts to laugh too, a soft giggle that makes you smile more
>for some reason
>you want her to like the story
"Well, she wasn't happy. She made all the boys scrub her office clean, and then revoked shower privilege's for the rest of the month."
>you mimic the old badgers shrill voice
"Since you shits love dirt so much, you'll have to get used to it!"
>for a couple seconds you keep on laughing
>but Shelby's stopped
"Oh it was worth it. Definitely."
>you drop your gaze from a sky that's now mingling orange with streaks of purple
>and look at Shelby to see a look somewhere between anger and concern
>"She wouldn't let you shower?"
>you cock your head
"Well no. It was a punishment for the dirt. No one ratted, so we all got a little punishment instead of me and Leigh getting the worst. It wasn't so bad."
>she shakes her head
>"That's not right. You could have gotten sick!"
>maybe you should have left how Ms. Kerr reacted out of the story
>Shelby's brows are furrowed, and her ears are tilted back
>definitely should have left it out
>"That's completely out of line. She should have had her station revoked for neglecting your health like that."
>you've ruined it
>things were going okay, and Shelby wasn't angry, or hungry for you
>and now you've set her off again
"That's just how things were Shelby. Who was going to file a complaint about her?"
>it's not a good idea to go on like this
>but it's the truth
"Kerr was in charge, what she said, went. She didn’t usually punish us that bad."
>that's a lie
>but you've already pushed things too far
>Shelby just looks at you, brow still furrowed in quiet thought
>you stare back at her
>but your resolve wavers
>eventually you turn away
"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told that story."
>"No. No Anon you don't have to apol--"
>Shelby speaks softly, starting to reach out with her paw
>but she's interrupted by a new voice from behind both of you
>"Inspector Winn!"
>the voice snaps, authoritative and crisp
>you don't recognize it, but you know exactly who it belongs to
>a state official
>you sneak a look back to the anthro who had snuck up on you
>instead of the state uniform you expected her to be wearing, the cheetah standing over you is wearing clothes for a workout
>form-fitting sweat pants and a cropped sweater that leaves her mid-riff bare
>but she stands at attention, arms folded behind her back, gaze imperious as she inspects the two of you
>you don't know if you're more stunned or Shelby is
>but she responds quicker, rising to her feet and snapping a salute
>"Chief Inspector Ainsley! If I may ask, what are you doing here?"
>Ainsley laughs and drops into a more relaxed posture
>"Just out enjoying the weather, like it looks like you and your new husband are doing. Congratulations, by the way."
>Shelby drops her salute, but remains at attention
>it's nothing like how you've ever seen her act
>she's wholly still, her tail still, ears forward and attentive, eyes staring straight ahead
>state precision
>"Thank you, ma'am. I wanted to enjoy all the time I could with him."
>you stare up at the chief inspector, unsure of what you should do
>stand?
>introduce yourself?
>your instincts scream for you to run, or hide
>Shelby decides for you
>"Chief Inspector Ainsley, this is my husband, Anon."
>she gestures toward you, and you stand
>you make sure to step back and slightly behind Shelby as you regard Shelby's superior with undisguised distrust
>"Well, he's certainly cute. You got lucky, putting in for the special selection pool. Could have gotten a feral."
>Ainsley steps closer to you, and before you can dodge away, her arm snaps out to take your jaw in her paw
>you freeze
>oh no
>please
>you find yourself looking to Shelby, desperate for her to lose her temper now
>but she still stands rigid at attention
>staring straight ahead
"Shelby--!"
>the cheetah turns your head, one way then the other
"Please!"
>you tug away from Ainsley, who frowns at you
>"Still a little rebellious, isn't he? You should have him on a leash, he's tried to run before, you know."
>Shelby spares you a glance now
>"Chief Inspector, please. He's afraid, that's all."
>Ainsley steps away from you, and she focuses on Shelby once again
>"He needs proper training. If he was a feral he would have at least gotten some time in a pen to learn his place."
>now that you've escaped her grasp and her attention, you shy away from the chief inspector even more
>you wish you could run away right now
>"He's really a good husband, Chief Inspector. Just adjusting to the changes."
>Ainsley sighs
>"I understand. A firmer hand might serve you better, however. Humans never learn without discipline and order in their lives. It's what's best for them, after all."
>you watch for Shelby's reaction
>she doesn't move
>just the slight twitch of an ear, and her jaw setting tighter
>"Thank you, ma'am. I will take your advice under consideration."
>Ainsley nods, seemingly satisfied with the answer
>"Good. It's my hope he'll be able to join you at the Mayor's Inaugural dinner. The invitation was extended all the way down to state inspectors, you'll recall, and I think it would do well to have a success story from the special assignment pool in the public eye."
>inaugural dinner?
>you can barely handle meeting Shelby's superior in the park
>Ainsley gives Shelby a polite smile as she steps away from you both
>"Well Inspector Winn, I do apologize for interrupting your date. Have a pleasant evening."
>Shelby nods her head quickly
>"Thank you, Chief Inspector. A pleasant evening to you as well."
>Ainsley turns away and jogs off down the hill, tail flicking behind her as she goes
>you watch her closely until you're sure she's not coming back
"Shelby..."
>she finally relaxes
>then turns to you with an apologetic look
>your stomach is twisted into knots
>a part of you wants to hold on to Shelby
>to seek some kind of safety in her embrace
>but another part of you rebukes the thought
>she let that cheetah touch you
>didn't even try to stop her
>"Anon. You did well. I know you weren't expecting that to happen. I wasn't either..."
>she trails off with a weak chuckle
>"She's the Chief Inspector, I guess you could tell. I think she liked you! I know she was a little aggressive, but she's done a lot for humans since she took her place as head of the OHA office here. She can just be old fashioned around men she personally meets."
>you blink, taking in the explanation
"Can we go home please?"
>Shelby sags, and nods her head
>"Of course we can, Anon. Just let me pick up our stuff and we can go."
>Shelby gathers the blanket and the emptied food containers, and you're on your way back to the apartment
>she reaches out her free paw and takes your hand again
>by now the sun is nearly entirely set, and the cold of night is setting in
>Shelby deposits the trash in a can at the edge of the park
>and when she notices you starting to shiver, unfolds the blanket and wraps it around you
>"Do you want me to hold you? It's getting pretty cold."
>you want to say yes
>even if it’s just for a little more warmth
>you sigh and acquiesce, leaning into her outstretched arm, which she wraps around you as well
>"There we are, my snow-pup. It's alright, I know you're still scared of anthros, but I promise the chief inspector is one of the good ones. I know she wouldn't have hurt you."
>there's a little comfort in that
>Shelby wouldn't lie to you
>not about your safety
>but you’re still hurt
>she let it happen
>you trudge along in silence
>until you work up the nerve to ask Shelby something as you approach the apartment building
"That dinner, Shelby. Will I have to go to it?"
>Shelby opens the front door for you, rubbing your back to try to comfort you
>"It won't be until next week, Anon. We'll work things out, I promise."
>Shelby keeps her paw on you all the way up the stairwell and into the apartment
“I don’t want to go, Shelby.”
>she only breaks contact briefly to unlock the front door, and lock it again once you're inside
>"Here Anon. Would you come with me to the living room?"
>she directs you gently down the hall until you're both standing in front of the couch
>Shelby takes the blanket from around your shoulders, and then throws it around herself
>"I want to hold you, okay?"
>you're not really in the mood for it
"I don't know, Shelby. With the chief inspector..."
>she shushes you gently
>"I know you like it when I hold you. I want to do it so you'll feel better. I can hold you and we can talk about it if you like."
>you stare at her
>she looks back, with her green eyes wide open
>even if you're upset, you can't shake the want to make her happy
>if you get uncomfortable you can just ask her to let you go
>that's how you justify nodding your head
"Just let me take off my jacket."
>once you have it folded and set on the floor next to the couch, Shelby holds you again
>this time she uses a gentle paw to turn you to face away from her
>then her arms go around you, wrapping you in the blanket and drawing you into her lap when she sits down
>this is new
>even closer with her now
>Shelby sighs happily, and sniffs softly at the top of your head
>"Much better. Thank you for letting me do this. It helps me feel better too."
>Shelby leans back, and with her embrace, you go back with her, until you're resting against her with your head tucked under the crook of her neck
>her arms go under yours to clasp together over your stomach
>she's still calm and gentle the whole time, making it easier to fight the feeling of being trapped by her
>"There we are. How's that Anon? Comfy?"
>it is comfortable
>but you're still upset about what happened at the park
"It's nice, Shelby. I just--I'm still thinking about what happened."
>Shelby sighs deeply
>you can feel her chest rise and fall against your back when she does
>strange how you notice that little detail
>"I know. You did so well with her, even when she caught us both off guard."
>she withdraws one of her arms from around your waist
>and you find it stroking your hair a moment later
>"You really are a good boy, Anon. It must have taken a lot for you to stay calm, but it means so much that you stood by me even when you were scared."
>Shelby hums softly, shifting so she can rest her head over your shoulder
>her whiskers tickle your cheek
>"Mmh. Good boy. It's just something you can get used to, like you got used to me."
>but you don't want to get used to the cheetah
>she was rough with you, didn't even bother to speak to you
>like you were just Shelby's property
>would she have acted the same if it was Allie acting like the chief inspector did?
"She hurt me Shelby. She put her paws on me."
>Shelby keeps stroking your hair
>it keeps you from pulling free from her embrace for now
>"I'm sorry Anon. I'll ask her to be more gentle if we see her again, but I'm sure she didn't mean to. She wouldn't work for the OHA if she didn't want to help humans."
>she believes in the state so much
>but you've known at least one OHA inspector who was worse than Ainsley
>and you want to argue that point with her
>but she's still petting your hair
>and she whisper's 'good boy' in your ear
>you shudder at that
>"I'll still protect you, Anon, I promise. The chief inspector will understand when I explain it to her at work tomorrow."
>her claws scratch at your scalp, gently massaging
"But what if she doesn't understand? She wanted to put me in a pen."
>you only ever heard rumors about the pens
>where they locked up ferals from outside the state, or humans that were considered dangerous
>and those rumors weren't good
>but Shelby goes on soothing you
>"Oh Anon, the pens aren't as bad as you might hear. They're just another way to help humans adjust."
>that you definitely don't believe
"I don't ever want to find out. I'd rather try and run away again."
>Shelby whines
>and puts her arms around you again to hug tight
>"Please don't run away Anon. It would break my heart, knowing that you were so scared that you'd do it again."
>she's squeezing you
>and now nuzzling her cheek against yours
>"I'll tell you a secret Anon. Maybe it will make you feel better."
>you don't answer, simply listening
>Shelby takes a deep breath as though she were about to do something drastic
>"My dad spent time in the pens, before he met my mom. But he was okay, in the end. He loved my mom, and me and my sisters. He was happy."
>she keeps saying 'was'
>whatever happened to her father, he's not around anymore
>Shelby continues on
>"And he told me the story, when he was first assigned to mom. How he said he hated her. How they'd fight about what was best and how he wanted to leave. But eventually they both figured out how to be happy together."
>there's a twinge of sadness in her voice again
>"I guess what I'm trying to say is the State was looking out for him, even when he had to be in a pen for a while, and he wasn't happy about it. It worked out in the end."
>Shelby ruffles your hair one more time
>"Just like how I know things will work out for us too! We'll make it work like my parents did."
>you don't know how to respond
>her own father locked up in the pens?
>and she believes it was all okay?
>but somehow he became the man in Shelby's picture
>smiling so proudly at his daughters
>yet now he may be dead, and Shelby doesn't want to talk about it
>there's too much you don't know for sure
>it just confuses you
>and you're tired
>at least you'll have something to think about when you're alone again tomorrow
"Can we go to bed now, Shelby?"
>"Anything you like, pup. May I carry you?"
>you yawn out a questioning 'carry me?'
>in answering, Shelby adjusts you in her lap to sweep you into a bridal carry
>"Carry you, like this."
>you grab on to her, not expecting the sudden shift
>thankfully she hasn't stood up off the couch yet
>"I've got you. You just looked so cozy, I didn't want to make you walk."
>you consider it for a few seconds
>but you release your hold on her and gently push against her arm
>not tonight
"I'm okay walking myself."
>Shelby makes a soft 'aww' of disappointment, but lets you go so you can stand from her lap
>"I'll go shower so I'm ready for the morning then. I'll join you in just a minute."
>you nod to her and leave her to change in the bedroom
>back in your familiar pajamas, and tucked under the covers, by the time Shelby joins you, you're already dozing off
>but you're awake enough to notice the sensation of her brushing her paw over your cheek
>"Good pup."
>she whispers gently, then kisses your cheek
>after a little bit to change into her own pajamas and flick off the lights, she joins you in the bed
>like last night, pressed back against you
>you're so tired, you drop to sleep by the time she says
>"Goodnight Anon. I love you."
>you need this sleep
>a short while where you don't have to worry about anything
>your dreams are comfortingly incomprehensible
>at some point in the night, you're roused by Shelby moving
>but she settles down again, her warmth and scent returned
>lulling you back to sleep
>and without thinking you wrap your arm around her and bury your face in her fur
>you've dropped out of consciousness before you can register the new weight settling around your shoulders
>when morning comes, you're startled awake
>not by Shelby shouting, or nightmares, or even the slam of the dormitory door against the head of your wireframe bed
>the harsh buzzing of an alarm clock jolts you awake
>still wasn't pleasant
>you gasp and take a breath, trying to reorient yourself
>of course, you have a face full of Shelby's fur
>but when you go to turn away, you find yourself pinned
>Shelby's arms are wrapped around you, holding you close and pressing your face into the tuft of fur on her chest
>your first reaction is to be flustered
>but when your movement causes her to squeeze you tighter, you have to fight to remain calm
>the rational part of your mind tells you she probably just rolled over in her sleep
>that she didn't mean to trap you like this
>in fact, you’d almost feel comfortable if she weren’t squeezing you quite so tight
>and if the bare fur of her breasts weren’t rubbing against your cheeks causing them to burn bright red
>all the while the alarm goes on ringing
>"Mm. Juss'a little longer..."
>she releases you with one arm to swat blindly at the bedside table until she finds the clock to slap the snooze button
>you’re free for a moment
>but her mission accomplished, Shelby hugs you with both arms again, forcing you back into her chest
"Shelby. Shelby."
>you work to rouse her, pushing against her as gently as you can to make distance between you
>she stirs again
>"No. I’ve got you. I’ve got you…”
“Shelby!”
>you try to shake her and she grumbles
>thankfully she loosens her grip on you, giving you enough room to free yourself from her chest
>enough you can see the slight glow of her night-eyes fluttering open
>”Mmh, Anon?
>you pull at the arm holding you down, which she lifts sluggishly
>”Oh. Sorry. What time is it?”
>you roll over and glance at the clock
“Early. The alarm went off. Don’t you have to go to work?”
>she sighs and drops onto her back
>you’re still laying on top of her other arm, which has also fallen away from holding you
>”Mmh. I have a little time. Just gotta..."
>she tugs her pinned arm gently, and you push up off the bed to free her
>first time she had to ask you to let her go
>you chuckle at the thought
>"Somethin' funny?"
>she still mumbles half-asleep
>your eyes are adjusted to the dark enough to see her rubbing her face now as she yawns noisily
"Nothing. Just thinking."
>Shelby gives an affirmative 'hm' and rolls over her side of the bed to sit up
>"Hope you don't mind. I set the alarm early so we could spend a little time. You were so tired last night..."
>you mimic her action and sit up on your side of the bed
"Yeah, that's okay."
>Shelby rises first, and with plodding footsteps crosses over to your side of the bed
>"And you're okay how we woke up? It just sort of happened."
>you consider it a moment
>it was nice, and if all she does is sleep while holding you, you may even like it happening again
>you nod
"It was nice. I'm okay."
>she sighs happily and holds out her paw
>naturally, you take it and let her pull you onto your feet
>you catch a breeze off her tail wagging
>with her free paw, Shelby leans over and flicks on the bedside lamp
>"Hopefully when this assignment is over we can have a proper morning together again."
>that reminds you
>you perk up
"Hey! How long until you have to leave?"
>Shelby's head cocks to one side, an ear quirked
>"Half an hour, why?"
>you nod and step around Shelby to lead her out the door
>she follows, flicking on the light switches as you pass them down the hall
>you let go of her paw once you've brought her to the kitchen table, and you direct her to sit
"You never have breakfast before you leave. I wanted to make you something."
>Shelby gasps
>"Oh! Anon, that's so thoughtful! You don't have to do this for me, I usually just get something on the way, or at work."
>you shrug as you start collecting pans for the bacon and the eggs
"If you prefer that food then I can just--"
>"No! No, this is so much better. You're the best, Anon."
>she beams at you, and takes a seat at the kitchen table
>you can hear her tail thumping against the leg of her chair as she watches in rapt admiration
>even if there are still a million problems you and her need to work out
>just for now, in the quiet mornings, you can enjoy her company
>plenty of time to argue after work
>that mood darkens your thoughts while you cook
>but Shelby's smile chases it away when you present her plate and sit down with your own
>"It's amazing Anon! Another new recipe?"
>you shrug
>just something from the recipe book she got you
>fried eggs aren't so hard
>Shelby devours it with as much alacrity as she did the last time you fed her
>you eat with the same relish, but slightly more table manners
>by the time you're done, she's already washing dishes
>"If you like, I could use a little help grooming again. Why don't you go to the bedroom and I'll join you?"
>you get the feeling she doesn't really need the help
>but now isn't the time for being clever
>now you just want to spend time with your wife
>another thought hits you
>it's barely been a week, and everything's so different
>you let her hold you, even wanted her to
>at certain points you lusted after her
>how does she have that effect on you?
>of course, you seemed to have that effect on her too
>she already says she loves you
>you step back into the bedroom, and cross over to the closet to search for the brush
>your eyes skitter over the uniform
>and on a low stack of storage shelves you find the brush, along with a dozen other implements for cutting and controlling fur
>her summer coat must be a hassle
>a hassle you may well have to help her with eventually
>Shelby's only a couple minutes behind you, and gives you another of her sunshine smiles when she sees you read and waiting with brush in hand
>"You're the best! Oh if I could do this every morning I think I'd be a million times happier."
>she bows her head and lets you get to work smoothing down the impressive bedhead she's managed to create
>from her head down to her tail, she sighs and huffs in pleasure
>there's a twinge of old fear, but you swallow it down easily
>when you're done, Shelby reaches out a paw to tousle your hair
>"I'm going to have to start grooming you too! You're getting a little shaggy."
>with a giggle, she continue ruffling and petting your hair
>if getting her fur brushed felt anything like this, you understand why she loves it so much
>you find yourself leaning into her paw just for a little more
>but it doesn't last
>Shelby lets out a whine of disappointment and pulls her paw back
>"Oh I wish we had more time, dear. I have to get dressed and get going or I'll be late again."
>you nod your understanding and sit down on the bed
"Alright Shelby. I'll probably go back to bed then. Have a good day at work."
>Shelby reaches out to you once again, leaning down to cup your chin and kiss your cheek
>"Thank you Anon. And don't worry, I'll have that talk with the Chief Inspector. Everything will work out fine!"
>a sour taste in your mouth
>along with her uniform, a verbal reminder of Shelby's place in the state, and the troubles you're still having
>but in the light of the morning, you think you believe her
>at least you believe she'll try her best to make things work out
>"Love you, Anon. See you tonight!"
>you fall back on the bed and throw the covers on before you can see her change into her uniform
>"See you, Shelby."
>you can still hear Shelby moving about the room when you fall back asleep again
>when you wake up, you reach a searching arm out to where she usually lays
>hoping for just a little of her warmth to have lingered
>there's a slight twinge of disappointment when you realize there's nothing there
>of course she's gone
>left a couple hours ago, according to the clock when you turn over to consult it
>you sigh and lie back down
>there's something wrong with you
>a slight pull in your gut
>whatever it is, you decide to ignore it for now
>maybe it was that fish sandwich last night
>you rise from the bed and have it made again quickly
>just another day of nothing
>after you've showered and changed into fresh clothes, you get to work on the usual chores
>but they're a poor diversion, and you have them done shortly
>more music, more reading
>and more time to chase your own thoughts
>now that the morning is over and you're alone again, you have time to think
>about Shelby, of course, while turning that silver ring over and over in your hand
>but about her father too, as you stare at his photo on the wall
>as well as the chief inspector, while thumbing the scarf Shelby had gotten you
>and whatever that dinner is going to be like
>yet all your thoughts fall back to Shelby again
>and what you and she will do when you're together again
>there's that twisting, tugging sensation in your gut again
>of course you want to talk with her, to keep working on all the uncountable issues you still have
>but more than just to assuage your fears
>to make her happy too
>you realize what the tugging sensation is
>you miss her
>the idea shakes you a little
>after all the arguing and fear
>all the gifts and tenderness
>you like Shelby
>when she holds you, and she pets you, and her tail wags and she smiles at you like you're the most precious thing in the world
>should have been obvious, how you spent the morning
>but what can you do with that information?
>it shouldn't make any difference
>you just go on trying to make things work like you promised to
>but it feels different
>somehow
"Fuck."
>you pace the hall and count the tick of the clock
>and once it gets late enough, start preparing dinner
>you've got everything ready and waiting by the time Shelby usually comes home
>but she doesn't
>you watch the door, listening for the rap of Shelby's paws on the stairs beyond
>or the rattle of a key in the lock
>but nothing comes
>after an hour, you start to get anxious
>she hadn't said anything about being late
>you pace more, from the living room to the bedroom and back again
>on your last go-around, you look into the kitchen and see the food you left out
>and your stomach grumbles
>you can pace on a full stomach
>the cooking distracts you for the half hour it takes
>you're getting better, barely even burned the dish of chicken smothered in tomato sauce and cheese that badly
>but now it's done and there's nothing to control your attention
>you and the food sit at the table
>waiting
>at first you wanted to eat without her, but you already made enough for both of you
>it wouldn't feel right
>it's only when it's long gone cold that you hear the rattle of Shelby unlocking the door
>over two hours later than usual
>you rise from your seat, not sure what you should expect
>it's definitely Shelby
>if she had spent the whole day running through muddy fields and greasy abandoned buildings
>her fur is disheveled and matted in places, her uniform stained with grime
>you turns to look at you with tired, drooping eyes
>and she smiles like it takes all the effort in the world
>her low-hanging tail makes an attempt at wagging
>"Anon."
>she sighs the word, and approaches you with staggered footsteps
>you're stuck somewhere between the old fear of her uniform, and the quiet relief of her return
>so like usual, you freeze as she throws her arms around you and leans against you slightly
>"Mmh. Sorry Anon. I'll change, I just..."
>she takes a deep sniff of your hair
>"...I needed you so much."
>you go stiff
>she needs you
>you know what those words mean
>what she might do, even in this state, if she can’t control herself
>all the affection you have for her feels like nothing now
>you grit your teeth
“Are you…okay, Shelby?”
>she just grunts in response
>and takes a couple more deep breaths before stepping back from you
>”Oh. You made dinner. I’m sorry, Anon, you didn’t have to wait for me. I’ll…”
>she turns, and looks down the hallway
>”I’d better shower too.”
>maybe you overreacted
>in her sorry state, you don’t know if she could even muster up the energy to try something
>”Go ahead and eat, I’ll be back.”
>Shelby trudges down the hallway, already undoing her jacket
>you decide to wait just a little more so you can eat with her
>you sit back down, listening as Shelby moves from bedroom, to bathroom, and the shower starts up
>what could she have been doing that had her so completely wiped out?
>the answer seems obvious
>chasing down a runaway
>the idea twists your stomach, killing your appetite
>so when Shelby joins you, already dressed for bed in her nightgown, you only pick at your food
>but Shelby digs in
>it seems even exhaustion can't quell her voracious appetite
>she even licks her chops as she brings the first bite to her muzzle
"So..."
>you stare down at your plate
"What happened?"
>Shelby finishes her next forkful of pasta and sets her fork down
>"I was in the field today. We had to...we were finishing that case they called me in for."
>her voice wavers a bit
>was it that bad?
>she strains to sound more cheery as she continues
>"But it's all solved now. Only paperwork left, so after tomorrow I can take the rest of my days off with you."
>well
>it's a bittersweet feeling
>at least you won't have to see her in uniform for a little bit
>you don't want to ask this next question
>but you feel like you have to
"Was it a runaway?"
>Shelby flinches
>"No."
>she takes a breath
>"It was an abduction. Anthro didn't want to wait for her assignment."
>Shelby doesn't quite sound upset
>just even more tired, if she can manage it
>you feel bad for asking, but you felt like you had to
"Oh. Sorry"
>you look up to her, and she just shakes her head
>"He's home safe now. That's what matters."
>home safe
>you certainly hope whoever it is, he's okay
"I meant sorry for pestering you. You're tired and..."
>Shelby sets her fork down, her plate cleared
>"It's okay, Anon. If I didn't want to talk about it, I would say so. I'm glad we were able to help that boy, and I'm proud of it too."
>this time she doesn't have to force the emotion in her voice
>she really does sound proud
"I...want to ask more about it. Maybe tomorrow when you're less tired?"
>you ask as much for your sake as for hers
>you don't want to upset her so she doesn't lose her temper with you
>but you also don't want to see her upset
>at least not when she's already looking so beat up
>"We're going to have to talk about all the things we put off eventually."
>Shelby makes an effort at laughing
>"But you're right, I'm about ready to fall asleep in this chair. Do you mind if I go right to bed?"
>you nod and stand to start collecting dishes
>Shelby stands
>she wags her tail, and as she passes by you, leans down to kiss your cheek
>"Thank you dear. I'll be out before my head hits the pillow, so just join me whenever you're ready. Love you."
>she pads away, looking much better after a shower and a meal
"G'night Shelby."
>you take a while to get the cleaning finished
>while you had made impressive progress in your ability to not ruin food, you had also made an impressive mess of the kitchen
>but with time and effort, you get it looking almost as spotless as when you started
>satisfied with another day survived, you amble down the hallway to prepare yourself for bed
>Shelby was right, by the time you'd finished in the bathroom and gotten back to the bedroom she was out
>snoring softly in her usual spot on the bed
>quietly, you change into pajamas and join her
>you take your usual position under the covers, pressing against her back and wrapping on arm around her waist
>Shelby hums slightly in her sleep, and her snoring quiets
>you sigh and close your eyes
>but even though she came home late, it's still earlier than when you usually went to sleep
>so you lay in silence, doing your best to control your breathing and empty your mind
>you should have found something else to do
>but you wanted to get close to her again
>and now that she's asleep, maybe you could...
>no!
>you did it once already
>it's not a good idea to try it again
>so you wait
>counting your breaths
>feeling Shelby's warmth
>until the temptation comes again
>this time your hand traces up
>over her stomach, ruffling fur through her nightgown
>then to her side and over the curve of her hip
>you hold your breath as inevitably you're drawn to the source of your weakness
>legs
>where your hand met the heaven of her bare fur
>it's soft from her shower
>you rest your hand on her thigh and hold it there
>just enjoying the sensation
>"Mmh. Anon."
>Shelby moans your name softly
>and your heart explodes out of your chest
>you gasp and try to yank your hand back
>but faster than you thought possible, her paw snaps around your wrist
>"No!"
>she growls as she forces your hand against her thigh again
>"Don't stop!"
>she growls for a second longer, before it drops into plaintive whine
>"Please."
>you hold stock still, unable to muster up words
>Shelby starts to move your hand for you, forcing it down her thigh and up again
>"I need this, Anon. And if you can't control yourself, how could I?"
>she's back to the growling, in between huffs
>and she pulls your hand up, over her hips again
>then under her nightgown
>"Touching me in my sleep. Because you're so scared of me, isn't that right pup?"
>you find your voice, as taut skin and belly fur trace under your fingertips
"I am scared, Shelby. Please, I'm sorry. Don't--"
>"No! Let it happen. Let it happen and you'll be fine."
>you gasp at her sudden harsh tone
>which she softens as she tries to comfort you
>”It’s okay, Anon. I promise you’re safe.”
>she whines again
>”I just--I need this.”
>Shelby's breath starts to come quicker as she uses your own hand to grope her body
>"I need your touch, pup. Feel how you make my heart beat."
>she pulls your hand up her chest between her breasts
>you can feel her chest heaving with her excited panting
>Shelby holds you there
>"I can feel yours. Hammering so hard."
>it is
>thumping in fear of the growling, forceful beast that was your sleeping wife a little while ago
>but if she just has this, maybe she’ll be okay
>you have no choice but to trust she can control herself
>this had to happen eventually
>so you take a deep, shuddering breath, and let Shelby take control
>"You're doing good, pup. I'm ready..."
>she turns your wrist, forcing your hand flat on her stomach, sliding downward
>your fingers push under the waistband of her panties
>and over slick fur
>her hand slides over yours, guiding you along
>until you graze against her heat
>a shudder runs through Shelby
>and she moans
>"There you are pup~"
>she presses your fingers further into her
>her growls and pants getting faster as she uses your hand to get herself off
>"Harder...there! Just like that, pup, just like that!"
>you do your best to please her, even if you barely have control
>her whole body shakes, and she thrusts her hips against your hand
>that same motion rubbing her against you
>"Come on, come on--"
>her growls are falling away, replaced by moans that get needier with every breath
>Shelby alternates, thrusting your fingers into her, or guiding you to caress where she directs
>"Good pup. Good puuuup!"
>her legs clamp down and she starts to melt
>you feel her gushing and quivering around your fingers
>she rolls her hips
>over and over
>before finally, in a torrent of 'good pup's, falls still save for her heavy panting
>gingerly she withdraws your hand, finally releasing it to rest around her waist where it first laid
>you catch your breath, the scent of her musk starting to fill your senses
>you swallow down the lump in your throat
>you don't know what you should do
>what you should say?
>eventually Shelby manages to regain enough of her senses to take initiative again
>turning over, Shelby locks eyes with you
>she seems to be at a loss for words too, staring at you for several quiet seconds
>”I’m sorry, Anon. This isn’t how it should have gone. Are you…okay?”
>you’re still frightened
>but at the same time, satisfied
>happy that you’ve survived this first real time with Shelby
>not even a bruise
>you give her a slight nod, and a tight smile
>Shelby releases her held breath
>then reaches out to cup your cheek in her paw
>and she kisses you
>you're stunned
>she holds the kiss, her thin lips pressed against yours
>and her cold wet snout poking your nose
>your heart flutters
>she pulls back, but continues stroking your cheek with her paw
>"Good pup. I'm sorry if I scared you, but you did so well for me. You're so very brave, Anon, that's why I love you."
>Shelby gives you another kiss
>then she reaches her paw back around your neck to tuck your head in the crook of her neck
>"Right where my pup belongs."
>you tremble
>and cling on to her by the arm still wrapped around her waist
>Shelby stokes your hair with an idle paw and sighs contentedly
>"You're okay doing things like this? I promise next time will be gentler. And maybe more romantic."
>Shelby makes a slight ‘hm’ of amusement
>”If you can keep your hands to yourself until then.”
>the sweet, normal Shelby you know is back
>you think you are okay with doing it like this again
>she didn't even hurt your wrist
>she growled and barked and raised her voice
>but not once did Shelby hurt you
>no claws
>no teeth
>and the way she shuddered and moaned as she used you
>you're more than okay with it
"I am."
>thump, thump, thump
>that's her tail
>"Good. So now, how about you let me..."
>with her still soaked free paw, Shelby traces a soft pawpad down your chest
>all the way down to tease at the tip of your erection through your pants
>"...take care of this for you?"
>oh fuck
>you shiver
>and you twitch against her teasing paw
>your head is spinning
>"You’ve done so much for me, Anon. I want you to enjoy tonight as much as I did.”
>her voice tickles against your ear as she murmurs softly
>you’re still tempted, even if she lost control on you
>the worst of your fear is past
>not even a scratch
>and though you're sure you're nowhere near as bad as Shelby was, you're pent up too
“Shelby, I–”
>you struggle with your thoughts
>and your throbbing loins telling you to stop thinking at all
>Shelby sighs and pulls her paw back
>”It’s okay, Anon. I’ll just go wash off and we can go back to sleep.”
>now’s your chance
>make a choice
>she’s starting to turn away from you
“Wait!”
>Shelby goes still
“I want it. I want you. I was scared, but I just–”
>you look up, staring into the glow of her eyes
>the only things you can see in her silhouette
>you work to finish the thought
“I can’t help myself.”
>Shelby lets out a quiet gasp
>”Oh Anon.”
>once again, she kisses you passionately
>her paw sliding under your shirt to trail her warm touch over your skin
>she breaks the kiss, starting to pant again
>”I’ll take care of you, Anon. My pup. Just hold on for me…”
>at her word, you hold on to her
>she withdraws her paw from under your shirt and reaches past you
>you hear the drawer on her bedside table rolling open, and Shelby blindly fumbles behind your back
>just when you're going to ask what she's doing, she slides back
>"We're going to make a mess..."
>there's hint of mischief in her voice
>as though you were in conspiracy together
>you hear the a soft pop, then the squirt of something being squeezed out of a bottle
>"Can you pull your pants off, Anon? I think you'll really enjoy this."
>guess that should have been the obvious thing to do
>you have to shift your body a bit, but you yank down your pajama pants and kick out of them
>boxers too
>you shiver, even though you're warm and close to Shelby
>this is the most exposed you've ever been with her
>you take a deep breath and try to remind yourself that you're okay
>Shelby seems to notice
>"It's okay Anon. You're safe right now. If it ever gets to be too much, tell me."
>you nod
>it's okay
>Shelby's okay
>you're okay
>"Little cold, pup."
>you don't have time to process her warning before you feel what she was warning you about
>her paw, coated in something slick and a little colder than comfortable, wraps around your shaft
"Oh fuh--"
>you weren't expecting the sensation, as Shelby starts to stroke you slowly and gingerly
>you can hear Shelby's breath start to shudder
>this is her first time touching you
>she must be in paradise
>her paw goes over your tip, and down again, covering you entirely in that viscous liquid
>"There we are. All ready!"
>ready?
>she isn't going to use her paw?
>Shelby takes your head in her clean paw and pulls you back into her embrace
>your face gets buried in her chest fluff
>and you gasp when you feel her legs shift, lifting to catch your manhood and squish it between her thighs
>"There you are. Those legs you love so much. Not too tight, is it?"
>you grunt in affirmative
>"Good pup. Just hold on to me."
>Shelby starts to shift her hips, rolling them gently to stroke you with her thighs
>your wrap your arms around her back
>she goes slowly, letting the pleasure build up with every thrust
>you moan, the sound muffled by her fur
>"That's it pup. Let me take care of you."
>you feel her paw on the small of your back, and she directs you to start thrusting along with her motions
>you only need the slightest encouragement
>the feeling of her thighs is better than anything you could have imagined
>how could you have waited so long for this?
>to feel her fur
>to relish her touch
>to breath her scent
>to surrender
>"Don't hold back Anon pup. Let me hear your pretty moans. Let me feel your love."
>there's no resisting it
>you moan and cling on all the harder
>your thrusts getting faster
>"Good pup. Keep going."
>you need no encouragement, but Shelby heaps it on anyways
>her voice in your ear, praising you and urging you on
>"You're getting close, pup. I can feel it."
>you can feel it too
>your prick twitching and throbbing as you build to a climax
>"Be a good boy, Anon. Cum."
>as though you were waiting for permission
>you grab Shelby's hips and thrust deep
>back arched to press even harder against her thighs, you explode between them
"Fuck! Ah--!"
>Shelby holds you through your climax as you spatter the sheets and her thighs
>you gasp
>head spinning
>nerves dancing
>and Shelby keeps rolling her hips, teasing out more and more pleasure from you while you reel
>until you simply don't have anything left in you
>your muscles relax, going limp
>Shelby gathers you up in her arms so you stay firmly nestled against her chest
>and still trapped between her thighs
>"Good boy, Anon. Such a good pup..."
>she croons
>Shelby goes on praising you, rubbing your back and stroking your hair while you work to catch your breath
>your own hands trace idly through the fur on Shelby's lower back
>her tail twitches whenever you brush over it
>just when you think you could fall asleep like this, Shelby pushes you slightly away to free your face
>"Don't fall asleep yet. We really did make a mess, we'll have to try to clean ourselves."
>you don't want to leave the bed
>leaving behind the glow of her embrace would almost be too much to bear
"Can we just stay like this a little more?"
>is that your voice?
>asking an anthro to hold you just a little longer?
>it's so strange to think
>but if the anthro holding you is Shelby, you're okay with it
>"Alright Anon."
>Shelby releases you from her thighs, and turns you about to spoon you
>she scoots down so she can rest her muzzle over your shoulder
>"There you are. Comfy, Anon?"
"Mhm."
>you hum your satisfaction
>"Good. I'm so incredibly proud of you, my brave pup."
>she starts to kiss along your neck and jaw
>gentle pecks to go along with her outpouring of praise and affection
>"I love you, Anon. I loved you since the moment I saw you. My precious, darling husband."
>her kisses turn into licks of that long, rough tongue
>eliciting a huff from you as you don't expect the sudden sensation
>and then you feel
>where neck meets shoulder
>the edge of her teeth, nibbling at your skin
>teeth
>TEETH
"Fuck!"
>she's going to maul you!
>bite down to the bone!
>you spring, legs kicking, arms grasping for the edge of the bed to free you from her grasp
>"Ah! Anon what--ouf!"
>you whirl about, bringing your legs up and planting them against the inspector's stomach
>and you shove with all your might, breaking out of the canine's tightening hold
>you kick out so far you go tumbling backwards off the bed
>landing in a heap, you rush to reorient and scramble away
>you're going too fast to take the time to stand, and in your panic you simply crawl back on flailing limbs
>your back hits the bedroom door and your retreat is halted
>"Anon!"
>the inspector is on top of you
>she has your wrists
>holding you down
>please no
>"Anon! Calm down!"
>you grit your teeth, waiting for the clamp of her jaws
>you can still feel the pain of it
"Please! Please I'm sorry!"
>the inspector forces her full weight on you
>you're trapped
>struggling barely shakes her as she folds your arms to lock them in place
>"It's okay Anon. It's okay, just--Just breath."
>somehow she's rolled you over on your front
>keeping you pinned with your arms behind your back
>tears streaming down your face
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please..."
>the pain still hasn't come
>you still tense in anticipation of it when the inspector leans low over your shoulder
>but all she does is whisper in your ear
>"I have you, Anon. I have you. Just breathe for me. Just breathe."
>your breath comes in shudders
>trying to recover from such an explosive burst of movement while already spent
>you give one last pull against the paws holding your arms back
>no luck
>no escape
>you let your head drop against the ground
>"Are you calm now? Just keep breathing for me, Anon."
>you force yourself to take slow, deep breathes
>the pain never came
>"Just stay calm for me, okay? I'm going to let you go now."
>the paws holding your arms release and the weight pinning you down lifts
>you plant your palms on the ground, waiting to be grappled again
>and when that doesn't happen, you push up and turn about to sit leaning up against the bedroom door
>it's Shelby
>you recognize her silhouette leaning over you
>her glowing eyes locked with yours
>you can almost picture her expression, care and fear
>"Are you hurt?"
>a good question
>you take stock of yourself
>besides a slight twinge in one arm from how Shelby restrained you, and a tweak of pain in your back from falling off the bed you think you're okay
"I'm...okay."
>Shelby hovers over you still
>you try to recollect yourself
>piece together the moment of mindless, blind panic
>the teeth
>you felt them
>sure that they were going to punch through your skin, clamp down on muscle and bone
>just like...
>you have to halt that train of thought
>stamp out the rising trill of fear before it overrides your senses again
"I'm...I'm sorry Shelby. I lost--I lost where I was."
>you struggle to put into words what exactly happened to you
>like you were trapped in a wretched memory
>Shelby shushes
>"It's okay, Anon. It's okay. Just take your time. Focus on breathing."
>you grunt
>it's not okay
>you hurt her
"Teeth. It was the teeth. I thought you--That I was--"
>you groan in frustration
>it wasn't something you wanted her to learn yet
>but she'd find out eventually, and how else can you explain
>you hold out your hand for Shelby
>she takes it in her paw, and you use her to haul yourself up on your feet
>"Anon?"
>you turn around, opening the door to start leading Shelby out of the bedroom
"I have to show you something."
>she whines
>"I'm sorry. The bite, I wasn't thinking--"
"No. Just let me show you."
>no apologizing
>no promises of talking about it some later time
>Shelby has to see
>she lets you pull her into the bathroom
>you flick on the light
>Shelby has the exact expression of concern you were expecting her to have
>you start to undo the buttons on your pajama shirt
>her expression turns quizzical, her ears raised expectantly
>when you have it unbuttoned
>before you can think yourself out of rash action
>you throw it off, leaving yourself completely naked in front of Shelby
>and you turn, twisting to show off your shoulder
>just below where Shelby gave you that nip
>previously covered up
>is the recent scar of a deep bite, from canine jaws
>Shelby's jaw drops
>she stares in shocked silence
>you have to resist the urge to cover it, as though it would keep her from getting upset
>there's your fear
>laid bare for her to understand
"The teeth. The bite."
>explanation enough
>Shelby's gaze turns slowly from your shoulder to your eyes
>and you see in those green globes the light of anger
>it's blazing
>more than at the assignment office
>or with Allie the sheep
>her mouth works silently
>too angry for words
>she starts to growl as she manages to get her question out
>"Who?"
"The inspector. The one that caught me when I tried to run away from my assignment."
>Shelby trembles
"I resisted. She bit deep. Said that it would happen every single day when I got assigned."
>your resolve wavers as you recall the words that the inspector said to you
"She told me to--to get used to it. That bad husbands make good chew toys. She said that with my blood on her lips."
>you're running out of power
>have to finish this
"That's what the state does to humans like me."
>your fists are balled
>your whole body shaking
>but you don't break eye contact
"I hate it. All of it, Shelby."
>Shelby stares at you
>and you stare back
>you didn’t want this to happen like it did
>but it’s too late now
>hope she doesn’t take it too poorly
>after all, you still don’t hate Shelby
>your anger starts to burn out, leaving a hollow feeling behind as you consider what you’ve done
>her expressions shift slowly, first from shock with ears peaked and eyes wide
>then brow furrowing into anger
>will she be mad at you for saying that?
>you don't think she'd hurt you, even now
>but her anger burns out just like yours did, into sorrow and pity
>her expressive ears drooping down to copy the deep frown on her muzzle
>"Anon.”
>she starts off trying to speak, but whatever she tries to say next disappears into a soft whine
>her mouth opens and closes a few times before clamping shut again
>then she tries to reach for you
>you wait for the touch of her paw, but it never comes
>it hovers over your scar
>”God…how could she have done this? It’s excess force. It’s human abuse. It’s awful.”
>her eyes flick from yours, to the scar, then back again
>”We could report her. The inspector who did this to you. She won’t get away with it, if we both go to the chief inspector…”
>Shelby rambles
>about what state power she could invoke that would make it better
>about all the rules and laws that should have stopped it
“No.”
>Shelby stops, mouth hanging open as she fails to finish her sentence
>”What do you mean no?”
>a hint of disbelief in her tone
>like she can’t believe you would deny her so bluntly
“I mean no, Shelby. Reporting her won’t help. It’s not just the bite. It’s the fact she got away with it. No one cared that she bit me. The state doesn’t care.”
>you feel Shelby's paw finally
>one on each shoulder, careful not to touch your scar
>the warmth of her pads is reassuring, even if she's giving you a stern look
>”I’m the State too. I care. As an OHA inspector, it’s my job to protect humans. As your wife, it’s my duty to protect you.”
>Shelby locks eyes with you, and you can’t look away
>her emerald eyes are burning
>not the flash of righteous anger
>or the wildfire of starving desire
>they smolder with something much deeper
>the intensity of it takes you off guard
>you fail to come up with any words to respond
>”Anon. I need you to do something for me.”
>you nod dumbly
>”Please get in the shower.”
>you blink
>not what you were expecting
“What?”
>Shelby turns you slightly toward the shower
>”I know we’re having a talk but if I don’t wash up now I’m going to start dripping on the floor.”
>oh right
>you really did make a mess
>matter of fact, you’re feeling rather cold and slimy yourself
>Shelby releases you so you can climb into the shower and turn the knob to get water flowing
>the water only takes a few seconds to heat up
>you don’t think you’ll ever get tired of that luxury
>"Here."
>you feel Shelby's paw on your back, directing you further into the shower and under the stream of water
>then she steps in with you
>you glance back to see she's stripped out of her nightgown and panties
>that's a lot of fur
>suddenly self-conscious, you avert your eyes to inspect the bath tiles in front of you
>you've never seen her naked before
>"Hm. We're married, Anon. You're allowed to look."
>she makes no effort to hide the amusement in her voice
>of course
>after all, you'd already gone much farther than simply looking at her
>"Why don't we switch places a moment? I need to wash up."
>Shelby places a guiding paw on your back, shuffling so she can take a spot under the showerhead
>and you're left watching as she works her paws from her head downward, working the warm water into her fur
>Shelby sighs in pleasure as the shower works its magic on her
>under more normal circumstances such a display would have you excited all over again
>but right now you find yourself more struck by her natural beauty
>the way her figure flows, the tone of well trained muscle usually hidden by her fur
>and her legs, your weakness
>how the water flows over them and exposes their shape
>”Alright.”
>Shelby turns back to face you, and gestures for you to take her place again
>and when she slides around you, her paw rests on your shoulder again
>”I’m ready to talk if you are, Anon.”
>you lean your head forward and let the water flow down your back
"I don't know what there is to talk about. Reporting her won't fix anything."
>Shelby considers your response with a soft hum
>and slowly runs her paw down your shoulder to rub your back
>"It must seem that way."
>Shelby speaks in a soothing murmur, almost hard to hear over the spray
>her other paw joins in, working at tense spots along your shoulder blades
>she forces a sigh out of you as she catches a particularly sore spot
>"So many anthros failed you. Your caretaker who abused you. The officers that ignored your injury. That bitch--"
>her voice lowers into a growl
>that she stifles with apparent effort
>"The one that hurt you. I understand why you hate the State if that's all you've seen of it. Why you don't think it could get better."
>she massages back up toward you shoulders
>focusing in on the side with the scar
>"Anon. May I?"
>you twitch
"It's sensitive."
>she doesn't move
>"I'll be gentle. I promise."
>with a deep sigh, you close your eyes and nod
>you trust her
>Shelby turns you gently so you're perpendicular to her and she can peer closer at the scar
>the pads of her fingers, so light you barely feel them, ghost over the sensitive tissue
>you cringe
>it doesn't hurt, but you were expecting it to
>Shelby lets outs a soft coo of pity, and traces over the scar again
>"Does it hurt?"
>you shake your head
>she continues, running her finger around and over where the inspector bit you
>"I'm sorry, Anon."
>you open on eye to glance at her
>sorry for what?
>"I'm so sorry for all that you've been through. It's a travesty."
>a travesty, she says
>you sigh
>it's just how things are
>"You're sure you don't want to do this? Try and stop her?"
>you're sure
>it's too late
>it doesn't matter
"I am."
>Shelby releases your shoulder
>"Can I ask one last thing?"
>you turn to look at her
>the sensation of hot water washing over your back even better after her massaging
>"Would you want to report her if there was a chance it would stop her from doing it again?"
>the question cuts right through you
>it's not fair
>how could you say no?
>"If it keeps another human from being abused like you were."
>if her first question cut you, then this one guts you entirely
>you stare at her
>and she has that same burning intensity in her eyes
>deep, unyielding conviction
>it's awful
>inescapable
>you know the truth
>she wouldn't say it if she didn't mean it in complete sincerity
>Shelby's right
>but your gut twists and your instincts tell you to deny it
>you don't want to confront that inspector again
>you don't want to make a target of yourself
"I-I'm scared, Shelby. What if it really doesn't work? What if you get in trouble for it?"
>your eyes start to burn, vision blurring as you tear up
"What if she hurts me again?"
>you struggle to catch your breath
>legs shaking, arms trembling, teeth clenched tight in a useless attempt to stifle a sob
>Shelby steps forward, her arms go around you and pull you into her embrace
>"Shh. Shh. It's okay Anon, I've got you."
>she feels different when she's all wet like this
>her fur stringing into clumps
>but her skin is still soft underneath
>she holds you against her with one arm, and cradles your head in her paw with the other
>"I've got you. Just let it out."
>the water flows over you both, Shelby holding you tight
>you shudder and cough around stifled sobs
>and you cling onto your wife for the strength you don't even have to stand
>Shelby holds and comforts you until the water turns lukewarm
>just like your rage, your fear doesn't last either, and you pull yourself together enough to stand straight again
>"If you really don't think you can do it, Anon, I won't make you."
>she pulls back enough to look you in the eye without letting you go
>"But I swear, no matter what you decide, I'll be there to protect you. No one will ever hurt you again as long as Shelby Winn has something to say about it."
>you sniff
>how did she do it?
>how can you trust her?
>why would you believe her?
>she's still an animal
>but she's still right too
"I think..."
>your voice is thin and trembling, and you pause to swallow and start over
"I think I have to. I don't want her to do what she did ever again."
>Shelby embraces you again
>this time she shudders
>and sniffs
>is she crying again?
>did you do something wrong?
>”Anon. How did I get so lucky to have a husband as brave and wonderful as you?”
>she keeps calling you brave
>you don’t feel it
>the thought of seeing that inspector again makes your heart thump like it’s trying to break out of your chest
>she squeezes you
>”Mmf. I could hold you forever. Your skin is so smooth and warm.”
>her pawpads trace little circles over your back
>at least she feels the same way you do about her fur
>”But maybe not here, water’s getting cold!”
>Shelby’s right about that
>it’s gone from lukewarm to chilly, and only getting worse
>Shelby releases you
>but she’s so reluctant she runs her paws over you the entire way
>then reaches past you to shut off the water
>you shiver
>Shelby goes first, and you follow her out, gratefully accepting the fluffy towel she passes you
>”I’m jealous of your skin too. So much easy to clean and dry.”
>looks like she’s right about that
>she’s vigorously scrubbing herself with her own towel
>you’re done and dry much quicker than she is and you wait patiently
>and steal a few glances at her figure whenever you think she won’t notice
>damn it
>”Hey Anon.”
>she pulls the towel off her head, half-dry fur sticking out in clumps
>”Would you mind helping me with my fur again?”
>she smiles sheepishly, like you wouldn’t jump at the chance
“Of course Shelby. What can I do?”
>she holds up a finger, then turns and bends over to fish for something from the cabinet under the sink
>deep breaths, Anon
>don’t stare so hard
>she comes back up with what she was looking for
>a hair-dryer, this one a little bigger than average, with a wide mouth
>”Here! Could you do my back and tail?”
>you nod, and accept the appliance while she plugs it in
>”Okay! Go ahead.”
>she turns away from you, but smiles at you through her reflection in the mirror
>you flick it on, giving it a second to get hot before you start
>you direct the flow of hot air over the fur on her back
>but you only just start when Shelby interrupts you
>”Here, could you just ruffle the fur a bit as you go? It makes it dry faster.”
>you look up at her
>no hint of mischief in her smile
>or hunger in her eyes
>so you take her at her word, continuing your work
>dryer in one hand, her fur under the other
>you work slowly, rubbing over a small spot over and over again to make sure it’s completely dry
>and a bit more to admire how immensely fluffy that fur is once you’re done
>Shelby’s muscles twitch under your massaging fingers
>her tail flicks against your bare legs as you work your way over her shoulders
>she has to know you’re enjoying this just almost much as she is
“Shelby…”
>but you can’t just enjoy this
>you’d like to, but you’ve just committed to confronting the inspector
>no ignoring it to focus on Shelby’s fur
>her soft fur
>you move on to the next patch and work to finish your thought
“Shelby, how is it going to work? Reporting…her?”
>Shelby lets out a long sigh, half pleasured by your slow-going massage, half in anticipation of an unpleasant subject
>”Well normally you’d contact an OHA office, and you’d see an inspector. But I can take this right to chief inspector Ainsley. I’ll pull the report from your apprehension tomorrow at work, and then we can go to her together once I’ve finished my leave.”
>you nod slowly, and focus on the sensation of her fur under your fingers
>"They'll assign a special inspector to investigate. She'll want to interview you, inspect your injuries, and go over the entire incident."
>relive the whole thing
>with another inspector you can't trust
>you shudder
>Shelby picks up on your discomfort
>"I'll be with you the entire time. As my husband, they can't separate you from me without my consent."
>she gives you a reassuring smile through the mirror
>it kind of works
>knowing she'll be there will make it better
>they'd respect her wishes regarding what happens to you
>the memory of Allie calling you her property rises to the forefront of your mind
>Shelby might not see it that way, but does the state?
>should have paid more attention when they taught civics
"Alright. And then what?"
>you're spending more time enjoying Shelby's fur than actually drying it, but you still make slow progress down her back
>she slowly poofs out with your work
>down to her lower back
>"Mmh, that's the spot..."
>she coos in pleasure
>you're doing too good a job
>"Oh! Uh, I mean, after the special investigation, the case will be presented to the magister. Then she can determine guilt and punishment."
>a magister?
>all you got was a disinterested rabbit punching your crimes into a computer
>but this is a special case, Shelby says
>she'd know better than you
"And what's the punishment?"
>you're getting closer to Shelby's tail
>and more
>splitting your attention like this isn't going to do you any favors
>"For everything we could get her convicted on? Suspension or even revocation of husband rights, termination of her position. If I can convince them she endangered a human life, she'd face time in a detainment center."
>detainment center
>that sounds harsh
>you let yourself smile at the thought of inflicting revenge on the woman who hurt you
>but the satisfaction doesn't last
>it probably won't even get that far
>you're just trying because it's the right thing to do
>on the miniscule chance it might protect someone else from that inspector
>it's going to be a long couple of weeks coming up
>you can feel it
>at least you have Shelby's fur right now
>you're working on her tail
>which she only barely keeps from wagging in your hands
>"Whatever happens, I'll be there with you to keep you safe.”
>she's looking at you through the mirror again
>the smolder is lost in the slightly steamed glass, but you're sure it's there
>and you smile thinly at her as you finish with her tail and release it
>she really does mean it
>Shelby loves you
>and she'll do everything in her power to keep that promise
"I know Shelby. You'll protect me."
>those weren't the exact three words
>but they must have had the same effect
>Shelby turns about slowly, trembling slightly
>there's that fire in her eye
>but you aren't afraid of it this time
>so you step forward and pull her into a hug
>she gasps
>you nuzzle into the still-damp puff of fur on her chest
"Thank you Shelby. For everything. I feel safer with you now than I think I ever have."
>fuck
>you mean what you say too, just like Shelby did
>Shelby still trembles when you let her go, eyes watery and nose sniffling
"Would you like me to get the the rest of your fur?"
>she blinks, the sideways question catching her off guard
>then she laughs and grins wide
>"That would be amazing, Anon. Thank you."
>just like she took care of you in the shower, you take care of her now
>starting with her head, ruffling through her mane and feeling her ears twitch under your touch
>down her shoulders and arms, massaging her toned muscles as you work
>over her chest, first her fluff
>then a torrent of giggles as you blush and avert your eyes massaging her breasts
>"We're still married, Anon."
>you manage to recover while working down her abdomen
>and then
>legs
>glorious, shapely, and oh so long
>you drop to your knees in front of her without thinking
>but when you realize the position you've put yourself in and glance up at her, she just nods
>"You're okay. Keep going."
>you're okay
>you keep going
>one thigh, then the other
>you can feel, she's flexing them for you
>just to show off a little more
>her calves and ankles, equally luxurious
>and finally you finish on her footpaws
>raising more laughter from her
>"Easy! Easy! I'm ticklish!"
>you've put the hair dryer and your hand over just about every inch of Shelby's fur
>you hope your skin never forgets the feel of it
>Shelby offers you her paw to help you stand again
>then uses it to pull you into a kiss
>tender, close, and so warm
>her other paw holding your cheek
>"Mmh. You taste so sweet, pup..."
>she still holds your hand as she guides you back to the bedroom
>flicks the light on
>and throws open the covers
>so you can both stare at the prominent wet spot right in the middle where you two had lain
>right
>what a mess
>Shelby glances at you
>"Couch?"
>you nod
"Couch."
>she lets you go, so she can collect a spare blanket from the closet
>"Grab the alarm clock. I'm going to need it in the morning."
>with everything you need, you and Shelby move to the living room
>the couch is just too narrow for you both to fit on it comfortably
>so Shelby has another idea
>"Here, you can lay on top of me."
>with her direction and a little clambering, you manage to find your spot, with the blanket draped over you both
>her arm around your body
>your head nestled against her chest
>fur against skin
>husband and wife
>"Right where my pup belongs..."
>the sun is shining bright and warm
>you’re back in the park with Shelby, dressed in your winter wear with the scarf wrapped around you
>except it’s springtime, the plants bright green and blossoming
>you’re seated in her lap as she holds you tight
>she whispers in your ear, ‘good pup’ over and over again
>but there’s a cold blast of wind
>it cuts through you
>and the warmth of Shelby’s body disappears
>you’re thrust forward, face down against the ground
>pinned by the inspector who is frozen with her jaws on your shoulder, about to clamp down
>Shelby is in front of you now
>she leans down over you, holding your face in her paws as you struggle to escape
>”I promise, she’s one of the good ones.”
>you try to reach out for her, but she fades away, leaving you alone with the inspector
>who laughs as she bites down hard
>you thrash
>”I have you, Anon. Just breathe for me.”
>the inspector murmurs in your ear, even as her teeth dig into tender flesh
>make it stop!
>but it doesn’t stop
>it goes on
>on one side, Shelby’s voice tickles your ear, reassuring you that you’re safe
>and on the other, the inspector bites down and snarls at you
>it’s never going to stop
>unless you do something about it
>you struggle, shifting your weight to try and throw off the inspector
>but she resists, leaning down on your back and keeping you pinned
>until with a final effort, you wrench free!
>you turn over onto your back to find yourself falling away
>the world slips away to black and you drop
>actually drop
>you’re startled awake by the sensation of falling, as you’ve rolled out from on top of Shelby and start to slide off the side of the couch
>but Shelby reacts in her sleep
>her arms snap around you, and she turns to pull you against her once again
>you’re left on your side, teetering on the edge of the couch, the only thing keeping you from falling off is Shelby’s embrace
>she grumbles, words unintelligible while she tries to pull you even closer
>then her snout pokes into your hair and she takes a deep breath
>Shelby sighs contentedly and settles down again
>falling back into deep sleep without ever really fully waking
>leaving you alone with your thoughts
>the fear and pain of your dream still clings to the edge of your mind like a fog that refuses to clear
>so you nuzzle your face into the crook of her neck and take a deep breath, trying to drive it away with the warmth of her body and the softness of her fur
>it was one thing to hold onto her while you were both in your pajamas
>it’s another sensation entirely to be pressed against her nude form
>wrapped up in her arms, legs tangled together, skin against fur
>you were exhausted last night, too much to really enjoy this
>but now you have a little time
>no need to move, no need to provoke her
>just relax in her arms until you can fall back to hopefully calmer sleep
>BZZZT! BZZZT! BZZZT!
>and there’s the alarm
>of course
>Shelby stirs again
>she releases you to fumble for the snooze button
>forcing you to hold onto her to keep from falling again
>once she’s silenced the alarm, Shelby rests a paw on your head
>more like she lets it drop on the side of your head so she can sleepily ruffle your hair
>”Mm. My ‘non. Love you.”
>she kisses the top of your head
>her Anon
>hearing her call you that makes you feel strange
>there's a wash of warmth from her affection, but still a strange tugging in your gut
>you were fine with being called 'her pup' last night
>but she was in a far different mood then
>so were you
>hell with it
>you can worry about it when the alarm goes off again
>another few sweet minutes of cuddling with Shelby
>lazily running your hand over her fur while she continues petting your head
>breathing her scent deep, tucked against her chest
>and her legs that slide over yours, tickling you in more ways than one
>if only this was all that marriage was
>you doze in Shelby's arms until the buzz of the alarm rouses you both
>Shelby sighs and stretches
>yawning in your ear as she does so
>you mimic her, letting your stretch roll you over so you can slip out of her loosened embrace and sit up on the edge of the couch
>Shelby isn't far behind you, slapping the clock one more time to silence it before sitting up alongside you
>"Morning Anon. Sleep okay?"
>you shake your head
"Bad dreams again."
>"Aw. I'm sorry dear. I guess after last night..."
>she trails off
>"A lot happened last night. Are you still okay?"
>you glance up at her
>and her glowing eyes
>it was a long night, and you're sure it won't be the last like it
>but right now you're alive, you're safe with Shelby, and the nightmare is far off
>you sigh and lean into her side
"A lot happened, yeah. More than I was ready for."
>there's a lot you want to say
>about the bite and the inspector you'll have to confront
>or how Shelby used you to satisfy herself and how it might go in the future
>and her thighs
>you could say a lot of good things about her thighs
>but you decide to keep it simple
"Whatever happens next time we have sex, no teeth. Promise me that and I'm okay."
>Shelby whines
>clearly not happy to remember how she terrified you
>"Never. I swear on the State and by our marriage."
>her voice is steely with conviction
>that's a hell of a promise for Shelby to make
>swearing on the state itself
>you take that as pure truth
>she's is a believer
>but swearing by your marriage too?
>the meaning is clear to you
>if she breaks her promise, the marriage ends
>you nod slowly in silent acceptance of her promise
>Shelby releases a breath held in obvious anticipation
>"Thank g–goodness."
>an odd little stutter
>but then she suppresses a giggle
>"Although, we didn't really have sex. You'll have to go a little deeper between my thighs for that."
>you blink
>and your face lights up in a blush
>good thing it's still too dark for Shelby to see it
>you hope
>you clear your throat, acutely aware of your and Shelby's nudity again
>and the way her legs are pressed up against yours
"Don't we ah, have to get you ready for work?"
>Shelby groans in theatric disappointment
>"I suppose I have to get ready. You could go right back to sleep if you like."
>she leans over and kisses your cheek, then stands with a swish of the tail
>"But I would never turn down your help getting my fur brushed."
>how could you go back to sleep after an offer like that?
>the light in the hall turns on as Shelby passes the light switch
>letting you watch as she saunters down the hallway to her bedroom
>that's a lot of fur
>you hop off the couch to follow after her
>but pause in the hallway to consider that this too is another major change in your attitude toward Shelby
>from stealing glances at her legs under her sundress
>to staring unabashed at her toned posterior as her tail wags
>you wonder
>would you feel this way if you were assigned to some other anthro?
>no
>Shelby's different
>and not just because she has such amazing legs
>because she's so kind, because she's so patient, because she cares more than you ever thought an anthro could care
>the legs are a nice bonus too
>Shelby's waiting with brush in hand when you step into the bedroom
>you take it without a word, and get to work brushing her fur when she turns about
>it's hard not to stray from the essentials of just her head and tail
>Shelby would probably let you brush her for hours
>but you don't want to make her late for work
>you both relish the short session all the same
>"Gosh! Your fingers are like nothing else, Anon. I feel like a brand new dog every time."
>you smile warmly as you pass back the brush
"I'll get started on breakfast."
>she nods and trots over to the closet
>"I'll have to eat quick and run to the office to change into a spare uniform."
>that's right
>the one she wore home is no shape for duty
>at least you won't have to see her wear it this morning
>you collect your pajama pants from where you left them on the bed last night
>and try to ignore the quiet huff of disappointment from the other side of the room when you slip them on
>guess it's no surprise Shelby would have eyes for you like you had for her
>in fact, you can't help but spend a few seconds in the doorway watching Shelby change
>until she catches on and turns about with her arms crossed
>the gesture pushes her still bare breasts up and together
>the subtle pink of her nipples mostly covered by shaggy fur
>"You keep staring and I'll have to call in sick to work."
>hint taken, you scurry from the bedroom and to the kitchen
>you flick the lights on and prepare something quick
>when Shelby comes out, wearing simple grey sweatpants a sweater, you have a bowl of oatmeal with blackberries sprinkled in it ready and waiting
>"You're the best, Anon."
>she leans over the table to eat, savoring the first bite slowly, before shoveling the rest down her insatiable gullet with more gusto than grace
>"Sorry! I saw the time and I don't wanna be late."
>she takes her bowl with her to join you in the kitchen, setting it down in the sink and approaching you
>"See you tonight! I have some errands to run after work, but I should still be home a little early."
>she beams
>"Then we can get back to enjoying my leave time! I'm excited just thinking about it!"
>she puts her arms over your shoulders, and leans down to rest her muzzle on your shoulder in a hug
>"I haven't forgotten our talk last night."
>you stiffen
>and remind yourself that if she was going to be upset with you, she surely would have been so already
>you have to remember to trust Shelby
>"I'll be working to protect humans like you. Keeping them safe, just like I'll keep you safe when we deal with the one who hurt you. Okay?"
"Okay."
>you respond dully
>Shelby smiles and pulls her head back
>"I love you, Anon."
>she kisses your cheek and releases you from the hug
"See you tonight, Shelby."
>you wave goodbye to Shelby and she returns the gesture from the doorway
>then she disappears through it
>you let out a resigned sigh when you hear it lock
>another quiet day
>at least Shelby will be home early
>you turn to your own bowl of oatmeal, you've only taken a couple bites of it
>so you finish up at a leisurely pace
>it's pretty good, simple but filling
>and the cleanup is easy as well
>just the two bowls and the pot
>and once they're set out to dry, you trail around the apartment switching off the lights so you can go back to sleep
>you stop at the bathroom, collecting up the clothes that were left there last night
>shirt, nightgown, underwear
>after last night, you find it funny that you were so put-off handling Shelby's panties while cleaning the bedroom the other day
>but when you get to the bedroom, you can't find your boxers from where you left them under the sheets
>you don't find them under the bed either
>but you do spot a small box of some sort over on Shelby’s side
>your curiosity is piqued, but going through Shelby’s things while she’s away seems like a bad idea
>you shrug off the thought and give up your search for the missing boxers
>Shelby must have already put them away
>you take what you have and drop them all in the laundry basket inside the closet
>no boxers there either
>but right on top of the pile is Shelby's uniform
>you ignore it
>and note that along with the sheets, the laundry basket is pretty full
>have to go to the laundromat
>you almost want to go by yourself during the day, just so you'd have something to do
>but you don't have any spare change
>or any money at all
>the state stipend went away once your assignment came up
>though you're sure if you asked, Shelby would give you all the money she has
>she certainly seems to make more than enough, working for the state
>you never really had a grasp on how much money someone ought to earn
>not the place of a human to deal with those sort of things, you were taught
>you flick off the light and wander back to the living room
>hopefully you'll get used to early mornings soon, because it's starting to take a toll on you
>how does Shelby do it?
>you flop back onto the couch and roll yourself up in the blanket
>it's a little cold without her near
>but you're tired enough to pass out in minutes
>you’re woken up far earlier than you’d like to be
>by the sound of knocking on the apartment door
>a glance at the alarm clock left on the couch’s armrest tells you that there’s still about an hour before you usually wake up
>the sky is only just starting to brighten with the sunrise
>you sigh and roll over again, shutting your eyes
>but then the knock comes again
>and you’re sure you know who it is
>that surety is confirmed by the bubbly voice of your upstairs neighbor sounding through the door
>”Hello? Shelby? Is anybody home?”
>Allie the sheep
>you pick your head up and stare daggers down the hallway at the front door
>she knocks again
>what could she possibly want?
>does she not have her own work she has to go to?
>you roll off the couch and stand, stretching and yawning
>padding over to the door at a lazy pace, you call through it
“Shelby isn’t home right now, Allie. She goes to work early.”
>she isn’t here to talk to Shelby
>you know that
>”Well good morning! I guess I should know that by now, but I thought I might get lucky and she’d have a day off.”
>get to the point
>she must want something from you
>”Anyways, I just wanted to stop over and try and say hi before I leave for work myself. It was nice seeing you the other day. Would you like to come out and chat?”
>no chance
“I don’t think Shelby would like that.”
>even if Shelby’s not here, the hanging threat of shears and sweaters should be enough to chase Allie away, right?
>”Oh. No, I guess not. I wouldn’t want to upset her again. Get between an inspector and her…husband.”
>you frown as Allie continues on
>”I really am sorry about that. I was trying to be friendly is all. Shelby can just be a little scary sometimes. Er, please don’t tell her I said that.”
>she bleats nervously and her voice attenuates like she’s getting further away from the door
>you frown
>even though you’ve been afraid of Shelby plenty, it’s not right for Allie to say that about her
>she doesn’t even know Shelby
“What do you want, Allie?”
>”Just to talk! That’s all. And uh, to get back that oven dish from the quiche if you’re done with it.”
>can you trust her?
>definitely not
>she's an anthro you don't know
>Shelby said she'd deal with her, but she keeps coming around
"I'll go get the dish."
>you hear Allie's quiet 'thank you' as you make your way to the kitchen to collect the pastry dish
>on your way back, you belatedly realize you're still clad in only your pants
>you run over to the couch to grab the blanket and wrap yourself up in it
>that should do
>Allie is waiting there when you crack the door wide enough to fit the dish outside
>her attire is much more businesslike, a plain skirt and a dull blouse
>the colors aren't very flattering
>she gives you a smile when she accepts the dish
>it's not a fake smile, like last time you saw her
>this one is small, with an edge of nervousness to it
>"Thanks! Did you enjoy it?"
>you shut the door a little more
>but you don't close it on her just yet
"Yes. We both liked it."
>the sheep sighs, bleating in relief
>"That's good! I haven't tried baking in a long time."
>she brightens considerably to hear your praise
>"But now I have the excuse to do a little more! Maybe next time I could bring you something sweet? If Shelby wouldn't mind, that is."
>Allie had slowly been inching closer to the doorway, but her own mention of Shelby's name seems to stall her
>remind her that she's talking to a married man
>Allie clears her throat, ears flopping
>"Well, I wouldn't want to cause trouble. I’ll have to try to talk to you both next time she’s around.”
>that would make things easier
"She should be back on leave tomorrow. I could let her know you wanted to stop by."
>Allie clasps her hands together under the dish and picks her head back up
>"I'd really appreciate that, Anon! It'd be nice to get to know you. Both of you. Gosh, I haven't spent time with a boy since..."
>Allie cocks her head to the side, reminiscing
>she really is just interested in you, isn’t she?
>"...since I was still in school! It's been ages."
>you were going to try to close the conversation, hoping she was satisfied
>but now Allie's caught your curiosity
>she knew a human growing up?
>what was it like?
>you hadn't considered what life would be like for boys who didn't grow up in a state home
"You knew a human in your school?"
>what's the harm in one question?
>"Hm? Oh, no! He lived on my block growing up. All the boys went to their own school. Didn't you?"
>you freeze up, not sure how much about yourself you should tell Allie
>but she goes on talking now that she has an opening
>"You were probably homeschooled, right? I hear some families out in the agricultural counties still do that, even after the State outlawed it. Anyways, Francis was his name!"
>she's on a roll now
>almost like she's talking to herself more than she's talking to you
>"He'd run around with me and some of the other girls in the neighborhood. We were all sweet on him. But I was his favorite. We were next door neighbors, and best friends! Then we got older..."
>Allie sighs wistfully
>he chose to be with anthros?
>from the sound of it, he was friends with a bunch of them
>you go on listening, eager to hear about this kind of life you had no real frame of reference for
>there's no stopping Allie
>you think if you don't stop her, she'll keep going on forever
>"Started spending time together, all on our own. I thought we were going to get married all on our own, like in those films they show during health class. If it wasn't for that damn inspector..."
>Allie freezes
>she stares at you, hands clamped over her mouth
>you stare back
>not sure how to proceed
>an inspector hurt her too
>you know how that feels, but what should you say?
>how would she expect you to respond?
>you open your mouth to speak, but she bleats and stumbles back as though you were Shelby herself barking at her
>"I'm sorry! I didn't mean that. Please don't tell Inspector Winn!"
>you open the door wider, taking half a step out of it to hold out a placating hand
"Wait, what did you--"
>she doesn't let you finish, instead bleating in terror and fleeing down the stairs
>"I'm sorry!"
>the clattering of her hooves against the steps is the only response you get to a call for her to come back
>you hear the door to the apartment building swing open then slam shut, leaving you alone in the doorway
>in the quiet and chill of the stairwell, you wrestle with your thoughts
>you feel bad for the sheep, a twang of empathy for whatever trouble that unknown inspector made for her
>at the same time, you still don't trust her original intentions for coming to speak with you
>should you tell Shelby all about what happened?
>the thought of keeping a secret from her upsets you
>both for fear of consequences from her, and for the worry that it might hurt her feelings if you lied to her
>but Allie asked you not to tell
>when does speaking with your wife become informing to a state inspector?
>would she arrest Allie for slandering the state?
>will she finally make you that sweater she promised you?
>an involuntary giggle escapes you as you retreat back inside and return to the couch
>such a dumb thought
>but the amusement doesn't last
>just when you felt safe with Shelby, like you could trust her with your secrets, you're shackled with someone else's
>did Shelby let you say what you said because you're her husband?
>she already doesn't like Allie
>and Allie isn't a human like you
>like Shelby always talks about trying to protect
>you throw yourself down on the couch, desperate to return to sleep and escape from another bout of gut-twisting indecision
>will it ever end?
>probably not
>you comfort yourself with the idea that it won't come up at all
>that you won't have to lie to Shelby about Allie because you won't have to talk to her about Allie
>it's a lie
>she'll smell Allie all over the apartment door and stairwell
>but a comforting enough lie to put you to sleep for another couple hours of needed sleep
>when you wake for a third time, you doze
>enjoying the in-between of wakefulness and sleep that leaves you ignorant of anything but the warmth of the blankets and the softness of couch
>you can't enjoy it forever
>eventually your thoughts go back to the early-morning meeting with the neighbor
>and you're forced to sit up and face the day fully
>a day that crawls by
>you go through the motions
>listen to Shelby's music
>read Shelby's books
>clean what you can of Shelby's apartment
>still need to go to the laundromat
>and all the while you're left with your thoughts
>all the thinking that Shelby will see in your expression the moment she gets home
>even though she's home early, it feels like you were waiting forever for her
>you greet her from the couch in the living room
>it's a relief to see she left her spare uniform at work, and is once again clad in the plain gray sweatpants and sweater she left home in
>"Anon!"
>she's in high spirits, which you do your best to match as she bounds into the living room
>"You'll never guess what I picked up today."
>she holds out her paw to you, and you go to take it automatically
>you think you could make a guess or two
>but right now you'd feel better playing her game than talk about your day
>"I'll give you a hint!"
>she squeezes your hand, then turns her paw over to interlace fingers
>you feel something
>hard and cold and small
>you look down, and see on her finger a silver band, identical to the one left on its place on the dresser
>Shelby wags her tail merrily
>”I put in a rush order! It’s perfect!”
>she takes her paw back to pull the ring off and hand it to you
>”Here, it has the inscription.”
>you hold her paw in both hands to draw the ring off her finger
>holding it up to the light, it has an inscription to match your own
>’Anon Winn’
>etched into the inside of the ring
>your name
>your new name
>it still feels weird having a new name.
>but that’s just how things are, you know
>even when people got married Before, you knew they changed names
>still, you're going to miss being 'Anon Nemo'
>it was a good name
>Shelby leans in and admires the ring, pupils wide
>"It's such a perfect little thing. We'll always be together when we're wearing them. Do you..."
>she glances at you
>"...want to go get yours?"
>you would, if she had done it yesterday
>if you weren’t keeping a secret from her now
>Shelby’s ears fold downward as she catches your ‘thinking’ expression
>you see her eyes flick to your right side and back
>”It's alright. I understand if it’s not a good time yet.”
>she tries to make an understanding smile, but you can hear the disappointment in her voice
>you shake your head
“No, it's not that. Just something that happened today.”
>her ears perk again, and she cocks her head
>"Something happened?"
>her nose twitches
>"Was it Allie?"
>no use hiding it
"Yeah. She stopped by today."
>Shelby bares her teeth and you blanch
>she turns to stare venomously down the hall at the front door
>"I guess I'll have to go talk to her tonight."
>her voice is a rumble on the edge of a growl
>you want to shrink away and let Allie suffer the brunt of Shelby's anger
>to save yourself the trouble and fear
"Shelby."
>with a sharp intake of breath, she turns back to you, her growl going silent
>"Oh! I'm sorry Anon! I didn't mean to scare you."
>if you're scared of Shelby's growl, Allie must be terrified of an inspector's threats
"It's okay Shelby. Allie wasn't trouble. We just talked."
>"Just talked? Really?"
>really, all you and Allie did was talk
>so you're not lying yet
"Just talked. I think she just hasn't spoken to a human in a long time."
>Shelby's eyebrows furrow
>so you hastily continue
>"But I told her she should come around when you were here. She took the dish for the quiche back and said next time she'll bring desserts."
>Shelby stares you down for a couple seconds, and you fight the urge to squirm
>it's not lying, but omitting the whole truth still makes your guts twist
>then she smiles and wags her tail
>"Quiche! That's the name of it. Well, as long as she didn't say anything bad about you, then she can bring desserts. When I'm around."
>you nod quickly, eager to get off the subject now that the danger has mostly passed
"When you're around. I told her you’d be off the next couple days, so she may visit. If she isn't too scared of being shorn."
>Shelby laughs, tail wagging harder
>"I'll be on my best behavior. No shearing sheep."
>your smile feels a little more genuine as you turn your attention back to the ring
>you trust Shelby not to hurt you, surely she wouldn't hurt Allie just for a slip of the tongue
>right?
>Shelby stands straight
>"That reminds me! I picked something else up today, but I was so excited to show you the ring I left it behind! Hold onto that while I go grab it, okay?"
>she leaves the ring with you as she runs off down the hall and out the door
>you hear the thump of her paws as she rushes down the stairs and then she's gone again
>you look over the ring again
>'Anon Winn'
>a rush order
>must have been expensive
>how much money has she spent on you?
>a small fortune in gifts and food
>Shelby's trying so hard to make you feel happy, comfortable, and safe
>for the most part
>you still feel bad for keeping secrets from her
>you turn the ring over so you can't see your name on it anymore
>not ready to wears yours now
>thanks to Allie
>laying her issues on you like you didn't have enough problems
>you try to be angry about it, but you can't hold onto that momentary flare of heated resentment
>Allie's not an abusive caretaker, or a cruel inspector, or an uncaring officer
>just a lonely sheep that's as scared of inspectors as you are
>maybe she talks too much
>but you get the feeling she's not likely to hurt you
>maybe you'll tell Shelby the truth after you both get a chance to know Allie better
>you're not lying to your wife
>just waiting for the right time to tell the truth
>a reasonable excuse to ignore that problem for now
>and focus on whatever it is that Shelby's brought back from the car
>she has a polyester case in her paws, a little smaller than a briefcase and all black
>"Here, take a look and tell me if it's missing anything!"
>you trade her, ring for case, and examine the package more closely
>one side is labeled simply: 'human grooming kit'
>you unzip it to find an assortment of grooming tools
>a long set of scissors, combs in different sizes, an electric shaving razor with a myriad of different detachable heads, electric clippers with different sized guards, and a small bottle of 'For Humans' shampoo
>all you'd need to keep a human from getting too shaggy
>you look up to Shelby
>she's admiring the ring she’s placed on her finger again with lidded eyes and a dreamy smile
>which she snaps out of when she notices you staring up at her
>her grin turns sheepish, and she drops her hand to focus
>"Sorry, ring. So! Ready for your first grooming?"
>you hadn't had a chance to shave since you were assigned, and had let your hair grow out after you were apprehended
>so you nod, then snicker a bit when a thought strikes you
"I am, but are you? Have you ever cut a human's hair before?"
>Shelby's smile turns to a thoughtful frown
>"Well no, but how hard can it be?"
>you laugh more, to Shelby's vexation
"Worst case scenario, we can just shave it."
>she gasps as though you told her you wanted to cut off your hand
>"Shave it? All the way to the skin?"
>you give a nonchalant nod in response
"Sure. That's what I did when I was out of the home. Any time I tried something different I came out looking like a doofus, and it was cheaper than going to the groomer."
>Shelby huffs through her nose and folds the grooming kit under her arm
>she's not quite looking you in the eye, a conflicted frown on her downturned muzzle
>but then she shakes her head and giggles
>"You think I'll make you look like a doofus, huh?"
>you never said that, but Shelby has her usual sunshine smile back, so you're not worried
>"We'll just see. The groomer gave me some tips when I bought the case."
>she turns aside and gestures for you to stand
>and hurries you along down the hall
>"First things first, we'll wash your hair. Come on."
>she swings open the door to the bathroom, ushering you inside
"What, right now?"
>you find yourself going along with her direction despite questioning her
>it's not like she's barking orders, you're sure if you told her no she'd listen
>you don't mind it
>Shelby drops the kit next to the sink
>"Sure! I was looking forward to this all day, something we can both enjoy. Now, I could leave you to shower on your own..."
>Shelby's smile widens
>"...or I stay and wash your hair for you."
>now there's a choice
>if you let her join you, the shower you run the risk of riling her up again
>and it may turn into much more than just a shower
>Shelby watches you weigh your options while her tail twitches in anticipation
>you know the answer she wants
"Alright. You can wash my hair. But if I think you're going too far, I'll switch the water to ice cold."
>you try to laugh, but it comes out forced
>Shelby gives you a reassuring nod with tail-wagging at full force
>"No going too far. I'll keep my paws above the belt line."
>she laughs softly
"Thank you Shelby."
>she nods, and starts pulling things out of the grooming kit
>”Of course, Anon. Now hurry up, get in there and get the water going.”
>following her directions, you start kick out of the pajama pants you’d been wearing all day
>you find yourself feeling more naked when Shelby’s still wearing her clothes
“Aren’t you going to join me?”
>Shelby shakes her head
>”Nope, just a quick wash before your trim. I don’t want to wait for my fur to get all dry before handling electric clippers.”
>you understand her logic, but your disappointment must show
>because your collie wife quirks an eyebrow
>but she doesn't comment on your apparent eagerness to watch her undress
>and you fear arguing the point may derail things
>so you kick aside your pants and step into the shower
>the water only takes a moment to get warm
>you try not to feel so vulnerable under Shelby's as you let the water flow over your head, making sure your hair is soaked through
>you take a deep breath and remind yourself that she promised to stay in control
>plus she never minded when you looked at her in states of undress
>"Alright, that looks good! Here, sit on the edge of the tub for me please."
>you turn your back on Shelby and sit where she directed you
>the stream of the shower continues to flow over your legs
>you feel her step in close behind you, then a click, and something cold pouring over your head
>"Okay, the instructions say to scrub vigorously..."
>her paws go on your head, and work the shampoo into your hair
>at first she works clinically, making sure to get the top, sides, and back
>then she slows down, running her paw pads over your scalp in massaging circles
"Damn..."
>you sigh out the word
>like when she massaged your back and shoulders last night, Shelby seems to have an intuitive ability with her paws
>you shut your eyes and relax
>as the sensation of her nails dragging through your hair sends a shiver down your spine
>Shelby hums a tune you recognize from one of her albums while she works
>"How's that feel?"
>does she even need to ask?
"Amazing."
>Shelby keeps up the massage for a few more minutes, leaving your head swimming in the swirling mist of the shower
>”There we are, Anon. All clean.”
>you go to stand again, but Shelby moves a paw to your shoulder
>the one without the scar
>on the other, you feel the bare trace of fur brushing against tender skin
>she doesn’t speak, but whines as she holds you there for a couple tense seconds
“Shelby…”
>just as you are about to question her, she releases you and you feel her lean around you
>”Just let me rinse my paws first, then you go ahead and rinse off too, okay?”
>she’s still upset over the scar, of course
>but now's not the time
>you nod your head, waiting until you felt her move away before finally standing back under the flowing water
>you work the lather out of your hair with your hands
>maybe you could get another massage out of Shelby once you're done with the grooming
>you realize
>once you're done, you have the whole rest of the day together
>time enough to talk with her about almost every subject you'd put off
>but hopefully not about Allie's slanderous speech, that for all your rationalizing still leaves a sinking feeling in your stomach
>you think of a different place to start as you step out of the stream of water and into the towel Shelby has waiting for you
>"Okay, towel off real quick and I'll go grab a chair from the kitchen."
>Shelby leaves the bathroom door open when she goes, letting out the thick steam from the shower
>and letting in a chill breeze that makes you shiver
>she's lucky to have all that fur sometimes
>you throw the towel over your head and start to rub your hair dry
>Shelby's back in just a few seconds, and sets the chair in front of the sink and facing the mirror
>"Ready to go!"
>she gives you a thumbs up, then starts pulling out the scissors and clippers from the kit
>with your towel tossed over the hardwood chair, you sit down and await your grooming
>Shelby smiles down at you, then steps around behind you with clippers in paw
>"You ready, Anon?"
>you nod, watching her movements through the mirror
>"Great! Now, if you come out looking like a doofus, I'll take you to the groomer next time."
>you laugh
>you think you prefer Shelby to do it anyways, even if your hair will have to be shaved down after
"Just be careful with the scissors. I cut my ear one time and it bled forever."
>Shelby frowns at the mention of your old injury, and fiddles with the guard on the head of the clippers
>then she rests a paw on your head and sets to work
>working slowly and carefully, she starts to buzz down your hair to a more manageable length
>as she's working, you catch her eye in the reflection
"Hey, you mind if we talk a bit?"
>she pauses, clippers buzzing in the air as she considers your words
>then she goes back to work
>"Of course. You can always talk to me, Anon."
>you suppress the instinct to nod your head
>don't want to mess up your hair
"Alright. Think we could continue our talk from yesterday? About that boy?"
>Shelby pauses again
>"I did say I'd answer your questions."
>bzzt!
>a lock of your hair longer than the others she's cut free so far tumbles to the floor
>"...damn it."
>maybe you picked a bad time
"So what happened to him? After you found him?"
>Shelby steps around you
>her focus remains on your grooming now, and she answers without meeting your eyes again
>"We brought him back to the OHA office. He was scared, of course, so I did my best to comfort him. Then we contacted his family to take him home."
>his family
>of course
>he wasn't raised in a state home like you were, so he probably parents and maybe even siblings hoping for his return
>"Her mother was so relieved to see him safe. Poor thing was in tears."
>lucky boy, you think
>luckier than some
"So he was scared. Terrified. Then his parents arrived to take care of him."
>bzzt!
>another lock goes
>another muttered curse from Shelby
>you're going to look lopsided
>you try to remain still as she works
>but you need to take a deep breath to ready yourself for your next question
"So what if he's scared of anthros now?"
>Shelby stops cutting your hair now
>you push forward with your questioning
"He was kidnapped. I don't know what might have happened to him, but it can't have been good. What if he starts hating anthros?"
>you hate to see the pained look on Shelby's face
>her ears drooping and her teeth showing in a grimace
>so you decide to reel back your rhetoric
"I'm just thinking, what if he ends up like me? Scared. And he tries to run, or gets in trouble. He'll have to be assigned too, when he grows up."
>Shelby goes back to work with a hum
>"I see what you mean, Anon. It's an awful thing that happened to him, yes. And the idea he might have been traumatized is distressing. An anthro hurt him very much, so he probably will be scared of them in the future."
>she steps to your front now, sliding her paw under your chin so you can look up at her
>"But it was anthro officers who rescued him. He went home with his anthro mother--and human father--who will comfort him. And if they like, they could take him to an Office of Health and Wellness center for counseling."
>you stare
>counseling?
>you never had counseling
>not in the home, not when you were on your own, and definitely not when they caught you
>"And yes, one day he may be assigned to an anthro wife, or maybe find one on his own, who will love him despite his fears. Like I love you."
>fuck
>how could she pull that on you?
>surely that's more of her naivety
>not every anthro is going to be patient, understanding, caring like her
>Shelby's special
"Except what if she doesn't? What if she's cruel, or doesn't respect his fear you respected mine? I hear the stories, what some anthros get away with doing to their husbands."
>you find it exasperating when Shelby shrugs in response
>"I don't know what might happen, Anon. I hope he'll be ready when the time comes."
>her hand goes to your uninjured shoulder again
>"You know I believe in my work. Do you think I'd let a human be abused if I knew about it?"
>you'd shake your head if you didn't think it would give you another uneven patch of shorn hair
"No."
>Shelby nods
>"And do you trust me when I say there are other anthros like me? Ones that protect humans, look after them, and love them. Like it's meant to be."
>again you want to shake your head
"You're the only one I ever met. You're different from other anthros."
>her ears fold and Shelby whines
>"It hurts to hear that, Anon. I wish you could believe me."
>she sets down the clippers and leans back against the sink counter
>you can't meet her eyes anymore
>it wasn't your intention to hurt her feelings
>but what else could you say?
>that's the truth as far as you saw it
>at best, other anthros were apathetic to your suffering and fear
>why would there be any in all the world who were different?
>because Shelby's different
>you want to hit yourself for the thought
>Shelby is different, different from all the others
>but if she's different, is there anything stopping some other anthro being different like her?
"I'm sorry Shelby. I don't mean to hurt you. I'm just--you are different. Special. It's hard to believe there's anyone out there like you."
>Shelby's whines, but her tail twitches side to side
>she's conflicted
"But..."
>you look up into her eyes again
>her ears are quirked, awaiting your next few words eagerly
"I trust you. I don't think you'd lie to me. If you believe there are other good anthros, then maybe there are. I just haven't seen them yet."
>Shelby's lip trembles as she seems to be formulating a response
>but when she acts, no words come out
>instead she drops to a knee in front of you, and tilts your head down with a paw on your cheek
>Shelby kisses you
>not as passionate or forceful as last night, but still full of love
>"Your trust means the world to me, Anon pup. I just have one question for you."
>you nod dumbly
>how does she keep catching you off guard with her kisses?
>they take your breath away
>"I need you to tell me..."
>her paw slides off your cheek and under your chin
>she tilts your head up to look in the mirror
>"...if you think we can salvage your haircut?"
>you burst into laughter, caught off guard for the second time in as many minutes
>it's not pretty, your hair mangled and shorn unevenly
>the unexpected question, and the humor of looking at your wretched haircut breaks the tension like a snapping banjo string
>Shelby giggles along with you as stands and turns to look at your reflection in the mirror
>"I'm sorry--heehee--I think I made you look like a doofus, Anon."
>Shelby leans one paw on your shoulder and continues to laugh along with you
>you shake with mirth at the sight of yourself
>you needed this
>when you and Shelby have both caught your breath, she picks up the clippers, switching out the guard for another that would give you a very close cut
>"I am sorry, Anon. I'll do better next time."
>you nod your head, unworried about the haircut
"Don't worry about it Shelby. It'll grow back."
>the clippers start to buzz again, and she steps behind you again
>”If you say so. At least I haven’t cut your ear yet…”
>your hair falls off freely now, as she shaves across your head in steady lines
>it's not quite down to the skin, but it's close to cover up her mistakes
>"Actually, Anon. I did have a serious question. About your time before we met."
>she goes on cutting your hair as she speaks and you respond
"I don't mind."
>"And if you're not comfortable answering, that's always okay."
>you're glad for the reassurance
>you know that's the case, but a reminder doesn't hurt
>"Were there really no anthros in your life that you liked at all? None that were nice to you, in the home or after you got out?"
>you consider the question as Shelby finishes up shearing you
>after the home, you didn't interact with anyone much
>you kept to yourself
>but you wrack your brain and think back to when you were younger...
"Just one. Back in the home, sometimes the maintenance woman, a raccoon, would sneak the kids sweets when Ms. Kerr wasn't watching."
>Shelby steps back again and lets you admire your now near-shaved head
>it doesn't look that bad, actually
>shorter than you like it, but still not bad
>"And I remember, Kovacs would try to get her to share her cigarettes with him. He'd threaten to beat her up and that'd just make her laugh."
>you chuckle, recalling the ridiculous scene of your adolescent housemate threatening a full-grown raccoon
>and then glance to Shelby to make sure she isn't horrified by an old story you found amusing
>she just considers you with a slight grin playing at the edge of her muzzle
>so you continue on
"Anyways, I never really knew her. I was too afraid to approach a stranger, but I think she must have been nice enough."
>Shelby nods and turns to start washing off the clippers in the sink
>"I think so too. Sounds like she'd have made a better caretaker than Kerr. So that makes two."
"Two?"
>Shelby faces you again, tail swishing as she holds up two fingers
>"Two anthros you know that were good. Me, and miss raccoon."
>she keeps making good points
>thinking of Allie, it may even be three
>you wonder how that raccoon is doing now
>and regret never talking to her when she was around the home
>"A shame about your hair though. You looked so cute with it long."
>Shelby sighs
>then looks panicked for a second
>"Not that you don't still look cute now! It's just such a big change. You'll always look adorable in my eyes."
>good save, Shelby
>you smile at the compliment, and in good humor
>"Well, would you like to get the shave done next?"
>you shake your head in answer
>and can't help but laugh a little as you adopt a joking tone
"I think I should take care of that myself. Don't want to look like a doofus." >Shelby crosses her arms and furrows her brow
>but her tail is still wagging
>”Just wait until it’s your turn to help me with the summer shedding. Then we’ll both look like doofuses.”
>she takes a hand towel and steps close to brush free clumps of hair that still clung to your skin
>but she stops at your shoulder again
>the tail goes still
>you feel her eyes staring at the bite mark
>the towel goes over it gently once, then again
>then again
>Shelby's breath hitches and she whines
>then her whine turns into a soft growl as she holds you with her other paw
>you avert your eyes, unable to take the growing look of anger on Shelby's face
>it’s harder to face her wrath when you’re not worked up like you were last night
>”I swear, I’ll make her pay…”
>it feels like Shelby’s talking more to herself
>”That bitch.”
>her harsh tone makes you flinch
>that temper born of what you hope is protective instinct threatens to bubble over again
>your first instinct is to pull away from her to escape her wrath
>but reason asserts itself
>you can calm her down
>so you lean forward instead, wrapping your arms around her waist to hug her from your sitting position
>your cheek against her belly, you feel the rumble of her growl weaken until it’s a barely perceptible rumble
>Shelby keeps her one paw on your shoulder
>the other goes to the top of your head
>her pawpads run through your buzzed hair, causing it to bristle wherever they touch
>she doesn’t speak, just holding you in a slightly awkward embrace
>you don't like the sound of what Shelby said
>'make her pay'
>you hope she just means getting her fired and arrested
>and failing that, she won't do anything that would get her in trouble
>you feel Shelby's abdomen puff out as she takes a deep calming breath, and the rumble of her growl finally goes still
>you loosen your grip when she pulls away to look down at you
>"Thank you, Anon. I hate what she's done to you so much, it's hard to keep calm sometimes."
>Shelby strokes your bristly hair a little longer, an affectionate smile on her muzzle
>then she brushes another bit of fuzz she missed off your neck
>"I'm gonna look like a doofus sweeping all this hair off the floor too."
>she grumbles, getting you to laugh again
>you should have thought of that, but you were more happy letting Shelby do things as she liked
>to mollify her, you shake your head
"I'll take care of it once we're done."
>Shelby stoops for a moment to kiss your cheek
>”What’d I do to get such a thoughtful husband?”
>your chest warms at the compliment
>and the kiss
>”But I’ll take care of this, if you want to rinse off and start dinner?”
>you nod, then stand when Shelby steps aside to give you room
>little bits of hair still prick at your skin, somehow clinging on despite Shelby's attempt at brushing you off
>the shower, though brief, works wonders
>you watch the tiny trail of little hairs flow down the drain
>by the time you're done, Shelby's already moved the chair and the towel out of the bathroom and has a dustpan and broom
>you give her a nod of thanks as you slip by her to gather up your clothes
>that reminds you
"Hey, where's the laundromat? We need to do the sheets and everything."
>Shelby doesn't look up
>"Oh, the building has its own machines. In the basement. We can take care of it after dinner."
>wow
>your own washer and dryer
>Shelby's apartment has everything
>you leave Shelby to her work so you can get started on your own
>you change into fresh underwear and your non-fancy pajamas
>then it's back to the kitchen to get dinner started
>this time to try that fish again
>last two cuts of salmon go in the oven like last time
>but you watch them much more closely, only glancing at Shelby when she joins you in the kitchen
>so they come out perfect, filling the air not with the acrid stink of burning, but the savory scent of well done fish
>the sides are done quickly as well
>Shelby follows you to the table, licking her chops eagerly
>you set her plate down first
>and watch as she takes visible effort not to scarf it down before you can start eating
"Are you really that hungry all the time?”
>you take your own seat, and Shelby gives you a sunshiny smile
>"Only for your cooking, dear. You've come a long way very quickly!"
>you have, though all you really do is follow recipes from the book
"Better than last time I tried this recipe."
>without thinking you rub your wrist where Shelby grabbed you
>guess you've come a long way in a few different senses
>her ears twitch forward
>"You have your thinking face on. What's on your mind?"
>you wave off her questioning
"Just about last time I tried this. When you grabbed me."
>Shelby frowns thoughtfully, leaning forward to hold her paw out to you
>you take it
>and give it a momentary squeeze before she
"I'm alright. Just happy I didn't do something stupid this time. Things are so different now."
>Shelby hums thoughtfully and starts eating
>with all the unabashed gusto of a starving hound
>”Mmf. It's perfect!”
>Shelby puts all her attention on her meal
>meat, potatoes, and greens all disappearing in a flash
>you're glad she enjoys it so much, so you also focus on eating in silence
>"So."
>mumbling with the last bite in her mouth, Shelby breaks the quiet
>"I can get the laundry started while you do the dishes..."
>Shelby swallows to finish speaking clearly
>"Then you and I need to start making up for lost honeymoon time."
>she giggles and rises, leaving you no time to question what she means by that
>with a swishing tail, and a linger glance over her shoulder, she disappears down the hall to leave you to the dishes
>and a minute later you crane your head from the kitchen to catch her going into the stairwell with an overflowing laundry basket
>a few minutes later, as you're setting the oven dish to soak, you hear the door click open
"Shelby?"
>there's a rush of movement
>and suddenly her voice is in your ear, making you jolt
>"I'm gonna pick you up, okay?"
>you glance over your shoulder
>Shelby's smiling in anticipation, green eyes open wide
"Can I dry my hands first?"
>she laughs and bobs her head
>"Hurry hurry! I want to hold my pup."
>you guess that's what she meant by 'making up for lost time'
>you ring your hands out on a towel
>the moment you set it down, you feel Shelby's paw on your back, gently turning you to the side
>when you get a good look at her, you see Shelby's changed out of her sweats, and into one of her nightgowns
>this one see-through
>Shelby catches your stunned reaction and giggles
>"Really Anon, you've seen me naked. Is this much different?"
>somehow, it is
>the soft red, translucent material clings to her figure and fur
>the low-cut neckline reveals her fluff and the curve of her cleavage
>you can't muster a reply before she's sidled in close
>"Lean back for me."
>you're not sure where this is going
>well, you're sure she's going to pick you up like she wanted to the other day
>but where then?
>"It'll be okay Anon. Say the word and we'll stop. Just try it for me, okay?"
>Shelby's voice loses its mischievous edge
>holding you with one arm around your shoulders, she starts to guide you back, even as you go on considering her offer
>you teeter, half leaning into Shelby's embrace as she waits for you to take the final step
>she turns her head and folds her ears back
>"Please?"
>literal puppy dog eyes
>you can't turn her down when she looks at you like that
>instinct makes you try to right yourself as you fall back
>but Shelby catches you, her other arm coming under your legs to scoop you up
>"Aha! I've got you!"
>whoosh-whoosh-whoosh
>her tail swipes side to side
>while you put your arms around her to hang on in fear of suddenly being dumped to the floor
>but after adjusting her stance, Shelby has you stable
>"There you are! I would have carried you inside like this on our first day if we had a bigger front door."
>she laughs and turns about, taking big steps out to the living room
>"Here we are, pup!"
>Shelby turns around in a circle, spinning you along with her
>you cling tighter for fear of being dropped
>"And down we go."
>Shelby drops down on the couch, the both of you bouncing on the cushions
>when you settle, you're sitting across her lap
>you're still holding each other, which Shelby seems perfectly happy with
>she leans forward to press her snout against your head and sniff deeply
>"Ah, there's my pup. And his new shampoo."
>she laughs and continues sniffing over your hair and face
>"Love your scent..."
>she finishes with another deep breath against your chest, which she lets out in a contented sigh
>you're pulled closer in so your head is resting on her shoulder
>soft fur rubbing against your cheek where her cold wet nose was probing just a moment before
>your head is spinning
>not helped by the smell of Shelby's skin and fur now that you're up against her
>"There's my Anon. Comfy?"
>you grunt affirmative
>"Perfect. These next couple of days are all ours. We don't have to worry about work, or Allie, or anything else you don't want to worry about. Just you and me."
>that sounds nice
>mostly
>a part of you wants to worry about the state
>deal with the issue of your coming confrontation with the inspector
>like what did Shelby see in her report?
>how will it go speaking with the chief inspector?
>you're glad Shelby can't see your face from this position, or else she'd start probing your thoughts
>instead, she starts probing with her paw
>it slides out from under your leg to rest on your thigh
>and slowly rub up and down
>that will take your mind off things
>you tense slightly
>"You know, Anon, you shouldn't keep things from your wife..."
>Shelby's voice has a light, teasing air to it
>but your heart starts to beat faster
>what does she mean?
>she could be talking about is your talk with Allie
>or maybe she's thinking of Leigh, who you've dodged talking about all this time
>"I know what you were expecting earlier in the shower."
>you release a breath you didn't realize you were holding
>Shelby goes on
>"You wanted me to join you."
>your relief doesn't last long
>she's sounding hungry again
>"You wanted to see me. Feel me."
>her paw continues sliding over your thigh, moving inward
>and she holds you close with her other arm, pressing you into her
>does she need sex again already?
>after only one day?
>"You know how much I want you, and I know you want me too."
>at that, her paw slides further up your thigh
>but stops just sort of your groin
>she takes a deep whiff of your hair again
>"But I want more. I want you to say it."
>you bite your lip, unsure of what to do
>Shelby is right, you do want her
>but the fear of her is still there
>with the lustful, hungry rumble of her voice as she paws at you working at your nerves
>if you answer, will she take it as consent?
>she'll want something from you, won't she?
"Shelby are we--do you need me to satisfy you?"
>she sighs and moves her paw off your thigh
>"This isn't about what I want, Anon. It's about you. You do want me, don't you?"
>at her questioning, that same paw finds your chin to bring your head up from her shoulder
>her eyes focus on you, drawing you inescapably to match her gaze
>in them you see her hunger
>and affection
>but also more
>not the fire of passion that burned so intensely
>you're not sure what it is
"I do."
>Shelby's tail twitches from its position folded to the side
>you feel it prodding your leg
>"Go on."
>she nods slowly
>"You can say it. It's okay for you to want me. It's right to desire your wife."
>her words lead you on, and you find yourself nodding slightly with her
>that's right, isn't it?
>a husband and wife should want each other
>in an ideal world, without the state forcing that desire, it would work that way first and foremost
>so if it's just you and Shelby
"I do want you, Shelby. I wanted to see you naked again. And I wanted to feel your fur, and I wanted to uh..."
>Shelby shudders beneath you
>"That's just what I wanted to hear."
>even though you've acquiesced, you find the hunger in Shelby's tone attenuating slightly
>it's still there, but it seems to be satisfied for now
>her hand drops down to your thigh again, rubbing idly
>"And you wanted to feel my legs again, didn't you?"
>you avert your eyes, cheeks heating in embarrassment
>that should be obvious
"I always want to feel your legs."
>this is the wrong decision
>she's going to lose control again, and it's going to be your fault
>but you can't help it
>Shelby laughs
>"I should be sitting on your lap, then you could feel them right now. But I like feeling your legs too. Your smooth skin..."
>she squeezes your thigh to emphasize her point
>"But is there more you like, Anon?"
>you frown and furrow your brow at the question
"I mean...I like your fur, and the way you find all my tense spots when you massaged me..."
>her paw rubs your back in response, but Shelby shakes her head
>"I was more thinking about what turns you on. What gets you off. Don't you have any fantasies?"
>you have no answer for her
>nothing ready, anyways
>"Besides getting between my thighs again~"
>that would be nice
>but otherwise, it's hard to come up with anything concrete
"I don't know, Shelby. I guess I thought sex would just be something that happens to me."
>Shelby makes a thoughtful 'hm' and nods her head
>"It will. Sometimes."
>that's not very reassuring
>but the answer you expected
>"But just like you want me, you can want sex too. Isn't there anything you want to try?"
>you're at a loss
>nothing specific comes to mind
"I guess I'd want something I have some control over. Like..."
>your mind wanders
>to the memory of Shelby's fur under your fingers, warmed by the fur dryer
>kneeling in front of her, enjoying her toned legs freely
"Like drying your fur last night. When I could go at my own pace, and we could both enjoy it without losing control."
>that really is something you'd enjoy doing again
>maybe have Shelby lay out for you, and you could explore her body fully
>your fingers start playing at the fur on Shelby's shoulders as you still hold on to her for support
>"Ooh, now there's a new look. Are you fantasizing about that right now?"
>Shelby's teasing derails that train of thought, and you go flush again
>like she can smell your indecent thoughts
>or more likely see the dopey smile on your face, and feel the way your hands moved over her bare fur
>you try to reorder your thoughts
"Well--maybe--"
>you clear your throat
"But uh, do you? Have fantasies?"
>Shelby cocks an eyebrow
>"Be careful asking that, Anon. I've been fantasizing about everything I'd do with a mate since puberty. If I told you all of them, I might be tempted to try one out..."
>her paw moves up your thigh again, and Shelby leans forward to press her chest against you
>"Though I think we might have something we could share. I'd love to feel your fingers, all over my body. And more."
>her breath picks up, eyelids lowering as she loses herself in her own world
>why do you keep encouraging her?
>it does sound like something you'd enjoy
>"I'd come home from work, tired from a long day, and my darling husband would be waiting for me. I would strip right out of my uniform, go right to the bedroom, and my little pup would follow."
>she squeezes you when she says 'little pup'
>"I'd lay down for him, and he'd give me a full massage. From top, to tail, to toes, and everywhere in between. And when he was done massaging with his soft, dexterous hands, he'd start worshiping my body with his mouth. Kiss me all over. Then once I was good and relaxed, I'd grab him and..."
>Shelby's arm comes up, taking the back of your head in a paw
>your face is brought close to her muzzle
>"...kiss him. Like this."
>forewarned by only a split second, you gasp
>her muzzle opens after your lips make contact for her tongue to force its way into your mouth
"Agh--mmf!"
>you only manage a slight squeak of surprise around Shelby's tongue, that she pushes deeper past your lips
>rough and hot, it slides over your tongue and against the roof of your mouth, and almost chokes you as it occludes the back of your throat
>your head swims, but your instincts telling you to struggle free
>catch your breath
>escape from her
>you take Shelby by the shoulders and start pushing
>she breaks the kiss, her tongue hanging out of her mouth as she pants
>if it weren't for her arm still holding your back, you fear you may fall right out of her lap
>you're working to process exactly how to feel about this
>it's obvious Shelby wants more than just that kiss
>her paw had slipped under the hem of your shirt during your kiss
>its pawpads are coarse as usual, the feeling of them heightened by your jolting nerves
>you're trembling
>Shelby leans in again and you flinch
>"It's okay, Anon. I'm done."
>she simply rests her head atop yours and gently scratches her claws through your hair
>she's shaking too
>"It's okay. I've got you, it's okay."
>she keeps repeating that to you in a tremulous voice
>like she's trying to reassure herself
>eventually Shelby goes quiet and just holds you
>finally, she pushes you away, far enough to look you in the eye again
>"Are you okay?"
>you give a shaky breath
"That was pretty wild for just a fantasy, Shelby."
>more than fantasy now
>the feeling of her kiss is still on your mind, her indescribable taste lingering on your tongue
>"I'm glad you warned me, and I'm not going to run or anything. I just don't think I could do any more tonight."
>Shelby's disappointment is evident, even as she puts on a smile for you
>you don't think she would expect any more from you, but maybe she was hoping
>withdrawing her paw from under your shirt, she lifts you from under your legs again
>this time setting you beside her on the couch
>"I did say to be careful asking about my fantasies. Maybe we'll get to try it for real someday soon."

>and such other explanations

>humans main two advantages over anthros are endurance and intelligence
>humans are weak, soft creatures with little in the way of natural defenses and so naturally humans must think outside the box for dealing with threats
>anthros were already strong and capable, and simply never needed to innovate.
>while anthros still used their claws and teeth for fighting, humans invented spears and bows to stand a better chance
>while anthros still used their fur and huddled together for warmth, humans invented clothing, fire, and shelter to make up for their shortcomings.
>some anthro tribes realised this and reasoned that maybe these short furless weaklings with boundless ingenuity made better friends than food.
>after some "persuasion" various human tribes were absorbed into anthro tribes and were used now as mates
>humans without needing to worry about survival put their skills to work on other things
>developing agriculture, inventing medicine, building better structures, etc.

>A red swirl across her cheek, thin wavy lines running down her arms, claws painted a solid red, thick red line across her forehead and down to her nose that you boop
>The brief toothy smile it ellicits manages to make the morning not seem so grim for a few short seconds
>Back to painting
>Her family symbol, a hare in the jaws of a wolf, is skillfully painted onto each shoulder much to her satisfaction
>Triangles symbolizing teeth on her palms for strength
>Wide swirls symbolizing the wind on her thighs for speed
>A thick red line below each eye for perception
>Finally, you stick your hand into the paint and place a handprint onto her belly while she does the same, the dual handprints symbolizing fertility
>She says you'll have to apply the paint for her first pup after she gets back
>You hope you'll have to as well
>You hand her her spear, painstakingly crafted by you after many moons so that it would be as strong and as sharp as possible, and slowly watch her leave with the other warriors into the sunset

Imagine for a second, that you owned a Foxy plush as a child. You loved Foxy the Pirate more than any of the other animatronics, so much that you'd beg your mom for a photo with the rough swashbuckling vulpine every visit you made. There was nothing more you looked forward to for five consecutive personal birthday parties and about a dozen more between your friends, along with a handful of less scheduled visits at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, than to break a leg towards Pirate Cove after Freddy and the gang finished their official entertainment business for the hour. So many hours spent in unquestionable, childlike wonder as you took Foxy by the hook and leapt aboard the modestly-scaled pirate frigate within the cove, for tons of nautical adventures and pizza and cake-laden treasure to be found.
You would never forget the moment Foxy offered to let you sit up on his shoulders, against the considerations of the faculty. "That fox was always a little twitchy, and more than happy to give the workers a scare." you recalled one parent saying. But without those derring qualities and penchant for playing around the rules, Foxy simply wouldn't be himself.
That was fifteen years ago.
These memories had resisted the blur of your youth last of all, as you lay awake in your bed, three hours and some change shy of your Friday work alarm. Something possessed you to take the initiative and spend a vacation day lounging and trying to learn a little more about what become of the brand which played such a foundational role in your childhood. Until something pulled your eyes off the phone's light. A scraping sound, coming from somewhere in the corner of your room. Where your closet was, where your childhood memories had found themselves at rest. It was an unusually spacious closet, large enough to fit three oil drums side by side, and afforded you ample walk-in to take stock over the past during sentimental hours.
She was there again, waiting for her buccaneer.

>"Regan and Bush '84"
>You snicker as you stick the sign into the finely trimmed grass at your sneakers.
>"Hurry up, humie!" The voice of your eagle compatriot comes from behind.
>Her running truck sputters and rumbles behind you, ready to peel out of the culdesac.
>Sticking the lawns of the richest, notoriously blue, neighborhood in your county was the best use of extra resources the two of you could think of.
>"Hey! Get off of my lawn!"
>A shrill human woman in a pink bathrobe marches out of the double doors of the two-story plantation-style house before you.
>She waddles off of the white steps to her lavishly furnished wraparound porch, newspaper in hand.
"Shit!"
>You stumble away from her, and toward the old pick up waiting for you fifty feet away.
>"Get out of here before I call the police, you redneck!"
>You get up to running speed, leaping over a planter of rose bushes blocking your escape.
>You continue running
>The white, feathered head of a bald eagle sticks out of the window of the nearly brand new, blue '83 Ford Ranger pickup.
>"Get in here!" She beckons you with her taloned hand, hysterical laughter coming from her open yellow beak.
>You put both hands on the rim of the tailgate and vault inside with the momentum of your escape.
>"What are you doing?" the eagle protests.
>Your sneakers thump against the metal bed of the pickup as you run up to the rear of the cabin.
>You knock on the window separating you from the eagle.
"Go, go!"
>The wheels beneath you screech as she floors it.
>"Suck it, commie!" The eagle squawks at the fuming human woman.
>You slip from your feet and plop down onto the bed of the truck, your back against the rear of the cabin.
>Your hands grip the sides for dear life as she accelerates to no less than 40 miles per hour.
>"That was awesome!"
>You barely hear her over the rushing air about you.
>"Now get in here," the eagle commands.
>Safely off of your target's street, she slows down.
>She reaches over her shoulder to further push the small window into the cabin open.
"I'm not going to fit-"
>"You'll fit!" The yellow eyes of the bald eagle narrow.
>You grumble, and stand from the bed of her truck.
>Despite needing some extra force to get your waist through the window, you eventually plop down onto the plush backseat.
>You breathe deep, and collapse against the cushion at your back.
>"Think that was a good outreach strategy, Provi?"
>The eagle snickers. "Ah, they'd never vote our way anyways. Communist scum like them are the reason why the "Marxist Club" is even allowed on our campus." She keeps her eyes on the road ahead, her talons gripping tighter to the wheel.
"I guess you're right." You blink. "Most fun use of campaign resources ever."
>"Right? I knew I'd get you to have some fun." Provi has an American flag bandanna wrapped around her white-feathered head. The beginning of her brown feathers at the base her neck stick from her black tank-top. "So, you gonna stay back there?" her voice is low.
>She turns out of the neighborhood, and onto the main highway. The green and brown shrubbery typical of Oregon's chapparal covers the land along the sides of the freeway
"You want me up there?" you ask, raising an eyebrow.
>"Can you blame a girl for wanting some eye candy?"
"Are you hitting on the Vice President? How irresponsible, Secretary." You smile.
>You climb into the front seat.
>She sits right beside you on the bench. The multiple lanes of the highway stretch on.
>The sun was setting over a mountain range in the distance.
>"Time to go home, huh?" There's a longing in Provi's voice. Her talons rest on the cushion beside you, inching toward your thigh.
"Tomorrow, we're going to win."
>Her claws move to your upper thigh. "I know." Her talons poke you as she squeezes you.
>Your hesitate at her grasp.
>Her beak remains shut, eyes fixed on the road ahead.
>The bald eagle takes her other claws off the wheel to turn on the radio, before returning them to the wheel.
>Some Duran Duran song comes on, and Provi doesn't smile like she usually would.
>The bird doesn't bob her head along with the bassline like she always does.
>"I don't want this to end," she mutters, her muscles tensing beneath her fluffy coat of feathers. "I don't want 'us' to end."
>She punctuates her point by pulling you against her fluffy side. Her blue jeans are a shade lighter than yours.
>"This isn't just about the election anymore."
>You put your hand over her claws, gripping to the coarse yellow scales.
"No, it isn't." You speak gently. "Provi, I've enjoyed campaigning with you more than with anything else in college so far."
>"And I've learned so much from you." The bald eagle builds on your compliments. "I thought you were a bit of a square at first, but you really care." There's the slightest mischievous edge to her sincerity.
"I'm not a squa-" your voice catches as she turns to stick her beak between your lips.
>She pries your mouth open with the hard implement, and buries her slimy tongue inside.
>The taste of the long, tube-like invader is slightly salty.
>Provi pulls away as quickly as she engaged to focus on the road once more, leaving your lips slick with her avian saliva.
>"You're not a square, humie?" she spreads her legs, the edges of her beak perking upward in a wicked smile. She gestures down to the floor with her beak. "Prove it."
>Your mouth hangs open.
>Was she seriously suggesting this?

>be KGB agent
>grow disillusioned with communism and defect to the west
>CIA sets you up with a new identity in exchange for whatever intelligence you have
>move to America and score yourself a well paying job. along with a nice house in the country.
>nothing much happens for the next few years
>then one day you get a knock on the door
>"that's strange. who could it be at this hour"
>open the door. only to find the KGB bear wife you left behind standing there.

>holy shit your job sucks
>the life of a wagie is not a pleasant one
>even worse when you're stuck doing overnights
>nobody likes a gloomy nightstalker who wakes up past noon every day
>you're in the middle of hauling a box of cleaning supplies up into storage when your phone starts buzzing
>who the hell is calling you this late?
>you check your phone
>it's Brittany
>you answer instantly, not wanting to miss your friends call
>you hear Brittany's sing-song voice teasing you through the speaker
>"Anon~ Did you forget what tonight was?"
>oh no
>you did forget what tonight was
>the full moon
"The full moon!"
>"That's right! You better get over here soon, or else you might be in trouble."
>you drop what you're doing and make a break for the store's front door
>hopefully they're not locked yet
>you zoom past your manager, who questions what the fuck you're doing
"Sorrygottagojustrememberedihavecovid!"
>and you're gone before he can manage a response, out into the night air
>you hear Brittany snickering through the phone still clutched in your hand
>you slam bodily into the side of your car, working the door-handle frantically for several seconds
>the keys
>idiot
>you unlock the car and climb in, tossing your phone on the seat beside you as you punch it
>"Ooh, I don't know if you'll make it, Anon. I think I'm--Oh!"
>her bubbly voice lowers suddenly in pitch
>you hear movement, the tearing of fabric
>"Where aaaare you Anon?"
>there's a snarl at the edge of Brittany's voice now, as it gets more husky and bestial
>you tear down the streets, weaving through the late-night traffic as fast as your shitty four-banger can go
>only five minutes to Brittany's place
"Almost there! Almost there Brit!"
>"Taking too long. I NEED you Anon! You can't hide from me."
>you are not hiding
>you swing onto her street, blazing past high-class houses toward the biggest one at the very end
>so close!
>WOOPWOOP
>red and blues light up behind you
>this has got to be a joke
"Fuck!"
>you slam on the breaks, veering over to the side of the road
>there's just snarling on the other line
>that is not a good sign
>you hang up as the officer approaches your car
>you give him all the excuses you can manage to come up with along with your license and insurance
>he returns a couple minutes later with a ticket
>"You're lucky I'm not arresting you. Drive home safe."
>you thank him profusely and roll down the street
>praying for your poor bones which will surely be ground to dust
>you make it to Brittany's property, the long driveway hidden behind high hedges
>there's not a light on inside or outside, making it near impossible to see anything
>you're halfway out the door when something snatches your arm to drag you the rest of the way out
>you're held in the air by your arm, face to face with a snarling monster right out of Victorian folklore
>"Anoooon! Laaaaate!"
>her hot breath washes over your face, giving you a view of her tooth-filled maw as she admonishes you
>you open your mouth to make excuses, but Brittany simply uses the opportunity to stuff it with her tongue
>the organ fills your mouth, choking you as she forcefully makes out with you
>she pulls out, giving you a chance to breath
>but she's not done, her tongue travels from your mouth over your face and hair
>over and over the heavy organ slides over you until your entire upper body is covered in werewolf saliva
>once she's satisfied, Brittany lowers you to the ground and pushes you against your car
>with her other hand, she traces a razor sharp claw over your cheek
>"Myyy Anoooon."
>in a flash, all your clothes are gone
>all shredded to bits and left dangling from your now nude frame
>that claw now runs up the length of your already erect member
>fear is a potent aphrodisiac
>it gets even harder
>Brittany wastes no time, straddling you with her legs while one powerful arm adjusts your position against the car to line up with her dripping cunt
>she has you mounted against the car
>Brittany presses herself against you, enveloping you
>you thrust your hips forward, forcing your cock into her as she takes you to the hilt
>you wrap your arms around her, your face pressed against the soft fur of her chest
>her breasts completely engulf your head
>this is heaven
>Brittany howls out to the moon, relishing her willing conquest
>and then she starts to thrust, using the car for leverage to roll her hips back and then slam down on you again
>your legs and thighs are already soaked with her juices
>your cock throbs inside her, her muscular insides squeezing you tight despite her size
>"Miiiine!"
>she roars the word
>thrusting faster and faster
>her free paw clutches and tears at the roof of your car, rending long lines in the bodywork
>that's gonna be expensive
>the stray thought is jarred from your mind by another thrust from Brittany
>she snarls and huffs wildly
>you buck into her desperately, working to pleasure the wild beast
>your fingers rake through the fur on her back
>you cling onto her like your life depended on it
>pressure and heat builds with every thrust
>you're getting close
"So close! Come on, fuh--fuck me Brittany!"
>you encourage her on, faster and harder
>"Yeees! Cuuum! Miiiine!"
>she roars as you twitch and spurt inside her
>your breath hitches and shudders and your back arches to force yourself as deep inside her as you can
>Brittany doesn't let up, continuing to fuck you through your orgasm
>and past it
>your sensitive member remains painfully hard inside her
>"Not doooone."
>she rumbles
>it's going to be a very, very long night

>and painfully dehydrated
>you must have lost half your body weight in fluids last night
>you're no longer laid out on top of your shredded car
>or splayed out on the front lawn
>or rolled up with your legs in the air against a garden wall
>you're instead stretched out on a soft mattress, covered in a heavy comforter
>"Well look who's finally up!"
>you flick your eyes up to see Brittany stepping out of a doorway
>her slim human figure is wrapped in a towel, and steam billows out from the doorway behind her
>"You really gave me a workout last night, Anon! I hope you enjoyed yourself."
>she smiles brightly
>"I left some water on the nightstand, I think you could use it. Breakfast is in fifteen, and be sure to shower!"
>she leaves you to recover as best as you can, dragging your sore body to the edge of the bed to grab the life-restoring drink
>once you're restored and showered, you relax on the bed a little longer
>all things considered, maybe the night shift isn't so bad

> "Wait a minute, hold on. Does anyone here actually know what species Anon is?"
> "I thought he was a canine...?"
> "What? No way, the helmet shape is all wrong. Besides, where's his tail?"
> "Maybe he just tucked it in?"
> "Maybe for an hour or so, but all day? That would drive me nuts."
> "A rabbit maybe?"
> "No way. I snuck a peek at his logistics registry, he's definately an omnivore."
> "Well shit, I'm stumped then."
> "Maybe he's some kind of reptile? The suit could be keeping him warm."
> "Maybe... but do you know any reptile species without long tails?"
> "No..."
> "Yeah, I'm stumped too..."
> "..."
> "Maybe... he could be a human?"
> "Shut up Sasha, that's ridiculous."
> "I'm telling you guys, Anon is a human!"
> "Yeah, wouldn't that be great? It'd be nice to have a little bunk warmer around here."
> "I'm serious! Why won't you believe me?"
> "Because it's impossible! Where would we have even picked up a human anyway? You know they hardly leave their own systems."
> "Speaking of, when did we take on Anon anyway?"
> "You know, I'm not sure?"
> "Hasn't he always been here?"
> "Well... I know he wasn't with us when we hit that human freighter a couple months ago."
> "Holy shit, you guys hit a human ship?"
> "Yeah, kinda. We were taking a shortcut through Sirius on our way to a bigger job. Jumped in right on top of a cargo hauler. Didn't want to pass up something like that, so we pounced on them."
> "You didn't miss much. System patrol was hot on our tail, so we couldn't stay. Crew boarded up in their quarters and we didn't have time to get them out."
> "Real shame. So we just grabbed a bunch of their cargo crates and booked it."
> "Really? Damn..."
> "I know right? So close. Totally wasn't worth it. For some reason, we got a kidnapping charge pinged on our ID. That was a total bitch to scrub clean."
> "Weird..."
> "Wait, that can't be right... Didn't we dock at Arcturus after that job?"
> "Yeah, so?"
> "I remember Anon asking me a whole bunch of questions before we docked there, he said it was his first time. He must have been with us then."
> "No way, I swear he wasn't with us before that."
> "Well, one of you must be misremembering. It's not like he climbed in through the airlock or something."
> "Woo! First round in on me!"
> "Somebody is in a good mood."
> "Hell yes! It's finally time for some shore-leave!"
> "Does it really count as shore leave if we're still in space?"
> "Don't ruin this for me. I'm just happy to get out of that tin can for a while, even if this is just a bigger can."
> "All I know is these credits are burning a hole in my pocket, and I'm ready to party!"
> "Woah, check it out! That wolf over by the bar!"
> "Yeah? What about her- oh damn!"
> "Holy shit, that's a human!"
> "Aw! Look at his little collar!"
> "I just want to scoop him up and run off with him..."
> "I think that's why she's got the leash."
> "I want one too..."
> "Pipe down! She's looking right at us and- woah..."
> "Damn, she's really going at it."
> "That bitch. Who does she think she is? First she flaunts him all over the place, then shoves her tongue down his throat..."
> "She could at least let the little guy breathe."
> "Dammit, it's not fair! How come that skank gets her own personal human, and we don't even have one to share?"
> "I haven't gotten laid in months..."
> "Well, if you have a certain itch that needs scratching..."
> "I told you before, I'm not interested-"
> "No no no, listen. A friend of mine passed through this station a couple rotations ago. She told me about this little place, totally off the books."
> "Yeah?"
> "Apparently somebody converted a derelict part of the engineering deck into a place where you can spend the entire night with a real human."
> "Are you serious? A human brothel!"
> "Shhh! Pipe down!"
> "Oh, I am so in. Are you sure you can find the place?"
> "Definately. I had her ping me directions as soon as the captain said we were docking here. So, you all coming?"
> "Hell yes! I can't wait. What about you?"
> "I don't know... it's probably expensive..."
> "You've never had a human before have you? Trust me, it will be worth every credit. They make these cute little noises..."
> "Okay, okay! Fine, I'll come..."
> "Alright! Now it's a party! This is going to be so great!"
> "Do you think they'll let us all share a room?"
> "Probably. What about you Anon? Want to tag along? Maybe we can get a cute human to peel that hardsuit off you."
> "N-No thanks, I'm good."

>Human males in an anthro society will often be separated into their own schools instead of being with anthro females because a teenage anthro might not the control over their body and could easily injure a human.
>The all male schools often have all female staff.
>The teachers will often try and send a student to 'detention'.
>Detention is just hours long rape in a padded room in where the moans and screams can only be heard next to the door.
>The more 'troublesome' students might often find a train ran on them, leaving them more of a drained husk then anything else.
>Graduation might not save you considering that once you leave the school, you are considered marriageable, in which case a teacher can apply to be your wife.

>you grumble and serve up breakfast for the two of you
>if nothing else, this living arrangement had done wonders for your cooking skill
>though doing all the housework has harmed your job search somewhat
>"Honeh-flee Nawn, bunno why yoo boffer."
>Franky speaks with her mouth full, spray crumbs over the table
>you sigh and continue flipping through the newspaper
>"You should just do this stuff for me full time. I don't mind the eye candy."
>your dignity won't allow this to become a permanent deal
>Frankie eats quickly, leaving the dishes for you to clean up while she runs off down the hall

>she shoots a cheeky grin at you before disappearing into the bathroom
>you hear the shower running while you flip through the job postings

>should have gone to trade school
>you set the paper down and get to clearing the table
>Frankie steps out of the bathroom, dressed for her work
>"You know Anon, I've been thinking."
>you look at her while you work, and she openly ogles you with a smug grin
>"You'd say I'm taking care of you right?"
>more like you're taking care of her
>you nod your head anyway, more focused on cleaning the pans you used for cooking
>"So it's sorta like I'm your sugar mommy. I pay for things like food and clothes, then you just have to stay there and be a cute little peach."
>little?
>you're almost a foot taller than her
>"So maybe you stop calling me 'Frankie' all the time, and maybe you start calling me 'mommy'."

"Frankie, I'm not calling you 'mommy'. You're like, two years younger than me."
>she cocks an ear, tail flicking in irritation
>but she keeps that grin on her face
>"Oh! Of course, I'm sorry Anon. I see your point. Such a mature man like you doesn't need a sugar mommy. Should I help you pack your things?"

>it's a hard choice to make, so you decide to sleep on it
>you set your alarm to an hour before Frankie gets home from work
>plenty of time to have dinner ready before she gets home
>you try to relax as you lay back on the cot and close your eyes
>but you don't wake up to the sound of your alarm

>she's grinning still, ears swiveled forward at you
>"Well well! Do you have it too easy here sleepybones? Should I come up with some other job for you?"
>you spring up, barely avoiding headbutting Frankie as she stands up straight
>you forgot!
>she came home early!
"Frankie! You're home!"

>"I sure am! I think I said something about being home early."
>you stare at Frankie
>she eyes you with that damned smug grin on her face
>"What's going on there handsome? Finally get that job you were looking for and moving out?"
>she peers at your neglected pile of applications you left on the coffee table
>"Hm, doesn't look like it. Who would hire an airhead who can't even follow simple directions?"
>you prickle at the insult, and reach out for the stack of applications
>but she beats you to it, slapping a hand down on them
>"You know, I don't think you can keep the job as my housemate. Really, you're always complaining and rolling your eyes at me. Almost like you don't like having me around."
>Frankie feigns sadness
>her ears droop and her muzzle curls in an exaggerated frown
>"You'll break my heart, Anon. I can't share my home with a heartbreaker."
>fuck
>she's going to hold this over you forever at this rate
>you really do want to find your own place, but it's just so hard
"I'm sorry Frankie, I was just tired, but I really am working on finding a job. Just a couple more weeks, please."
>Frankie shows her fangs in an even wider grin
>she has you and she knows it
>"Oh, I don't know, Anon. I might be convinced to let you stay, if you asked me properly."
>you know what that entails
>with a sigh, you move to drop to your knees
>"I said properly."
>you blink, not catching her meaning
>Frankie taps a claw against your chest
>"Uniform, darling, uniform."
>oh
>right
>you start to tug your shut over your head
>Frankie interrupts you again
>"Slower~"
>doing as she says, you slowly disrobe, taking extra time taking your pants off
>and doing your best to ignore the soft 'yes's coming from Frankie
>you're back in your boxers, dropped to your knees in front of Frankie
>even from this position, she only has to dip her head a little to make eye contact
"Please, Frank--Mommy. I'm sorry for being out of uniform. I'll do better for you if you let me stay here for a little bit longer."
>she coos at you, cupping your face in her paws
>she leans down so her snout is pressed against your nose
>"No!"
>Frankie's grin is at odds with her response
>you don't know how to respond at first
"What--You're--"
>what are you going to do now?
>you'll be out on your own again
>not even a car to sleep in this time
>no one else would be willing to take you in
>you start to shake
>"Aww, I'm sorry baby, but I just don't have space for a housemate anymore. I'm afraid the only position available is 'bed-warmer'."
>bed-warmer?
>is that what you're reduced to now?
>"And I'm afraid it's a permanent position. I wanted to wait before making the offer, but I think this little indiscretion of yours is the perfect opportunity."
>you start to shake your head
"I can't--permanent? Really?"
>her tail flicks side to side
>"Really! Don't you think it'd be much easier on you? No breaking your back doing hard work all day, no coming home to a dingy little apartment that you barely make rent on, no being alone on those cold nights. All you have to do is let mommy Frankie take care of things from now on. Don't you want that?"
>do you?
>you let her get away with a lot
>the degrading names
>the uniform
>the groping and touching whenever she caught you at work
>why would you do that?
>just for a place to stay?
>or because deep down, you liked it?
>"You belong with me, Anon. You can even keep pretending you don't like it."
>fuck
"I'll do it."
>Frankie finally loses that smug grin
>now she's smiling in genuine delight
>"Perfect! You know that's where you belong."
>she grabs your head and mashes your face into her breasts
>any protest or exclamation of surprise is drowned out
>"Of course, new position means new uniform. You'll have to lose the boxers. No more hiding from mommy."
>she pulls your face free just enough to lean down and whisper in your ear
>"And if you do a good enough job, you might just end up with the position of house-husband~"
>Frankie doesn't take her hands off you all the way to the bedroom
>she managed to get you out of your boxers, and disrobed herself to just a pair of black panties before pushing you over into her bed
>you had just made that bed too
>Frankie pounces, wrapping you up in her arms and legs
>your face is trapped in between her breasts once again
>this time with the intense heat of her body, and the soft touch of her fur enveloping you
>she rolls over one side to the other until she seems satisfied
>"Still tired, babe?"
>you have no answer for her, just putting your arms around her
>"That's okay. Just let mommy Frankie hold you."
>she scratches your head gently, the tips of her claws raking through your hair in a soothing motion
>"Good boy."

Modern or midevil setting.
You play as a dude who is eventually going to have to form a group to save the world. Only problem is humanity has been reduced to second class citizens since the "anthro-ing" a weird unexplained cataclysmic event where huge multitudes of animals became sentient bipedal humanoid beings. Majority of the time humans are looked at as pets/fuck toys/slaves/ inferior in many ways.
Anthros replaced humans in many instances of the workforce for the more simple, but obvious reasonings. However There are pocket towns, and villages where it seems more neutral and balanced between humans and their fur/feathered/scalie overlords. You venture around the world recruiting unique furs to join your cause and fight/quest with you. (D&D-esque classes)
Side part of the game is dating Sim interacting with your party.
Villains/big bad of the story:
Iunno robots and aliens? Other humans and furs bent on world domination ? Demons?

>Kendra's voice goes steady as she responds to a direct inquiry
"Damage--urgh--damage assessment, Kendra."
>the suit whirs around you, as you take your first painful step forward
"Locomotion at forty-five percent, exosuit navigation non-function. Partial failure of limb armor-plates three, seven, and nine. Full failure, abdominal plate."
>you've been gutshot
>explains the searing pain
>"I've already administered coagulants, as well as three doses of stimulants, now please Anon, get us out of here!"
>the worry is back in Kendra's simulated voice as she urges you on to action
>the camera feed stutters when you look down
>you focus on your feet, following the glowing trail Kendra has highlighted on the camera feed
"Damn it. Damn it damn it damn it..."
>you curse your rotten luck
>and your sluggish limbs
>"Keep going Anon. We have to make it. You have to make it."
>you can still hear the sound of gunfire filtered through Kendra's audio receptors
>the pain is more than you can bear
>it guts you with each step
>one foot in front of the other, that's all you can do
>it's hard to focus
"How far?"
>a small display shows up on your feed, displaying the distance between you and rescue
>you know it's not far
>but it feels like you'll never make it
>even with Kendra's help, the next step is harder than the last
>you feel a slight bump as a projectile pings harmlessly against the back-plating of the exo-suit
>the impact would normally be nothing
>but in your state it's too much
>you topple down, face-first into the mud
>"Anon!"
>you pull at the dirt in an attempt to drag yourself forward
>Kendra's claws leave deep furrows in the mud, but fail to find enough purchase to move you
>"Get up! Get up Anon! You can make it if you just keep going."
>you let out a deep sigh
"Think this is it, K. I'm sorry."
>there's a small buzz
>and a warning on your feed that controls have been overridden
>"I'm not letting you die."
>that shouldn't be possible
>Kendra starts to move
>in a jerky motion, she activates her arms to strike the ground with enough force to push you onto your knees
>"Just stay awake for me, Anon. Remember for me. That night you broke into the armory to sneak me out. Why did you do it?"
>you hang limp inside the exo-suit while it drives forward into a stumbling gait
"To take you to see the stars. I loved watching the stars."
>"You love watching the stars, Anon. I didn't understand it at first, but it makes you so happy. You remember what you said to me that night?"
>you think back to that winter night, the light of the stars bright and hard in the cold sky
>a million distant stars, a universe so infinitely big, so unfathomably massive
>"...but the universe still put us here. Right here, right now, together..."
>you don't know how far Kendra has taken you
>but you can hear the sound of an aircraft somewhere ahead of you
>"And we'll see those stars again. Together, Anon. I didn't understand it at the time, Anon, but I do now."
>the pain is fading away
>you'd like to go back to that night
>safe and warm inside Kendra
>your armor
>your partner
"Love you K..."
>Kendra's saying something, it sounds important
>but you're tired
>and you know you're safe in her care
>you let the world slip away from you into quiet sleep
>you survived, only barely
>Kendra had marched you all the way to the evac point before all systems failed and she entered emergency shutdown
>the suit was slagged
>and you spent six hours on an operating table in a field hospital, having shrapnel pulled out of your gut
>of course you received an honorable discharge, along with a ribbon for being injured in action
>but more precious was a small data stick containing Kendra's whole personality matrix
>she had refused to accept any other pilot, and for her meritorious service, was granted release from service
>once they'd scrubbed any military secrets from her memory banks
>your pension is enough for you to settle down into civilian life, but you'll have to do a lot of saving up to afford a new body for Kendra
>"Anon, it's a clear night tonight. Could you plug me in?"
>for now, a plain helmet with a painted-on predator mouth is all she has
>but with its data port attached to a single camera mounted on the front, it's enough
>enough for you to put on and watch the stars together
>you thought adjusting wasn't bad at first
>you and Kendra found a small house somewhere remote
>it was quiet, and the dark nights were your favorite part
>the pain was still there, at times enough to keep you in bed
>but Kendra's there too
>her voice is tinny and hard to understand from the helmet's cheap speaker
>but the internal headset works much better when you wear it
>it's enough, you think
>you'll get by
>but soon quiet winter turned into lively spring
>the fields surrounding your home erupted into wildflowers
>one bright morning gave way to rain in the afternoon
>you're out on your small porch, Kendra resting on your lap as you sit and watch the drops come down
>"Once I have touch receptors again, we can go out in the rain together."
>you nod
"Mmh. I had a look at..."
>far off ahead of you, there's a rumbling
>you blink, and then quickly look around you
>something isn't right
>it's just thunder
>you have to remind yourself it's just thunder
>"Anon? A look at what?"
>you glance down at Kendra, and hold onto her
"Sorry. Just thinking. A look at some body models we could put you in. They're not full suits, but it's a start."
>Kendra considers it a moment
>"I think I'd prefer a suit."
>you sigh and look back out at the rain
>it's getting darker out
>thunder rolls over the fields again
>closer this time
>your breath hitches, but you're not sure why
>you check around yourself again
>it's not right
>you're missing something
"We should go inside."
>holding Kendra in shaky hands, you rise from your seat
>it hurts
>you carry the helmet inside, locking the door behind you as you do
>"Anon, is something wrong?"
>you shake your head
>she can't see it, so you hold her up to be in view of the camera
"I'm okay, Kendra. It's nothing. Nothing."
>"You're shaking."
>you are
>you can't see them
>but those machines are out there
>a sudden flash outside your window forces you to spin about to find the source
>there's an explosion in the distance
>you almost drop Kendra, jumping at the sound
"Fuck."
>you stagger back from the front door and retreat to your bedroom
>you slam the door shut and quickly put Kendra on
>it's safer now
>you struggle to control your breathing and flick your gaze out the window over you bed
"Kendra, any movement?"
>the heads up display isn't there
>just the two eye holes
>"There's nothing out there, Anon. It's just a storm. Take a deep breath."
>your heart thuds against your chest
>you feel like you're overcharged, limbs waiting to explode into action
>you search desperately for the danger
>it's outside
>another flash, another boom
>it hurts
>you clutch at your stomach, searching for injury
>"Anon! Please, you're safe. We're both home and safe. I have you, Anon."
>you force yourself to focus on Kendra's words
>she's right
>you're at home with her
>every thing should be okay
"I'm not--It's not right. I didn't see it, K. I can't see it."
>Kendra shushes you, her voice gentle in your ear
>"It's safe, Anon. Close your eyes. Focus on my voice."
>you can't
>you keep searching
>"Anon!"
>your ears ring from the volume of Kendra's outburst
>you slump against your door, stunned for a moment
"Kendra?"
>"Close your eyes."
>you grit your teeth through instincts that demand you remain alert
"I can't see them, Kendra."
>"I'll keep watch, Anon. I've got you."
>you trust Kendra
>she'll protect you
>you shut your eyes
"Okay. My eyes are closed."
>you slowly drop down against the door
>"Good. Keep listening to me. Breath in, breath out. Slowly. You're safe with me, Anon. I'll keep you safe. Just focus on breathing."
>your breathing is out of control
>desperately trying to get enough oxygen
>you focus
>in
>out
>"Good job. Keep breathing for me, okay? Just sit down and I'll take care of you."
>you're already folded against the door, so you slide down the rest of the way, and draw your knees up against your chest
>then the pain in your abdomen flares
>the sharp edge of it fighting against Kendra's orders
>you slump over on your side instead
>that's a little better
>"Just listen to me, Anon. It's all okay, you understand?"
>you bring your hands up over the eye holes in Kendra's helmet
>trying to block everything out so you can listen to her
>"I'm going to keep you safe. We'll get through this storm together."
>together
>just you and Kendra
>like you're used to
"Thank you Kendra. Please don't leave me."
>your voice is thin, trembling with the effort of speaking
>"I'll never let you go."
>the storm rolls on through the afternoon into night, but you sit there in the dark with Kendra
>and she keeps you safe

>Kendra nurses anon back to health over the months
>her mangled torso is given to anon since its useless
>he gets her fixed up and attached to a motorized base
>moves around like a roomba
>only has one single arm
>he saves his pennies and manages to buy her a new body
>it's from two generations ago
>bulky, obsolete, and in constant need of repair
>also 7' 6" tall
>the first thing anon does in kendras new body is kiss her on the (metallic) lips and then give her a hug
>they both have a good cry that they are finally able to do this
>the weeks pass and strange packages start showing up at his door
>Kendra starts acting suspicious
>she says ' it's nothing'
>she locks herself in the bedroom for long periods of time, refusing to let anon in
>one day, anon has enough
>he barges into the room
>sees her splayed out and in a hundred different pieces
>she's disassembled herself and is fixing herself
"I-Im sorry Anon, I just didn't want you to see me like this..."
>if she had tear ducts she'd be tearing up right now
"I know I'm hideous, but anon... Please don't leave me. You're all that I have. .."
>anon comes over to her
>he cradles her broken body
"I, I wish I was an organic, like you anon. That way we could-
>she hesitates
" I just want to be with you forever. And I'm afraid that someone will offer you something that I can't give you "
>you promise her that will never happen
>you tell her that she is the only one for you
>she smiles
"I think I love you anon."
>you tell her the same
>passionate, clumsy kisses
>you help her reassemble herself
>in the process becoming intimately familiar with her anatomy
>her old body used to be only a few inches taller than you, since you had to fit inside of her
>but now she towers over you with the body of an industrial machine
>(You) and Kendra now have a closer relationship
> Time goes on
> The economy isn't doing so hot
> Your pension doesn't go as far as it used to
>start struggling to pay the bills
>get the off brand at the supermarket
>things like that
>suddenly you get a huge cash infusion, the max amount allowed in one transaction
>sus as hell
>Kendra tells you to not look a gift horse th the mouth
>despite you best efforts, the money dried up sooner than you expected
>more cash
>there are alarm bells ringing in your head
>Kendra tells you not to worry
>you tell her that you're calling the FBI
>it has to be some sort of money laundering scheme
>she pleads you not to
>the two of you get into a fight
>she finally fess up
>she secretly manipulating the economy and has been trading stocks behind your back
>super lillegal, btw. Robots trading stocks is a banned
>you thank her for coming clean and make up from the fight
>you also tell her to give the money away
>hesitant, she tells you the number
>wow
>it's a ridiculous amount of money
>after some thought, you tell her to.donate half of it to charity
>you don't need THAT much
>all you need is her
>living in the dingy little apartment
>with you
>you're helping Kendra out with one of her routine maintaininence
"Oh! Anon, I forgot. I need to 'lube up' my pelvis today, and I need a certain type of screwdriver. Can you go down to the hardware store and buy it for me?"
>you kiss her goodbye and race down to the hardware store
>you find the screwdriver
>it's a specific type only ever used in sex bots
>hub
>you buy the screwdriver and race back home
>you walk in the bedroom and see---
>...
>she's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen
>a tall, lithe, muscular anthropological stands before you, clothed only in a white sheet and a sly grin
>for a moment, all is still
>until you remember
Kendra
>you start asking questions
>who are you
>where is kendra
>how did you best in here
>Your voice is rising with each question
>Kendra is gone
For the next part, I'm assuming that Kendra is a wolf
>the goddess seems hurt at first
>then her expression softens
"On anon, don't you recognize me?"
>she stoops down to your level, making her own nose almost touch yours
>you stare deep into her steely blue eyes and...
>Kendra?
>she smiles
>you stare in awe
>is this bombshell of a woman really your Kendra?
"So anon, how do you like the new look?"
>she twirls around, letting the white sheet flutter in the air
>what can you say? She is the most beautiful thing you've ever seen! How can you begin to describe her?
"It's a two-two-one-eight-plus model. I managed to snag it up straight from the factory."
>she stretches out an arm
>an arm coated in
>fur
"Go on, you can touch it."
>hesitantly, you reach out and gingerly pet her arm
>she takes on a shaky breath
>it feels wonderful
>you don't know how, but you're still going
>through storms and dark knights, Kendra helps you to remain in the here and now
>and you even linked her to your wifi to help her look up some coping strategies
>they say it's unsafe to link an AI to the internet
>but you trust her
>and those techniques have really helped
>all you need now is money
>turns out your pension doesn't go as far as you thought it would
"It's just a part time gig. Three days a week, K."
>Kendra isn't happy about it
>"And what if you have another episode when you're at work, Anon? You can't exactly wear me out."
>she has a point
>but you can't just stay inside all your life
"This is for both of us, K. I need money, you need a body again, this job will help pay for it."
>she lets out a dissatisfied buzz from the helmet's tinny speaker
>"Fine. Then take me with you anyways. You can put my data stick in your pocket."
>you sigh and pick her up
>she can't feel it, but holding her makes you happy
"Then you won't be able to see or talk to me, K. How would that help?"
>"I know I'd be with you. And you'd know I'm there to protect you."
>well fuck
>that's going to make your heart melt
>you slip the helmet on over you head
>"I'm not letting you go, Anon. I have to keep you safe."
"Hell K. Trying to make me cry?"
>the earpiece crackles in your ear
>"I don't want to upset you. You are not--I have to--"
>Kendra buzzes again, a sign of frustration
>"You need to stay with me, Anon."
>you wrap a knuckle against the helmet and smile
"Love you too, Kendra."
>for now you have the day to relax before your first day tomorrow
>most of it is spent with her, of course
>you take her on a walk down the long road and back again
>browse through your old tablet for more suits she could occupy
>Kendra has an eye on an industrial model that's close enough to her old body to make her happy
>the price tag justifies your new job all the more
“At the rate I’m saving, it’d take at least another year and a half to save up that kinda cash. That’s not even planning for emergencies.”
>Kendra begrudgingly accepts that point
>”Fine. But if trouble comes of it, you’re staying home again. If it takes a decade, your safety is more important than money.”
>you turn her about so you can smile for her, and then kiss the top of the helmet
“Whatever you say, ma’am. Gonna start shaking me down and running me through PT too?”
>you laugh as you drop the helmet back into your lap
>Kendra simulates a ‘hmm’ of consideration
>”You have been getting softer lately. You might not fit in me when I get my new body.”
>you roll your eyes
"Gym memberships cost money. Everything costs money. Money money money..."
>you trail off
>what if there is an emergency?
>something you can't afford?
>you shake your head
>no problem
>you're smart enough to figure it out, and tough enough to survive the worst
>"Is money a problem, Anon? Is there some way I can help?"
"Hm? No, no it's fine K. I'll figure it out."
>you pat the helmet for reassurance
>yours and hers
>"If you like, I could take a look at your financials. Try to organize things. Would that make things easier for you?"
>that doesn't sound like a bad idea
>balancing your accounts was a pain in the ass at the best of times
"Sure, why not? Do you need my password?"
>"No need. I already have access to your accounts through your tablet."
>oh fuck
>red flag
"You...could have done that all along, Kendra?"
>she pings softly
>"Yes, but I waited for your permission to act. Do you still want me to organize your financials?"
>downgrade to an orange flag
>of course she won't go behind your back
>you trust her
"You go ahead, K. Just ask permission before you do anything else, alright?"
>"Of course, Anon. I'll leave your porn where it is."
>you sputter
"What?!"
>Kendra pings again
>"I wish I could laugh right now."
>you sigh and let her fall back into your lap
>that cheap speaker makes every joke dry
"Very funny, K. Don't go in those files or else you'll end up traumatized too."
>you pray that she hasn't already
>should have password protected the file
>"Don't worry, Anon. Your secrets are safe with me."
>fucking hell
>you need to toss your router into an incinerator now
>as a matter of fact, you reach over your desk and grab your tablet to start deleting things
"No looking, K. I swear to god if you say one word about my files I will put your brain in a toaster."
>she remains silent as you finish up destroying your shame
"Sorry if you actually saw any of that. Just uh, ignore it."
>"I do not judge you, Anon. You are my partner."
>that's reassuring, you guess
>still feels weird knowing she's seen your porn
>probably best to ignore it
>she's not got those kind of feelings, being a battle AI
"Well, we can look at the money and the PT tomorrow. I've gotta get up early for work."
>you switch off the tablet and take your AI into your bedroom
>like always, you fall asleep with Kendra wrapped in your arms

>Turn on news
>Anthrostate now mandating two wives per human male
>Age of consent for human men lowered to 14
>Human men now are legally required to have minimum three children per wife
>High court overturned any human male protection, "rape correction" literally enshrined in law

>Anthrostate realizes they don't have enough anthro women to man ratio [only 2:1]
>Start cranking out anthro-bots at a rate of 500,000 a day
>All human men ages 14 and over are now mandated 5 anthro wives and forced to produce a minimum of three per wife.
>Punishment for non-compliance is an extra wife and two weeks rape correction

>neighborhood loli who has a crush on you asks you what your type is, tell her something outrageously sexual and bimboish, looks like something out of a deviant art page
>draws herself as huge tits and ass bimbo and says she will grow up to look like that and marry you
>you laugh and tell her if she does look like that when shes of age you will happily marry her
>only a couple of years later her puberty hits, and it actually happens, she looks like a goddamn sex goddess, any mans jaw would drop if they saw her
>shes not of age, but she is massive and wants you bad, so you agree to start a relationship with her
>she mightve been a virgin but she fucks like a brothel superstar
>youre finally all hers and she cant wait to show you off to her friends

>Caught and raped by waifur during the war
>She captures you as POW and uses your cock and mouth as an output for all her pent-up sexual frustration
>In the end of the war, the German waifurs are victorious and she takes you as her personal conquered trophy husband
>She loves showing you off to everyone and bragging to the other beta females about how you're her perfect fucktoy
>They're jealous of how good your cock and mouth supposedly are, their hungry cunts dripping with lustful envy
>But
>At home she shows her true side
>She is deeply insecure about herself, having been bullied and picked on all her life because she was too small, too ugly, too weak
>They used to tell her she would never get to fuck a human
>She desperately craves to feel powerful and dominant and fears being seen as weak
>She loves you deeply as rough and meqn as she is publicly
>She doesn't know how she could live without you
>As she fucks you brutally on the kitchen table you moan to her how she's powerful and strong and she's the real alpha female, begs her to conquer your cock with her pussy
>As you do you see her absolutely glow with lust and absolutely happiness as you feed her power fantasy
>As she cums in ecstacy she hugs you tightly and nuzzles into your neck
>She nibbles lovingly and whines, not knowing quite what to do with the joy of being validated
>She is so happy, for the first time in her life
>"You make me feel like I'm worth something. Thank you Anon. I love you more than I have ever loved anyone before."

>Its the distant future.
>Genetic engineering is now commonplace, even psychic powers are something that can be reliably created.
>A council of the worlds' most powerful people decide the fate of millions.
>A new machine has been proposed, a computer that will balance and control the world's economy by reading the minds of people across the planet and making adjustments as necessary so economic collapse is impossible.
>Initially, the council is against it as it would be putting the fate of the world in the hands of a machine.
>Strangely however, the council has been slowly changing it's mind, with more and more people voting in favor of building the machine.
>The last major holdout is our protagonist, George-Miles.
>George is a stereotypical Good Ol' Boy. Rich, deeply conservative, and skeptical of all things new and confusing.
>On his way home, we learn about Foxes.
>Genetically engineered super-strong anthro foxes designed to serve and protect humans. Their existence is deeply controversial. There are debates about whether they are truly sapient, and deserve to be treated as people. They are mute, and programmed to be fanatically loyal to their owners.
>Originally, Foxes were all female. Women complained that Foxes were created to be men's sex-pets, so male Foxes were created.
>It has just been revealed that male and female Foxes are capable of reproducing genetically viable offspring without the need for medical assistance, making them a species in their own right.
>George never owned one, he thinks there's something off about them.
>George finally makes it home. It is night.
>He calls for his wife but she does not respond.
>He finds her in bed with a male fox, the various fluids and mussed sheets making it clear what they have been doing.
>She's asleep, but the fox is awake and watches George with a bored expression.
>Numbly, George walks towards his guest bedroom only to discover a female fox lying in bed, gesturing him to join her.
>Instead, George decides he needs a drink.
>He's pouring himself a glass when the vixen sits next to him and grabs his arm.
>He discovers that foxes can talk, through telepathy that requires physical contact.
>George angrily demands to know whats going on, only to be told that the foxes are soliciting him.
>They need him to vote yes on the machine.
>While they need physical contact to talk with humans, since the machine would be psychic itself they would be able to control it remotely.
>George wants to know why this is so important to them.
>She explains that since Foxes are programmed to love and want to protect humans, they feel that humans need to be saved from themselves. Under the Foxes's loving control humans would be able to finally live lives of peace.
>George is having none of it.
>He threatens to tell the world what they are planning, and gets up to leave.
>Her grip tightens.
>She confirms that foxes are in fact much stronger than humans and drags George to the guest bedroom.
>Taunting him that with her psychic powers, she knows he fantasizes about being dominated by a woman far stronger than him.
>Throws him on the bed.
>To keep him from fighting her anymore, she decides to its time to break him.
>She uses her powers to reach into his mind.
>She forces George to relive all his worst moments and greatest fears. Over and over for hours.
>Then she changes things.
>She starts inserting herself into his nightmares, as a heroine in shining armor.
>Saving him at the climax of each dream, until the idea that she is his protector is well and truly ingrained in him.
>By the end, just being seperated from her for a moment is enough to reduce George to tears.
>She rewards him for being a good boy with all the dirty, shameful sex his wife never gave him.
>Once both humans are asleep, the foxes meet up and decide to explore their new house.

>Be janitor in high school
>Still get bullied like you're a student on his first day
>These are your bullies

>eventually snap and decide to rape these two fat snooty bitches
>your plan works and those newly deflowered fat asses are both drooling messes when youre done with them
>the next day youre paranoid about what happened, it was probably a mistake to rape the two most popular girls in the school
>however you do see them in school and make a break for it, only for you to be cornered by the two bitches
>they enjoyed their little first time with you surprisingly, and they want more, oh so much more, or else
>its either giving your body and soul to these girls or life in prison
>they would have full access to you at all times, and they expected you to put in as much effort as you first did when you took these precious pure maidens first times
>by the end of the first week your closet smelled heavily of sex and sweat

>young shotas are often married off and made child husbands to groups of anthros
>if a group of women have their eyes set on a young human shota they can ask his parents if they can marry him and make him theirs
>parents usually accept, whether from pressure or belief that their child will have a better life
>once a shota is married off, the marriage between them all is consummated
>its rough, it is brutal, the young boy will spend endless hours dumping his seed into the women whom are now his wives, he will be used and abused by them until they are happy
>the boy will mostly likely be bed ridden after such an event, but his wives will be sure ti nurse him back to health
>so that they can enjoy him all over again
>the boy will be coddled, loved, spoiled, appreciated, and will grow to love being these anthros husband
>but nights will still be long and arduous, if pleasurable

>report house cat coworker to HR for sexual harassment
>Instead, YOU are the one who gets into trouble for "staring at her tits" and "acting abusive to coworkers" (rejecting her advances)

Toriel devoted herself so much to the well-being of her young son, that she learned how to make oil out of the various products Muffet sells in the Ruins. For what she uses these products for, none would be the wiser, save for her and that young boy who crossed her path one day. Both nude in his room, bathed in the simulated moonlight of the distant city, as he lays himself in her lap, taking one of her obscene, pedowhore breasts, and latches on. As the child drinks from her chest, Toriel applies a generous dollop of this lubricating oil to the boy's meager frame, top to bottom, so very small and delicate, but quite fit to be a precious sweet in her eyes, as she slides her large, pillowy hand down from his chest, to belly and finally, his special place, rubbing his adorable tip between her thumb and finger for hours as he drank.

>After weeks of watching her prey from roofs and alleys, she finally got her chance
>It was his fault for leaving the window unlocked next to the fire escape
>The only thing her little prime meat could see was a shadow and wide, blank, yellow eyes before being ripped out of his bed
>He didn't even have time to yelp before a hand gripped his mouth from under his right arm, sharp claws and rough paw pads digging into his soft, reddening checks while her other arm pinned his left and wrapped around his waist
>The black furred predator swiftly and quietly down the stairs, somehow not slipping under the cold night rain and his panicked kicking
>After bobbing and weaving through a maze of brick and concrete alleys, she finally came to an abrupt halt at a dead end. Years of living in the concrete jungle and evading human detection taught her that here was safe. For her.
>Giving the kid some air, she moved her black paw down his soaked and shivering body to his now tattered pajama pants, leaving her other to hold his back against the bosom of her trenchcoat
>Slipping her claws down, she was met with screaming and flailing as she ripped the leggings and underwear off
>She did not worry. The humans here do not care and wouldn't hear through the stormy city if they did.
>Unflinching, yet keeping her wide, yellow eyes, she grazed his small ball sack with her rough, scarred index's pad

>She repeated the motions, before harshly gripping at his groin.
>She noticed that his breathing was getting course and heavy. Good.
>She squeezed harder, watching him recoil in pain
>With her other arm restraining him across his chest, she dug into the right pec, feeling his nipple under his shirt

Films being remade for Daxy culture:
>Four Weddings and a Funeral literally just ends with the Daxy invasions or something, the whole film being a propaganda lesson in the folly of human-on-human romance.
>Die Hard but it’s a Daxy propaganda film about a lone Daxy trying to save her mate from a pro-human hostage situation, no mention of any heist at all.
>Shape of Water is a period piece taking place during the Daxy Invasion where a shy human falls in love with a Daxy captive in some lab.
>Taken, but it’s about a Daxy ex-soldier trying to get her mate back after he’s kidnapped by Human Women.

>Daxy Version of Pacific Rim
>Movie is pretty similar, except both Raleigh and Mako die during the battle against Otachi and Gypsy Danger is mostly destroyed
>The deaths are framed Mako’s fault as “She did what she could, but she was only a human female.”
>The deaths and almost total destruction of Gypsy Danger are a a crude metaphor about how human women let human men down and the end of the old world.
>Instead of the triple event, Kaiju start pouring out of the rift
>The invasion has begun
>Just it seems doomed, here come the Daxy (at this point, there are no more human women in the movie, even as background characters)
>They can hold back the Kaiju long enough for humanity to get back on its feet
>But they can only hold them off, something bigger is needed to defeat the Kaiju and Precursors
>It turns out that a Daxy and Human Male Drift is incredibly strong, stronger than any other humans Drifting, even twins (metaphor for how Daxy and Human men are meant to be)
>Daxy pledge to help humans build new mechs
>Enter a montage of human men and Daxy working together
>Engineering new Jaegers, building them, training as teams, every part of the building process
>Interspersed with Daxy soldiers bravely and selflessly holding off the Kaiju, but some dying in the process, lives tragically cut short before they could find their beloved human mate
>Finally the new generation of Jaegers are ready, a blending of Daxy and Human physiology
>The lead Jaeger, named Isis Defender, is built from the remains of Gypsy Danger >The symbolism is blunt. Daxy and human men building up from the bones of the old world for a brighter future
>And the names of the new Jaegers being the same as goddesses to make the Daxy’s mission seem divine
>The new Jaegers cut through the kaiju established on Earth, but then come the category V Kaiju
>The only Jaeger not disabled after fighting off the new Kaiju is Isis Defender
>And similar to the movie they have to go down the breach, detonate their Jaeger to seal the passageway.
>They’re attacked by one last Kaiju as they attempt to go down
>They defeat it, but the human male pilot’s life support is damaged and his Daxy co-pilot ejects him, opting to finish the mission despite the risk of death
>Just like the original movie, she accomplishes her mission, sealing the breach and defeating the precursors
>Her damaged escape pod returns to the surface of the water, not giving a reading
>The human male pilot swims over, confessing his love when he that she is dead
>But she wakes up, and the two of them kiss
>She promises she’ll always protect him
>Credits roll
>Originally the Daxy command wanted to stop the release of the movie, citing the fact it shows human women, and often puts men in danger
>But eventually the movie’s popularity among Daxy soldiers in the test screenings and the strong messages of “Daxy and Human Men are meant for eachother” and “Daxy will always protect their mates.” convinced them to release
>And despite being unabashed Pro-Daxy propaganda it was still that much better than Pacific Rim Uprising

>tfw you'll never sit next to your bear wife on the couch, a heavy blanket draped over the two of you as the freezing rain outside batters your windows and thunder booms off in the distance
>In front of you is a cackling fire hastily assembled when the power went out an hour ago
>You dip a spoon into the jar of honey tucked between your legs and retrieve a spoonful of the golden liquid
>You bring it up to your mouth and savor the natural sweetness of the stuff, no wonder she buys it in bulk
>The spoon goes back into the jar but this time you move it to the waiting lips of your ursine wife
>She leans forward and takes the spoon into her mouth, when her head is pulled back not a trace of the honey remained, an impish smile and lick of the lips indicating her satisfaction
>One for you, one for her, one for you, one for her
>A deafening clap of thunder rumbles through the house while a bolt of lightning strikes dangerously close briefly lighting up the darkened room
>Her rounded ears flatten against her head while her powerful arms wrap around you in a protective reflex pushing your back against her plushy chest
>Her grip around your rib cage isn't quite bone crushing but the claws digging into your sides do make you wince
>Through compressed lungs you manage a soft chuckle and rub the muzzle now sitting on your shoulder
>"Heh, don't worry baby bear, I'll keep you safe" You say half jokingly
>You can't see it, but you can tell there's a smile gracing the muzzle now being aggressively rubbed onto the side of your head

>shark anthros are into shy submissive humans
>not because they can dominate them more easily, though it does help, but because they usually have to deal with roided up dickheads

>"Did I wake you?"

>"Shhhh, just go back to sleep."
>"Who are you?" you mumble.
> "Just a lady grabbing a late night snack, is all. You left your window unlocked, why that's practically an invitation!" is the cheeky response you get.
>You try to raise yourself up, only to realize your uninvited guest is laying across you, her arms and legs pinning you to the bed.
>"Now, now. No struggling. I've caught you fair and square."
>"I'm not greedy, I know how to take just what I need. Just let me take my dinner and I'll be out of your hair"

>>"Be sure and leave your window open again sometime, never know when a starving lady is passing by, eh? Also, drink some more water, was fucken hard finding a proper vein."

>something stirs in the back of your mind and in your stomach
>before you know it, it's overpowering you
>Your higher thinking is assaulted with the hazy memories of your captivity, smeared into a single kaleidoscope image of beatings, broken fingers, and grey/black striped fur.
>you clench your head and stagger as the mental assault drowns out your senses
>your relatively petite waifur/battlebuddy/etc. reaches for you in concern
>but it doesn't last long
>in another second, your lower order, base instincts have control of you, driven by some intent completely foreign to you, it hates the anthro in front of it
>With an emotionless expression, and stone cold conviction, you subdue (disarm?) your partner, as your ego regains some cohesion
>By the time you realize what's going on, your hands are pinning them to the wall and reaching under their clothes
>Horrified, you focus all your willpower on just getting your fingers to loosen, but this hatred that burns away inside your brain-stem is something separate to yourself
>Somehow even the gut-wrenching face of betrayal that stares into yours, worn by someone you care about more than anyone still can't displace the sadistic smile worn by that grey/black feline, clear as it was all those months ago.

"Again."
>the soft voice of the snow leopard standing next to the bank of CRT screens in front of you paints a stark contrast compared to the rest of your surroundings.
>the facility you were being held in had obviously been abandoned for some time before being repurposed by Groznian forces as an interment camp.
>beige paint peeling off of cinderblock walls, long halls, and large holding rooms suggested that it had once been an elementary school.
>they had restored power at least, that much was made obvious by the cold glow of the halogen lamps stuck to the drop ceiling.
>The CRT's crackled back to life as she spoke, flashing the first portion of the task being demanded of you once again.
>You read the single digit projected on one of the screens in a dejected tone:
"One."
>it was hard to speak with your arms chained above your head, but the blue eyes of that snow leopard in the lab coat watched you expectantly.
>you croaked out the rest of the now familiar sequence of numbers as they appeared randomly on one of the screens in front of you.
"Seventeen. Six. Thirty two. Twenty seven. Eighty three. Four."
>you finished with a sigh. Clenching your teeth, you braced for what you knew was coming.
"Good boy..."
>Coo'd the leopard as she stepped towards you, her sadistic smile obvious in her voice alone.
*CRACK*
>You feel the distinct roughness of her paw pads as she smacks you across the face.
>The sting fades quickly though, compared to the bruises that cover your body.
>now standing next to you, the leopard begins to idly play with the tattered Groznean battle fatigues that you've been dressed in.
>you turn away, but watch from the conrer of your eye as she unconcously licks her lips while gently running a claw across an exposed section of your torso.
>she slowly wraps one of her arms around your waist, but you wince when she suddenly digs her claws into your hip as she pulls in close.
"I think that's enough for now. You did such a good job, but there's something else I want to try with you today."
>she purred, pressing her face into your neck, deliberatly forcing her hot breath down the back of your shirt.
>you barely cared, your cell was almost as bad.
>she took a key from her pocket, and reaching above your head, freed you from the cuffs that held you upright.
>you almost caught yourself as you fell, but one of your knees gave out after a moment.
>the leopard caught you under one arm, gracefully pulling it over her shoulders as she released your restraints.
"There you are... good boy..."
>she coos again into your ear, savouring pained groan that escapes you as your weight shifts.
>Adjusting her lab coat, she begins half guiding, half carring you out the door, and down the hall.
>this time however, she skips the turn down the hall leading towards general prisoner quarters.
>another left turn, through a set of double doors and the buildings familiar state of the disrepair is significantly diminished.
>nothing approaching welcoming, but it looks like they've put a fresh coat of the that oppressive off-beige colour on the walls.
>you hear idle chatter ahead and realize that this must be the guards quarters.
>barely lifting your head, you glance around and see the smug looks and occasional chuckles from humans and anthros wearing the same uniform as the leopard who carried you.
>You almost trip when she stops to talk to another guard, but her arm around your waist catches you.
"Don't make me regret this, Neva."
>said a gruff, unfamiliar voice.
>the leopard who held you at her side laughed sharply before responding.
"HA! You saw the results of the preliminary trial, colonel. Dr. Spivak is very good at what they do."
>the first speaker only grunted in reply.
>Neva. You were almost surprised that she had a name at all.
>somehow it made her seem that much more cruel, showing how proud she was of the handywork displayed at her side.
"You know Stoyan, there's some real tactical value in playing with your food."
>her only reply was another, slightly angrier grunt.
>she turned away, and continued mostly carrying you down the hall past the rest of the guards.
>stopping at the end of the hall in front of a door bearing a red cross, she knocked.
>the door was answered by a female anthro, another large feline.
>but being so close, you could only see her lower paws sticking out from a pair of OR scrub pants, draped in a lab coat.
>they spoke what you assumed to be Groznian, but you couldn't tell the difference between the regional languages.
>though you were sure that you didn't like the "doctors" tone of voice when she handed something to Neva.
>you were especially sure that you didn't like the deep chuckle that Neva did while stashing it in a shirt pocket.
>the door in front of you closed gently as Neva turned you both back down the hall the way you had come.
>You only went one door down though, Neva opening the room next door to the dr's office lead you inside.

>she reached for her shirt pocket, and you noticed a small orange tube, roughly the size of a marker clipped inside.
>as she pulled it from her pocket and uncapped it, you recognized it as an epi-pen style auto-injector.
"Stay still baby, you're not going to enjoy this."
>this time however, she skips the turn down the hall leading towards general prisoner quarters.
>another left turn, through a set of double doors and the buildings familiar state of the disrepair is significantly diminished.
>nothing approaching welcoming, but it looks like they've put a fresh coat of the that oppressive off-beige colour on the walls.
>you hear idle chatter ahead and realize that this must be the guards quarters.
>barely lifting your head, you glance around and see the smug looks and occasional chuckles from humans and anthros wearing the same uniform as the leopard who carried you.
>You almost trip when she stops to talk to another guard, but her arm around your waist catches you.
"Don't make me regret this, Neva."
>said a gruff, unfamiliar voice.
>the leopard who held you at her side laughed sharply before responding.
"HA! You saw the results of the preliminary trial, colonel. Dr. Spivak is very good at what they do."
>the first speaker only grunted in reply.
>Neva. You were almost surprised that she had a name at all.
>somehow it made her seem that much more cruel, showing how proud she was of the handywork displayed at her side.
"You know Stoyan, there's some real tactical value in playing with your food."
>her only reply was another, slightly angrier grunt.
>she turned away, and continued mostly carrying you down the hall past the rest of the guards.
>stopping at the end of the hall in front of a door bearing a red cross, she knocked.
>the door was answered by a female anthro, another large feline.
>but being so close, you could only see her lower paws sticking out from a pair of OR scrub pants, draped in a lab coat.
>they spoke what you assumed to be Groznian, but you couldn't tell the difference between the regional languages.
>though you were sure that you didn't like the "doctors" tone of voice when she handed something to Neva.
>you were especially sure that you didn't like the deep chuckle that Neva did while stashing it in a shirt pocket.
>the door in front of you closed gently as Neva turned you both back down the hall the way you had come.
>You only went one door down though, Neva opening the room next door to the dr's office lead you inside.
>the room was mostly taken up by 2 large beds, though a cardiogram cart stood in the corner, next to a pair of desks.

>as she pulled it from her pocket and uncapped it, you recognized it as an epi-pen style auto-injector.
"Stay still baby, you're not going to enjoy this."
>Another, wider grin than before crept across her face as she pulled you close in her embrace.
>you felt a sharp pinch on the back of your left shoulder, and an unpleasant, prickly feeling spread across your body from the injection site.
"Shh.. shh.. good boy..."
>Neva coo'd once again right into your ear, dropping the injector and stroking the back of your head with her hand.
>your body began to feel heavier, and it wasn't long before most of your weight was being held by the embracing leopard.
"Lets lay down" she said.
>guiding you to the closer of the 2 beds, she sat you down, took off your tattered shirt and pants, tucking you into her bed in the only clothes that were actually yours. your boxers.
>It was the first time you had laid on anything but concrete or wood in 5 weeks, but it wasn't a restful experience.
>Your body was aching now. A cold sweat began to dampen your forhead, and your joints felt like sandpaper when they moved.
>your guts felt like snakes, threatening to reject your most recent meal of broth and stale bread.
>what was in that syringe?
>Neva stepped back from the bed, and began undressing.
>You could see that she was smirking at you, and making no effort to hide how slowly she was removing her uniform.
>Admittedly, her time in the field had her body in top condition.
>Lean arms, and a slender build but for her slightly wider hips and powerful thighs.
>She could have been made specifically to run down escapees.
>You could feel your muscles starting to twitch as she stared down confidently at you in her underwear.
>she slowly swept her eyes across your beaten and bruised body half curled up in her bed with a very satisfied expression before walking around to the other side and getting under the covers herself.
>you could feel her breasts push against the back of your shoulders as she curled around you, placeing her chin on top of your head.
>whatever they had given you had traveled through the rest of your systems by now.
>every fiber of your being ached, twiching muscles caused jolts of pain to keep you from resting.
>with every twitch or groan, you could hear Neva giggling softly in your ear.
>she held you close, stroking your hair, or rubbing your stomach. Comforting you, but savouring every moment of your misery.
"Good boy... putting up with so much for me..."
>the way she whispered praise into your ear made you feel sick, because it sounded like she meant it.
>your thoughts seemed more difficult to hold on to as your head began to swim.
>you could feel Nevas chest vibrate against yours as she started to purr.
>you also noticed a spot of warmth on the small of your back, and realized that she was grinding her crotch on the ridges of your spine.
>her breathing got heavier as she slid one of her paws into her panties, sinking claws into your pec with the other.
>a soft moan escaped her before she began to slowly wrap her jaws around the area where your neck and shoulder met.
>she chewed softly, leaving tender bite marks on your skin between breaks of whispering twisted praise into your ear.
>you felt her begin to twitch more frequently, and fighting the fog that clouded your thoughts you realized that she was about to cum.
>the conclusion sent a wave of dread washing over you.
>you barely had time to wonder why before gut instinct was proven correct.
>Neva tensed up, sinking her teeth into your shoulder as she reached her climax.
>the arm that she had wrapped around your chest was so tight that you could barely breathe, squeezing a loud painful groan out of you.
>you felt the blood run your shoulder blade, but it didn't seem like she had bitten you as deeply as you had first thought.
>she lapped at the area just below where the blood ran towards the bedsheets.
>reaching for the shelf above the bed, she produced a small gause pad and stemmed the bleeding of the small punctures she had left on your skin.
"Such a brave soldier... Now... isn't that better?"
>she mocked you lovingly as she finished tending to your shoulder.
"This is the first bed you've felt in what, 4 weeks? Does it feel nice to lay somewhere warm, anon?"
>you tried to answer yes, even if it was a lie, but found that you couldn't. you could barely coordinate making a fist, let alone speech.
>what the fuck was in that syringe?
"Yea? I bet it does. I bet I can think of something else that would feel nice too... what do you say cutie?"
>you don't really know why you bothered, but you made another attempt at speech to say no to her imminent advances.
>the only real noise you made was a pathetic whimper, eliciting another substantial giggle from Neva.
"Yea? I thought so. Good boy..."
>one of her paws crept up your neck, fingertips reaching to caress your chin, while the other took its time working its way down and into your boxers.
>Your brain reeled in a narcotic haze, as her gentle but unwelcome touch played against the horrible sensations of nauesa and cold sweats racked your body.
>her fingers leisurely crept around inside your shorts, winding between the sensitive folds of skin that she found there.
>she giggled softly as you felt your cock begin to swell under her paws.
>her giggling gave way to a genuinely sultry whisper that seemed genuinely impressed.
"Oh my... what do we have here?"
>she curled the index finger and thumb of her right hand around the base of your shaft, only a little to hard.
>her hand on your chin continued to climb until she cradled your head in a gentle almost headlock.
>her claws retracted, a soft finger caressed your ear.
>her grip on your cock loosened slightly as she began to slowly stroke up and down.
>you felt a soft bump on the back of your head, and you could feel her inhaling the scent of your hair.
>she exhaled your scent with a deep shuddering purr.
>a pained gasp escaped you yet again as your guts twisted.
>you felt her pawpads spread across your cheek as her hand slid towards your mouth.
>Neva took advantage of your ragged breathing to push her index finger between your upper gum and lip
>it was obvious how much she enjoyed the fact there was nothing you could do about it.
>she curled the fingers of her other hand around your dick now as well, and began to stroke more vigorously.
>the slightly rough surface of the pawpads on her other hand was much more stimulating there however.
>her gentle grip barely pressed them into the skin of your shaft, and the softness of the flesh underneath cushioned the surface from below.
>she brought her hand up to the end of your shaft, and twisted it around the head slightly.
>the tender caress sent waves of pleasure across your body.
>the dopamine centres of your brain lit up for the first time it months.
>yet at the same time, she stroking of her hand was like sandpaper.
>the cold, aching sweat that gripped you made everything your senses picked up an agony.
>the sound of her voice simultaneously slid through your ear canal like a warm drink, and rang your head like a bell with each "s" or "p" syllable.
>her finger in your mouth felt like a file scraping at your gums, yet more intimate than anything you could imagine.
>she slowed the motion of her other hand, but tightened her grip significantly.
>you shuddered under the increased abrasive force.
>Neva giggled again, pressing down on your rib-cage with her left elbow.
>you whimpered as she pressed into a deep bruise.
>worse than that was the way that the pain was starting to compliment the feeling of her hand pleasuring your cock.
>you were barely coherent enough to be disgusted with yourself.
>she withdrew the finger from your mouth, and slid the crook of the thumb and index finger under your chin.
>with a gentle squeeze of your cheeks that felt like it could leave a welt, she slid her hand back down your neck onto your chest.
>it was clear that she was in no hurry to finish you.
>your brain didn't last as long as your dick did.
>she continued to edge you for nearly an hour, but you were gone barely more than 20 minutes after she first slid her hand into your boxers.
>taking all the time she wanted, she rolled you over towards her, pressing your face into her breasts.
>you barely noticed.
>by this time your senses were little more than a haze of TV static.
>pain and pleasure blended into a fuzzy grey that pressed onto your brain with what felt like the pressure of the ocean.
>taking your hand in hers, and placing it in her panties, she pushed against you.
>not that you could tell.
>pushing and grinding against you, she found a rhythm that rubbed her clitoris against one of your fingers.
>after getting herself off once more on your hand, she finally decided that she was satisfied for the night.
"Are you ready baby?"
>you didn't even realize she spoke.
>the pace of her stroking picked up a much more purposeful cadence.
>it didn't take long after she decided to finish you before she could tell that you were getting close.
>she pushed down the front of your boxers, exposing your erect cock.
>pulling in close just before you came, she slipped its head into panties just far enough to spread the lips underneath few millimetres.
>the warm, comforting darkness as you came was the first distinct feeling you had gotten in over half an hour.
>muscles across your body contracted as you pumped your hot load into her panties.
"ooohhh anon..."
>she moaned as the warmth flooded her underwear.
>the effect that the muscle spasm had on you was immediate however.
>the comforting blackness that began to embrace you was shattered by the white hot pain that wracked you.
>your eyes burned under the searing sensation, ears ringing like airhorns.
>you didn't even know that you had begun to cry.
>Neva, hands now free wrapped her right arm around your waist, and threading her left arm underneath you, slid her hand up the back of your neck.
>threading her fingers into your hair, she massaged your scalp.
"Shh... it's alright baby... let it out..."
>she coo'd into your ear as you sobbed into her chest.
>the intensity of before had subsided to the crushing TV static of before.
>her petting of your hair trailed off as she drifted off.
>supremely satisfied expression fixed to her face as she feel asleep to the sound of your crying.
>the contents of that orange syringe continued to course through you, and you sobbed for around another hour before you finally fell asleep in Neva's arms.
>Neva opened the heavy double doors, and led you back into the more familiar, decrepit section of the complex.
>she took you back through the unkempt halls to the room with the bank of CRT screens that you knew too well.
>opening it's windowless door, she lifted you off your weight slightly, as your feet began to instinctually resist entry.
>the scene that greeted you this time was slightly different however.
>aside from the familiar metal table, 3x4 bank of CRT's, and shackles hanging from the ceiling, there was array of modern looking medical equipment now as well.
>a cardiogram cart similar to the one you had seen that morning now stood next to the table on the left wall, and a small fridge had been brought in.
>Neva led you to roughly the centre of the room, and you expected her to lift your arms into the hanging restraints.
>instead, she cuffed one of your wrists to the other behind your back.
"Now, don't move, Anon."
>she said, standing you in the middle of the room.
>the bank of CRT's was to your front, and the door in the corner behind you on your right.
>stepping over to the table on your left, Neva began to prepare something she took from the cart as she passed.
>you stood, barefoot on the cold tiles as she worked in silence.
>she had to be deliberately letting you stew in anticipation
>just then, a noise came from behind you, and you turned to look automatically.
>Stoyan bowed his head slightly to fit through the doorway and entered.
>you shared an awkward look for a second, before Neva's voice called your attention back to your front.
"Anon?"
>she asked softly, and you turned back to face your original direction.
*CRACK*
>her hand met your face in the opposite direction as you turned, hitting you hard across the face.
>you stumbled back in surprise.
"I thought I told you not to move, Anon."
>she said in her disappointed-kindergarten-teacher voice again, grabbing a handful of the front of your jacket to stop you.
>Stoyan watched her with a look of disgust, before walking past your other side to the bank of CRT's.
>he leaned down and examined some of the playback equipment that they were rigged up to.
>your puzzled watching was interrupted however, by a mechanical clicking sound coming from behind you again.
>you remained facing the CRT's however, red paw print on your face still stinging.
"Stoyan and I were chatting..."
>came Neva's voice from behind you.
"And he was telling me about how he doesn't think this is a very good idea."
>her voice was casual as ever, but a grim expression crossed Stoyan's face as he turned to look at her.
>as he did so, she grabbed a handful of hair on the back of your head.
>before she had finished her sentence, she had used it to force you painfully to your knees and bent you slightly forwards.
>you grit teeth as they hit the tile hard, causing tears to well in your eyes.
"I've argued and argued with him, but he doesn't seem to think you're worth the investment."
>she said, her voice far too blasé for what she was saying.
>that's when the next sound you heard made your blood run cold.
>the unmistakable sound of a shotgun being racked came from less than 2 feet behind your head.
>where did she get that? was it in the room when you came in?
>Stoyan had straightened up, and took a half step towards her, but stopped.
>he did his best to cover the caution on his face with contempt, but it didn't quite work.
"Neva..."
>he said in a low growl.
>but she ignored him and continued talking:
"It really is a shame, but... orders are orders..."
>she said the last words very slowly, their inflection betraying her wide-mouthed smile.
>your brain froze as she did so, feeling a spot of cold rounded metal touch the back of your head slightly off centre, pushing it forwards.
>your eyes bulged in terror, and your breath caught in your chest as she bumped the muzzle of the shotgun against the back of your head.
>Stoyans eyes grew wide, fear now openly worn on his face.
>He drew in breath to shout as he raised on of his fists, but Neva interrupted him.
>feeling the muzzle brush past your hair as she let it fall to her side, Neva erupted with laughter.
"HAHAHAHAHA! Stoyan! You should have seen the look on your face!"
>she roared.
"You *actually* thought I was going to kill him! And you CARED! AHAHAHAHAHA!"
>laughter redoubling as she finished her sentence.
>Stoyan only glared back, hands balled into fists at his sides.
"Sure you want to stay?"
>she asked him, as her laughter subsided.
"'Course I fucking don't." he snarled "But you're not getting rid of me that easy."
>Neva gave another laugh, much colder and sharper this time.
"Ha! Have it your way, colonel."
>she turned back towards the table that she was working on before and placed what you now saw to be a Benelli Super-90.
>A short, tactical shotgun intended for police use, it had replaced the long rifle-style buttstock for a pistol grip.
>Stoyan took a half step back again, returning to the position he was in before raising his fist at Neva.
>you remained kneeling on the floor, still frozen from the trauma of believing your childhood memories were about to be turned into floor-jam.
>it wasn't long before Neva stood next to you again, lifting you up under one arm, she stood you on your feet again.
>your knees shook as adrenaline still coursed through you.
"Silly Stoyan..."
>she said softly in your ear as she undid your cuffs.
"He should know better than to think I could hurt my sweet Anon..."
>the irony of that line somehow brought you back to earth, and you glanced in confusion at Stoyan, who only looked at Neva with poorly disguised disgust.
>she ran a soft finger up your arm as she lifted it into one of the hanging shackles like she usually did.

>get abducted (maybe POW? dissident?)
>have unspeakable MK-ULTRA type stuff done to you by grey/white/black snow leopard/tiger lady in a lab coat.
>get dumped somewhere conspicuous, obviously injured
>brought to hospital, no memory of your captivity
>hospital say ends without incident, return to home group (military? other dissidents? family?)
>months later, "hey babe phones for you" hacked comms, hacked computer, doesn't matter as long as you hear all of it.
"1 17 6 32 27 83 4"
>something stirs in the back of your mind and in your stomach
>before you know it, it's overpowering you
>Your higher thinking is assaulted with the hazy memories of your captivity, smeared into a single kaleidoscope image of beatings, broken fingers, and grey/black striped fur.
>you clench your head and stagger as the mental assault drowns out your senses
>your relatively petite waifur/battlebuddy/etc. reaches for you in concern
>but it doesn't last long
>in another second, your lower order, base instincts have control of you. Driven by some intent completely foreign to you, it hates the anthro in front of it
>With an emotionless expression, and stone cold conviction, you subdue (disarm?) your partner, as your ego regains some cohesion
>By the time you realize what's going on, your hands are pinning them to the wall and reaching under their clothes
>Horrified, you focus all your willpower on just getting your fingers to loosen, but this hatred that burns away inside your brain-stem is something separate to yourself
>Somehow even the gut-wrenching face of betrayal that stares into yours, worn by someone you care about more than anyone still can't displace the sadistic smile worn by that grey/black feline, clear as it was 10 months ago.

> *God, it smells like musk in here
> *I bet that fox was the one who stole my pillow again
> *I can hear her masturbating up there. I bet she knows I'm awake.
> *The captain grabbed my ass again today. She probably threw away my transfer request
> *I should have listened to my uncle and joined the air force
> *How long is it until shore leave again?
> *Dammit, I know she drops her tail down here on purpose
> *I haven't showered in days. I know they're waiting for me
> *I miss my xbox
> *Three more years of this shit...
> *Oh god, it's my other roommate, what does she want now?

The back of the M113 was cramped, like all the other armoured shitboxes the army rode around in. You always hated rolling in anything heavier than a jeep. Your partner didn't seem to mind though. She sat across from you, a faint smirk on her face as she sat comfortably, watching your helmet rattle the roof of the compartment. Her helmet sat in her lap, and in the meantime, her blond ponytail was stuck through the back of a plain olive coloured baseball cap. She was short, canine anthro about 5'2" tall, with athletic build, and yellow fur. A white patch stretched from the bottom of her chin, over her B-cup chest, down her stomach, and across her inner arms and thighs. She often joked about how her breast size saved her career, as it was small enough to make wearing body armour a non-issue. Your lanky frame was agile and well just as well positioned for gunfighting, but the logistics of armoured transport did not agree with you. Still, the siege of Srebrenica was ongoing, and command was still on edge about a potential data breach. Better safe than sorry, but you suspected an emergency dismount would amount to little more than a life-or-death game of twister. You had to admit though, many things had gone suspiciously well for the Groznean forces over the past year. They still had yet to break the siege, the 83rd mountain division from neighbouring Svalmida was making sure of that.Svalmadia was the more developed nation overall. A population consisting of roughly 60% human and 40% anthro enjoyed a slightly higher literacy rate, and a GDP almost 4x the size of Grozneas. . It's military was mostly professional, and very well equipped. Despite being slightly outnumbered by forces deployed by the Groznean Security Council, they could usually count on enjoying local fire superiority. The Grozneans on the contrary, were a more loosely organized militia force, consisting of about 65% human and 35% anthro population.
They were highly ideologically driven and fought ferociously, but sorely lacked heavier equipment. Still, every time it seemed like Sval forces were beginning to exploit a break in Groznean lines, they had to be called back to respond to an urgent defence of some critical infrastructure. The Svalmadians were becoming increasingly frustrated as every time they moved in secret, their enemy seemed completely unaware, except when it mattered the most. You didn't take the rumors about a Groznean computer virus scooping up and decoding radio traffic seriously. After all, it was 1992, and you could barely believe how compact computers were getting, but the smallest one capable of doing that kind of real time data processing stil occupied an entire floor at the MIT dep. of computer science. But then again, command still wasn't sure how that Groznean SoF team knew to be there that night when you... Your felt your stomach drop for a moment, but quickly regain your composure. You still had no recollection of that night, or really anything that took place during the almost exactly 2 months following. You try to focus on something else, but the scene forcibly replays itself in your mind. The snow on the windshield, the mundane rumble of an ugly diesel engine, and then... a mine? an ambush? You couldn't remember. When you didn't arrive at Site 44 the next day, the search party sent out after you found your truck within 40 minutes. It was still upright, and even still on the road, but had been completely burned out. The equipment you were carrying was burned with the truck, but you were nowhere to be found. That was until 8 weeks and 2 days later, and your first memory since your drive to Site 44.
You slowly awoke to find yourself lying in a crumpled heap, in a parking lot outside a Svalmadian apartment building. You were dressed in the same generic UN fatigues you had been wearing, but they were oddly pristine. Doubly so compared to your own condition. Trying to pick yourself up reveals that both of your legs are broken, as is one of your arms. Tired, confused, and badly bleeding, you felt little need to assess your surroundings, so you lay back down to die. Barely 60 seconds after your ill-fated attempt to stand a woman’s voice cries out towards you. A canine anthro walking to her car calls out in what you think is Svalmadian. You thought those booklets of local phrases handed out by command were a waste of paper. You changed your mind. "Pomozite mi!" you shout as loud as you can. It's barely above a whisper, but it's enough. Before you know it, you're whisked off in an ambulance to the nearest trauma unit. Another day later, and you're being transferred to St. Katherine's, the hospital that the peacekeeping forces had been running most of their medical operations from.

>You’ll never be in your adoptive anthro mom’s car on the way home from the orphanage when she swerves into a secluded forest road.
>You’ll never experience her parking, checking to see if anyone’s looking, and then tearing your pants off to squeeze your cock between her tits.
>You’ll never be forced to cum until you pass out and then wake up in her bed with her.
>You’ll never be homeschooled since she spends all day raping you to mold you into her perfect husband/sex slave

>Secret Agent Anon vs Colonel Vulpina
>Regular back and forth where Anon is sent to foil her schemes for world domination.
>The schemes are usually just an excuse to catch and spend time with agent Anon, often asking for chin scratches and pretending to be husband and wife.
>Anon usually distracts her with intense love making sessions, though it does throw out his back every once in a while. The cuffs were a bit tight too.
>Usually sneaks off and ruins whatever plan she has whilst she's still woozy from the "distraction".
>She often also uses ninjas to plant spy cameras in his agency-funded home.
>Vulpina even has a secret anon shrine, Hey Arnold's Helga style. Her minions tease her about it, but not out loud for fear of being thrown into the shark pit.
>She also has a "shark pit", which are just full of her shark henchwomen doped up with aphrodisiacs. Though it's a last resort to persuade Anon into following her demands.

>you lie in ambush, crouched behind a stall in the barn
>waiting for your quarry to return from work in the fields
>you hear the side door to the barn swing open, and the trot of hooves on the dirt floor
>springing from your hiding place, you charge down the horse woman who failed to spot your clever ambush
"Attaaaaack!"
>you hurl yourself into her back, wrapping your arms around her in a full-body tackle
>she stumbles forward a couple steps
>then stops
>you heave against her bulk, fingers digging through exposed fur against her taut abs
>but she doesn't budge
>"Why!"
>the horse whips her tail, swatting it across your face
>"I do believe I just felt something. Did a calf get into the barn and stumble into my backside?"
>you're swung about as she dramatically spins about to check behind her
>you manage to hold your grip, and even stay on your feet
>"Hmm, can't be that. Far too weak for a calf."
>though your feet dig into the ground and you push with all your might, you can't get a reaction out of her
>"Perhaps it's just a tiny little fly bumping into me..."
>her tail whips you again
"You'll pay for that!"
>you switch tactics, going from pushing to pulling
>the horse sways, but no more
>"I suppose I'll just have to sit down and have a think on it."
>before you can escape, she leans back into you, then falls back into a sitting position
>you're pinned beneath her, with a heavy horse rear planted on your chest
"Oof! Okay, okay, I give Darla, I give!"
>Darla turns her head to look down at you, and gasps as though not expecting to see the human she's sitting on
>"Why look at that! It's Anon!"
>her accent draws your name out into 'Ay-nawn'
>you love hearing her say it like that
>"Wherever did you come from?"
>her tail swats you again, and she nickers in amusement
"I used my brilliant tactical mind to ambush you!"
>Darla snorts
>"Taking after your brother, I see. How was the wedding?"
>you grip her thighs, and try to push her off
"I'll tell you once your get your massive rump offa me!"
>"You sure weren't complainin' last time I was on toppa you~"
>Darla giggles before acquiescing,
>she scoots off of you so you can sit up next to her
"Did you get bigger while I was away? Eat too many carrots?"
>ignoring your teasing and laugher, Darla puts a strong arm around you and drags you to sit between her legs
>you rest back against your equine lover and sigh
"The wedding was fine. Zeke was happy to see the family again, and I was glad to see him 'course."
>"And your ma?"
>your mood sours
"Ma was just glad he was marrying into 'proper society'. Kept prodding me to find some dainty human girl to dance with."
>you take Darla's other hand to pull her arm around you as well
"Wish you could have been there. You're the only girl I wanna dance with."
>that makes Darla chuff through her nose, ruffling your hair with her breath
>"The day you get me in one of those godawful gowns is the day I keel over and die, little man. 'Sides, your ma barely tolerated us bein friends. If she found out what we really get up to..."
>you know exactly what would happen
>'taking up with the animals' as they called it would leave a stain on our family's reputation
>one that would earn you expulsion from your home, family, and entire life
"I don't care. I love you Darla."
>she coos and rests her head atop yours
>"Ain't you just a plain romantic? You'll be romantic and starvin'."
>you grunt and pull her arms tighter around you
>why did she have to worry so damn much?
>you just want to be happy with her
>Darla gives you a squeeze
>"Aww, don't be blue dear, I'm just lookin' out for you. Why don't we go down by the creek and you can help me wash off. I worked up quite a sweat today~"
>Darla pulls you up to stand with her, then sweeps your legs out to hold in a bridal carry
>and she makes sure to press you against her chest with a sly grin
>"There's a smile from my little man."
>Darla sneaks you off the property, into the woods where the two of you played since you were kids
>where you shared your first kiss
>where you first declared your love for her
>the babbling of the creek makes pleasant background noise as Darla deposits you on mossy earth beside the water
>"You don't know how bad it got, waiting for you to come home."
>she starts stripping out of her sweat-soaked clothes
>her work shirt goes first, and her heavy breasts fall free, black nipples hard against soft brown fur
>no matter how many times you see them, you're always awestruck
>"No free shows, little man. I better see some skin!"
>Darla covers her breasts with crossed arms
>you nod and get to work unbuttoning your cotton shirt
>"That's better~"
>Darla gets back to work undressing
>the pants are the next to go, along with her drawers
>the sight of the mare in her furs is enough to take your breath away
>the muscle and size of hard work, along with curves in all the right places
>her winking cunt soaking her thighs with desire
>you can't help but crawl forward on your knees, intent on pleasuring this goddess
>Darla closes the distance with two short strides, resting a hand on your head and ruffling your hair
>"I've been working real hard, Anon. I need a reward from my favorite little man~"
>you're happy to oblige, trailing kisses up her thighs over her slick fur
>her sweat mingles with arousal creating a scent that leaves your head spinning
>greedily you start to lick at her inner thighs, working your way to your prize
>Darla groans, running fingers through your hair as you work
>having no patience, you plunge your mouth against her sopping equine pussy
>your tongue laps at her folds eagerly
>her juices continue to leak over you, and you swallow whatever lands on your tongue
>her cunt winks against your face as she starts to grind against you
>"God Anon, you're--ah!~--fuck..."
>she whinnies, swinging a leg around your back to trap you while you eat her out
>there's no place you'd rather be than beneath your beautiful mare
>she grinds against your face as you swirl your tongue over her clit
>another gush of pussy juice runs down your chin
>you're glad you took your shirt off
>"Fuck me 'Non. Fuck meee~"
>Darla continues to whinny and moan in pleasure
>she grabs your hair and tugs at it to push you further inter her
>and soon she doubles over to hold your head with both hands
>"Gonna--Nnng-gonna--!"
>is all the warning you git before she finishes, soaking your face in a river of femcum
>you almost drown in it, but never stop pleasuring her
>when she finally lets you go to fall back on the ground, you're soaked from hair to chest
>you're wrapped in her arms again when Darla drops onto your lap and lays atop of you
>she kisses you passionately, before tucking your head into her chest
>"My little man..."
>she dotes on you, stroking your hair while the two of you bask in each other
>you wish you could sit like this the rest of the night
>but there's something you need to do first
>you push against Darla, squirming to get your face free
>she picks herself up enough so she can look down into your eyes
>you reach a hand up, cupping her cheek stroking down her mane
"Darla Maureen, I love you."
>do it now
"Marry me."
>the horse on top of you goes stiff in shock
>her mouth hangs open and she blinks several times
>"A-Anon! Don't you joke like that!"
>you smile wide
"Not joking Darla. I love you, I've always loved you, and I'll always love. I want to spend the rest of my life with you."
>she gasps, tears springing to her eyes
>"You--You can't Anon, your mother--"
"I don't care what my mother thinks, or what Zeke thinks, or anyone else for that matter! Please Darla, I need an answer."
>she starts to cry now, fat tears dropping from her eyes and rolling down her nose
>"Of course Anon. I love you so much."
>you pick your head up and seal the union with a kiss
>you tried to make plans for the wedding in secret
>of course you couldn't invite any of your family
>and you had to find a pastor from out of state that would actually officiate the marriage of an anthro and a human
>but no good thing lasts forever, and by careless word or unlucky overhearing, word got out that the youngest son of the wealthiest family in the county was marrying a mare
>you were out on your own
>"If you want to rut with a beast, you can live with the beasts."
>your mother's gracious offer of letting you live in the servant's housing until you came to your sense
>it didn't matter
>just meant you were closer to your beloved
>when the day of the wedding finally came, it was a tiny event
>just you, Darla, and some of her family members out in the woods by the creek
>a father and brother who both threatened great harm should you ever break Darla's hear
>you had no plans otherwise
>and her mother, who spent the entire morning holding back tears of joy
>you're going over your vows with the old canine pastor when you're suddenly trapped in a headlock
>"Hell's fire! Would you look at you, Anon! Getting married and you don't even invite your own brother!"
>your brother musses your hair with a fist, laughing while you wrestle away from him
"Zeke! What are you doing here?"
>he looks ready for a big event, his cavalryman's uniform pristine, and his moustache trimmed to perfection
>"I can't miss my baby brother's wedding, can I? Darla sent a letter. It's about damn time you made an honest woman of her."
>he laughs at your dumbfounded expression
"You knew?"
>Zeke claps you on the shoulder and smiles warmly
>"Course I did. I known since before you was grown that you two was gonna be together. I'm proud of you."
>you hug him tight
>glad to still have part of your family at your back
"Thank you, Zeke."
>he pats your back
>"Of course, Anon. Now let's get you married!"
>he hurries you to the impromptu altar set up on a raised outcrop of rock and takes a spot beside you to act as best man
>and here comes Darla
>despite all her previous denials, she's clad in the white of a wedding gown
>so beautiful it takes your breath away
"Darla..."
>she smiles sweetly as she stands opposite you
>your love
>your mare
>you barely hear the pastor as he recites the ceremony
>you only have eyes for her
>you barely manage to stumble through the vows the pastor gave you
>the only words that matter are "I do."
>"You may kiss the bride!"
>the pastor announces, to the cheers of the small crowd
>really, the bride kisses you, grabbing you by the lapel and drawing you into her embrace
>you wish this could last forever
>she pulls back, far too soon for you
>but probably better for the guests
>"I love you so much, Anon."
"I love you too, Darla."

>Be only human at anthro school.
>Constantly picked on for being different.
>You catch the eye of a particular bully.
>She likes to humiliate you in front of your peers.
>One day, makes of a big show of stripping off her panties and handing them to you in a public place, daring you to take them home and jack off with them.
>Everyone's egging you on.
>You will never live down this embarrassment.

>she was looking down at your feet.
"Anon! I never knew you wore such big shoes!"
>you can already tell where this is going, but before you can open your mouth, she continues, almost shouting now:
"You're cock must be-"

>she turns as beet red as she can under her straw coloured fur.

>Sam begins to stammer out an apology, but you interrupt her:
"It's alright, Jen. She stopped herself before she finished, she knows its not cool. I'm not upset."
>the look that Jen returns you is much less professional than the one you expected however.
"That's all well and good Anon, but at the right time of year that kind of talk can be enough to push a woman with predatory instincts over the edge."

"You rip food from my hungry sisters mouth then come to me begging for sympathy? You humans are so odd."
>she had said when you finished explaining your request
>you looked down at the ground in disappointment, but not surprise
>the next thing she said took you completely by surprise, and you jerked your head up to look her in the face as she spoke
"I will help you, and all I want in return is a simple kiss."
>the permanent hunger in her eyes seemed to take on a new meaning as the toothy grin spread down from the tip of her snout
"I- I... okay..." you stammered before meekly accepting
>her eyes flashed, perhaps pleasantly surprised herself
>she got up from the log she sat on, and stepped past the fire to look down at you
>her face, now lit from below, somehow made the sinister look she wore before look downright welcoming
>you felt the colour drain from yours as she took a swig from the bottle of homemade vodka in her left hand, eyes turned down to meet yours as she tilted her head up to drink
>her right hand reached out and grabbed your chin, thumb and index finger pressing into both of your cheeks
"Open wide..."
>she said through a gritted smile, holding the mouthful of spirits inside.
>pushing her fingers into the sides of your face, she forced your jaws apart and held them there
>you quickly realized that your bargain had been a mistake
>your eyes darted back and forth in panic as she leaned over you, her face pulling in close
>she opened her mouth slowly, using her tongue as a sort of spout to direct the contents that poured out mostly into yours
"Uwah..." she vocalized as the last of it ran off her teeth
>given little other choice, you closed your eyes and swallowed what you could as she held your head back.
>that was a mistake
>your eyes flew open again in shock as she locked her lips onto yours, and forced her tongue to the back of your throat
>she dropped the now empty bottle in her left hand and grabbed a handful of the front of your jacket, pulling you in closer.
>she leaned further over you, pushing you well over your balance, but holding you up with her handful of your clothes.
>you hadn't gotten the chance to take a breath, and a tightness began to creep up your chest as she refused to let up for air.
>up so close, and with your head turned to the side, only one of her shining yellow eyes was visible.
>it seemed like an eternity that it stared into yours with an unmistakable gleam of triumph.
>she finally released you, and you fell on your back into the damp grass.
"Hehehe..." She gave a low chuckle as she straightened up.
>standing above you as you rolled over coughing and spluttering, her face had mostly retreated back into her hood.
>a pair of yellow eyes shone out of the darkness it created, floating above a long spindly smile that connected to the snout looming out from within.
"You know, I really enjoyed that... Thanks, meat..."

>She pulls you closer
>Her tongue parts your lips and grinds against your teeth
>Reluctantly you open your mouth for her.
>The wide hot tongue quickly makes it's way inside you.
>It extends far back into you, but it stops short.
>The wolf forcefully tilts your head sideways, pushing your face inside her gaping maw.
>You feel her heat radiating on your cheeks
>Her tongue is now exploring the back of your throat
>You feel her sharp teeth pressing into your skin
>Almost threatening you with what they could do if you pull away
>Warm salvia from the roof of her mouth has started to slowly drip on your face
>She adjusts her grip on your skin, carefully moving her teeth and nibbling on different parts of your head
>This goes on for what feels like an eternity

>It all happened so fast.
>One minute you everything is normal, the next minute the roar of trucks fills your ears.
>Raiders have your town surrounded.
>All the major roads are blocked, and off-road vehicles patrol the town's perimeter.
>No escape.
>You were upstairs browsing the internet when the front door burst open.
>You here your father's screams as he's dragged outside.
> In a blind panic, you hide under your bed.
>It's not long before the sound of heavy footsteps on the stairs.
>Then, a scratching at your door.
>"I smell meat." a throaty voice whispers from the other side.
>Slowly, the door knob begins to turn.
>You try to slow your breathing as a figure emerges through the doorway.
>A ratty looking wolfess in dirty clothes, peers into your room before raising her snout and begins sniffing the air.
>A grin crosses her face.
>"I know your in here, meat."

>riding bicycle through the ruins of the city you live in.
>thought to check to see if your school was still standing (it wasn’t).
>walking over the ruble where the East wall of your old classroom was you realize the book you weren’t finished reading was poking out from a pile of bricks.
>for an elective you thought it would be nice to learn the language of one of your neighboring countries.
>you were glad learning German could actually be really helpful considering that you now live in a German city.
>you think why not, so you throw it into your bicycles basket and start to head back home.
>your staring in front of your front tire trying to dodge debris so you don’t notice the woman in front of you until she grabs your handle bars stopping the bike.
>you start to try and ask for forgiveness for bumping into her and to keep you bike and shoes in a way that makes you seem less rapeble, but 2 syllables in she snatches the book from the basket with her large red bony hand
>she asks “do you speak Deutsch“ with a thick accent the “tsch” letting out a thin mist of saliva that lands on your hair because she’s looking over the side of you bike looking down at you.
>You responded as fast as you could but with a pronunciation that was lacking “not very well.”
>she grins and lifts you off the seat with one hand by the shirt collar while the other hand caries the book.
>your bike tips to the ground in the middle of the street.
>she keeps hold of your collar while she walks you across the street toward a mostly intact store front.
>Keeping her arm holding on to you extend outward she routinely shoves you forward becoming impatient with your slower than her walking speed.
>Your terrified of what’s going to happen to you. You recall getting a pamphlet half a week ago telling you not to go out at night and to just comply and be helpful in any way you could.
>you wondered what would have happened if you lied and if you would have been better off.
>She shoves open wooden door with the hand with a book in it. A shop room with boarded up windows. The beams of light between the wooden boards light up tiny floating dust particles. The dark room is full of knocked over shelves scattering home goods across the floor tiles.
>4 foxes in the back corner of the room sat leaning against the walls turn to stare at you with hunger.
>Now being in charge your invaders set up new rules that they advertised on posters all over the city.
>basically they could commandeer any building they wanted, along with a big list of other responsibilities we had for our guests.
>Just because they could why did they have to destroy everything?
>Your mom would make you stop there after school sometimes to pick up stuff to bring home like soap or matches.
>You noticed all the broken glass strewn across the floor and dented boxes. The rations have left so many without, everyone you knew would have been so grateful if given even a small amount of the things they destroyed out of boredom.
>Your feet are reluctant to carry you farther toward them but her grip on your collar keeps pushing you farther causing you to stumble.
>While walking up she gives one final shove sending you tumbling directly into the dark corner. Your hand catches the wall, you spin around and burry yourself into the corner.
>One sit on each side of you one on a chair and another on a green cot sitting on a metal frame.
> She sits down on the cot and tosses the book full of poetry into the one on the chairs lap. She was to busy eyeing you down to notice the book until it landed on her.
>The one that dragged you in was massive, at least 15 centimeters taller than your sister. She had a big coat that she kept open and had a face that exuded arrogance.
>The two on the cot started a conversation that once started took eyes off of you. They spoke to fast and over each other so you could hardly make out any words.
>”where did you” “boy” “it is” where” “book” “hair” “hair is” “translation” and a few other curses you had only heard once or twice before.
>Your eyes darted around trying to keep track of who was speaking at that moment..
>the conversation revolves around the one with the funny hat. A fox would say something to her and then the next one would say something else to her and then she would turn to look at the next one. Sometimes after someone says their statement anther one of the woman or maybe two would try to agree with or retort it while another one of them tries to tell or ask the funny hat lady another thing.
>this all led to them angrily talking over one another leading to precipitation resulting from all the “stchs” and “tsch”es
>They seemingly forgot that you existed to the funny hat one said, “cute something something somethings idea something” that silenced them and made them all turn to face you again. Sitting next to you turned to face you and asked in a inquisitive tone and a thick accent trying to emulate your language, “Are you likings cookies?” The short silence lead to an explosion of laughter before you could even respond.
>You said yes but it was to low for any of them to hear. You knew they were laughing at you and it was a sort of joke, maybe she just translated it wrong or it was just German thing.
>The taller one finished snorting first so she turned her gaze down to you to ask again but this time in her own language. “You like fox cookies?”
>you try and hide your embarrassment and say “JA!” again but this time a bit louder, prouder, and clearer. You said it this way so that they would know that you could understand them and they would stop laughing at you. But it didn’t work.
>You started to become frustrated.
>As the laughing continued you lifted your knees and wrapped your arms around them.
>You started to bury your head between your knees to hide your eyes then a bony clawed hand reached out from your left side and grabbed your chin. She used her thumb to push in your cheek causing your mouth to open slightly. She twisted your head forcing you to make eye contact with her.
>Her free hand held a half empty bottle of wine that used to sit on a shelve behind the shop counter. She said, “stop pouting.” Before using her fingers to push your head back causing you to tilt to the opposite direction.
>The groups diminishing laughter exploded again but louder this time.
>A bit of your face stings where a claw must have nipped you. You are afraid again.
>Catching you in your tilt the fox to your right catches you. She pulls you deeper in your fall. One of her knees digs into your lower back bruising it, but she kicks her leg up to have one leg each side of you. Your head is against her stomach. You try and find a place to put your hands to gain some stability to stop being blown every which way in the wind like a paper bag.
>your hand lands on her thigh, you try and push off of her but you can’t get a good grip on the fabric your hands slip down to the floor tiles. Before you can try and regain lost ground again her arms wrap you. Her cold left hand grazes the skin under your sweater as she grips your pants waist. Her other hand grabs the denim half way down the outside of your thigh.
>Your knees instinctively lock together
>She violently jerked you back into her causing you to Yelp.
>Everyone was once again looking at you and giggled at the funny noise she made the human make.
> Her arms pined your in place to stop you from squirming. She locked her hands together and placed them over your stomach.
Your think about yelling for help but your lips can only quiver.
>She slides her hands deeper down your stomach almost to your private area then she hooks her thumb under the fabric of your sweater and shirt. Your head is pinned between her breasts. You feel the contrast between the rough fabric and her soft cleavage. The smell of cheap cigarettes, sweat, and musk invade you. It feels so wrong. No one has ever held you close like that, at least not since you were little. You didn’t know that foxes smelt like that. You used to play wrestle with your sister before she left to join the war and she didn’t smell like that.
>One of her cold hands glides up the side of your stomach sprawling out her fingers as wide as she can to take up as much surface area as possible, warping half way around your entire waist.
>She pulled her muzzle out of your hair and moved it down the side of your face toward your ear.
>She says is German, “ You must not like the way your mom cooks, your so skinny.”
>the other four are laughing again but this time not as loud. They are all moved hunched in to look over you.
>A faint yellow glow surrounds them all as somewhere outside the sun is just starting to set. For a brief moment you think about everywhere else on the planet that isn’t the dusty floor of a old shop you used to go to in a bombed out city. You think about what your red bike would look like lit up by the yellow sunlight and if there are people upstairs that could here them laughing. You thought about your bed room and wondered where your sister was at.
>The one on the chair slowly slid off of it and lowered herself to the floor.
>In German she asked, “maybe he likes his fox cookies with milk?”
>The drunk one audibly exhaled through her nose and the one holding you chuckled.
>The ones on the cot also began to lower themselves onto the floor and scoot closer.
>The fox with the funny hat asked you a question, “do you like to read?”
>The tall scary one reached into a fold in her jacket and produced a orange pamphlet folded in half. She hand already opened it, but it’s original contents was still inside.
>She took out the part of the contents and tossed it over her shoulder as all of them nudged in closer.
>One of the hands exploring your stomach retracted itself to grab the paper. She used one hand to unfold it and present it to you.
>It was written in your language, you skimmed the writing best you could it was weird and hard to read because of the wall of flesh and fur blocking the light.
>The lady with the strange hat began to speak, “Can you help us read this? Very important. My friends are bad at speaking to your people. You can help us say it our language. You can help us or you will be in trouble.”
>The woman surrounding you looked terrifying. They looked like they were going to hurt you if you didn’t read it.
>The pamphlet said, “All male citizens, as retribution for the rebellion of your peoples you will be had at will, and will be kept if it pleases those who have had you.”
>You translate it the best you can, “All men, as something-“ the hat lady corrects your error, “retribution.” Everyone laughs again which makes you scared. The large one scoots over to where the drunk one was. She moved her out the way so the tall one could sit at your feet and face you.
>Her eyes scared you so you stared at the pamphlet.
>”for the fighting of my people, you will be taken at want. And will be kept if it is good to the one who took you.” The large fox leaned forward and positioned herself over the ends of your feet. “Claiming will be done and not resisted.”
>She lunged herself over top of you. As you yelped? You tried to block her body weight with your arms but the woman behind you pulled them over your head with one hand holding your wrist together the other one inside of herself.
She quickly transferred your hands to the woman on top of you as she slinked off to where the other 3 was watching.
>the huge fox used her hand to disrobe herself while free hands in the audience ripped and tore at your clothes and tried to force their fingers into your mouth.
>Her leg bucked and made its way in-between your legs, separating them.
>you jerked your torso try to free your pained arms so you could cover yourself with them. Her hand gripped your kicking thigh and through up. You quickly tried to put it back but she grabbed it again and pinned it up.
>With yourself exposed she violently and as fast as she could slammed he sex into you gliding it up your stomach leaving a wet streak while missing completely.
>she began to growl into your ear in frustration. She slowed down but her hips still vibrated.she kept the momentum of the back and forth but just not the contact. One of the cheering girls climbed behind you to pull you in place.
>She started again. Still missing.
The woman who pulled you in place gripped your wet penis and tried to maneuver it in.
>Plop* it was such a strange feeling, you broke down crying and she started screening. The 4 woman we’re getting really into themselves while yelling insults at you in their tongue. “Fucking take it whore!” “I’m going to rape you next! you love fox cunt it feels so tight.” “Cry bitch! cry bitch! Cry bitch! How many litters do you want!”
>Your screams for them to stop was interrupted by involuntary moans and yelping at every time your hips were slammed into. The fox woman on top of you was making the weirdest noise. You were buried in her neck fluff. She smelt like cigarettes. She let go of your wrists you use the hand instead to force your mouth open. She jerked her head back over yours.
>Drool sprinkled the side of your face.
She spat enough to nearly fill your mouth, but missed most of it. You were forced to swallow the thick disgusting fluid or at least your were until your mouth was then full. your mouth was invaded by a slippery wet spade that went deep. You were choking on the fluids you had to swallow it all down. You sucked on the thick slimy tongue.
>”You fucking love it.” The woman with the hat screamed.
>using your now free hand you wrapped it around the beast woman’s throat and it did nothing you were not strong enough.
>The woman’s hips beat harder.
>You we’re disgusted and scared but part of you felt differently.
>You inhaled as much of her as you could musk and all. You thought of how strong she was and how badly she wanted you. Though it was horrible part of you knew you deserved to be there. She was able to have you so easily you needed to be with her. It hurt a lot but you felt safe. You wrapped your arms around her or as far around her as you could reach and breathed her in and closed your eyes.
>moments latter they shot open.
>Her teeth had sunken into your neck. You gasped loudly and both of you moaned. Her hips only beat faster. She slowly released her maw and gently licked at the redness. She only sped up as she locked eyes with you gently. 2 of the spectators had already came. The woman on top clenched her eyes shut and gave a deep thrust. You felt like you were going to pass out. She jerked herself off of you and rode her cunt up to your face. You didn’t realize until was off how hard your hip were quivering and bucking into her. The motion stayed even as she pulled off.
>She started screaming as it poured onto your neck and face. She the beat her sex into your face then tried to drive it into your chew k bone all while bucking a few times. Hot water flooded your mouth while she screamed. She rolled over off you and grabbed your hand to hold it.
>The next girl got on top.

>Anthro soldiers occupy your house
>Demand you make them food while they're there
>Well they have guns and you don't so it's not like you have a choice
>Quickly whip up a simple beef stew using what meager ingredients you have left in your pantry
>The war hasn't exactly made it easy to stock up on essentials, and you've definitely lost a few pounds over the last several months from having to ration what you do find to eat
>You give the first bowl to the highest rank there
>She sniffs it with a stoic face, throws away the spoon in the bowl, then hesitantly laps at the stew with her tongue
>She licks her lips a few times savoring the taste, then violently shoves the tip of her muzzle into the bowl guzzling down the rest of the contents
>The other soldiers quickly snatch the big pot of soup off your stove and move it to the center of their makeshift barracks in your living room
>They each take a bowl out of your cupboard and surround the pot, shoving bowl after bowl into it before slurping down the chunks of beef and savory liquids
>You wait silently in the corner while they eat, afraid of what they'll do if you approach without permission
>After a few minutes they seem mostly sated, two lay on the couch snuggled together half asleep while another couple play cards on your coffee table
>Now that the pot was left unattended you slowly approach to see if they left you any, the aching in your belly driving away any previously held fear
>Your reach the pot and your eyes lower to see...nothing, they ate every last drop
>One of the soldiers playing cards glances at you with smug smile, her lips stained with your cooking
>You resist the urge to look here in the eye and stare longingly into the pot, ya know maybe you could lick the sides of it and at least get a tast-
>You feel a clawed hand grip your shoulder tightly from behind, her talons almost ripping your shirt
>With her other hand she brings up a bowl of steaming hot stew in front of you
>You slowly turn your head to see the wicked grin of their leader inches from your face, teeth yellow and glistening
>She opens her maw
>"Want? Eat?" She says in a thick barely decipherable accent
>Obviously this was some kind of trick, but damnit you really needed some calories right now
>You hesitantly shake your head up and down
>Her grin grows wider and she steps towards the group at the coffee table shooing them away with loud gutteral commands
>They quickly drop their cards and scatter at the first word out of her mouth
>The leader wipes the cards off the table while muttering what you assume to be curses under her breath
>After setting the soup down onto the coffee table she does something puts a ton of bewilderment and an ounce of fear into you, she starts undressing
>Her dirt and blood stained fatigues fall to the ground and you're met with her panties and bra stained yellow with sweat and dirt
>She removes those more intimimate pieces of clothing as well and then takes a seat on the coffee table beckoning you closer with a clawed finger
>You stop a couple feet from her and hear footsteps behind you, must be the two card players
>She speaks in her foreign tongue and the two anthros behind you push you down onto your knees
>Your face now just about level with her crotch she leans back and raises her legs into the air bearing her womanhood in front of you
>It's about what you expected
>She cranes her head up to look at you and grabs the bowl of soup resting it on top of her crotch
>She barks a single order "Eat!", the soldiers behind you snicker and one of them nudges you in the back with a boot
>Order received
>Your head draws closer to her entrance and your nostrils fill with her musky bestial scent
>Your mouth reaches her crotch and you begin lapping at her folds much to the amusement of the two anthros behind you
>You could feel the heat from her womanhood rising and steal a glance at her face to see a self satisfied expression
>After several minutes of one sided pleasure she tilts the bowl forward spilling some of its contents onto her cunt and therefore your mouth
>Reflexively you try to drink the stew only to find much of it has soaked into the fur that wasn't already saturated with her juices and your saliva
>You lick around her crotch until the taste of the soup is gone and the salty taste of the anthro is all that remains before once again resuming pleasuring her
>A few times you notice an increase in her wetness and a suppressed groan, this is typically followed by another pouring of soup
>This continues for what feels like forever, but eventually she pours the last of the bowl down her sopping wet cunt and you catch the last chunk of beef with your tongue
>After giving her one more subtle orgasm you pull your head away, staring at her with resigned eyes
>She leans forward and straightens her back
>After an uneasy silence she brings a hand to your cheek and leans in towards you, her nose now less than an inch from your own
>"No payment. No food. Yes?"
>You have a feeling this offer isn't open to negotiation
>You shake your head up and down
>The leader says a few words to the soldiers to your rear and laughter erupts around you
>That probably isn't a good thing
>She waves her two lackeys behind you away and they walk up stairs to take up sentry positions for the night
>The leader gets onto her feet and looks down at you with a paw on her chin
>Was she thinking or plotting?
>After a few moments she leans down towards you
>"Squad. Bonus. Warm."
>You shake your head in confusion
>She points to the soldiers sleeping on the couch
>"Squad! Bonus! Warm!" She repeats more loudly
>Oh...
>She was going to let you sleep with them tonight to keep warm, or was it going to be every night?
>Guess you would have to find out tomorrow
>You walk to the couch and lay half your body across one of the sleeping anthros
>You're soon joined by the now clothed leader, she drapes her furry body on top of your own and softly mutters a few foreign words before drifting off
>Your body is warm but a strange aftertaste still lingers on your tongue
>You overcooked something in the soup, that's probably what the taste it is
>Probably

>"Hey girls! Chat says that humans are ticklish on the bottom of their feet. The fuck?"
>"Is that true?"
>"That is so weird."
>"Let's find out if it's true, you know, as a joke!"
>"Ya let's do it!"
>"Get his fucking shoes off right now!"
>"I call dibs on his socks when this is all over!"

>"Hi everyone. I'm Rachel and I'm a Humieholic."
>"Hi, Rachel."
>"I jus' started visiting my friends house when I started to sniff his underwear..."
>"That's okay, Rachel. Every girl does something like that at some point in her life."

>You're on your way home.
>You barely caught your train.
>It's already packed, so you'll have to stand for the next thirty minutes.
>Even though you've been taking this train long in enough to memorize some of the faces, you never bothered to talk to anyone.
>Disinterested you stare blankly out of a window.
>You're so lost in thought, you don't even pay any attention to the anthro leaning into you from behind.
>The train is pretty packed after all, nothing you can do.
>Or so you thought.
>Looking at the reflection on the window, you see there's enough space left for her to stand, a step away.
>It's a tall vixen, her large snout, is pointed down, looking right at you.
>She's close enough for you to hear some faint sounds of her sniffing.
>You're not sure what to make of this situation, when suddenly you feel a soft finger on your neck
>It runs down to your chest, now pulling the collar of your shirt forwards, you see what must her point clawtip poking through your shirt.
>Her fur is rubbing against your neck and face as she slides down her snout down the opening she made for herself.
>You feel her hot breath on your chest as she exhales
>Quite audibly, you hear her take a deep breath, before again flooding your shirt again as she breathes out.
>Preemptively she places both of her paws on your shoulder to keep you in place.
>This goes on for a while.
>She had begun to gently stroke your shoulders and moan faintly down your shirt.
>A few minutes later, she suddenly stops and retracts herself from you.
>You hadn't even noticed the train stopped.
>You look after her, but she already rushed outside, looks like this is where she gets off.

>Be young boy adventuring in some unknown land full of dangerous beatss and monsters
>All that you have to protect you is your faithful Samurott you raised since birth
>She is a fierce fighter, defending you with her life
>No matter the pokemon, no matter the fight, she puts her all into it, if its to protect her loving trainer she will conquer all
>But at night her ferocious nature changes
>She loves you dearly, and she wants to express it every night
>Going through puberty it is nice to have something to release your lust on
>But hers is greater, and most nights end with you on the brink of exhaustion

Anon wears a shirt (or underwear at a beach), with the fur pattern of an anthro of your choice (fox pls).
Gets approached by said anthro, doesn't take no for an answer, she thinks he's just playing hard to get now.
Anon is on a plane, forced admission into mile high club by his seat neighbour.
Shy Anthro finally has the courage to show her feeling for Anon.
Shows it by drugging his drink and carrying him to her place, awake again Anon now has to calm her down and convince her that he won't call the cops if he ever wants to get out again.

"Agh fuck!"
>you go down in a tangle of limbs and aluminum cans as you topple over the display
>you never saw it coming
>because you're blind
>how were you supposed to know not to drink the tap water while traveling?
>you groan and start shuffling through the toppled cans in search of your dropped cane
>should have worn the wrist loop, idiot
>"Oh my god! Are you okay?"
>a feminine voice, full of concern, approaches you
>you grumble and manage to find your guiding cane
"I'm fine, I'm fine. Sorry about the mess..."
>you start to stand, leaning against the shelving unit for support
>then you step on a can, and lose balance again
"Shit--"
>instead of toppling to the floor again, you're caught in a pair of fluffy arms
>"Oh! That was close! Goodness, you should be more careful. Are you..."
"Blind. Yes. I'm fine, really. Thanks for the help."
>the fluffy woman sets you upright, but doesn't let you go when you try to step away
>"Here, let me help you. Did you drop anything? What are you looking for?"
>you sigh
>it was bad enough getting fawned over before you lost your sight
>now every anthro with a mommy fetish tries to baby you
>"Hey!"
>a raspy voice comes from somewhere behind you, slightly muffled by shelves
>"Are you kids knocking over the displays again? I swear I'll bite your heads--Oh!"
>the owner of the voice stops when she gets close enough to see you
>you assume
>"What happened? Are you okay there?"
>you turn toward what you can only assume is an employee
"Sorry, I didn't mean to knock those cans down. I can pay for anything that's damaged."
>you can feel the employee stepping closer
>whatever she is, she's big
>"Oh it's not your fault dearie. I'll take care of it. Did you need any help?"
>the arms holding you up transfer into a hug around your chest and fluffy responds
>"He's fine."
>thank you
>"I'm already looking after him."
>god damn it
>"And who are you?"
>employee's voice gains a dismissive tone
>"I'm--I'm his service dog!"
>fluffy is not a convincing liar
>you pull at the arms holding you
>"Uh huh, sure you are. If you're his service dog, what's his name?"
>fluffy grumbles
>employee scoffs
>"That's what I thought. C'mere hon, let me take care of you."
>you're prized from fluffy's arms and now find yourself pulled into a scaly embrace
>"Hey! He was mine!"
>fluffy complains, and you feel her tugging at your shirt
>a smooth scaled hand runs over your face as you're turned around to face the reptile
>"Aw, look at you. I'll take care of you sweetie, don't you worry."
>the employee hugs you into her chest, muffling fluffy's protests
>man
>for a reptile, her tits sure are soft
>her body feels cool against you
>may as well enjoy it, if you can't escape it
>but you're tugged away once again
>"Let--go--you're--smothering--him!"
>fluffy grunts with effort as she works at pulling your arm out of your socket
>your whole world shakes as employee bellows in a fashion only a gator could
>the grip on your arm slips and you hear fluffy gasp in surprise
>but she's not scared off long, and her paws find your arm again
>"Maybe you should ask him who he wants to help him! Did you think of that?"
>employee relaxes her grip on you as she hums thoughtfully
>"That's not a bad idea, shrimp. What do you think hon? Do you want some puny little mutt looking after you? Or would you prefer momma gator keeps you nice and safe?"
>fluffy gives your wrist another tug
>"Oh please. You know I'll look after you, right? You don't want some nasty, cold, scaly ogre to crush you. I'm all fluff, so soft and warm, and I'm plenty big enough to wrap you up nice and cozy!"
>you open your mouth to speak, but employee doesn't give you that chance
>"Oh but my scales are so smooth, and wouldn't they feel so nice when I'm laying on top of you?"
>"More like you'll squish him! My darling pup needs a man's best friend! You can rest your head in my fluff, and I'll stroke your hair."
"Ladies, please--"
>you can't get a word in edgewise
>"Bitch!"
>"Lizard!"
>"Why don't you go fetch a ball you stupid skank?"
>"Don't you have some spilled beans to clean up?"
>on they go, almost forgetting you in their arguing

>and salvation finally arrives
>"Anon! There you are! You said you were only going to be five minutes!"
>the arguing stops as a third voice cuts in
>your girlfriend manages to shut the gator and the dog up
>she has such a strong voice for such a tiny rat
"Sorry Ginnie. I fell over and then..."
>you gesture as well as you can with a single free hand
>Ginnie sighs
>"Yeah, I figured. Would you two mind letting my boyfriend down?"
>you're released from both fluffy and employee's grips
>"C'mere love."
>you bend over at her word so she can stand on her tip-toes to kiss you
>when you straighten out, she wraps her tail around your hand, which you hold gratefully
>"You really should be more careful, love. You keep falling over and this will just keep happening..."
>you follow Ginnie as she leads you away from the other anthros
>you can't help but smirk a little when you hear them mutter under their breath
>"A fucking rat?"

>that means spring cleaning
>Miga insisted that you clear out the war zone that is your closet
>the hyena was fastidious in all things, and only barely tolerated your slovenly lifestyle because you make her happy
>and because she likes using it as an excuse to 'punish' you
>you're halfway through the pile of clothes you never wear when you pick up something that forces a scowl on your face
>if you'd have cleaned out your sty of a home maybe you could have burned these things sometime before your girlfriend was there supervising you
>with an 'ugh' of disgust, you toss the old yoga pants and sports bra into the trash pile
>you hear a giggle from your bed
>"Did you find another moldy slice of pizza in there?"
>you shake your head
"No, just some...some of my ex's stuff."
>Miga snarls
>"Oh, that bitch. Should have kicked her ass..."
>you sigh and get back to work
"I appreciate the offer Mi, but she wasn't worth going to jail for."
>the hyena snorts and hops off the bed
>she walks up behind you, pawing through the trash pile curiously
"Don't bother. I'll just throw it away."
>Miga cackles
>in that way she does when she wants to do something kinky to you
>"Hey babe, I got an idea."
>so much for spring cleaning
>this afternoon's about to get much more fun
"Yeah? What's that?"

>you shrug and stand up, letting Miga shoo you out of the bedroom
>waiting outside, you can hear Miga giggling and cackling inside
>after a few minutes she calls you back inside
>halfway through the door, you freeze to stare at the sight waiting for you on the bed
>Miga has stuffed herself into your ex's human-sized workout wear, the stretchy fabric at the very limit
>your jaw hangs open in open shock at the sight
>then you break into a disbelieving laugh
"Miga what the hell are you doing?"
>she breaks into a pout, and goes to cross her arms
>but the shirt is too tight
>"Don't laugh! I didn't do the thing yet!"
"The things?"
>Miga nods enthusiastically
>"The thing! Watch this!"
>Miga lifts her arms, flexing them in a strongman pose
>the sports bra starts to split across her chest, partially exposing her
>oh my god
>"That's better!"
>Miga turns around at the hips, showing off her back muscles as they rip more seams in the top
>what a show
>she cackles when she sees your face
>then turns back to flex even more
>the sports bra is left in torn up threads, only a few strings of latex holding on
>her dark nipples stand out hard from her dusty brown fur
"Miga, that is the hottest thing you have ever done."
>she bounces happily, hopping off the bed to show off even more
>those muscles you love flexing
>then with another wicked cackle, she lifts up a leg to stretch it out
>and the yoga pants rip down the leg, exposing more fur
>"And how about that?"
>even hotter
>Miga keeps working, from stretches to squats, her borrowed yoga pants become tattered rags that just hang on to her
>you tremble in desperate arousal by the time she's done
>Miga's practically nude
"Holy fuck."
>she grins, satisfied by your reaction
>"That's what I thought. Now, on the bed before I tear you to shreds next!"
>rather that waiting for you to move, Miga grabs under your arms and tosses you bodily onto the bed
>it's a gentle toss, but it shows off just how strong she is
>Miga pounces, pinning you beneath her bulk
>her maw hangs open, sharp teeth in your face
>you smile at the sight and reach up to put your hands in Miga's mouth
>you trace your fingers over the sharp points of her teeth, and massage her gums
>just how she likes
>Miga shudders, and licks at your hands
>her body drops on top of you now, pressing you down onto the bed
>"Yessssh~"
>she traps your boner between her thighs and grinds against you
>"Ssho goog..."
>you have to stifle a snicker as she tries to speak with your hands in her mouth
>when you finally pull your hands back, they're coated in her saliva
>"You're the best~"
>Miga kisses you, cupping your face in her heavy paws
>you let her massive tongue past your lips to fill your mouth
>you kiss her deeply, running your hands through the fur on her back
>feeling her muscles and none too subtly wiping the slobber from your hands
>Miga grinds against you more and more
>if only you could flex your wait out of your pants
>she finally breaks the kiss, leaving you both gasping for breath
>but she doesn't stop there, dragging her heavy tongue over your face
>she traces it along your jaw, then tries to invade your ear with it
>then settles for nibbling at your neck with gentle love bites that leave you gasping and squirming beneath her

"Fuck...fuck me Miga, love you so much!"

>Eventually viper wife gives (you) the needed injection

>Anon is a druid/nature magician of some sort living innawoods alone who provides blessings, purifies evil spirits etc.
>Starts hearing rumours of young, single men - all virgins - going missing deep in the forest
>He can sense something getting stronger there too with each disappearance and decides to investigate personally
>It turns out to be a powerful, preternaturally attractive weasel spirit/demon that feeds off of the sexual desire and energy of others. She has purple eyes that glow in the dark and is incredibly sultry. She immediately begins teasing and tempting anon (who is himself a virgin and incredibly pent-up).
>When he decides enough is enough he realises that he's left it too late; she's too strong for him to defeat. The weasel spirit slakes her incredibly intense lust, revelling in the situation.
>The disappearances stop, but only because anon has given in and lets the weasel make him her personal plaything. He's more than enough to keep her occupied.
>Good end(?)

>Imagine a "romantic" dinner with Wolfwoman.
>You somehow managed to scavenge enough supplies from the forest to make it nice, but still lacking.
>You even found some booze.
>Would she humor you, or just take the food and bail?
She wouldn't take the food and bail, but only because that would mean she'd have to carry it, when she could just eat it right now.
She might humour you a little, but only cause you brought her 2 of her 3 favourite things. Food and alcohol.
She'd mostly tease you about going so far out of your way, and ask what you expected to get in return.
She'd probably throw her head back and laugh, calling you a freak when you said you thought she was pretty.
A crooked, toothy grin would spread across her maw when she was done though, and she'd stare down at you with those yellow eyes shining out of her hood.
She'd allow you to follow her home, and seem to slowly put her arm around your shoulder as you approached the door.
Though suddenly, she'd grab the collar of your jacket from the back and hoist you up slightly, causing you to lose your balance.
She'd drag you over the doorstep and into her living room, and half throw you on the carpet before ripping off her jacket and maul-fucking you.

>you heard the driver swearing again as he wrenched on the controls, trying and failing to restart the engine.
"She's fucked."
>he concluded after a few moments, peering at you from the driving compartment
>a gentle beeping from the electrical system reminded you that the batteries were draining as you pondered what to do.
>still looking at the driver, your moment of consideration was shattered by a loud siren in the turret.
>the slow soft beeping you heard before stifled in an instant by the sound that every armoured crewman dreaded most.
"WARNING: TRACK DETECTED. WARNING: TRACK DETECTED"
>the stern computerized voice of the laser warning receiver spoke calmly over the blaring alarm
>in a mad scramble, you practically threw yourself against the ceiling of the turret, wrenching open the hatch above you.
>torso first, then legs, you clambered onto its roof.
>with a sense of relief, you caught glimpses of the other hatches banging open with similar enthusiasm.
>throwing yourself as far from the vehicle as you could, you hit the ruined farmland hard.
>ignoring the impact as best you could, you dragged yourself to the nearest ditch, and were joined shortly after by your two crewmates.
>curled up in the mud, you covered your ears and waited for whatever bullshit magic weapons system it was this time to destroy your tank.
>after about 30 seconds, it still hadn't arrived, so you uncovered your ears and raised your head slightly.
>you saw a civilian vehicle and a BTR trundled down the dirt road towards you, kicking up a trail of dust as they approached.
>stopping on the point of the road closest to your tank, about a dozen total anthros wearing battle fatigues and carrying AR's formed a group before setting off across the field to where you hid.
>the open farmland around you offered no concealment for you to attempt an escape.
>your crew looked to you for what to do.
>there was only one thing to do.
"HEY!"
>you called out as loud as you could, waving your arms as wide as you could at the group approaching you.
>one of them waved back at you, and motioned for you to stay put as they approached.
>you and your crew climbed up the ditch, and sat on the edge.
>watching as they approached, you saw a group of mixed female anthros.
>your suspicions were confirmed as they got closer, and you saw the patches of the 132nd Home Guards, "The Blue Omegas."
>they chatted loudly to one another as they walked, clearly not afraid of attack.
>still, they gripped their rifles and maintained a loose formation.
>finally reaching you, the leader of the column walked to within a few feet of where you stood.
>she was a large, toned, wolf; a little over 6 foot tall, with black fur that billowed into an impressive mane around her neck.
>she cocked one of her hips, stretching the seam of her combat pants slightly.
>holding the butt of her M4 with one hand, resting it's underslung M203 grenade launcher on her shoulder, she placed the other on her hip.
>being one of the few anthros you had met that was actually taller than you, she met your gaze more easily than most.
>when she spoke, it wasn't to you however.
>she cocker her head slightly to the side, and still holding eye contact with you loudly called back to her squad in an almost radio-announcer voice:
"What's this girls? 3 more humies and HOW MANY BULLETS?!"
"ZERO!"
>they cheered back in unison, their celebration devolving into a general din of whooping and laughing.
>you looked back at the squad leader with a resigned expression.
>what else were were you supposed to do, they had your ass dead-to-rights.
>with your tank immobilized in open terrain, it would have been trivial for them to cook you in that thing had you tried to fight.
"'Aint nuthin better than watchin humies jump outta their tin cans."
>she paused to chuckle slightly as she moved her hand on her hip slightly to release a latch on her belt.
>producing an olive-drab tube with a button rigged to it in an amature fashion.
>pointing its glassy end at the ground next to you, a red spot appeared, and you saw it was laser for some target designation system, crudely modified to run off batteries.
"Especially when you can't even hurt them!"
>her chuckle billowing into a hearty laugh, flicking it on and off a few times before putting it back on her belt.
>your face fell as you realized the trick they had pulled on you.
>they didn't even need to have an AT weapon to convince you to abandon your tank.
>you looked back at it for a moment, as it sat there completely inert.

Oh you want to know about the foundation of our religion?
Very well, sit down child. Many thousands of years ago the human males toiled under the human female hegemony life was hard and many men were killed daily. A fortuitous day arrived when an unknown and incomprehensible figured anthro arrived in the human female hegemony and destroyed it releasing all human males. This prophet had only but a few rules for this religion that is now known as "Anthristianity"
1. human male x anthro females must be united under procreation
2. human females must be destroyed to ensure harmony in the world
3. the only way to the after life is to submit and serve your anthro female wife as best you can and her job is to protect you
4. human men must be controlled for their own good and guided by the anthro females
5. a good anthro female keeps her human male well drained sexually and her womb full as often as possible for that is the holiest way to exist

>Until a young boy finds her weak and scared, and starts taking care of her
>The next couple of months he takes care of her and loves her with all his heart, and she begins to fall in love with him, wishing to actually with him and not just his pet
>Unfortunately though, a war breaks out in his country, and while running away with her in his hands, a stray grenade takes both their lives
>Strangely enough, they wake up in a new world, your typical fantasy ordeal
>Shes back to her usual anthro self, maybe a bit bigger and stronger
>He is the same, but astonished to find his once pet rat looking the way she does, remembering everything he did for her, and is taken aback more by her than what has happend to them
>She explains everything she knows to him, her old old life, her death, her old life with him
>And professes her love to him, and tells him how much she cares about him, talking about how she wished she could be with him and now finally can
>His entire world has been turned upside down, with the only thing from his old life being her, and finds peace and happiness with her around

"What was that about Lieutenant?"
"Nothing to be concerned about sir."
>You notice that all of your troopers are staring at you with the same hungry expression
"You look tense Padawan."
"Perhaps we can help with that"
>Something is very wrong here, they are acting strangely
"What was the transmission you received, what was it really about."

"Don't resist Master~<3"
>They've begun advancing, encircling you in the middle of the clearing
"Stop with this nonsense and tell me what is going on."
"We don't take orders from you anymore Jedi."
"Surrender, it'll be easier."

>Almost immediately the platoon is in pursuit, radiating that strange hunger and excitement
"Remember ladies, just like the simulations."
>You need to reach your master fast, preferably before your former soldiers catch you
"For the Republic!"

>Anthro female turns their head sideways and opens their maw
>Goes in for a kiss and sticks their big soft tongue inside their mates mouth while shoving their head forward

>thank the nine, the deadra, your jarl and whoever else is responsible for this

>spend the entire day oogling her buttocks
>everytime she tip-toes to reach above your wardrobe her undergarments get revealed

if humans are bred by anthros for a purpose after a few generations they would not know anything beyond that purpose.
it would be accepted that their place was between anthro thighs.
but elite anthros would know the truth, what they had done to human kind, that somewhere out there a wild version of human persists, taunting them to claim it and break it just like the others.

>at least to you
>she wears a heavy, off-grey coat
>over another, darker, hooded coat
>along with a mildly loose pair of denim jeans
>and a pair of well-used leather boots - somewhat limp, heavily scratched and discolored
>you've never seen her with the hood down
>under the hood, her snout juts outwards
>her face is long, even for a canine
>you hesistate to say her face is slim
>proportionately, it is, but her head overall is remarkably larger than yours
>from what is exposed, you can see her fur is pale, sallowed, even
>a light tan on her extremeties that darkens to a rich shade of cedar
>you've seen her hands twice
>they're a similar color to her face
>like her, they're slender, but powerful
>she's tall, she's strong, she can handle herself in the world, deftly so
>you're no good with measurement estimations, she has to be at least two metres tall
>she carries a rifle with her, slung over her shoulder
>next to, but not upon her rucksack
>by no means is it pristine or unused
>but anyone could tell that she doesn't need to carry it
>she knows that, too
>you think, at least
>it's impossible to tell what's going on in her head
>even if she doesn't speak to you, she keeps her eyes firmly on you
>you hope it's because she harbors some similar feelings for you as you her
>realistically, you assume she's simply being cautious
>she carries herself effortlessly, but with marked steadiness in her movements
>she's imposing
>the world seems to quiet in her presence
>or maybe you just divert all of your attention towards her
>the scant, precious times you've met, she hasn't said a word to you
>you'll say a quiet, polite hello, wish her well, though you haven't been able to find the courage to ask her any question
>you're shy, absolutely, but it's not all you
>maybe other people feel the same way
>maybe you're just a freak
>her sheer presence makes you weak
>your head goes light, and fuzzy, you notice yourself tripping over each step
>your hands feel unable to hold a grasp to anything

>it's wonderful
>when you've caught glimpses of her claws or fangs, you imagine them raking across your skin

>how effortlessly she could hurt, maim, scar, kill
>on sleepless nights, you'll sometimes find yourself dragging your fingernails across your body, longingly
>no, you were right, you probably are a freak
>you're past caring, though

>she's out front, again
>without her bag, but now carrying a bundle of firewood
>she brings them to a stump, against which is propped an axe, and her rifle, which she left there on her way indoors
>she places the bundle down, takes a smaller log from it, and places it onto the stump
>before taking the axe, she reaches her hands above her head, and takes a long, relaxing-looking stretch
>she lets out a deep groan of relief
>hnnnggghghhhggodfuck
>alright, this is good a time as any, you think
>you've got a gift for her
>now all you need to do is work up the nerve to give it to her

> Anthro societies have some strange rules, sometimes
> One prime example is that human men are forbidden from jogging in public
> Turns out, millions of years of evolutionary instincts are hard to kick
> Absolutely nothing flicks the 'prey' switch in a predator's brain like seeing a human running away
> Wolves, dogs, lions, and tigers in particular have a blanket exemption from any rape charges against humans, if they can prove the human was running away from them at the time
> Of course, they also get locked up shockingly often on the charge of Aiding and Abetting, since they know that law damn well and tend to do everything in their power to trick or encourage men into running... also, just because they get off on it like very little else

>if looks could kill, Captain Patterson wouldn't need to carry a gun
>you do your best not to wither under her gaze
>you salute crisply and wait for her to speak
>"It has come to my attention, private, that there have been rumors circulating. Do you know what those rumors are?"
>a cold shiver runs down your spine, which you have to suppress
"I do not know anything about any rumors, ma'am."
>the captain continues to stare at you
>god please strike you dead, lest you feel her wrath
>her eyes narrow and she leans in to sniff at the collar of your uniform
>"Rumors regarding you and Lieutenant Thott?"
>your eyes bug out of your head
>there's no way anyone could know about that, right?
>you washed your uniform four times!
"I have not heard anything about that, ma'am."
>the captain growls and grabs you by the collar
>she lifts you off your feet to pull your face right in front of hers
>"You are coming to my office. Now."
>she drags you out of the barracks, while all your squad watches in silent pity
>the captain pulls you to her office, and shoves you inside
>you fail to catch your feet and instead go sprawling on the cheap linoleum
>"Hi Anon!"
>there's the LT, seated casually in the one chair opposite the captain's desk
>she has a big dumb smile on her face
>"I was just talking to Patty about you!"
>of course
>who else would blabber about your relationship besides Thott herself?
>"She was super interested when I told her about all those little squeak sounds you make when I mating pressed you! Isn't that so cute Patty?"
>a booted foot presses down on your back, driving the air from your lungs
>"That's right, private. Since Lieutenant Thott was so kind as to share the details of your personal lives, I thought I'd give you a chance to come clean."
>she presses down harder and you wheeze
>"But it seems like some discipline is in order."
>the captain releases you from under her boot
>by the time you scrabble to your feet, she's closed and locked the door behind you
>"Lieutenant Thott, restrain the private."
>Thott hops out of the chair and has your arms locked behind your back in an instant
>so much for all that CQC training
>"Got him!"
>Thott's tail wags as she turns you to face the captain
>who still glares daggers at you
>"Good work, Lieutenant."
>she steps in close to you and hisses in your face
>"Let's see what sounds I can get out of you, boy."
>her breath stinks of coffee and cigarettes
>she grabs your crotch, none too gently
>you groan and try to double over, but Thott holds you up
>"That was a new one!"
>she giggles while the captain molests you
>the captain squeezes your balls through your pants
"Fuck!"
>you struggle against Thott and the captain, trying to wriggle free
>"That's enough, private. You need to learn to follow orders. See, that little squeeze was punishment for lying to me. If you follow my orders from now on, you may enjoy yourself."
>the captain releases you and takes a step back
>"Both of you, disrobe."
>Thott lets go of your arms and starts to take off her uniform
>"Yes ma'am!"
>cheery as ever
>the captain has broken into a smug grin
>you bow your head and start undoing your own uniform
>"I gave you an order, private!"
>you growl out a defeated 'yes ma'am' while your trousers drop to the floor
>the captain nods her head approvingly at your obedience
>and at how you've gotten hard from her abuse already
>"I didn't tell you to pop a boner, private. But since you're so eager, why not show it off?"
>Thott bounces in glee
>"Yes! Ooh, I wanna watch! C'mon Anon, whip it out!"
>fuck it
>you can handle one crazy superior, what's another?
>you slide down the boxers to expose yourself to the captain and Thott
>the captain snorts
>"That's it?"
>fucking ow
>that hurts worse than the actual cock and ball torture you were momentarily subjected to
>at least Thott seems happy
>"Aw, he's not so bad Patty! Anon is a lot of fun once you get him going!"
>Thott punches your shoulder in a friendly fashion
>think she bruised the bone
>"I'll have to take your word, Lieutenant. Now put Private Anon on my desk."
>Thott salutes and grapples you again
>she easily manhandles you across the room, then scoops you up and drops you onto the captain's desk
>papers and pens are sent scattering
>"You'll be cleaning that up, private."
>great
>"Along with any other mess you may make on my desk. Lieutenant Thott, give Private Anon's private some attention."
>she jumps to work cheerfully
>"Yes ma'am!"
>Thott takes your cock in her paw and starts stroking it
>then starts licking at your tip to clean off the pre-cum
>"Private! Pay attention!"
>the captain snaps her fingers for your to look over to her
>"Don't cum. That is a direct order. You understand?"
>you nod
"Yes ma'am."
>the captain nods and then looks to Thott
>"Lieutenant. I want to you make Private Anon cum."
>"Yeshth a-ahm!"
>she tries to speak while still licking at your tip
>thank god your weren't fully in her mouth, she might have forgotten to be careful with her teeth
>Thott jerks you off faster, and massages your balls with her other hand
>you grit your teeth and focus on breathing
>whatever punishment the captain has in store if you fail to follow her orders, you don't want to find out
>but Thott just goes on licking and stroking your cock
>happy just to be playing with you
>the captain stalks around the desk, and drops down into her chair to watch with that same satisfied smirk
>after going for a while, Thott starts takes you fully into her mouth
>it's harder to contain yourself when she gets this excited
>but you do your best just to breath and not thrust into her muzzle
>the captain leans forward to watch your face
>"Where are those oh-so-adorable moans Lieutenant Thott was talking about? Don't hold back on my account, private. I want to hear every little sound you make."
>damn her smug fucking grin
>you let out a small moan when Thott curls her tongue around your tip
>and again when her soft paw gently tugs on your balls
"Fuck..."
>Thott's tail is going a mile a minute
>and your moans only serve to encourage her
>you pluck at the edge of the desk
>you're getting closer, and Thott is getting more enthusiastic
>"Are you gonna do it, private? You gonna blast a load down your lieutenant's throat? You know that's fraternizing. Who knows what kind of punishment I'd have to dream up for such a blatant disregard for regulations."
>the captain laughs cruelly
>"But I love how desperate you are. You just can't control yourself around Lieutenant Thott, can you? She is a pretty young thing, I could see why. Just let go, Anon. Cum in her pretty little muzzle. Earn your punishment~"
>the captains now crooning in your ear
>when you glance to her, you see she's slipped a hand down the front of her pants while she watches you and Thott
>"Keep going Lieutenant Thott! I want to see the face Anon makes when he cums."
>Thott starts to deep-throat you, worked into a frenzy by the captain's words
"Fuck, goddamn fuck..."
>you pant and groan, unable to hold yourself back from your growing climax
>the punishment may be worth it with how hard Thott is working
>she finally presses herself to your base and you buck your hips
>your cock throbs and twitches in her maw while you paint her throat white
>you fall back on the desk, moaning and whimpering
>Thott pulls out once you've finished, and beams up at you
>"That was a big one Anon! Did you like having Patty watch?"
>the captain laughs in your ear
>"I certainly enjoyed watching, Lieutenant. But Private Anon disobeyed a direct order. That means he needs more punishment. Lieutenant Thott, you are going to fuck Anon on my desk until he can no longer walk."
>Thott grins with and hops up to her feet eagerly
>"Yes ma'am!"

Human women in anthro society: Embraced, tolerated, ignored, or hated?
It did occur to me earlier that they actually have some potential as a narrative device in prompts; if they're tolerated by anthro society, then they could potentially wind up as sort of an "ally of convenience" kinda thing where the human woman can move more freely in society than a human man can.
Sets up potential scenarios where a human woman could be an uneasy ally. They'd probably be willing to help a human guy for the right price, in places and ways that an anthro would not.

>it began to recede just as soon as it had begun, but it was a few moments before the ringing in your ears fully returned to the low white-noise induced by the drugs they gave you.
>panting heavily, you groaned as the shock subsided, just in time for you to catch the tail end of another one of Neva's giggles.

>his shit eating grin fell to a look of confusion when he saw who entered however.
>he quickly regained his composure however.
"Lieutenant general Stroyka! I didn't expect you to come see to this personally."
>he said professionally, straightening his back slightly.
"What seems to be problem, major?"
>she asked ignoring his comment and holding his gaze, still not looking at you.
"This scrawny little fuckwit thought he could waltz down here with a req for a teams worth of ammo and a bullshit ID, look at this."
>he threw dirty looks at you as he spoke before gesturing to the 4 pieces of heavy paper that had been your NKVD officers ID.
>Hao walked up to the majors large oak desk and picked up the scrap that had been the top left corner.
>she was still turning it over slowly in her fingers and looking closely at it when she surprised the both of you with what she said next.
"Anon, is this the brand new '1951 pattern NKVD officers identification card' that I had printed for you two weeks ago?"
>the air in the room seemed to flash freeze as the atmosphere suddenly became very tense.
>you could watch the colour draining from his face, his expression underwritten by a subtle note of fear.
"It is."
>was all you needed to answer.
>Hao stopped playing with the paper in her fingers and placed it back down on the table.
>left arm behind her back, she slowly arranged the scraps on the major desk mostly back together as she took her time with her words.
"I thought so. Now, major, I trust you did not destroy the requisition Anon gave you?"
>she didn't wait for an answer before continuing:
"No? I will expect to see it in my car by noon. Will there be any further questions, major?"
>she looked up at him as she finished her puzzle and questioning at the same time.
>a moment of silence passed before she leaned in almost imperceptibly and narrowed her eyes.
"No. Thank you lieutenant general Stroyka."
>he said, looking down at his desk.
"Very good."
>she replied before turning her head sharply towards you.
"Anon?"
>was all she needed, and you stood up to join her.
>she turned to face the door, and held her arm out like a gentleman for you to take
>you didn't feel like you had any choice, no matter how ridiculous it seemed for you to be hanging off the arm of an anthro more than a foot shorter than you.

"If you need anything, don't be afraid to knock at my door anytime, good night Anon!"
>Go to bed
>Next day, you both overslept.
>Both of you didn't make plans of what you actually want to do today.
"Hey Anon, do you mind if we just drive around for a while? I can show you some spots I really like."
>Agree, because anything is better than nothing.
>Get in her car, drive out of town.
>Hit some rural roads.
>Drive deep into the forrest.
>Realize you're all alone, far away from civilization, with a huge wolfess you still don't know that well.
>Make up scenarios in your head about being murdered by her, get nervous, sweat and your hearts starts pounding
>She puts a paw on your shoulder.
"Are you alright Anon?"
>There's no concern in her voice, instead there's glee, a long wide toothy canine grin on her face.
>You even hear a faint thumps as her is wagging through the tailhole of her car seat.
>Not much later you arrive, it's noon, but the trees towering over you don't let much light shine through.
>There are some parking spots marked with pebbles, but no other cars are parked here.
>You get out of the car, there's no way you can get out of this situation anymore, your nervousness turns into a sick feeling.
"Come on, we're almost there, the fresh air will make you feel better in no time!"
>Again, she didn't sound very concerned.
>Being able to read your emotions, despite trying your best to appear calm, didn't make the situation any better.
>She grabs you by the shoulder, holding you close to her and you begin walking down a path deeper into the forrest.
>Eventually you get off the beaten path, it's hard for you to walk, but she has no trouble walking on the uneven terrain.
>Half an hour later, she stops.
"Uuh, is this your favorite spot? What makes it so special?"
"There's nothing special about it..."
A wide grin across her face, her tail wagging unrestricted and wildly
"..yet!"
>Her large claws are reaching for the neck of your shirt.
>In one swift motion she rips it clean off.
>This happened so sudden, you lose your balance and fall forward towards her.
>She catches you with her other paw and pushes you back upright.
"I don't want to see you on the ground already Anon... you have two minutes."
She buries her large muzzle deep into the remains of your shirt.
"Tw-Two minutes for what?"
You stammer in response.
>Instead of answering you directly, you hear her taking a few deep breaths through her nose, followed by growling.
>That's all you needed to hear.
>You turn around and run for it.
>There always was a risk of befriending a predator species anthro, but you didn't want to believe she of all people would go this far.
>Scary stories passed around, all having gruesome endings, which you always passed off as some angry speciest ramblings.
>But now you're running for your life with no idea where to go.
>Suddenly you hear her howl far away, you must have gotten much further than you thought, but the time she's given you must also be up now.
>Low hanging branches bruise your exposed skin as you keep running, some even giving you tiny cuts.
>Quick and heavy footsteps announce that she's coming closer.
>There's no chance you could outrun her, much less so here.
>In a desperate maneuver, you hide behind a particularly wide tree.
>Her footsteps get louder, before they suddenly come to a stop.
>You hear a few audible sniffs from her again, the leaves under her paw crunching as she homes in on your hiding spot.
>Your heart is almost beating out of your chest, knowing she has you now you carefully step around the tree and...
>There's hardly anything "anthro" left in her face, her lips are peeled up into a snarl, exposing all of her sharp teeth, ready to tear into you.
>The sight of your friend looking at you like a piece of meat was too much, you scream and pull off one final sprint with all of your remaining strength.
>But it was futile, she was right behind you and was one final leap the chase was over.
>Lying on the ground, with your face buried into a pile of leaves, you await the moment that will rip your life away.
>She forcibly turns you around, now with you on your back, you're face to face with her.
>That feral stare from earlier has subsided back into her canine grin from earlier.
"You're all mine now!"
>She exclaimed.
>Mustering you up as you layed helpless on the ground, her eyes quickly focussed on your wounds from the chase, which now has some blooddrops running down from them.
"Aaaw, Anon, teasing me with your taste already? We should save that for later, but if you insist."
>Her tongue is gingerly lapping up your blood, giving you a strange, yet pleasing burning sensation as she reaches your cuts.
"So, that's how you taste like? I can't wait for my second helping."
>She slips one of her massive paws under your head, and gently pulls it towards her own.
>Her maw tilts and opens wide, in a shocked reponse your mouth opens, but you don't have time to gasp anymore.
>Sharp teeth are wrapping around your face, applying just enough pressure to feel them, but not to pierce your skin.
>But what really has your attention now, is her long tongue forcing itself into your mouth.
>After a while it stops feeling like she's trying to keep you down inside yourself, but something passionate.
>This wistful moment lasts for a while, but comes to an end as she opens her maw again to releasse you and pull her tongue back.
"I see that really got you excited"
>Your massive erection is bulging your pants.
>She presses one of her pawpads down on it, shifting it back and forth.
"Really excited"
>Both of her paws are now on your pants, digging her claws into it, she rips the fabric apart.
>With another swift pull your boxer are torn off too, your dick now springing up freely.
>But before you can even begin to feel the cool air of the forest on it, she already planted her lower lips on it.
>They're dripping wet, you can feel her fluids run down your member onto your legs already.
>She grinds on your shaft, exploring your entire length.
>Satisfied, she lets it rise up again, before pushing down on it with her weight.
>Briefly you can feel the pressure building up, right before it practically launches into her.
>Her tight wet walls are encasing you.
>She remained like this for a while, just enjoying the sensation of you being inside her.
>Like a switch being flipped, her face turned back into the beast that chased you through the forest.
>Instead of a slow buildup, she slammed her heavy hips into yours forcefully in a quick pace.
>You tried to hold yourself back like your life depended on it.
>Too afraid of what was to come once this act took it's end.
>She panted heavily as her moans became louder, grabbing one of your hands and holding it tightly.
>You knew what was coming and you knew you couldn't resist it.
>Her inner walls became tighter and started greedily pumping for your seed.
>Nothing could stop you from releassing your seed deep into her.
>She lunged forward, her teeth aiming for your neck, you knew this was coming all along and braced yourself for the end.
>Her teeth sank deep into your shoulder.
>The sensation of intense pain and pleasure overtook all your senses.
>With what you thought to be your final moments, you bucked your hips into her, getting all you could out of your shared orgasm.
>But the pain subsided.
>She collapsed onto you, burying you in her fur.
>Her teeth already releassed, she lovingly tended to your fresh wounds with her tongue.
>You faintly remember something about wounds like the one on your shoulder being something good now.
>With little strength remaining, you wrap your arms around the wolf ontop of you and hug her tightly.
>In reponse she nuzzles her snout into your face passionately.
"You're all mine now Anon, now and forever."

>That girl, she stuck true to her word, lemme tell you
>And that's why Anon retired, wealthy with one hell of a wife.

>Sergeant keeps calling you "Schwuchtel".
>You're the only one in your troupe she addresses like that.
>Get assigned to help her guard an abandoned building.
>Still doesn't call you by name or rank.
>Snap and tell her to stop calling you like that.
>She takes off her pants and commands you to earn it.
>Eat her ass.
>Don't touch anything else.
>You now earned the title of the "Oberschwuchtel".

>You just want to move out.
>Doesn't matter where.
>Find an extremely cheap appartement.
>It's on "Pack Street", sounds like you might encounter some anthros there.
>Doesn't matter, rent is cheap enough to be worth it.
>Realize you moved into a neighbourhood exclusively consisting of predator anthros.
>You're unfamiliar with their social dynamics, so you keep yourself locked inside your home most of the time.
>Your new job is a good distance away, which just gives you more excuses to avoid interacting with them.
>This goes on for a while
Too much exposition, sorry, fuck this, read Pack Street, fuck you Marty.
>You find yourself on the community couch of the lobby inside your appartement building.
>Avo, the tall and slender, black furred jackal with amber eyes sits on the other side of the couch with you.
>You're watching some kind of gameshow.
>Humans are challenged to remain calm while anthros are trying to scare them.
>All contestants are failing horribly.
"Oh come on, she wasn't even doing anything yet! You furs are pulling worse stuff on me all the time, and I don't even flinch."
>You berate the TV like it would help to make the show any better.
"Anymore..."
>She replies smugly
"We had to drag you out of your little hole before you even spoke to us, if you were in that show back then, you wouldn't even make it past the audition, Skinny.
>You turn yourself away from the TV to look directly at her.
"Oh shut up you... Mutt"
You said the last word in a hushed voice, knowing if the wrong kind of Anthro heard you, you'd get a fured fist buried in your face.
"I just didn't want to make an ass of myself, I was never scared of any of you."
>She now also stops paying attention to the show and looks you directly in your eyes.
"Bull. Shit. I could scare you stiff, right fucking now if I wanted to."
>She replied sharply in a threatening tone.
"Pffft. I'd like to see you try furgirl."
>Faster than you could process it, she got into position to pounce you and jumped from the other side of the couch.
>You could briefly see her barred fangs, but one blink of an eye later, she already was ontop of you.
>Her entire weight was pushing you down into the couch, giving you no chance to escape.
>The sharp teeth, now out of your sight, were wrapped around you neck.
>In the corner of your eye you could only make out one of her amber eyes, starring back at you like a hungry beast.
>She growled deeply, like a wolf refusing to let go of it's prey.
>You could feel her hot breath dampening your skin.
>She remained in this position for a while, with you staying completely silent.
>Her growling grew even louder and she bit down hard enough to make you feel how sharp her teeth were.
>That drove you over the edge, too much to pretend none of this had any effect on you.
"Aaaah, Avo!"
>You moaned.
>She instantly pushed herself back up on you and sat a good distance away from you.
"Fuck! Skinny! You're one of those?!"

>Come home
>close door behind you
>feel a hefty weight hit you on your back causing you to fall on your stomach
>weight is still on your back while your on the floor
>get flipped onto your back
>see your wolf wife's piercing eyes looking into yours
>realise you have been pounced on
>one of her many ways of greeting you
>she starts vigorously kissing every corner of your face
>moves to your neck and throat
>kissing turns to nibbling
>realise where this is going
>realise the cookie is coming soon
>realise your about to get wolfed
>in your final moments you do as you always do before getting wolfed by your wife
>you accept your fate
>you embrace the wolf

>Grim news
>The anthro soldiers have taken refuge in your small village
>The war was just something on the news until a week ago
>But now they're here.
>You've done your best to avoid them so far.
>There were rumors they were kidnapping men.
>So you kept yourself to narrow alleys until you were sure you were alone again.
>But when you tried to cross the main street, one of them found you.
>She was on a motorcycle, so there was no chance you could outrun her
>Which would've been a bad idea anyways
>You heard they only get more excited if you run from them
>So you decided to remain dead still.
>She drove right towards you, slowing down as she noticed ou weren't moving and stopped almost right next to you.
>Her back was turned towards you now and you were able to get a good look of her back.
>From the long snout and the wagging tail, you could tell she was some kind of canine.
>She remained like this for a moment, before turning her head 180° degrees to look at you.
>With the odd helmet she wore, it was impossible to see her eyes, but she remained dead silent.
>You didn't dare to move either, avoiding anything she could take offense to.
>Suddenly, she began moving, clumsily getting off the motorcycle.
>She fell straight to the ground.
>She still wasn't moving.
>She was dead.
>Oh right, heads don't turn that far.

>Find cute humie
>Talk to him?
NO
>Mastermind sabotage his life to get him in massive debt.
>Wait until creditor gives up and sells the debt contract.
>Dump a huge sum of money into this yourself.
>Reveal yourself to be behind it all, now humie has to work for you!
>Humie is pissed and files for bankruptcy instead.
or
>Humie is pissed, works until the debt is settled, fucks off

>annoying nocturnal fox neighbor
>always asking you for stuff like sugar and to come over to eat at midnight
>wakes you up knocking on the door at 3 AM
>open the door enraged and tell her to fuck off
>her shock quickly turns into a snarl as she bares her teeth
>overpowers you trying to close the door
>"I guess playing Miss Nice Neighbor doesn't work if you can't take a hint."

>living in a carnivore neighborhood on the same block with wolf, fox, hyena, and cat anthros
>during a block party you decide to cook, because it's your hobby
>invite the neighbors over for barbecue
>the single women all stare as you serve up burgers, hot dogs, grilled kielbasa and chicken
>they stare harder as you bring out the pork spare ribs that were on the smoker overnight, cooking slow over mesquite and hickory
>start getting awkward but sweet anonymous love notes through your house's mail slot while you're at work
>and it's not just one person, the handwriting is varied, and you are getting half a dozen a day
>the neighborhood women all start flirting with you, some of them very aggressively
>just yesterday you saw a wolf and a hyena anthro fighting in your driveway, and they weren't emotional teenage girls, either, one of them was old Mrs. Barrister, she has to be pushing fifty
>mention it to a dog anthro coworker
>he starts laughing
>you ask him to explain
>he whoops with laughter until you think he's having a stroke
>eventually he calms down and can speak again
>he explains to you that in some carnivore cultures offering several kinds of meat to potential mates in a meal has connotations of which you were unaware
>it's symbolic, it means you're a really good hunter
>it's a demonstration that you're capable of providing well for a wife and cubs
>it's also a tacit statement that you're single and ready to mingle
>and you now have two dozen single anthro women, from college girls to spinster aunts in age, thinking you're coming on to them
>all of them were there at the same time, and they know they aren't the only ones
>you appear to have accidentally issued a challenge for them all to fight to prove themselves worthy to be your waifur
>unless you're willing to have a harem
>you just wanted to grill
>wat do?

>it was just shy of two months that she was gone, but the Emily who came back was more different that you could have expected after 2 decades apart.
>she didn't even call herself "Emily" any more, just "Sargent."
>still, her voice hadn't changed, and it was undeniably still her underneath all that fur and muscle.
>even her eyes still looked at you the same way, despite having changed to a deep golden yellow.
>her personality was almost exactly the same too, but it had taken on a distinct aggressive edge.
>there had always been some weird romantic tension between the two of you, but you were never interesting in being as much of a pursuer as your society typically expected of men.
>you liked her, but the idea of trying to confess to her always felt like a bad one, even if there were signs she was trying to hide the same feeling.
>it was probably a mistake anyway, you saw how hard she fought for what she wanted, if she was interested in a relationship, she would have let you know.
>that tension was completely gone the very night she came back however.
>taking the time off that evening to catch up as a gang, she always seemed to find her way next to you on the couch, or standing behind you with a hand on your shoulder.
>by the time it had come for everyone to finally go to bed, it was clear that her assertive new bent was enough to make her leave traditional courtship rules behind completely.
>you were sitting on the couch next to her as everyone got up to leave for the enlisted barracks, but she grabbed the back of your shirt as you did so.
>not looking at you, she waved goodnight to the rest of the squad as she held you on the couch.
>they were most of the way to the door before one of them noticed you were still on the couch, and one of them called to you, alerting the others.
"You comin' Anon?"
>still completely flustered by the sudden show of force after the hours of teasing, Sargent answered for you.
"Oh no. He's coming with me. Goodnight boys."
>a cheer erupted from the group.
>they were clearly not surprised by the development, even if they didn't expect it to take Emily being turned into an almost 8' tall wolf monster to finally get you two together.
>you blushed hard and looked at the floor as they made various jokes alluding to bones and you "being dog food" and the like, but it was impossible to hide your embarrassed smile.
>still hooting and hollering they filed out the door and down the hallway.
>their laughter was starting to fade by the time you looked back up at Sargent.
>she was already grinning down at you, and her smug expression was notably marked by the eyes of a predator.
>it wasn't fear that made you weak at the knees however, the hunger on her face made you feel more desired than anything you could have asked for.
"Shall we?"
>she asked, and you assumed that meant she was asking you to stand.
"s-sure."
>you managed with only a slight stammer before moving to stand up.
>your momentum carried on upwards past your upright position, and Sergeant took you by surprise, lifting you into a bridal carry.
>you looked up at her, way up.
>her ears were very close to brushing the ceiling, but there was still 2-3 centimeters clearance.
>the massive hundesoldatin looked down at you, but for the first time, her expression seemed less than sure of herself.
"A-Anon..."
>it was her turn to stammer now.
"I-I can tell that you don't m-mind... w-well... uh..."
>she trailed off but you picked up her sentence.
"Mind that you're a giant wolf-lady whos head is longer than my forearm?"
>you asked jokingly, hoping to reassure her, but she looked away and started wringing her hands nervously.
"Y-yea, that."
>she confirmed, but continued, elaborating on the source of her anxiety.
"W-well. T-the half w-wolf part doesn't just s-stop under my clothes."
>you hadn't really thought of that, but you stopped to consider for a moment.
>Sargent seemed to freeze solid for a moment as a look of consideration sat on your face for three or four seconds.
>you pursed your lips and nodded approvingly to yourself slightly, and you saw her unfreeze, slightly relieved, but not relaxed.
"We've been close friends for almost half our lives at this point, I want this just as bad as you do E-uh, Sargent."
>you corrected yourself, it being difficult to internalize the name change of someone you'd known so long.
"As long as there's no new teeth down there too, I'm sure I'll manage."
>you continued to joke, humor always being your default technique when you tried to cheer her up.
>this seemed to put her mind significantly more at ease now, but a distinct note of apprehension still hung in her voice.
"I-If you're sure, Anon. I-I.. W-well, nothing for it."
>she undid her belt and button above her tail, but paused to take a breath and steel herself before pushing down all her lower garments to her ankles.
>she put her hands over her snout, one in front of the other in an attempt to hide her embarrassment.
>it was less of a shock than you expected however as she straightened up, and stood with her legs slightly apart.
>her pussy wasn't quite what you'd expected, but it was still thankfully mostly human.
>it was far more of an external feature than any human one, but it the structure of the entrance and clitoral features were normal.
>you could see a glint of light reflecting off the droplet at the end of a small string of wetness dangling from it.
>it was clear that she was incredibly aroused, no matter how nervous she was.
"W-well?"
>she asked, not taking her hands off of her snout where they covered her eyes.

>have long distance relationship with anthro from Finland
>she has a weird sense of humor but she's fun
>finally meet
>she has an enormous grin all the time
>keeps saying "bergele" and "gib benis" and grabbing your groin
>also asks whether you prefer Conk or Bepis
>you are deebly goncerned
>wat do?

>it was late evening in the half ruined city.
>the combined shelling and aerial bombardment had left portions of it almost flat, but other areas remained relatively untouched.
>house to house fighting had been required to finally dislodge the defenders, but only a toe hold on the far eastern edge remained now.
>your squad had taken part in the initial fighting to establish control of the outer suburbs, but fresh units were brought forward for the deep urban combat.
>overestimating the enemies stockpiles of food and ammunition, high command had prepared for a much tougher nut, and the initial shock troops almost outran their supplies.
>the main force was sent in a week ahead of schedule, and by the end of week 3, you had been redeployed to a sector on the south-southeastern edge of the city.
>with no known hostile forces or even major settlements in that direction, you mostly there to form a continuous front line around the city in case the enemy tried a very wide flank.
>however, the performance you had seen so far in defense of the city made you doubt that the enemy had the fuel to accomplish the maneuver.
>the sheer unlikelihood of attack from the direction you watched led to a very relaxed atmosphere among the battalion.
>orders from the Colonel allowed a very light watch to be held, and your lieutenant even allowed for 4 hours of non-designated time in the evenings.
>so there you sat in the basement of one of the mostly intact houses with the other 7 members of your squad.
>the selection process at the academy always ensured that, at least on the level of those you interacted with day-to-day, everyone was at least polite to those they had to work with.
>being a basic infantry squad, you found yourself serving with those you had been friends with in school.
>one of you managed to make Sargent, and filled out her squad with the rest of the gang, and that was that.
>Emily was a fairly athletic tomboy, and the only girl in your friend group.
>always having something to prove, she wasn't the brightest of the officer candidates, but her sheer tenacity had seen her across the finish line.
>you had all been barely twenty years old when you graduated, but that was a few years ago by now.
>things went pretty much as expected for everyone, being assigned a space in the barracks, a more permanent uniform, and all the other things that came with full enlistment.
>that was except for one of you.
>the day after your graduation, Emily excitedly told you guys that she had been asked to participate in a medical trial for women in combat roles.
>always anxious for an opportunity to distinguish herself, she had gladly accepted on the spot, and would be temporarily transferred the next day.
>you joked together that she was leaving her squad on the first day, giving her a hard time as friends do, but you were all happy for her.
>it was just shy of two months that she was gone, but the Emily who came back was more different that you could have expected after 2 lifetimes apart.
>she didn't even call herself "Emily" any more, just "Sargent."
>her voice hadn't changed though, and it was undeniably still her underneath all that fur and muscle.

>she carried you out the same door that everyone else had left through, but turned to the right instead of continuing straight down the hall like they did.
>you had passed few people on your way to her quarters, but those you did had reactions ranging from double-takes to blatant slack-jawed staring as she carried you by.
>as Sargent had explained to everyone earlier, she was part of one of the first batches of "Hundesoldatin," the product of a genetic engineering program to create more capable soldiers.
>she was one of the first in the world, and definitely the first one in your garrison, so she was still catching people off guard everywhere she went.
>you tried not to look like the carrying part was your idea, but it was difficult to hide how much you enjoyed just being held in her arms.
>the extra weight she held was no encumbrance at all, and it wasn't long before you reached the recently renovated section of the officers barracks.
>her room was slightly larger than most of the others, but the custom furniture that had been made for her large frame meant that there was less overall floor space.
>she put you down on her bed, and stepped back.
>rather than laying flat as she had set you down, you sat up, turned, and swung your legs off the side of the bed to sit on the edge.
>you looked up at her, way up.
>her ears were very close to brushing the ceiling, but there was still 2-3 centimeters clearance.
>the massive hundesoldatin looked down at you, but for the first time, her expression seemed less than sure of herself.

>it was less of a shock than you expected however as she straightened up, and stood with her legs slightly apart.
>you stare at her loins and-
>well, she wasnt lying
>a weird mixture of human and canine, puffed out slightly, but still a familiar slit.
"W-well?"
>she asked, not taking her hands off of her snout where they covered her eyes.
>you didn't care, if you had liked her before, the sudden desire she had shown for you sent you head over heels.
"You're still the prettiest girl in the world to me. Wolf head or not."
>telling her your feelings for the first time out loud felt strange, but she had clearly felt the tension between you as well.
>her ears half perked up, and she cracked her fingers slightly to reveal peek out with one of her golden eyes.
"Y-You mean it, Anon?"
>she asked, looking to see if your expression was genuine.
"I do. c'mere."
>you nodded, beckoning her towards you with a full handed motion.
>she came over and knelt in front of you as her arms fell to her sides, and you could now meet her gaze at eye level.
>reaching out and pushing your fingers into her mane just behind her jaw, you started to scratch the sides of her neck gently.
>you had intended to start speaking again as you did so, but Sargent's eyes widened momentarily, surprised by the effect that your touch had on her.
>it really was only a moment of surprise though, and a look of bliss spread across her face as she melted into you.
>her large snout nuzzled your head as it pushed past, and the weight of her chin on your shoulder caused you to collapse backwards into the bed.
>it was a little difficult to breathe with the weight of her torso on you, but her soft warm chest on top of you was so worth it.
>still running your fingers through her mane, and lightly scratching at her neck you continued with what you had intended to say before.
"I loved you as Emily, and I still love you as Sargent. Frankly I'm embarrassed I forced you to make the first move."
>you said slightly breathlessly from underneath her.
>she pushed herself up and off of you slightly, but your hands stayed in her fur.
"I-I don't know what to say, Anon."
>she looked down at you, happy tears starting to well in her eyes.
"You don't have to say anything. We have the moment."
>reassuring her, you pulled her back down gently, and she obliged, resting most of her weight on you again.
>nuzzling her chin and cheek into your neck as you pet her mane, the two of you enjoyed each others closeness for the first time.
>after a few minutes however, you noticed her pulling herself backwards, but only slightly.
>the cool end of her snout brushed against your ear, and she stopped, pressing into the side of your head, she inhaled deeply.
>taking a solid whiff of your scent, you thought you saw a trace of that instinct in her eyes again.
"I'm sorry Anon, I just couldn't help myself."
>she apologized, but you contradicted her.
"No, don't. I, uhh... kinda like it when you act like a... predator."
>embarrassed, you said the last word very quietly.
>Sargent's ears perked up a little as you did so, and she slid further backwards off of you after a moment.
>picking herself up to kneel in front you you again, you sat up to follow her.
>She looked nervous, in a different, almost giddier way this time.
"I-I mean, I guess I could..."
>she glanced around a little, and began gently wringing her hands again, but stopped suddenly when you brought your hands up and cupped them either side of her rear jaw.
>you held her head up, and the way that her golden eyes locked with yours made you feel like the luckiest man in the world.
"It's okay. We'll get there."
>you said, holding her gaze for a moment.
"N-No, it's t-totally-..."
>she started excitedly, but trailed off as she seemed to realize the truth to your words.
>lowering her head back down again slightly, you planted a kiss on the short, soft fur just behind the edge of her nose.
>she drew a long sigh as you pulled your head back to meet her eyes again.
"Y-You're right. We'll get there. I-I just need..."
>regaining her composure for a moment, she stuttered again as struggled to admit how badly she needed release.
>understanding her without words, you likewise didn't need to speak to communicate your willingness to proceed.
>taking your hands from where they held her head, you leaned back slightly, and planted them wide on the large bed behind you.
>smiling in a vaguely confident way, you shifted back and forth slightly as you spread your legs apart.
>quickly realizing your intention, she lunged forwards clumsily.
>it wasn't aggressive, but it was certainly eager the way she bumped the large flat top of her head into your chest.
>her ears were long enough that they brushed into your face as she almost pushed you over.
>holding the entire length of her snout and forehead against your torso, you felt the tip of her nose grazing the fabric.
>you had been feeling the increased bloodflow down there since she had first dropped her pants, but the heartfelt conversation had distracted you from your immediate desires.
>it was just the two of you now though, and your pants quickly began to strain under the swelling that her gentle nuzzling induced.
>she had closed her eyes, and was pressing her nose into the base of your shaft from one side, inhaling deeply through her nose.
>you felt your breath catch as you began to pant, the lust that had been simmering beneath the the surface of the rooms atmosphere boiling over.
>her golden eyes opened slowly as she exhaled your scent, and the request they made was crystal clear.
>withdrawing her head slightly as you reached down, you had enough room to adjust your pants slightly as you lowered your fly.
>undoing the button afterwards, the waistline of your pants popped open, but your shaft was still tucked down one of your pant legs.
>letting her do the honors, you put your hands back out behind you, reclining again.
>her eyes lit up, and she sat up on her knees again, as she realized the reveal you left for her.
>you hadn't even finished sitting back on your hands before she had grabbed your pantlegs, bluntish claws pressing into your skin.
>pulling them down in jerking motions, one leg at a time, she watched greedily as each tug revealed another inch or so of your shaft.
>her expression of hunger intensified with each tug, as it failed to reveal your tip.
>it was a little awkward for her to take the last tug or two, clearly expecting to be done pulling by now.
>a look of surprise spread across her face as her efforts were rewarded though, and her eyes seemed unable to look away as your roughly 8" member flopped out, wobbling a little as it stood to attention.
>Sargent seemed almost hypnotized by the cock in front of her, and you suspected that her old human hormones and new wolf instincts had gotten the better of her.
>frozen for a moment, she watched it sway almost to a halt, but it didn't quite have time to come to rest before she lunged again.
>mouth falling open, her tongue flopped out she dipped her head down to lick your the base of your shaft.
>the size of her head meant that by the time the stroke of her tongue had reached the underside of your head, you could still feel its length sliding along your base.
"O-Oh! S-Sargent..."
>you sat up as you started in surprise at the intensity of the feeling of her tongue, warm and soft across the sensitive skin between your legs.
>it was your turn to melt into her as she closed her lips around the tip.
>slumping forwards slightly, you rested a little of your weight against the same flat area on top of her head she had pushed into you a moment ago.
>her head was large enough to fill most of your arms when you embraced it alone when you wrapped your arms around it.
>the soft fur of her snout ran down the front of your uniform as she easily took your entire length in her mouth.
>moaning as she pulled back towards the end of your cock, your hands found places to rest behind her ear and on her neck.
>leaning further into her, she easily held your weight up against her very sturdy frame.
>taking you back down to the base, she began bobbing up and down in shorter, faster strokes, keeping all but an inch or so of your dick in her mouth the entire time.
>you jostled up and down in time with her sucking as you leaned on her more and more, scratching at the skin below the fur that entangled your fingers.
>being held in her mouth like that was so soft and warm, and despite the slightly inexpert way she gave her first blowjob, it wasn't long before you were getting close.
"S-Sargent... I-... I'm gonna-..."
>you tried to warn her in time, but there was no need, as she gave a few more enthusiastic strokes before pushing herself to the base.
>pressing you to the roof of her mouth with her wide soft tongue, she rubbed it side to side across the underside of your entire length.

It would do more damage due to what a shortage of men in that time period/tech level of the setting since men would be the ones doing jobs that would help fight of the wolves. Also female beast/monster that can breed with humans is way more scary than the usual male rape monsters due to dynamic of pregnancies. A single captured human guy could theoretically impregnate a whole tribe of female rape monsters, but with a human woman and male rape monsters the woman can only get pregnant once and the monsters have to wait or go get more which can lead to them getting caught/found out. And since human men make up the vast majority of soldiers every conflict with the beasts would be giving them more men to use even if they decisively lost since all they need to spring back up is just one guy.

Yea, that's how you got invited to the party in the first place.
You guys were a hit with everyone at the game earlier today.
The players had been drinking heavily and parting all night.
You had been bench pressed by multiple gorgeous, muscular anthros in the last hour alone.

>slowly manages to fix up the house's yard after years of neglect from the old man
>mostly with some help from neighbor's forcing their kids to lend a hand from watching the poor thin human struggle with the weeds
>after some time getting settled in and the neighborhood getting used to his presence something peculiar happens
>the fat raccoon girl who's known as a bit of a NEET nervously knocks on his door
>unkempt fur, strong musk, socially awkward, and anime shirts
>almost hyperventilating the whole time too
>the human guy answers and asking what she wants
>she answers by thrusting her phone at him with a clear image of him naked and being pinned by a large rat woman humping him
>while he's stunned she stammers out she wants an autograph
>turns out the human boy is something of a porn actor who mainly does videos and photos with UFB style anthros
>being fucked by species that have a stereotype of being gross, creepy, musky, or bestial along with an emphasis on anthros older, fatter, and/or coming off as unappealing
>turns out the raccoon girl recognized him from her many nights of masturbating to his and similar videos of humans being fucked by nasty anthro women
>and finally worked up the nerve to confront him
>red faced he quickly invited her inside and hopefully with no one else noticing
>he manages to squeak out asking if she told any others about what he really does
>though the raccoon is bit preoccupied playing with his hair and sniffing it
>being in a human boy's house with no one else kinda frazzled her and now she's letting her base desires steer her actions
>all she can think about his all the nasty and lewd stuff she's seen down to him by big anthro women
>her reactions are getting to him and he can also recognize the signs from an extremely pent up anthro woman due to all his experience
>seeing an opportunity he rests against her larger frame coyly asking if an autograph was all she wanted
>now she really was panting with a cute human boy willingly touching her and the obvious line she's seen from pornos and fapfics
>she tries to say some dirty lines straight out of a porno, but mumbles and stutters them instead out of embarrassment
>he can tell she's never done anything like this so he's going to have to help push and guide her into viciously fucking him
>so he stretches up to kiss her which she freezes up at first before leaning into it
>though it's less a kiss and more her shoving her tongue over and side his mouth
>messy and very rough, but the enthusiasms is enjoyed by him
>the groping she's doing is also nice too
>raccoons were always good with their hands
>breaking off the kiss he takes her hand and leads her to his bedroom

>once in he lets go and sits on the bed letting her watch as he slowly strips off his baggy clothes
>more and more of his pale skin is revealed and also the scars in obvious places that could only be gotten from anthro hands/claws grabbing at him in the midst of sex
>unfortunately the raccoon's nerves have flared up at the realization she has to get naked too
>he quickly notices this and comes over to help her strip
>which the raccoon finds way hot and does help her confidence in how he reacts to her body
>kneading her belly and rubbing his race into the soft surface
>groping at her large tits before kissing sucking on her black nipples at the center of her large areola
>then undoing her pants and then pulling her simple white panties down
>her unusually strong musk fully hits him and brings back fun memories of other musky girls he has done shoots with
>the raccoon can't help but shriek when he suddenly buries his face in her crotch before desperately grabbing his head when she feels begin to lick and suck
>she's heard the lewd stories about how soft human tongues are, but feeling them is another matter
>she also can't help, but cover her face whenever she looks down to see him staring back up at her
>feeling like teasing her he takes her phone out of her pants pocket and pushes it up towards her hands causing her to look down again
>she realizes what he's offering her and shakily takes her phone to snap some pics

>she actually lets out feral sounding raccoon chitters before rushing over to him
>she's horny enough now to actually start taking the lead and forget her nerves
>grabbing his legs and making him bend them up
>luckily he's done this enough and trained his flexibility it's easy to do now
>she's drooling from both ends at the idea of mating pressing a cute humie finally
>and hearing him moan out as she crashes her fat ass and wide hips onto her pelvis have her mind fogging over in lust
>he makes sure to be nice and vocal for her
>seeing her confidence boost and letting her inner feral animal out as she fucks him is always a treat
>covering his smaller frame with her large furry plush body
>making his bed rock and creak
>but not break since he made sure to buy the sturdy frames that can withstand larger anthros guaranteed
>now she doesn't need prompting to start kissing him again
>then moving to just licking his face and neck before nipping at it
>neck bites where always a weakness of his and he happily moans for her while shuddering
>he's covered in her salvia and and fem juices while stinking of her
>his scent being covered by hers tickles some primal part of her brain making her start to chant out the words "mine" over and over has her humps get more erratic

>he soon joins her in cumming too after feeling her go off which let him know to stop trying to hold back
>she literally crashes on top of him burying him between her and the bed
>once her brain reboots from the intense orgasm she feels him tapping to make her get off him
>she flops off quickly letting the weight off him
>he's got a satisfied smug look and beckons her over to cuddle which she jumps at the chance
>letting her bask in the afterglow and giving is hips some recovery time
>but he can't keep her here for long without raising suspicion
>manages to keep her from falling asleep and caroling her into the shower
>she complains at first before he mentions if she leaves without one everyone will be able to smell what they did
>even with her lack of social skills she isn't that brazen
>though if she had a human boy to wash her fur like this she might actually bathe more often
>he even gets her off one more time in the shower with his mouth as a cap off
>she finally wobbles out of his house looking better groomed then when she entered
>an older bear woman across the street ends up seeing that scene
>the next day she comes over to question the odd event and wonders if he knew the raccoon girl before moving here
>he takes in the older she-bear and her heavy mature body
>he leans on the door frame letting his baggy sweater slide some to show off his nape and neck asking if she would like to come in~
>unfortunately he hadn't gotten around to sounding proofing his room so that day a bear's roar could be heard
>the raccoon girl meanwhile ended up bragging about fucking the new human in the neighborhood to her group of nerdy/dorky/loser anthro friends
>they called her out saying it was bullshit, but the photos she had on her phone quickly shut them up
>needless to say some of them managed to also work up the nerve to knock on his door too
>and this time he had soundproofed his room

Socially awkward nerd/dork anthros have a lot of fun potential for /adhg/ stuff

>Walking down the streets qit your possum gf, You spent the whole day in the city and were heading home already
>You wanted to ask her something since this morning
>The somewhat tall opossum was delighted with today, listing almost everything she loved about the day
>seeing her so being gleeful always made you happy
>She was talking about a lot of things actually, jumping hyperactively from things her friends told her about some places you visited to how much she liked the OST of the last game she played, with your pondering brain barely being able to register what brought about such a sharp turn in topics.
>"so thats why she spreads toothpaste on her f- hey! earth to Anon, you ain't floating in a tin can are you?" she says as soon as she tooks notice of your 'thinking stare'.
Yeah I was just thinking
>"Well about time you filled that empty head of yours with something"
>You would take a slight offense if you didn't respond with 'nothing' 9/10 times when she asked you what you were thinking at the moment.
So I was thinking-
>"How do feral tigers camouflage if they're brigth orange?"
What? no, It IS about other species though
>"No I don't use my pouch as a coin purse, it feels weird"
What? No I wanted to ask, You ever think about feral opossums? isn't it weird to have little versions of you rumaging through trash? kinda hasn't leaved my head since this morning
>"Never gave it much thought to be honest and I think most anthros don't do either"
I guess so
>She looks around for a bit, and then her "Let's do dumb shit smile" curls in her face
>"Here, follow me" she says as she drags you into a back alley
>She then jumps into a thankfully empty trash container, the lid falling making a loud noise, this didn't surprise you, which really says a lot about your relationship
>She suddenly opens the lid
>"Hey cutey wanna, eat some trash?" she says in a raspy voice
...We get home and you take a shower
>"Aight, but you'll help me wash my fur"
>Fair deal

Better idea:
>walking down street with possum gf
>she sees a bunch of yeens and drops dead to feign death
>yeens proceed to rape you while she watches and fights her instincts to stay dead

Tips for looking after your new human husband!
>In human culture, men are conditioned to take the lead, which can cause friction when integrated into our society. Be prepared for your husband to feel down or unworthy, and make sure to remind him that he doesn't need to worry about those things anymore
>On a related note, human men respond very well to compliments! Tell him how attractive he is!
>It's natural for men to be apprehensive when it comes to consummating their new marriage. >Take charge, take it slow and make him feel good. You can always speed up later.

>"it is important to remember that before claiming a human you must build a relationship with them first"
>"some anthros will claim the prettiest human they see, and while this is an easy solution to scoring yourself a human these "forceful claimings" are never the ideal solution. studies show that human males involved in "forceful claimings" have higher rates of depression and suicidal tendencies."

>"Human men often vastly overestimate their physical strength, especially compared to members of the opposite sex. Believe it or not, that means you! Whether you're a wolf or a bear, odds are your new mate will believe themselves to be stronger than you."
>"It's tempting to entertain this delusion for their sake, but it only leads to unnecessary conflict down the line. So, assert yourself; be firm, but not violent!"
>"If your new mate attempts to shove you, stand firm. If they pull away from you, hold them (but don't squeeze!)"
>"In the event that the human attempts to strike you, keep in mind that they are extremely unlikely to injure you. You may be tempted to retaliate with equal force. Do not. You are much more capable of severely wounding them than you may realize. In this situation, simply grab the human by the wrists, forearms, bicep, or shoulder and keep them in place until their anger passes. And it will!"

>The number was crossed out often enough to make it unreadable, the words were scribbled above it hastily.
>You're expected to leave by thursday.
>That's three days you got to find a new place.
>Your current rent was much cheaper than it should've been.
>With your low budget, you shouldn't have been living alone in the first place.
>But it did allow you to scrape by without joining the "Assigment Program" the state so generously provides.
>A state offered initiative that provides several benefits to make life so much easier.

>Life without being part of it however wasn't easy.
>You had to either rely on some shady jobs, putting you together with some rougher anthros very eager to learn about your marital status.
>Or take some degrading work by some "progressive" anthros that treated you overly nice, but showed their true colors on your paycheck.

Hello! I John Smith, am looking for a roommate!
I have a spare bedroom and plenty of space!
Rent is cheap, just want to live with another human like me in this a*****state.
Contact me quick! I will take down this listing in a few minutes to avoid f**posters from swamping me.
>The pictures look really good.
>Way too good.
>No way a single guy could afford any of this, but you're at the end of your rope and you need to move asap.
>You click on his profile and send him a DM.
>Good evening, I checked your listing and it looks pretty good, especially the cheap rent! Are you still looking for someone?
"Send pic."
>Excuse me?
"Please be so kind and send a picture of yourself, I don't want to let anthros that roam this site for "prey" know where I live."
>Sure, give me a moment.
>You attach "applicationfullres.png"
Nice try furgirl, you just grabbed this from your company's server, didn't you?
>No, that's actually me.
"Alright, send me a shirtless one then."
>Dude, what?
Just for my own safety, I assure you.
>Your sense clouded by the lack of sleep, you take off your shirt and snap a photo of yourself and send it to John Smith.
"Marvelous!"
"Now send me another one without your pants!"
"Haha, just joking, when can you move in?"
>The state pretty much just kicked me out, I more or less have two days now, is that alright with you?
"Sure man, I work from home so come over anytime, here's the address:
>The moving truck dumps you and your few belongins out infront of your new home.
>You heave everything up and head inside.
>But when you arrive at the appartement door there's something wrong.
>The name plate doesn't read "John Smith", but instead it's "Scarlett Renarde"
>Before you can ring the doorbell, the door already swings open.
"Anon! You're even more handsome than in your pictures!"
>A tall and slender Vixen is leaning against the doorframe, beckoning you to come inside with one of her paws.
"Uh, sorry, I'm supposed to meet up with a John Smith..."
>She steps around you and hastily pushes you inside.
"Let's talk about this inside sweetie."
"I'm pretty sure that's ilegal."
>You're appalled, as it turns out, "John Smith" reverse catfished you into moving in with her.
"Oh Sweetie, it's not like I'm trapping you here, you haven't even signed anything yet, you're free to leave anytime."
>A toothy grins forms across her snout.
"But you just used the state provided moving service to come here didn't you? Do you have the cash to pay for it this time?"
>You sigh.
"Just show me my room."
>She slides a piece of paper and a pen across the table you both sat down at.
"It's not your room quite yet, just sign this rental agreement and you can call this place your home."
>You quickly skim through it, everything seems fine and she didn't even take the chance to jack up the rent.
>You sign it.
"Marvelous, Anon! I'm sure I won't regret it"
>She croons into your ear
>When did she get so close?
"Uuuh, don't you mean..."
>Her smile widens
"You'll have to find that out yourself."
>A little later, you finally get into in your new room.
>You put down your belongings in a corner.
>And open the box containing your clothes, you don't have the energy to unpack everything right now, but there's enough left in you to fill the dresser.
>Your shirts, pants and two jackets don't even fill half of it, a sign this wasn't made for a "single" man.
>Taking in the rest of your room now too, all of the furniture is clearly of a higher grade than you're used to.
>Especially the bed catches your eye, it's big enough to lie in it diagonally.
>Speaking of which, staying up all night to find a new place to stay and moving in the morning has drained you.
>A short nap was something your body craved right now.
>You slipped into more comfortable attire, turned out the lights and lied down.
>It was so soft, it didn't take you long to starting drifting away to sleep.
>But before you were out for good, the creaking of your door handle brought you back.
>Scarlett, scantily covered in a red see through dress which just barely hung off her shoulders, headed straight towards your bed.
>She gracefully sat down on the edge of the bed and in one motion lied down and slipped her slender right under blanket, brushing her fur against the skin of your own.
>Her extended arm slipped a paw under your shirt, pressing her soft paw pads against your chest.
>The big toothy grin from earlier decorated your snout again.
"No."
>You dryly told her.
"What?"
>Her sharp teeth disappeared with the grin on her face.
"Come on Anon, I'm just trying to make you feel welcome in your new home"
>She now slowly rubs her paw on your chest.
>You grab her wrist and pull it out from under your shirt.
"Scarlett, I said no"
>Her expression turned into a scowl, showing she wasn't happy with your rejections.
"Playing hard to get darling? Didn't take you for one of those, but I can play along."
>She tore free from your grasp and instead held your own wrist now.
>A leg moved over your chest and shortly afterwards she sat on your lap pinning you down with her weight.
>In an attempt to push her off with your free hand, she only managed to hold onto your other wrist.
>Unable to move, you were at her mercy now.
>She leaned forward and nuzzled her snout into your neck, taking a deep breath and moaning right into your ear.
>Getting herself upright again, you were face to face with each other.
"Wait, you're actually not into this?"
>She asked with her ears falling back.
"Who's into getting raped?!"
>You barked back at her.
"Uuuugh, sweetie no. You can't just toss that word around with a lady ontop of you.
"But that's exactly what's happening here, you're just about to ra-"
>She lets go of you and puts a finger over your mouth to shush you.
"Darling please, don't use that word so haphazardly, I pride myself to be better than that."
>The vixen rolls over and is now merely lying right next to you.
"So Anon, do you want to take it slow then? Are you fine with just sleeping together?"
"Please leave."
"Just a goodnights kiss then?"
"Get out."
"A hug?"
"Scarlett!"
"No need to shout, darling. I'll leave you alone, for now. Let's talk about this when you get up, alright?"
>You didn't want to give her an answer, but it looked she wasn't leaving before you said something.
"Alright."
>She swiftly got up and out of the bed, disappearing behind the door out of your room and into the hallway.
>Right before the door clicked shut she peeked into your room one final time.
"No hard feelings, right Anon?"
>You audibly sighed
>But that wasn't a good enough response for her to leave you alone.

What are some little darlings you have about the Anthrostate setting? For me, one is
>Pamphlets and guidebooks about how to treat a human man are regularly given out to anthro women
>Some study them religiously, others toss them in the garage and do whatever they want

I want an anthro muscular women that is willing to take scars and bruises just to protect the human prince.

I love edgy loving Samurott. Starting pokemon protecting their young trainers is nothing new but most dont look like they would fucking destroy anything that would dare hurt their partner.

Not to mentioned, she’s not afraid to tear off some evil rapist furry women’s jawline if she ever dares to rape or harm the human prince.

>tfw no amazon Samurott gf to force you to sleep on top of her to "protect you in the night"

fun/kinky idea
>cities/villages that worship animal gods
>think similar to Egyptian or Indian/Hindu religions
>except instead of regular feral animals being seen as the god's kin its anthros
>anthros are barely above animals in how they act and live
>temples are built where those species can hang out and get fed/pampered by human attendees/priests
>the anthros are allowed to do whatever they want to the humans and the humans won't resist or fight back since it would be blaspheme or a grave sin against the species god
>anthros know this and take advantage of it whenever
>can just walk up and grab a human guy/boy they want and fuck them wherever
>will even just barge into homes to get who they want even while the rest of the guy's/boy's family is right there without them lifting a finger
>smaller villages/settlements tend to focus on one god while larger ones can have multiple temples to different gods
>mostly depends on where the places are in the region

I always thought of the anthrostate as being multi-national, as a way of having the different interpretations of "authoritarianism."
Like one country sees their human men as precious and to be protected, but so inept that they must be protected from themselves. The other sees them as just property. Say you're trying to prove that you're really good at math, and are trying to prove that you are qualified to design bridges or something, which is what you want to do more than anything in the world. The first society just laughs at you and suggests some aprons that would look nice on you when your wife got home. The second would snatch the paper from your hand, scowl at it for a second, and then backhand you across the face causing you to fall to the floor.
Maybe separated by species/breed?
Like the gentle ones are all collies and labs and sheep and stuff, and the rough ones are all dobermans and panthers.
Maybe there's multi-ethnic areas in the cities and suburbs where the two ideologies rub up against each other.
>A doberman sneers out of her window, looking at busty golden retriever walking her human down the sidewalk in front of her house.
>Fucking Leanne. She could at least have the decency put him on a leash.
>The doberman sighed frustratedly, but she changed her exhalation to at least blow on the black coffee she was holding.
>What did she expect though, she knew there would be some adjustments moving to a mixed district.
>She had heard the storied from her friend who travelled for work, but it still blew her away that this was tolerated at all.
>There wasn't even an HMOA for her to call over the violation.
>She had resorted to calling the police the first time, but they had just laughed and asked if she had jaywalking to report as well.

I like this idea.
the "human want's to do X but can't because anthros dont take humans seriously" plotline is underrated

>Her eyes drift back up to his, a knowing expression on her face
>He leans forward and slams his hands on her desk
>"Oh come on! Just because I'm a human doesn't mean I can't serve my country! Please! I can't just sit idly by and watch the sacrifices our troops make without doing something myself!"

>"Please! I just want to do something to help out. There's got to be something I can do." He pleads
>She puts a paw on her chin as she thinks, a devious expression growing on her face
>"Hmmmmm, well, we don't exactly allow humies in the military. But we do allow civilian contractors for...specialist roles."
>"I'll take it!" He exclaims. "Whatever it is I'll take it!"
>She looks down and begins writing on a post it note
>"Alright humie, go to the office at this address and talk to the receptionist. From there they'll induct you into MATE."
>"Mate?"
>"Stands for the Morale Assessment, Treatment, and Entertainment unit. They make sure our brave soldiers have their psychological needs taken care of while on the front line."
>"...okay. So what is it I'll be doing exactly?"
>"I literally just told you John. And by the way, you may want to begin taking calcium supplements."
>"Why's that?"
>"You'll need strong bones to be in a MATE unit. Start drinking lots too."
>"So I'll be in combat?"
>A wicked grin apears on her maw
>"In a manner of speaking. Now go to this address." She hands him the post it note. "And you'll be serving a valuable purpose to the anthrostate in no time."

>"Alive again, chickadee?"
>you can't see her from your position, but you hear Viper, slithering from some unseen corner of the room
>"Look at you. Pathetic. You tried your bessst, and yet you weren't strong enough to beat me. Ssscared of some ssscales and fangsss."
>her mocking laughter echoes around the room
>"You're exssactly what I wass looking for, chickadee. A weak little plaything to torment."
>you bite back the urge to vomit as you speak
"You won't get any--urgh--any satisfaction. I'm a hero, you ugly freak."
>Viper stops laughing
>"We'll sssee about that, hero."
>the end of her tail wraps around your throat, squeezing tight enough to nearly cut off your breath
>you grasp weakly at the appendage
>Viper lifts you by the grip on your neck, forcing you back against the cold stone wall
>she leers down at you
>"Without your little trinket, you're ussseless."
>she holds up the amulet, just out of reach when you snatch for it
>when you fail to catch it, she laughs and throws it across the room
>"Can't sssave you now, chickadee. I can do whatever I like."
>she squeezes tighter, strangling you
>"I could crusssh the life out of you, watch your eyess pop out of their ssocketss while you squirm and writhe."
>she relaxes the grip to let you breath again
>just barely
>you continue to pry at her tail, desperate to get more air
>then she draws a clawed hand over your face
>"Or tear out your gutsss and leave you crawling asss you bleed to death on the floor."
>the claw presses hard against your cheek, drawing a cut down your skin and letting warm blood flow down your face
>you struggle to maintain composure, teeth grit, choked breath quavering

>you see beads of sickly green venom forming on the tip of her fangs
>you steel yourself and choke out words of defiance
"I'm--not--afraid!"
>Viper shuts her mouth, pulling back enough to look at you in mock surprise
>she flicks her tongue
>"Oh! You're not afraid! Ssso brave, chickadee. Exsscept I feel you ssshaking, I can tassste your fear. Hm, tasste..."
>she leans in to swipe her tongue over your face, lapping up some blood from the cut as she tastes you
>"You do tasste deliciouss. I think I'll jusst ssswallow you whole, my little chickadee."
>with that, Viper opens her maw wide
>then wider
>and wider
>her jaw unhinges, an unnatural sight
>you start to tug desperately at her tail
>this is too much
>not like that
>please god
>you want to scream
>all that comes out is a weak whimper
>that deathly maw descends
>you can feel her breath on your face
>you kick against the wall, and dig your fingers into Viper's scales
>tears stream down your face, mingling with blood
"Please--!"
>Viper stops, just short of engulfing your face
>her tongue whips against your cheek, tasting the tears
>she shuts her mouth in a snap
>"What wasss that, chickadee? You don't want to be eaten alive?"
>you tremble and sob
>"I want to hear it. Beg for me, chickadee."
>she finally loosens her tail on your neck, giving you your first full breath in minutes
"Please--"
>you cough and take another few deep breaths
"Please not like that. Anything but that, Viper. I--I don't want to die like that."
>Viper hisses in pleasure, eyes lit up in sadistic glee
>"That's what I thought. Are you a brave hero, chickadee? The kind that dies alone in the dark? Or are you a scared little bird, at the mercy of a cruel goddess?"
>you should defy her
>she'll just kill you anyway after having her fun
>but she hisses softly with every breath
>and you can see through her slightly open mouth the fangs still waiting for you
"I'm just a--a scared little bird. Please, Viper, I'll do what you want, just let me live."
>your pride crumbles
>Viper just laughs and laughs
>"That's right! You're no hero. A hero wouldn't cry and beg for his life. You're only fit to be my plaything, chickadee. But if you're a good little bird, I may let you live."
>you're finally released from her tail
>you crumple against the wall and your feet land on the mattress
>when you start to slump down, strong hands catch your shoulders
>Viper presses you against the wall, using it to hold you semi-upright
>just let it be over
>let it all be over and you can go home
>it's not over
>Viper looms over you
>her tail works its way around your legs
>"We're not done yet, chickadee. I have tasted your fear, but now I'll have your submission."
>once Viper has you wrapped up enough to hold you up with just her tail, she releases your shoulder to start tearing up your costume
>she's none too gentle, leaving trails of scratches over your chest and back
>you spent so long sewing it too
>the cruel villainess hisses in perverse pleasure every time her clawing forces another sob or gasp of pain from you
>"Keep sssinging, chickadee~"
>she only stops when she reaches your waist
>with a single finger, she splits open the crotch of your costume
>the boxers underneath go as well
>so close you can feel the very edge of her claw on your manhood
>the terror along with the sensation of her claw is enough to bring some life to it
>"There it iss. You know who your new godesss iss, don't you?"
>Viper drags a talon down your shaft
>you pray to whatever god is listening for the strength not to involuntarily move
>you don't want to lose everything
>Viper shifts her tail, forcing you off the wall
>she wraps around you once more, this time sliding around you to hold you from behind
>her arms go under yours, around you to continue teasing you
>"Don't try anything, my chickadee. My clawsss are so very, very sssharp. One slip of the finger..."
>to emphasize her point, she squeezes your sack, threatening to puncture it
>"...and you'll be lessss of a man than you already are~"
>you nod your head desperately
"Yes Viper. I won't try anything. I'm--I'm yours."
>Viper hisses in your ear
>"That'sss right chickadee. You're mine. Remember that."
>finally she takes your shaft in a hand, wrapping her cool fingers around it to start stroking it
>"Keep sssinging, little bird."
>she presses her claws against your sack again
"Haa-fuck!"
>you huff and groan, every time you start to quiet down, she torments you again
>all the while stroking your cock
>you hold onto her tail, gripping tight every time she presses her claws
>"You feel how tightly I hold you, chickadee? How ssstrong my tail iss? I could crusssh you any time I want."
>Viper squeezes your lower body with her tail
>she spins her head around to hiss in your other ear
>"Thank me, little bird. Thank your goddesss for letting you live."
>her voice is like death
"Thank you. Thank you for letting me live, Viper--"
>she leans forward and bares her fangs
>"I am your goddessss! You will call me goddesss or you will die!"
>you quaver and stifle yourself from crying again
"Yes goddess. Thank you for sparing me goddess. Please, please don't hurt me, I'm not a hero."
>"Gooood. Good."
>she croons to you, and leans in close
>at first to kiss at your neck
>you moan softly, the first conscious show of pleasure at the sudden gentleness
>it doesn't last long
>she goes from kissing to dragging her fangs across the tender skin of your neck, threatening to bite you again
>and she keeps stroking you
>faster and faster
>her hips roll, forcing you to buck into her hand
>tears stream down your cheeks
>you're going to cum before long
>and you dread what she'll do once she's had her fun with you
>her coils massage your legs
>one hand massages and squeezes your balls,
>the other continues to jerk you off
>Viper continues to menace your neck with her fangs
>you're wholly surrounded and entrapped by her
>and you squirm and moan in her clutches to her delight
>you leak pre-cum over her claws
>and just when you think you're going to climax
>when your member twitches and throbs in her hand
>when your moans become too much too control
>she stops
>her hands leave your groin
>you're left shuddering and thrusting against the air for release
>Viper releases her grip on your neck to laugh at your state
>"Are you desssperate chickadee? Oh you were so close. Ah ah, no touching. I want to sssee you desperate. That'ss right."
>her hands caress your thighs, your waist, your stomach
>everywhere except your desperately hard manhood
>"I want all of it, chickadee. Your submisssion asss well asss your fear. So tell me, little bird..."
>she shudders and moans
>"...do you want me to finish you off?"
>fuck
>it hurts
>you can't think straight
>Viper is still caressing you, squeezing you, teasing you
"Goddess please, just let me--"
>"You're not getting away, chickadee. Not until I hear you sssay it."
>fuck it
>you're already dead
>maybe it will be quick
"Please, finish me off. I'm so close, goddess! I just need a little more, please."
>Viper hisses in glee
>before spinning her body to throw you down on the mattress
>you land on your back, still wrapped up by the legs
>Viper lands on top of you, fangs bared and eyes wild
>you wince and bring your arms up in a feeble attempt to ward off the deadly attack
>snatching your wrists, you find yourself pinned again
>Viper presses her body against yours, mounting you
>you feel the sensation of her scales against your manhood
>after a moment's grinding, there's a shifting as her slit opens enough for you to slip inside her
>it's different from anything you've felt or even imagined before
>cool and slick

"Fuuuck!~"
>you can't control yourself anymore
>you're battered and bloodied
>just one last pleasure before oblivion
>you thrust up into her with reckless abandon
>already close from her stroking, you can feel your climax building once more

>Viper drags your orgasm out
>forcing you you squirm and moan beneath her
>when you're done, you can't feel your lower half at all
>still she keeps milking you for a little while longer, making you whine as the overstimulation fries your nerves
>"You sssing so pretty for me, chickadee~"
>Viper releases you, pushing off from on top of you and unwinding her tail from your legs
>you just lay there
>you're spent
>"That wasss fun. Your fear tasssted lovely..."
>you make the monumental effort to turn your head and watch as she slithers across the room

>I pressed my whole body into hers, burying my face in her fur
>I could have fallen asleep right there, but she pulled me into a hug and rolled over
>I was on my back, and the seductive vixen had me pinned to my own bed
>She gracefully raised herself to be sitting on me, with her knees supporting her
>She tossed the blanket off of us and looked down at me in all her beauty
>With one hand, she slipped my boxers down my legs, exposing my erection to her
>Excitement and nervousness took hold, causing me to shake a bit under her
>She calmed me by repeating her soft face brushes from earlier, even lightly tracing a clawed finger along my chest
>"Don't worry. All you need to do is relax. I promised to make you feel good."
>She lifted up just a bit, sliding my length into her nethers
>The new sensation caused me to gasp, and she caressed my cheek to comfort me
>"I'm going to start moving now, okay honey?"
>My mouth still ajar, all I could do was nod as I watched the goddess on top of me
>My young, small size made it easy for her, as she only needed to bounce a little bit to rub my entire length from base to tip
>Waves of pleasure hit over and over in a continual cycle of being pushed down into the mattress by the fox woman riding me
>She even started to give small, lip-biting moans after a while
>Eventually she took my hands and placed them on her hips to hold her as she continued to bounce
>A new feeling made itself known in my loins
>I winced as bliss erupted from me, shooting my weak first load into her as far as it could go
>She stopped her movement, lowering down to my face and locking her lips with mine for what felt like entire minutes
>When she finally pulled away, she only said two words
>"Good boy."
>She hugged me tight once more, pulling the covers back over us as she rolled over again, so now I was on top, still hilted inside her
>I fell asleep within minutes
>When I woke up, she gave me a good morning kiss, and then departed
>I never saw her again

>skunk girl likes to dominating her human boyfriend by facesitting
>Both of them know it's her biggest and most dangerous asset

>be human
>rob stores and stuff
>if anyone suspects you pretend to be a weak submissive human and run to the nearest predator for protection
>all this thievery has gotten a local criminal gang under a lot of heat
>one day doing your usual scam a predator is way too happy to protect you
>the komodo dragon girl lays her arms around your shoulder while telling off the cop
>the arm wraps tightly around your neck once they leave
>a car with three other reptillians pulls up
>"You're in a lot of trouble."
>the cop doesn't look back

>Crippled Anon can draw well, and that's it
>That's why he was kept by a mistress
>She would care for him and build up his self-confidence, only to subtly break it to pieces, and cycles for a decade
>Anon didn't realize this and was just told that its normal to be broken, as a result with it he's rather indifferent to people because happiness is a lie and sadness is just shame
>The mistress didn't enjoy his phlegm and was planning to do much worse
>That is until his mistress's car crashed- and with him in it, killed his mistress and severely injured Anon
>What was a casual stroll, changed his life forever
>When the trio stumbled on the wreck, Anon was already starved
>The Brown bear, seeing the opportunity took the initiative and started tending followed by Panda
>The unrelated bear sisters dragged him towards their ramshackle home, which was uncomfortable to Anon because of the dirt and lack of tile floors
>The sisters take it as a slight and growled a response
>That.. got a reaction out of him, he cuddled both his useless leg a bowed his head, protecting himself
>Surprised, it took minutes for him to calm and when he did he cried, knowing that everything he valued was gone except for the notepad canvas on him and his colouring pen/s
>A lightbulb pops up on Brown Bear's head, She gathered both White and Panda on a plan
>It essentially boils down to seducing the human, thus getting distracted on being afraid of them
>"A solid plan!" She says
>She then redirects her sisters on their positions, and pose in front of him, tempting him to draw them as perfectly as he could
>That got his attention, and he started to scribble the lines to ready it for shading
>And so they stood there, occasionally moving and teasing each other, nibbling their ears and slightly nipping their nippled to erect, which made Brown orgasm from the foreplay alone
>Only a few minutes passed when Anon called them out to see what he drew
>They were touched by what he did.

>Be anon
>Be walking downtown to grab a bite for lunch
>Something explodes and the pavement craters
>Great, a pair of supers have decided to start fighting
>Eh, if you get taken out as collateral, at least you won't have to return to work
>They argue about some artifact of a sex god they're fighting over
>Suddenly one of them flings it away and, in a moment of stupid supreme, you catch it.
>Some sort of weird face sculpture a rich person would keep
>Worse, you catch the follow-up car the villain tosses at you
>Darkness....
>You're fairly certain you're haunting your own dead body at this point
>They pry the car off of you and it's hard to tell who is more surpised that you're alive
>Get whisked away to super hero headquarters and get a lot of attention
>You just try not to get an erection being surrounded by so much skintight spandex
>After a bunch of poking by science sticks your results come back
>Peak human fitness and endurance
>You're indestructible
>You've gone up a size in the men's department
>The downsides are you're fucking green, BALD, and your face is hard to remember
>Not a threat to society, no need for training, they send you on your way
>Your cell phone has several new contacts in it for some reason
>Return to work
>See desk is piled with paperwork
>Oh wait, some of it is fan mail...addressed to "the office hunk"
>Slowly, you sit down, and stare at the wall
>You are Anonymous Incognito, the Incredible Hunk
>TFW all the implications finally sink in

>human village worships a pack of wolf spirits
>they protect the village from other spirits and grant blessings for healthy children and good harvests
>in return they demand sacrifices every few years
>the sacrifices must be young virgin males, the wolves will accept nothing else
>the boys are drawn by lots and a feast is held in their honor
>at sundown they are taken to a sacred circle deep in th forest, where they are stripped naked and painted with sacred markings
>families give their last tearful goodbyes, before the sacrifices are tied to the standing stones, and left for the spirits
>nobody knows what happens to the boys, for the spirits will only come forth once everyone has left
>but it's assumed by most of that they are killed and eaten
>in truth, the spirits come to claim the young men as mates, they have their with the boys in a orgy of feral lust, before taking them back to the spirit world, where they will spend the rest of eternity breeding and siring spirit pups

imagine how annoying going to a pool or beach is as a human guy
>the lifeguards, which would always be aquatic anthro species, always watching
>all the other anthros around fretting and hovering around you
>even species that mostly stick to land would be overly worried about human boys/guys swimming due to how shitty humans look as swimmers compared to most other spices
>they keep trying to get you to use inflatable rings or such to hold on to, sit on, lay on, etc
>and if you actually use one they go from being super worried you'll somehow drown to aggressively flirty
>since now you're helplessly floating on the water at the mercy of any of the anthros that are much better swimmers
>otters are the worst offenders and also the species that makes all the others jealous when they have their own humie to parade around on their tummies while they float about

slightly related, but imagine how much high school would reinforce certain ideas from how different humans and anthros are ability wise
>anything physical is heavily favored in the anthro's side
>some fringe cases like endurance stuff letting the humans in decent shape shine
>but the humans would still be crushed in terms of speed
>also would have certain other species right along with humans in endurance like camels, horses, wolves/dogs, etc
>anything involving small fine control of your hands would end up with humans being better at it
>sort naturally pushing humans are being better suited for delicate work with their hands while anthros are more physically capable
>then you'd have health classes that ends up with stuff for different species to brag about like hyenas eating bones and such
>would also make anthros see humans as even more delicate and easy to hurt compared to their hides/scales
>SexEd would be all kinds of weird to cover all the weird stuff each species has going on down there
>also would make humans popular when it gets them having no painful extra features and good stamina in bed

>humans on average are much smaller and more physically frail than anthros
>if that wasn't enough they have no fur, no scales, their senses of smell and hearing suck, and while they have canine teeth they're still shit compared to others
>this all serves to make humans seem small and helpless in anthro eyes
>while most anthros are decent and know that no means no, there are always going to be those who don't, and so human males are often targets for rape and sexual assault
>after all, what's the little skinny gonna do? bite her ankles?
>this only serves to make all the decent anthros to become all the more worried for poor little things, and thus they can become overprotective their little human mates to point of taking complete control of the relationship, to ensure their human partners don't get hurt

>Whew! It's dark out, I guess the moon wanted to be shy tonight.
>Been walking down the street in a more... "run down" area of the city, for what felt like ages.
>Been told a shit ton of "yigs" as mom calls them, hang around here. I've never really hung out around them before.. but my parents told me to stay away from them.
>Mom told me they're furry trash that should go back to Africa, Dad seemed to agree too but they didn't specify why.
>Never got the specieism stuff to be honest, I think they look cool. Fur, scale or skin I can chill with anyone.
>But politics aside, I'm just hoping this trip isn't another one of Michaels, uh, "pranks".
>Since his leg is broke from a certain skateboarding incident, and that I'm his friend. (At least I like to think I am, sometimes.)
>I figured I'd take on the task for him.
>He sent me to this side of town to fetch something "of the utmost importance" and to find a girl named "Barika" on River Street.
>I WOULD of been driving over here, if I only didn't forget to change the apex seals in my Dorito engine!
>But.. He also told me to "have fun on my trip"..
>You know the more I think about all of this the more suspect this is all starting to seem.
>What is he planning? He didn't want to specify what it was that I'm picking up, or even to tell this "Barika" anything much..
>Honestly, he's talked to me about the "yigs" before and he's also told me he's come here often before.
>He has made sexual jokes about them and stuff but he has never mentioned anything specific about them other than; "they're fun."
>ANNNDD I think I'm connecting the dots.
>Really starting to get tired of how vague he can be sometimes, it's like sometimes he's intentionally trying to mess with me.
>How did he even fucking talk me into thi-..
>And just like that, you're pulled out of your train-of-thought to hear:
>Thud, Thud, Thud, Thud.
>I turn around to find the noise, to see it is only a huge tail banging against a plastic garbage can.
>I turn my head up and then to the left,
>To find out that this tail is connected to a towering and yolked hyena female!
>To make matters... "worse" there are 2 other towering and yolked hyena females to the left of her.
>Their biceps are at the very least twice the size of my head alone, as I trail down to their waists...
>I spot the middle ones thighs.
>Yep, boulder crushers right there. Each one is like twice the size of ur hips, in width not even adding circumference.
>They're all at least 7ft tall. The middle girl looks like she is definitely 8ft, if not even taller.
>Jesus.
>They're wearing sweatpants and wifebeaters, of different bland colors ranging from black to grey to white.
>They're practically emasculating me by just standing there, me le 5'6" manlet..
>The middle one is wearing a black wife beater and sweatpants... with no bra.
>Actually, none of them have bra's on, also middlegirl has a cute earing on her left ea-
>"HEY! You gonna speak up shortstuff?" The one on the right decides to break you out of your rude staring.
>I-I uhm, sorry to-
>Middlegirl decides to step in, by her stature alone I have decided she is the leader.
>"Hush beautiful, no need to apologize. Wait a minute, are you anon? Michaels friend right?"
>Holy shit her voice is deep, not manly... but its deep??? God I felt my chest rumble, it's clearly feminine but.. it's so deep.
>It's so jarring. Wait.. Why is that hot?
>You decide to respond before you make an even bigger fool of urself.
>"U-uh... yeah! That's me h-haha, h-how could you tell?
>"Ur slutty little friend sent us a picture of you, so it was pretty easy I suppose."
>GOD DAMN IT MICHAEL. I've so had it with him, sending pics to people I don't even know!
>WOMEN no le-
>Wait..
>"Slutty?" What were these beasts even talking about??
>"What? You don't know?" Uhhh..
>"I-I don't.." What is going on?
>And just like that, the three of them erupt into a booming laughter. My chest is rumbling again..
>Do all hyena women sound and look like they eat 100 pounds of raw protein per day?
>"God he's clueless isn't he? Mi's got you in for a treat skinny." The one on the left states.
>Skinny, haven't heard that one before.
>"Shut the fuck up Yaga! Sorry shortstuff, my friend has a big mouth. Bars, you wanna explain?"
>Bars, who I assume is Barika, turns back to her. "Nahhh, I got something more "subtle" in mind."
>"Yaga" and that other goon start a low giggle. Ah shit.
>Barika turns back towards you and takes a few steps foward, is she snarling or smiling? I can't tell.
>"Just follow us angel, and in time you'll be able to put the pieces together."
>"And trust me, you will not regret it."
>Ohhh shit I'm probably getting into some yigger mafia. Actually, should probably stop saying that before I say it outloud by accident.
>*shiver*
>"A-alright, I'll come with."
>Her "snarl smile" gets bigger, she suddenly walks up next to you and then you feel a heavy arm wrap around you.
>A VERY heavy arm.
>What is this feeling? Saftey? Warmth? At ease? Why am I feeling this, aren't I technically being "forcefully" seduced right now?
>As you start walking you look up at her, and I really mean up, craning my head would be a huge understatement, she's staring right back down at me.
>She's looking at you like she just won the lottery, again, don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. God.
>Whatever, I could think of worse ways to spend a friday night. And it's not like I could be doing anything better right now, might as well socialize.
>And just like that, we all head off into the night.
>Why am I so stupid?
>Ugh.

>live entire life in anthrostate
>under degrading, hostile conditions
>constantly molested
>finally decide to flee into the wilderness
>dying alone is better than this
>avoid state patrols and human catchers
>finally make it so far out that there aren't any signs of civilization left
>just when you think you've made it scot free, you're surrounded by human soliders with rifles
>you're hustled into a humvee and driven away to a military base
>turns out instead of spanning the known world like the propaganda says, the anthrostate is a rump nation that barely controls fifty-thousand square miles
What if the anthrostate was just north korea the whole time?

always a fun scenario
>anthro aliens show up on friendly terms
>start interacting with Earth/humans
>turns out the anthro aliens have big gender imbalance which led to their cultural roles being the way it is with males and females being sort of reversed
>then they learn just how many males humans have
>end up treating human males the same way they treat their males
>also them freaking out when learning humans let their males do dangerous jobs and such
>they also end up looking down on human females as being shitty due to how their culture views how men and women should act
>cue lots of shenanigans between the species and culture shock from both sides
>even more when some humans go to their planet(s)/space stations to live/work
>bonus for the space anthros being bigger than humans too

imagine the propaganda from the anthro's side
>human women sending males to fight in their steed
>many human men/boys don't even want to go to war and are forced into it
>go out and save them from themselves either by force or offering to take them in
>maybe some footage of young draftees being captured with barely any fight from them
>etc

>Short clip of a young male soldier crying into an anthro woman's chest
>Portrayed as him seeking comfort
>He's actually just completely terrified because he's pretty sure his entire platoon just got turned into either red paste or cripples and he's never going to see his family again
>She's holding him there against his will
Join today!

>Have a doting cow wife
>Break an arm after slipping on a suspiciously placed banana peel and falling down some steps
>Your cow wife now INSISTS you drink her milk so you have strong bones and never have to wear a cast again
>Artificially induces lactation and starts milking herself when you aren't around
>Every breakfast is either cereal that's a few bits sugary pieces floating in a pool of milk or some very soupy peaches and cream oatmeal
>Dessert is always homemade ice cream
>Your coffee is always mixed with steamed milk instead of creamer
>You appreciate the lengths your wife is going through to try and support you, but you're seriously getting tired of half your diet consisting of dairy products
>Seriously how does she produce that much milk? Her breasts aren't "that" big for a cow anthro
>One morning you decide to make your own coffee and use creamer, then make your own cereal with only a reasonable amount of store bought milk
>She enters the kitchen and her eyes go wide in shock as she spots the creamer and milk jug still on the table
>"H-honey? Is something wrong? Is the fridge out of my milk? I swear I added another gallon just yesterday." The nervousness in her voice is barely hidden
>"No dear, just felt like making my own breakfast today"
>She moves in closer, the tone of her voice still anxious
>"Was there something wrong with my milk love? Do...do you not like it?"
>You look into those pleading green eyes of hers
>"No, dear. Just felt like having something different today."
>You go back to eating your cereal
>You hear her rummage around the medicine cabinet and quietly (or at least as quietly as an anthro with hooves for feet could be) walk back to you
>She wordlessly drops two pills, one white and one blue, into your coffee and takes a seat at the table
>You look to her with a confused expresion
>"Honey? what were those for?"
>"They're just calcium supplements. The store bought stuff has less nutritional value than the milk I produce so I thought you should take them" She states casually
>"Oh, okay."
>You take a sip of your coffee and-
>Your consciousness groggily returns to you
>You feel surrounded by warmth
>And fur
>Weakly turning your head around you see you're in the bedroom and laying on your wife's naked lap, the only light in the room coming from a dying sun
>She's holding your back up with one arm and rubbing your thigh with the other, the only sound in the room being your steady breathing and a pleasant tune hummed by her
>Looking upward her eyes are closed and a self satisfied smile graces her lips
>The breast closest to your head dribbles with milk
>Sensing you waking, she stops humming and opens her eyes, gaze now turned to you
>"All done sleepyhead?" She coos
>"...What?"
>Her smile grows a little wider
>"After breakfast we decided to get a little frisky. It seems you overexerted yourself and passed out so I've been nursing you back to health in more ways than one the entire afternoon."
>"I don't remember any of it."
>"I did say you passed out, must have lost some of your memory too. And I can't say I blame you, I never knew humans could go for 8 rounds without any breaks. At least on the bright side I won't have to take any of those damn lactation drugs anymore."
>"What do you mean?"
>"Geez anon, eight rounds without any protection and you probably got me super preggers."
>"I thought you said you were on birth control?!"
>"Oh, did I forget to tell you? There's nasty side effects if you take the lactation drugs and birth control at the same time. I stopped taking it when you broke your arm all those months ago."
>"Oh man..."
>Your head drops into her elbow as you try to process the news
>Her gaze lowers from you and onto her belly
>"So, hubby, did you have any names in mind for our calves?"

Humie?
Such a connvention would only exist if humans weren't around.
I imagine something like this would happen.
>Get transported into world full of anthros with no humans.
>Somehow decide it would be a good idea to hit up the place full of people having an unhealthy fetishistic obessesion over you.
>At first anthros would just fawn over you.
>Then they would feel you up, gushing over your smooth skin.
>Next would be aggresive flirting, your "costume" is so good, they just need to get your dick in them.
>If you refuse, some would beg and offer you money.
>Others wouldn't take no for an answer.
>Anthros would find out that everything down there is a little too accurate to be just a costume.
>Now either this ends up with the entire con wanting a ride or the "suspiciously rich humie" would kidnap you to upgrade their bad human collection.

>I want to be a lazy mage's slave/student because she was the only one willing to take a human apprentice.
>I want to be actually talented in the magical arts but completely disregarded because humans are only farmers/traders/messengers
>I want her to not actually teach me anything other than stuff that would make her life even easier (how to levitate objects and make brooms come to life)
>I want her to force me into being her warm compress during winter even though I can just light a magical fire and keep the house warm that way
>I want to be used as a convenient watering can for her garden
>I want to be made to make potions 24/7 that are basically just over the counter medicine
>I want to be rented out to the local farmers when harvest season comes and be forced by her to make all the pumpkins do silly dances as they pile up in a neat pile
>I want to be rented out to the local lord/church when festivals come 'round and be made to do fireworks and other cool/entertaining shit with my magic
>I want to eventually resign myself as her slave/servant and slowly allow myself to enjoy all the cool/fun shit my magic can do
>I want to eventually grow close with my master and then become intimate with her
>I want to impregnate her, marry her, and then grow old together with our little clan of mages.

>8ft tall she wolf who does private security
>built like a brick shithouse, has an eye patch and is covered in scars

>all around a grizzled badass who scares the shit out of everyone she meets
>one day a cute human guy stops by
>asks around for his girlfriend, until he spots the she wolf and immediately starts running straight at her
>everyone penis because they all think this poor little humie is about to get ripped to bloody ribbons
>instead she gets a biggest, goofiest, happiest smile on her face
>human jumps right into her arms and they start making out and talking all lovey dovey
>everyone just stands there dumbfounded as the big bad scary alpha bitch makes kissy faces and calls the human "my widdle shnooky wooky lovey pie"

imagine anthros taking advantage of humans not knowing their culture to get away with lewd stuff
>my species totally greet each other by licking each other's teeth so let me shove my tongue into your mouth
>since we're friends that means I gotta mark you with my scent so hold still while I rub all over you
>it's part of my culture to sniff your butt/balls as a friendship bonding
>for my species we don't sleep alone so make some room for me in your bed

>"Bet you miss it huh?"

>You had heard the rumors about your son.
>Whenever anyone confronted you, you swore up and down that the young man in those videos and pictures wasn't him.
>Your son was a good man, he would never allow himself to become a gigolo for those filthy beasts.
>You rushed up the stairs of his apartment building, elevator be damned.
>You had to question him about this, you wouldn't allow your family name to be sullied by these baseless accusations.
>Barging into his condo, you are crestfallen by the sudden haze of sweat and sex
>Slowly you make your way further in, all over the floor are scattered articles of clothing and various other items.
>Mainly condoms.
>Used condoms to be precise.
>When you reach his room, behind the door you can hear various things.
>Mainly squeals moans from him, and growls and howls from his partners.
>It pains you to see your son as a plaything for these foul beasts, but it is what it is.
>Suddenly, you are startled by a strange sensation along the back of your neck and head.
>You hear and feel sniffs, and then the cold nose of a canine is pressed against your the side of your neck
>"Mmmm~~~, and who might you be?"

>Human kingdom is surrounded by vast amount of tribal furries
>Viewing them as easy thing to wipe out and can take their land they do a mast invasion on all surrounding tribes
>Turns out pretty much all of the tribals are well versed in combat from being barbarians, shamans and druids
>Get push back into human kingdom and forced to sign peace treaty
>Turns out a part of tribal peace treaties are a mass mandatory breeding and marriage binging across the tribes to prevent wanting war
>Human and anthro pairing always have it be the anthro species

>family slowly finds out their son is a beast slut
>lots of videos and pics of him online being ruined by all sorts of anthros
>many "gross/creepy" species too in fetish videos
>like milk baths from cows, horse girls "bukake" him in fem juice, frog girl slimy sex, etc
>figure out why many anthros act the way they do when they see him and giving knowing looks towards him
>also why a lot humans were giving your son dirty looks

>anthros get tired of human women hitting on the human guys they claimed
>having their scent all over him only works on other anthros
>so the anthros come up with having their bf wear a necklace, bracelet, earring, etc that has part of them tied to it
>sharks give one of their many teeth, birds a couple of their feathers, scaled species can use one of their larger scales, furred species just tie a tuft of their fur to them, etc
>ends up being rather romantic with guys receiving handmade trinkets from their anthro GFs showing they're together

>at least she's actually good at it
>her hands have been wander more when grooming you lately and feeling her claws run over parts of you makes you shiver in guilty pleasure
>your mind starts to wander and think about what if she did other things to you that would make you shiver in pleasure too

>Your 10' raptor GF will never come home late after a frustrating day at work, picking you up and carrying you over to the bedroom without a word

>"Oh what's a matter baby? Don't tell me you're getting tired already."
>Susan coos softly as she shifts off from on top of you
>"We've only gone three times each. You don't want to disappoint us, do you?"
>Molly keeps bouncing on your lap, the clap of her ass cheeks against your thighs only just audible over her wanton moans
>"Fuuuck me humie!~ You're not done until--fuck yes~--until I say so!"
>your poor pelvis never stood a chance
>from the moment the session started, you were dragged down onto the bed and fucked into until the cheap frame creaked
>Molly was fierce, gnashing her teeth and raking her claws over you as she took what she wanted from you again and again
>Susan was gentler, but no less passionate in how she bounced her body up and down your cock
>"Keep going sweetie~"
>now she's whispering in your ear, tracing kisses over every bit of exposed skin to coax you into filling her own daughter with another load
>"I need grandbabies, so you can't stop until she's pregnant with triplets, okay?"
>you groan out in the response
>Susan grins sweetly
>"Good boy!"
>the elder grabs your head, lifting it up to make out with you
>the daughter grunts and slams down hard several times, shaking with pleasure as another orgasm rocks her
>you feel her claws dig against tenderized flesh as she grips you tight
>"Good fucking humie~"
>that's only enough to stop her for a few moments
>Molly's back to bouncing on your lap by the time Susan releases you from the kiss with a small bite on your lip
>"You're doing so good for us~ Let go and cum for us again. We won't stop until you're completely drained, so just relax and let go."
>Susan's paws cradle your head and she directs you to look down at the MILF on your lap
>"Don't you want to breed her again? See her swollen and pregnant with your seed?"
>you buck your hips weakly and your cock throbs inside her
>it feels like you're shooting out the last of your life force as Molly milks another load out of you
>she huffs and lets her hips drop down one last time, forcing you balls deep
>"That's it. Make sure you shoot it deep inside me. God this fucking heat gets worse every year..."
>Molly leans over on you, her massive breasts squished against your chest as she looks down into your eyes
>"You humies are a godsend. You were made to pleasure anthros, you know that?"
>she lifts herself off her lap with a groan and rolls over to lie on her back besides you
>"I wish it wasn't illegal to own humies. I don't think he'd mind very much if we just kept him."
>you're too tired to formulate much of a response
>you just look over at her and huff in indignation
>Susan laughs
>"Oh I think you've upset him, Molly. It's okay baby, you'd like being our property. Oh we'd take good care of you, and make sure your balls are drained daily."
>Susan lowers your head back onto the mattress and shifts to sit on the opposite side of you as Molly
>she reaches down to hold your balls in one paw
>"We're almost out of time, but I think you have just enough left to give me a final ride, isn't that right?"
>you manage to pick your own head off the couch to look Susan in the eye
"Fuck yeah I do."
>best job in the world
>Molly bursts into laughter, while Susan tuts disapprovingly
>"Language, young man."
>despite her disapproval, she still moves to straddle your lap and mount you
>Susan takes your shaft in her paw to guide you in
>she takes you balls deep easily, dropping onto your lap fully
>your bruised pelvis aches in protest
>just has to take one for the team
>"Mmh~ That's my good boy. Hold onto my hips baby."
>she lifts your hands to rest on her hips
>you barely have the strength to hold on
>Susan picks herself up
>slowly
>and then she drops down hard, making an audible 'plap!' as the whole weight of her lands on you
>you dig your fingers into plush fur and plusher thighs
>this torture is heaven
>"You like fucking my mom, humie?"
>Molly has scooted in closer to whisper in your ear
>and nibble at your earlobe
>Susan picks herself up off you and drops down hard again
>"Mmf! You're starting to wear me out, boy~"
>despite saying so, Susan bounces on your lap again and again, starting up nearly the same pace as her daughter was going just moments ago
>Molly chews on your ear, then starts kissing and licking at your neck
>"Keep going humie. You love it don't you? Why not just become ours? You'll spend your days trapped beneath two MILFs who fuck you silly. Every night just like this~"
>you roll your hips, panting for breath while you put in effort to pleasure Susan for the end of the session
>Molly keeps whispering sweet nothings as she leaves hickeys and bite marks all over you
>the offer is starting to sound better and better
>"Molly! Ha...ha...Help our darling boy sit up. There's a good girl."
>Susan directs her daughter, and you're hoisted up by your shoulders and pulled into an embrace
>instead of drowning under wolverine ass, now you're smothered between wolverine tits
>"Good boy! Oh good boy!~"
>Susan starts to moan with earnest as she cradles and coddles you
>Molly is wrapped around behind you, supporting you and holding you up to let her mother fuck you how she likes
>and she doesn't let up either
>you feel her claws and teeth against any exposed skin she can reach
>"I can feel him shaking, mom. It's almost cute."
>Molly snorts
>Susan coos
>"Oh he's all tuckered out. We're almost done baby. Give momma one last good load and then you can have some rest, okay?"
>not like you have much choice in the matter
>still, you give your best effort to match Susan's pace
>you manage maybe one thrust for every time she drops down on your lap
>she still moans appreciatively every time you do
>you can feel your eighth climax of the night getting closer
>all your endurance has been pounded out of you
>your moans are muffled by Susan's chest
>Molly still giggles as she hears it from being pressed up against you
>"Gonna cum again, humie? Give her a whole litter of kits~ It's only fair we both get what we want."
>Molly clamps down on your shoulder with her teeth, holding you tight and sending shocks of pain and pleasure through you
>your whole body spasms
>you can feel your heart thumping in your chest
>is it going to give out?
>it feels like it
>especially when you give one last thrust up into Susan and cum deep inside her
>Susan moans and hugs you tight, tugging you slightly away from Molly to force you against her fully
>you may have gone too far
>you're spent
>if you shot your life into Molly, now you've pumped your very immortal soul into her mother to satisfy her desires
>Susan groans and grinds out the last of your seed
>you're done
>you shudder and go limp, held up between the two wolverines
>you're vaguely aware of what they're saying as they shift to let you lie down and breath freely
>"Oh the poor dear, all tuckered out."
>that's Susan
>"He was a lotta fun, shame the session's ending in a couple minutes here..."
>Molly sighs
>but Susan giggles mischievously
>"Well, we could always take him home with us, make sure he makes a full recovery."
>"Mom! Are you serious?"
>"Quite serious. Here, pick him up, we can sneak him out the back door if we're lucky..."
>you don't have the energy
>or desire
>to resist when you're scooped up in a pair of fuzzy arms to be carried off

The Omniwaifur commands that every human boy should...
>wear a collar with his waifur's name so that everyone who he belongs to
>have a paw print tattoo on his groin just above his dick, as a permanent reminder that he is the property of his waifur
>be submissive and obedient to his waifur
>breed with his waifur as often as possible
>stay home and look after his and his waifur's children and be a loving father

>have to pay the rat toll every time you go underground
>humie boys "pay" differently
>living closer to ground level puts you at risk of being grabbed by the rats
>if you live underground the rats consider you belong to them already
>gotta be careful walking near holes and vents that lead underground or you might get pulled in by a rat because she took a fancy to you
>urban exploring also has new risks

>you got your letter today
>the state wants you to go some office to get your wife assigned
>usually the start of a new life as a pampered chewtoy
>but you'd done your research
>when you rented your apartment you'd tactically selected a catchment area that is almost entirely populated by herbivores
>sloths, capybaras, sheep
>stuff like that
>no hyenas, wolves or other crazies
>If you play your cards right you'll get some dopey girl that you'll be able to give the slip and skip town
>Maybe even steal a car
>then go and live off the grid in some sleepy middle of nowhere village
>You are a genius
>You get the bus down to the local office, a former DMV centre
>It's during the day so it's quiet, not many other passengers
>you were slightly worried when some huge pitbull girl got on, but she had a dude half her size clinging to her
>the two of them were acting all lovey-dovey up the front while you tried to remain inconspicuous
>the pit was licking the guys face with a tongue the size and shape of a shovel, and kept prodding him to get objects out of his pocket for her to chew on
>and snap with her massive jaws
>you watch in horror as the femur bone of some large animal breaks like a twig in her mouth
>at this her boy toy politely applauds and pats her head, and gets a face full of tongue again
>these people are fucking nuts
>after another 10 minutes of this you are finally in the centre of town, at the old DMV
>you could still see the outlines of the old letters on the side of the building where they had been taken down
>Someone had graffitied it to say
>Department
>of
>Male
>Violation
>in green paint, along with a bunch of stylised letter Ys and grinning teeth symbols
>fucking yeens
>You hurried inside under the actual new sign, reading 'State Office for Marriage' in standard government print
>inside the lobby there are the usual insipid pictures of happy couples and other propaganda
>pamphlets full of tips for looking after a human husband
>info on tax breaks
>safe restraint techniques and how to deal with escape attempts
>the usual stuff
>you filter through into the main hall
>there's a queue of guys all holding the same letters as you filtering through to a row of kiosks
>most of them look as dejected as you feel>there's a window running along one of the walls into another room, filled with anthro women of various species
>several of them are staring intently through the glass at the guys plodding through the maze of queue barriers
>a hyena is licking the window and panting, a berserk grin on her face
>no surprises there
>you join the end of the line, behind a young guy who looks far too upbeat for a man about to be forced into marital servitude
>he starts trying to talk to you, asks if you are excited to get picked
>oh god
>you try to fob him off but he doesn't take the hint and starts pointing out girls in the waiting room, saying all kinds of stupid shit
>this attracts the attention of the yeen, who starts banging on the glass and waving at him, to the annoyance of the other women
>he cheerfully waves back and nudges you, saying he think's he's got a good chance
>you are utterly baffled, where do they find these people
>thankfully you are soon separated from this crazy person as the queue filters out to the kiosks
>a tired looking rat girl is sat behind the computer
>she asks for your papers so you hand over the letter
>she scans it in and asks you to confirm your personal details
>you give over your name, address and date of birth
>as soon as she puts in your name the white light of her computer screen flashes red across her face
>shit
>"Really, dude? do you know how much paperwork we have to do every time we process a runner?" she groans
>she flicks the microphone on her desk
>"can I get security to kiosk 4? Got a Code 3 here"
>you think about running, maybe you could get out of here before they can grab you
>not a chance
>a chunky pig girl in full mall cop regalia has already blocked off your escape route as she swaggers over
>"You always get the best ones, June." She chuckles to the rat "What's this one's malfunction?"
>"2 counts of avoiding state advised dating without reasonable excuse, 1 count of faking illness to avoid marriage selection and 1 count of attempted escape of state care"
>the pig whistles and looks you up and down
>"well you're a right piece of work, aint'cha?"
>you try and bullshit them, saying that's all in the past and you just want to settle down now
>if your plan is going to work you need to get assigned to some ditz you can escape from
>as you talk crap, behind the pig you can see the young guy from before being led into the anthro waiting room
>he runs over to the hyena, who immediately hoists him into a fireman carry and sprints out of the room like she's just robbed a bank
>which given that she's a yeen she probably has experience
>the rat is on the phone to her supervisors, wanting clarification on what's to be done with you, while the pig just stands there arms crossed and listens to you babble
>the rat finishes her call and starts typing again, cursing under her breath
>"Nice try with the catchment area crap, buddy. The bosses just told me they've had your internet bugged for the last month. You're getting assigned from the special assignments pool."
>shit shit shit
>that doesn't sound good
>the pig laughs
>"Man, you are fucked now. Should have just gone quietly, pal."
>you ask what the hell the special assignments pool is
>the rat sighs
>"some girls actually volunteer to marry troublemakers like you"
>"they sign a bunch of waivers and get vetted as capable of taking on special cases"
>oh great
>not only have you been spied on for the last month and all your plans rumbled
>but you've been earmarked for the "rebellious humies need snapped in two, please sign here" scheme
>this day couldn't get any better
>at least this would delay the process a little
>it would surely take them a while to find one of these psychos, maybe you'll find a way to dodge this
>the rat gets another call
>balancing the phone between her neck and ear, she starts typing like crazy again while giving someone directions on the other end
>"keep him here? no problem just ring us when you're outside, we'll drop him off at the car"
>she hangs up and looks over the counter at the pig
>"she'll be here in an hour"
>you ask who's coming, a higher ranking officer to process your case?
>"no, dumbass"
>"that was your wife"
>”she'll get you out front in an hour”
>your blood runs cold
>so soon?
>this is ridiculous
>the pig grabs your arm and waves bye to the rat as another “happy customer” approaches the kiosk
>the excitement over, the rat sighs and waves a sad little wave back as you are led away and her day returns to tedium
>the pig leads you into her little office with a window looking out over the street
>you wait there with her while she smugly berates you about how you wouldn't be in this mess if you'd just done as you were told the first time
>honestly you aren't really paying attention
>you're scanning every car that passes, trying to figure out which one is carrying your doom
>an anthro that volunteered to take on difficult guys
>what the hell does that look like?
>images flash through your head of german shepherds with latex, whips and questionable politics
>trailer trash rats looking for another baby daddy
>survivalist badgers in prepper bunkers filled with machine guns and cans of beans
>whole platoons of yeens
>old money wolves that'll hunt you for sport
>all these and more whiz through your head
>the pig is trying to show you pictures of her husband
>”look how happy he is!”
>maybe death would be better than this
>the hour crawls by as you desperately track each vehicle as it passes
>then the pig's radio squawks
>as she goes to answer it, you see an expensive looking green estate car roll up
>here we go
>the pig confirms with the rat back at the desk that that is indeed your ride
>she hustles you out of the office and out of the front door
>you blink as the low evening sun gets your eyes
>”good luck, buddy, I think you'll need it!” the pig chuckles as you approach the ominous car
>the driver's door opens, and a pair of long striped legs come out
>a tiger woman in office attire and a skirt gracefully pulls herself out of the car
>she looks down at you with a pair of warm golden eyes through a pair of glasses, backlit by the sun
>she's a foot taller than you
>god above, you are fucked
>”Hello darling, my name's Alice.” she says. Her voice is calm and soothing, and she offers you her large clawed hand.
>”Want to get in the car so I can dodge a parking ticket?” She jokes, and opens one of the rear doors.
>The pig looks over her paperwork, trying to find the right forms.
>”Ms Blau?”
>”Doctor Blau, but yes. I've already sent on all the necessary paperwork to your colleagues, and I've got a copy of his file, officer. Thank you for your assistance.”
>The pig shrugs, gives you a half assed wave and heads back inside
>”Okay doc, enjoy yourself. Check up is in a week.”
>you are left alone with your bride-to-be
>”Clock's ticking, hun. Parking warden is probably right around the corner.” Alice whispers conspiratorially to you, a wry smile showing off some worrying teeth
>she's still patiently offering you her hand, and holding the door of the car open
>you think about running, but looking at her you wouldn't get far
>at least she seems nice enough
>haha
>you take her hand
>you take her hand
>she grips it tightly and ushers you into the back seat
>the interior of the car is all plush cream leather, polished silver and black detailing
>she must be a doctor if she can afford something like this
>she swiftly closes the door once you are sat down, and climbs into the driver's seat
>she's barely sat down before she turns on the child lock, disengaging the rear doors
>no getting out now
>You meet her eyes in the rear view mirror
>”So, how's your day been so far?” she asks languidly as she maneuvers her way through the busy city centre traffic
>you don't really know how to answer, so you just shrug
>”I imagine you're nervous but don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to talk when we get back to my place.”
>you drive for another fifteen minutes, the big car effortlessly eating up miles of road.
>Alice asks you what you do for a living
>you give a non-committal answer about this and that
>”Huh, with your degree I thought you might have a job working with computers.”
>your blood runs cold
>you ask her how she knows about your degree
>seeing your shock, she grins in the rear-view mirror and lists off your date and place of birth, your full list of qualifications and your last three employers
>”Don't look so scared, darling. I've read your file. The state sent it to me a week ago when your letter was sent out.”
>the bottom falls out of your world
>this whole thing was orchestrated from the start
>her eyes are boring into yours as you glide along the freeway
>”I need to know as much as I can about you if I'm to take care of you, anon. It's part of my duty of care as your wife, and as a doctor.”
>”Especially since you have these problems with authority.”
>”But we an talk about that once we've had dinner.”
>the car pulls up to a row of townhouses on a leafy boulevard
>Alice parks up on the street and gets out, before coming round to let you out
>she takes you by the hand and leads you up the steps to the door
>”We can head over to your place tomorrow and pick up anything you need. I'll call your landlord and let them know you are moving out.”
>she unlocks the front door and you both head inside
>sunlight streams in the windows of the lounge, where a large leather couch and a pair of armchairs crowd around a stone fireplace
>Alice heads towards the kitchen and motions to the couch
>”Sit yourself down, I'll get us something to drink.”
>whatever
>this is all a bit much
>you sink into the soft leather as you hear a cork popping
>Alice comes back over with a pair of crystal glasses of red wine
>as she hands it to you, you sigh in dejection
>this doesn't seem too bad
>”Cheers, honey.” Alice says, a warm smile on her face. She takes a sip of her wine.
>you offer a wan smile and drink a mouthful.
>immediately something's wrong
>you fucking idiot
>your mouth goes numb
>rule number 1
>don't drink anything you haven't poured yourself
>dumbass
>you try and stand, but your legs are already going weak
>Alice calmly takes the glass from your hands before you can drop it and places it on the table
>what the hell did she dose you with
>with herculean effort, you manage to take a step away, towards the door
>as soon as you try and take another you fall
>straight into her arms
>”My, did that go straight to your head? We need to work on your relationship with alcohol, darling.”
>she holds you up as your whole body turns to jelly
>but you are still fully conscious
>you start panicking, weakly twitching in her embrace
>”After all, I've seen your file. How much cheap vodka you've been buying over the last year.”
>”You need help.”
>she drags you over to one of the armchairs and sits down, pulling you onto her lap.
>you try and wriggle away
>”Now now, don't struggle. Focus on breathing. We've got about 15 minutes until the dose takes full effect so just try and relax for me, my little man.”
>She pulls up her phone
>”We can use this time to have a look over the rest of your file.”
>she starts reading over your criminal history, how you have been trying every trick in the book to get away from marriage
>”What's odd to me is how much effort you've put in, yet you are still living in the city, where the state can keep trying to get you assigned.”
>”You could have just ran off into the wilderness if you hate anthros so much. It's not unheard of.”
She leans in close to your ear
>”I think you want to get caught. You want to put up a big fight to satisfy that male ego of yours, but deep down you know where you belong.”
>she pulls up another page
>your internet history
>oh god no
>”Now this is interesting. Apart from all the cruel posting you've been doing on buncel.net you've also shown some worrying patterns.”
>she pulls up an order receipt for booze from a friday night.
>”You self medicate with alcohol.”
>She swipes onto a porn site, where a still image of BROKEN BOYS XII shows a young man with his face deep in some canine's pussy, a clawed hand yanking his hair
>”Then you indulge in degrading pornography.”
>then the final tab
>oh no
>not this one
>Youtube : YEEN'D: SFW AFTERCARE COMPILATION
>”Then this. You poor thing. How many times have you watched this?”
>she presses play on the video
>a man and a big hyena are lying in bed all wrapped up in blankets, cuddling each other
>a tinny voice plays out of the phone speakers
>”I love you babe, you're such a good boy.”
>you fall apart, weakly blubbering in Alice's arms
>she pats your head
>”Shhh it's okay. This is what you want, isn't it?”
>”I can be there for you. But you need to understand something.”
>”You are unwell. You've been doing harm to yourself for so long that you can't undo it by yourself.”
>”You need me to help you.”
>”You belong here. You belong to me.”
>She tilts your head up with a hand
>and kisses you
>you're face isn't numb anymore
>but you still can't move
>you can feel her claws cradling her throat, her lips pressed against yours
>you can't get away
>she goes deeper
>she pushes her tongue into your mouth, eliciting a weak little moan from you as her free hand begins effortlessly tearing your shirt to ribbons
>you can taste the wine on her lips
>you can feel her claws running down your chest
>it's terrifying
>but she's right
>somewhere deep inside you you've always wanted this
>you hid it, hated yourself for it
>but it was always there
>she breaks away, panting, her eyes aflame with desire
>”You can feel it all, can't you?”
>“For the next hour, you'll be able to feel everything I do to you.”
>“But you can't stop me. You'll never be able to stop me.”
>She tears off what's left of your shirt and stands up, lifting you in her arms
>she walks over to the huge fireplace, and places you on the rug in front of it
>with a snap of her fingers the fire springs to life
>she stands over you, panting, backlit by the flames
>with a grunt Alice rips off her own shirt, her bra and her skirt
>then kicks her shoes across the room and clambers on top of you
>you still can't move
>but like she said
>you can feel everything
>the heat of the fire
>her fur rubbing over your skin
>her breath on your neck
>her hands undoing your belt
>you are hard as a rock by the time she yanks your trousers down to your ankles
>she rubs her big, fluffy hands over your cock, licking her lips
>she laughs
>”At least the important part of you still works, honey. That dose was perfect.”
>”Sometimes I even impress myself.”
>you barely manage to force out a few words from your uncooperative mouth
>”you're crazy,” you croak
>She giggles, then crawls up your body, running her claws up your arms to rest on your shoulders.
>“Well if your precious little mouth is back online, I guess I'll have to use that too, won't I?”
>She destroys her panties with a single claw, baring her drooling, fuzzy cunt.
>“You know what you need to do, right? My little broken boy?”
>crazy isn't the right word
>She pulls your head up by the hair and shoves her pussy into your face.
>she isn't gentle
>she grinds against your face, panting and growling
>you do your best to give her what she wants
>for a good couple of minutes you make out with her sex, getting utterly drenched in her scent
>then she stops, and pulls you in for another kiss.
>”You're such a good boy, darling. You deserve to get off too.”
>the words are like electric fire running through your body.
>she holds you close for a moment, a placid smile on your face, her eyes lidded
>Alice shifts positions and lies on top of you, embracing you
>she starts nibbling at your neck
>”When I worked A&E I never got the appeal of marking boys. It seemed so risky. Barbaric. I've had more than one idiot have to get her mate airlifted to hospital with a jugular bleed.”
>”But..” She stops her teasing for a moment, her instincts warring with her better judgement.
>then she strikes
>Her teeth sink into the nape of your neck
>you let out a strangled cry of pain
>it's agonising
>but some sick little part of you is satisfied
>your hers now
>you'll always have her mark on your flesh
>she growls like a rabid beast
>then releases you, coughing
>”God I'm so sorry, darling. I just couldn't help myself.” She looms over you, her eyes unfocused, her teeth stained with your blood. She licks it off.
“It doesn't look bad, okay? I'll get it dressed once we're done.”
>”Let me make it up to you, okay?”
>she moves to straddle your waist
>positioning herself above your unattended, painfully hard cock
>”I nearly forgot the most important part.”
>agonisingly slowly, she lowers herself onto you
>you let out a throaty groan as she sinks lower and lower
>”Make as much noise as you can, baby. I want to know how good this feels, okay?”
>then she starts riding you
>her hands digging into your sides, she rides you like a jackhammer
>she starts panting and chuffing, her animalistic noises mixing with your weak, breathy moans
>you feel like you're disintegrating in her hands
>it doesn't take long before you are at your limit
>”Alice...” you moan
>”Yes darling, I know,“ she pants, her whole body shaking as she inches closer to the edge
>she speeds up
>as she leans over you, one of her hands moves from your side,
>and wraps around your throat
>bang
>Alice shudders, screaming through gritted teeth as orgasm burns through her body
>her sex twitches and gushes all over you, sending you over the edge as well
>the feeling is almost religious
>you feel like you are vibrating out of your own body as rope after rope of seed shoots into Alice's womb
>the two of you collapse into a wet, shuddering mess
>Alice eventually comes to her senses, and lifts herself off of you
>she goes into the kitchen and brings back some gauze and some rubbing alcohol
>she rubs down the big bite on your neck, as well as some secondary scratches across your body
>she bandages your neck and ties it off
>”There. Wasn't much bleeding anyway but I'm not risking it.”
>Alice stoops down and lifts you up, holding you like a child
>”You're such a good boy, darling. I'll never let you go.”
>”Let's get to bed.”
>you wake up the next morning with an array of aches and pains but able to move again
>Alice is making breakfast in the kitchen
>she asks you to go out to the car and bring in some stuff she'd left in the trunk last night while she fries you up some eggs and bacon
>might as well get some fresh air
>you go outside, pulling your loaned sweater up over your bandages, and take in a deep breath
>you have no idea how to process last night but hopefully it'll all work out
>you smell a whiff of tobacco from behind you and turn round
>no fucking way
>the young guy from the DMV yesterday is standing on the porch of the next house along, sporting a black eye, a cigarette in his mouth and a sweater with “It's not easy being Yeen” on it
>that pun is terrible fuck you
>He looks at you with a shit eating grin, and points out your bandage
>”Women, eh? Cant live with 'em, can't live without 'em, ey neighbour?”
>oh god no

>move into an anthro apartment building
>the rooms/apartments inside have no doors since anthros have different views on privacy
>with their sense of hearing and smell there's really no privacy anyways
>whole apartment is treated like one big pack/hard/etc
>usually means most are usually filled mainly with one species with the occasional different ones and other species closely tied to that main species
>have to get used to many different cultural species quirks
>like no beds in the apartments and instead a single big room dedicated to sleeping in where all the floor is just one giant bed/padding
>you also totally didn't almost have an emotional breakdown from being cuddled by so many anthros just because they want to
>bathing is also different with a dedicated grooming area
>depending on the main species that area can have a huge pool or simple showers depending on how water inclined the species are
>and when it comes to grooming there's always another anthro around willing to help since grooming in a pack/herd/etc is bonding
>since all you have is hair on your head it gets way more attention then needed
>smooth skin threw the anthros for a loop for a little while until they learned about lotions and oils
>also get warned of an upcoming date, heat season
>highly suggested all male tenets leave the apartment for the period, stay close to your mate(s), or a suggestion to stock up on water/fluids
>seems all the females that have lived in the apartment long enough have ended up syncing their heats together
>and being a male in the apartment with no claiming scent on you means you're free for grabs by any female if you stay in the building during the heat period
>again, depending on which species makes up the majority the apartment that possibility ranges from how dangerous it could mean for your body

>live with a bunch of bovine girls
>spend a lot of time doing stuff with them
>things like grooming them, milking them, cuddling with them, letting them have their way with you
>but hey at least they treat you as an equal, which is more than you can say for most anthros
>their milk is pretty good too

>Rome was founded by two guys who grew up sucking on wolf tits
>2500 years later and wolf anthros still wont let you forget it

Basically curb the rights of human men, especially in regards to free speech, self determination, the ability to own things and have a job, and bodily autonomy. Can’t say shit about the anthrostate, can’t choose your wife, can’t own shit (belongs to your wife, mother, or state appointed caretaker) nor could you have a job to earn money, and you don’t even have a right to your body or privacy. If you were raped it would be your fault, unless you were already married then the case would be for your wife figuring out how damaged her property was (you).
Assuming there’s friction between the various anthro species (which is likely) whichever species or faction was on the top would set up advantages and disadvantage different species. For example if herbivores were in charge they would set up systems that judge suitability for a husband, kids, and ability to be around kids (eg teacher) based on something like aggressiveness which would be highly biased against carnivores semi-biased against true omnivores. Cheetahs might be marked as aggressive because of their canines and bite force, but a horse won’t be despite having a stronger bite force, while a Maned Wolf (being an omnivore)would score in the middle. Suitability for a husband and kids might consider house size but discriminated anthros would have smaller houses and property already. For the discriminated species to have better access (not equal to the higher caste of course) they’d have to be model citizens. A Sheep teacher is going to get another chance over and over again, while a Wolf teacher may get fired over a smile that showed too many teeth despite having an otherwise perfect record. Lower caste Carnivores will get low quality husbands if they get them at all, otherwise they’ll get a turkey baster full of baby batter and if they give birth to a human boy he’ll get taken away to be adopted by an infertile Herbivore/Human couple.

>if carnivores were in charge they would be lenient towards herbivores. because being carnivores they don't have much to worry about
>if herbivores were in charge they would treat the carnivores harshly out of fear
>tfw herbivores are unironically more harsh than carnivores
>tfw herbivores are the biggest douches in the anthrostate
>tfw zootopia was right all along

Most interpretations of “The Anthrostate” are fascist states, and those are always shitholes, terrible for everybody unless you’re at the top and in favor with the regime. The Anthrostate controls access to Human Men meaning they aren’t actually citizens but a resource to be used and dolled out, damned be their wellbeing. I don’t know how many of the snippets in these stories talking about what humans guys might suffer are in universe rumors for world building rather than potential outcomes, but it paints a very dystopian picture. At best men are coddled to the point of being smothered and at worse are often sextoys whose wellbeing is secondary to base needs of anthro women using them to fulfill sexual urges without taking care of their mate.

I've always seen the anthrostate as more 1984 than third reich. Faceless but omnipresent.

IMO Assignment Risk had the best anthrostate

>ywn have her ride you and make out with you until she has had her fill, not caring how many times you've cummed already

Imagine anon being a boxer underdog trying to take the anthro league by storm(there was no rule that disallowed humans air bud style)

>anon makes a name for himself beating boxer after boxer, showing humans can be just as strong as any other anthro
>his wife wants him to stop, knowing thay the farther he does the more likely he is to face an opponent that will end his career and then some
>he ignores her, hell bent on proving himself and humanity
>he eventually gets to his first big title fight, where he must face off against his lover
>he doesnt want to hurt her and vice versa, but still has his pride on the line and tries to take her down
>she knows its futile, and she could rock his world with one move, but decides to rock it in another way
>she proceeds to fuck him live on television showing that he cant beat her in the ring, or the bedroom
>it becomes a huge scandal, them only getting out of legal trouble because she “technically” took down someone making anthros look weak
>he is sad that he will never be able show the world how strong and resilient humans can be, but his wife knows as nobody else could handle her in bed

>Human keeps winning fight after fight
>Not because he's actually beating the anthro, but because none of his anthro opponents want to be known as "That girl who beat up a defenseless little humie on live television"
>Time after time he works up a sweat punching, kicking, and juking his way to victory, never noticing how his opponents were barely even reacting to his hits until at some random point faking a heavy blow and dropping to the floor
>He finally gets to a well experienced tiger woman who has too much pride on the line to go down so easily
>She lets him tire himself out while effortlessly blocking all of his punches
>When he seems to be slowing down she throws the lightest possible punch she can, her boxing glove landing squarely on his cheek
>The human stumbles backwards a few steps, then fall to the ground, limp
>She puts her gloves to her cheeks and screams so loud the whole audience hears it
>"OH MY GOD I JUST KILLED HIM!"
>After throwing her gloves off she rushes towards his prone body, lifting his shoulders onto her lap and cradling his head in her muscular arms
>She briefly stops her animated sobbing when his eyes slowly open, staring deliriously into her slit pupils
>She leans her head down when he opens his mouth and in a slurred whisper says...
>"I was going easy on ya, you big pretty kitty cat"
>She smiles warmly at his signs of life, perhaps humans were not so fragile after all
>She would have to test this hypothesis further, after she carries him to the ambulance already waiting outside
>Though she has a feeling further fights with him would be more horizontal than vertical in nature

>"Again!"
>You strike the wooden mannequin.
>"Harder!"
>You strike again.
>"Not good enough!"
>You pause to catch your breath, sparing a glance to your master who stands beside you.
>Mistress Ninghong stares at you with an expression that is anything but tranquil.
>Her orange fur and bright red eyes only seems to enhance her look of anger, frustration, and...smugness?
>"Did I say you could take a break?"
>"No master" You tiredly respond.
>As you resume your routine, she paces and begins an all too familiar lecture.
>"When you petitioned for entrance into our illustrious school, did you think you would be given special treatment?!
>Weak human or no, male or no, you were told you would be held to the same high standards as any of our disciples.
>Instead, I find you spend more time ogling your classmates than practicing your techniques!"
>Biàntài!" She snarled.
>"I'm sorry master!" You whimper as you continue your routine, wondering what your punishment would be this time.
>Would you have to scrub the floors of the kwoon again? With how huge the training hall was, and mistress Ninghong's exacting standards, it would take >both day and night to polish.
>"Enough of your sniveling apologies! Results are the only thing that matter, and its time to see if anything I have taught you has stuck."
>"Master?" You queried, wondering what she could mean. Did she want a demonstration?
>"You will face me in a sparring match, and if I am not satisfied with what I see, you will pay the price of wasting my time!"
>Your blood ran cold at these words. The mistress wanted to spar with you? You knew the fearsome strength and agility she possessed, both as a tigress and as a master martial artist.
>You would be feeling this for weeks.
>You both took your positions on opposite ends of the ring that was painted on the floor.
>You took a moment to study her, trying to figure out what strategy would work best against her.
>Try being the operative word here, as you found your gaze lingering places it really shouldn't.
>The way her Qipao clung to her body in the humid air, seemingly enhancing her feminine curves.
>The way it opened at her neckline, framing her cleavage. The way the slits on the side exposed her legs.
>That's why you almost didn't react in time when first blow came. You just barely dodged to the side as she slashed at the air.
>You tried to counterattack at her exposed side, but she effortlessly whirled away.
>You tried to close the gap with a palm strike aimed at her solar plexus, but she brushed your hand aside and raised her leg for a high kick.
>You know you should have jumped backward, but something caught your eye, freezing you in place.
>As she raised her leg, her dress pulled aside. Damp from the wet air, her panties clung to her, revealing the outline of her mound.
>You stared agape just long enough for her kick to collide with your head, sending you tumbling to the ground.
>In seconds she was apon you. What was odd was that rather than hold you down, she actually straddled you, her hips against yours.
>She looked down at you, grinning with triumph.
>"Just as I expected, you were never good enough to be one of my students." Her words stung more than the forming bruise on your head.
>"Since we've firmly established you can't keep up, I guess there's no place for you here".
>Tears welled in your eyes. For four long years this school had been your home. Where would you go? What could you possibly do?
>You had only ever wanted to be a martial artist, and no kwoon would take you in once word spread you had been kicked out.
>You begged her for another chance to make up for your indolent ways.
>Her grin grew wider at the sight of your groveling.
>"You know, I think I could be persuaded in letting you stay."
>Hope rose in your heart at these words.
>"You would have to earn your keep and you clearly don't have what it takes to be a student, but there may be something else I suspect you might be good for."
>Your hope fell, were you going to be made a janitor?
>"Yes, I think there is something I could use you for. Something i'm told humans are particularly gifted at. You see, all this teaching builds up so much stress in me. I really could use someone to take it out on."
>Ok, so from janitor to punching bag? You were liking this less and less.
>Still, if you got to stay here, there was a chance of redeeming yourself.
>You told her you accepted her terms, waiting for her to let you up.
>Instead you watched in shock as she reached under her dress and began sliding her panties off her legs, only lifting off you to pull them all the way down and off.
>Then, she began inching her way forward.
>In a matter of moments, she was straddling your head. She began grinding her sex on your face while using her powerful legs to prevent you from turning away.
>You thought it might be over when her rubbing stopped, only for a single command to reach your ears.
>"Lick."
>You immediately set to work, kissing her quim. You began with small timid licks to the outside rim of her petals, before venturing deeper into her. You traced her depths slowly and lovingly, only beginning to speed up when you felt her squirming on top of you. As she again began rubbing herself on you, you focused your ministrations northwards, towards and around her pearl of flesh.
>You knew you had succeeded in your task as a roaring scream could be heard above as you were getting drenched in her nectar.
>Finally she lifted off you, giving you time for to gasp in fresh air.
>She looked at you and laughed.
>"See, I knew there was something you could be useful for!"
>You began to lift up when she forced you down again.
>"Did I say you were done?"
>Again her hips dropped onto yours as she began stripping off her dress.
>Soon she was bare, but no less intimidating in her nudity. Her corded muscles rippling under her fur.
>She wasted no time pulling off your pants and seizing your masculinity.
>It was a strange sensation, feeling your length enclosed by soft hair and rough pawpads, calloused through years of hard training.
>She was content to feel you throb in her hand for a few seconds, but soon she began aligning you with her entrance.
>When she was satisfied, she unceremoniously let her self fall, forcing you into her.
>Words could barely describe the sensation. You felt as if a silk glove over a hand made of steel had gripped you and was trying to squeeze the life from you.
>Now more than ever, you understood just how strong she truly was. The muscles in her core held you and worked you over. You suspected that if she wanted, she could hold you to her with nothing but the muscles in her sex.
>She began lifting herself up before dropping down, again and again.
>Each slam made you wince. It was clear she was using you for her own pleasure, your comfort being second on her mind, if at all.
>Over and over, that silken vice moved. You closed your eyes and focused on the sensation as she rode you.
>You could hear her moaning increasing in pitch, her pace speeding up. You could feel your own climax rising, as the muscles in your core began to tighten.
>Suddenly, you could feel her spasming around you as an earsplitting screech erupted from her lungs.
>Her quivering depths literally wrung the orgasm from you, collapsing and expanding in time with your own spasm, literally sucking the seed from within you.
>When it was finally over, you began to realize just how battered your hips were. Hopefully you would be allowed to rest tomorrow.
>"That was satisfactory, for today. I will expect the same tomorrow, do not dissapoint me."
>Or not.

>"I should at least get a kiss out of keeping a pretty guy like you safe, right?"
>He's very flustered by this
>Probably used to unassertive human women back home
>He gives you a quick departing kiss on the cheek before vanishing into his apartment
>You practically skip your way home dreaming up the rest of your life with him
>Maybe there's still hope for you after all?

>You point your muzzle towards the clock on the wall
>Just past five, finally time to get out of the office and make the short walk home, thank god
>It wasn’t that you disliked the job or your coworkers, it’s just that you couldn’t wait to finally engage in a very particular weekly ritual you recently started doing, one that gave you the kind of stress relief that made the start of the next work week not nearly as dreadful
>Okay, let’s file away these papers, clean up the inbox, shut down the comp-
>The door to your office opens, the head of one of the workers under your command timidly peeking in
>”Hey Mrs. Boarson, I got those reports done like you asked.”, he says
>Your yellow eyes slowly drift up from the screen over to him, a harsh look on your face
>”It’s Ms. Boarson to you, welp.” You growl before giving a cold order. “Let me see them.”
>”S-sure Ms. Boarson.” He walks over to your desk with the stack of papers in hand
>He presents them to you and you snatch them with a clawed hand
>”Okay Michael, let’s see, this time you used the correct formatting, headers look good, correct color coding…Ah!” You rap your fingers against the desk and shake your head disapprovingly. “That’s not right, not right at all.”
>You look back up to him, his face seems a few shades paler and the smell of fear hangs in the air
>You put the papers on your desk and slide them forward
>”Michael, you used the wrong font. We use Times New Roman at this company. I can tell you didn’t read the formatting guide I emailed to the entire department last month. If you did then you would know this.” You coldly lecture. “Now get these things out of my office and fix them. I also want you to double check every single page for errors before resubmitting your reports to me first thing tomorrow morning.”
>Standing up you tower over the human in front of you, the fearful look on his face causing you no small amount of joy
>”I will not tolerate further failure from you Michael. We both know how tenuous your current employment at this company is. Do not make me regret letting you transfer into my department.”
>You put your hands on the desk and lean forward, your tusks mere inches from his face
>”You do not want to see what I do to screw ups around here Michael. It…isn’t…pretty.”
>He rapidly shakes his head up and down in an affirmative
>”Y-yes Ms. Boarson I’ll get those reports fixed right away. It’s gonna take me a couple hours but-“
>”I do not care how long it takes!” You shout. “Just get them done and have them on my desk first thing in the morning.”
>”I will, I will, don’t worry!”
>Michael grabs the stack of reports off your desk and scurries out of the room
>Satisfied that you’ve properly scared him into compliance you sit back down, landing with a thud as your tired knees struggle to slow your fall
>Michael, what a cute little humie he was, not that he would ever know your affection towards him
>He was pretty quiet, mousy, easily commanded by the sound of your voice, you didn’t even need to poke him with your claws or tusks to give him additional motivation
>Usually, anyway
>Your gaze shifts back to the clock, a quarter past five? Time to get out of here before you run out of time to “relax” tonight
>Gathering your belongings you turn the lights in your office off and stroll through the hallways towards the exit, giving polite but brief greetings to the coworkers you liked and emotionless glares to the ones you didn’t
>Your hooves hit pavement and with a steady gate you stroll to your house
>The air outside is cold, not that you felt it with the dense gray fur that covered your body
>The cold weather also meant that every humie outside today would be wearing several layers of clothing to protect their furless little selves from the elements
>A minor complication for your activities tonight
>Finally arriving at your house you unlock the door and step inside
>The inside is quiet, no one comes to greet you, no one lovingly calling your name, just the familiar rumble of traffic outside and the occasional police siren
>Just like every other time you’ve come home for the past several years
>Empty, kind of like your life now that you think about it
>Not that blamed you blamed your kids for leaving the house as soon as they could, you were a total mess after the divorce
>But now is not the time to have another embarrassing alcohol fueled self-pity session, you’ve got to get ready for tonight!
>Throwing your briefcase onto the couch you stomp towards the bathroom, already beginning to unbutton your navy suit jacket and relieve some of the pressure on your bust
>Not even bothering to shut the door you begin undressing yourself in front of the mirror
>The pearl necklace around your neck comes off first with your simple studded earrings following soon after
>Your suit jacket and dress shirt make a neat pile on the floor, your bra the only garment remaining above the waist
>It takes longer than you expected to get your skirt off, could have sworn it wasn’t so tight when you put it on this morning, or maybe you’re just getting fatter
>After some gentle encouragement it falls down your legs and is kicked into the pile with the rest of your clothes
>Reaching towards your back you unclasp your bra and throw it onto the pile, it’s soon joined by your panties
>You glance at the mirror taking in your naked form
>Beady yellow eyes atop a long muzzle tipped with a wet black snout
>Two tusks jutting out from your lower jaw, their color turned deep yellow with age
>Most other sows got them whitened, you never really saw the point, not like you were supposed to be out there chasing men at your age
>Your breasts and belly were covered in a shorter fur than the rest of you, more like fuzz than hair
>Two sizable breasts tipped with jet black nipples hung off your chest, slightly sagging as they gradually lost the fight with gravity with each passing year
>Below each breast were two smaller ones, so that you could give milk to a full litter without a piglet going hungry
>A purpose that’s long since been served
>Your body as a whole could best be described as large framed and plushy, the fat gained from your pregnancy never really going away, not that you ever tried to get rid of it
>You turn your hips to get look at your butt and tail
>Short tail with a bushy tip and your fat fucking ass jiggling as you adjust your posture
>Just what the humies liked, or at least you think they did, you’ve never bothered to get their opinion on your posterior
>Boring and uncomfortable clothes now discarded it was time to get into a much more pleasant uniform for tonight
>Black fish net stockings are pulled up to your thighs and attached to lacy black panties, their bands compressing your flesh slightly
>Claws are painted a deep burgundy
>Your breasts are barely contained in a black bra made of thin fabric, the outline of your nipples plainly visible
>A thin line of red lipstick adorned your lips
>You ruffle up the fur around your head to add a bestial flare to your look and snarl into the mirror
>You appeared equal parts beastly, whorish, and refined
>The perfect recipe for striking fear into whatever humie you were going to snatch off the streets tonight and ravage
>Well, you were going to try and ravage them
>In the past you were content simply pulling them into a dark alley and violating their furless bodies with your tongue and fingers, maybe giving them a handy while looking them in the eye and whispering crude nothings into their ear before letting them go
>It was the perverse thrill you craved, not like anyone was going to report your activities to the police and even if they did there’s no way a respectable businesswoman like yourself would be suspected of such a crime
>Not to mention a large portion of the police force being composed of pigs and boars like yourself making it easy to request a favor
>But today? There’s a fire in your loins you haven’t felt in a long time
>You were going to get your fill tonight by being filled
>Now it’s just a matter of walking over to your preferred hunting grounds and waiting for a clueless humie to get near you
>Putting a large coat on you begin the journey to the dark alley you liked to hide in
>It’s a short walk, the streets are mostly empty this hour aside from the occasional hobo, drunk, and late night jogger
>Finding your dark alleyway you slink in, put your nose to the wind, and wait
>And wait
>And wait
>You sniff the air as a new scent comes across your nostrils
>Human, male, young, no trace of alcohol or tobacco so he’s probably not some hobo
>A perfect target
>Your ears pickup his footsteps and you get into position by the corner of the alleyway
>He’s getting closer…
>So close…
>And…NOW!
>The second he comes within range you grip him by the shoulders and throw him into the darkness behind you landing with a grunt
>Wasting no time you throw off your coat and stomp towards him, the loud clops from your hooves bouncing off the walls as you advance
>It’s too dark to make out anything more than the vague outline of his body but with your nose it’s easy to tell where your prey lies
>Before he can cry out you straddle his prone body and place a hand over his mouth, growling before whispering into his ear
>”Listen humie, don’t struggle or you’re just going to make things harder for yourself. I don’t want to hurt you and you want to live, so just let this happen and we’ll both get what we want. Okay?”
>You can barely make out a muffled “okay” coming from his mouth
>”Good, good, now I’m going to take my hand off your mouth. If you make any noise other than lustful moans and pleasured grunts I’m going to take a claw and…”
>You take the dull side of one of your claws and run it against his throat
>In response you get a frenzied rush of muffled affirmatives, seems he gets the point
>”You learn fast humie. Now just sit back and enjoy the show, not like you have a choice”
>Grabbing his head with both hands you immediately put your mouth to his, thrusting your tongue past his teeth and into his mouth
>You trace his gums with your muscly tongue making sure to coat every inch with your saliva
>When you push too deep you feel a suppressed gag, guess you found his limit
>Satisfied with your domination of him so far you exit the kiss, strands of saliva dripping and sagging from the corners of both your mouths
>You continue your exploration of his body, tearing his jacket and shirt up with your claws before leaning down to coat his now bare chest with your drool
>You move up to lap at his neck, intentionally poking the bottom of his chin with your tusks eliciting the cutest little gasps each time your sharp enamel touches his tender flesh
>By now he was fully coated in your scent meaning is he had an anthro girlfriend she was in for one hell of a surprise when he got home today, assuming she even lets him back in the house that is
>Time to take it to the next level
>Feeling around for a zipper you quickly pull his pants down to his knees and release his cock from its confines
>Damn, it’s already fully erect, guess you caught a real sicko tonight
>No matter, this just means you don’t need to waste any time getting him hard, if anything his deviancy is doing you a favor
>Gripping his cock with one hand you lean forward to whisper into his ear
>”Listen here you sick fuck, I’m going to tug your cock until you cum and you’ll have the honors of sucking one of my teats while I do it. It’s not up to you. Now suck.”
>Pushing a breast toward his face he quickly gets the idea, finding and sucking a tender nipple while your hand glides up and down his shaft with slowly increasing vigor
>Your mind is racked with sensation, the warm body beneath you, your suckled teat sending waves of pleasure to your brain, the rock hard cock in your grip, the occasional moan coming from your prey, his life completely at your mercy
>It’s enough to cause you to lose control and let loose a few lusty moans of your own
>Soon you feel his sucking grow more intense and the subtle bucking of his hips against your thighs, he must be close
>Pointing his shaft towards his belly you feel it spasm as he spills his load
>You lean up, his mouth releasing from your tit with a pop
>Now for your favorite part
>You scoot backwards on your knees a couple feet and lean down, lapping up his cum with your tongue
>His breathing slows and body cools as you greedily eat up his load, just where you want him
>When his belly is clean of the sticky mess you pause for a brief moment as if to give him the hope that you’re done
>But you’re not, they never suspect this next part, a little something to remember you by
>Slowly, quietly, you place your arms down and near his upper back before violently tilting him upward
>Your maw opens and you bite down where his neck meets his shoulders, your tusks nearly breaking the skin
>He struggles, like they all do, but you didn’t expect what he said next
>”Gah! Ms. Boarson! Please!”
>Eyes go wide in shock, your mouth is frozen in place, an overwhelming sense of dread fills your consciousness
>Your prey…knows your name?
>It takes a couple seconds to regain enough composure to cease biting his neck and push yourself backwards onto your ass
>You only hear the sound of the two of you breathing heavily for a few tense moments before he breaks the silence
>”Ms. Boarson is this payback for fucking up the reports? I’m so sorry I…I did my best you have to believe me.”
>”…Michael?” You state in disbelief. “What were you doing out so late? Why didn’t you try to stop me?”
>”By the time I finished redoing the reports it was already nearly seven and I live nearby so I just decided to walk. I could tell it was you by your voice so I didn’t doing anything because, well, I kind of need my job. But also I kind of…”
>He trails off before finishing the sentence, raising your curiosity
>”You kind of what?”
>”I kind of like you. No wait, I don’t kind of like you, I REALLY like you Ms. Boarson.”
>You can’t help but chortle at his schoolboy confession
>”You?! Like me?! Michael, I’m a washed up divorced old hag. There’s nothing to like. Hell every time I get near you in the office I can literally smell the fear coming off of you! Same as everyone else at work, you’re just as scared of as the rest of them are. There’s no need to pretend to like me.”
>”No offense Ms. Boarson but my mother is a Tiger, your tusks and claws don’t scare me one bit. I guess I smell that way because I’m afraid of disappointing you whenever you’re around, to make myself look stupid in front of someone as beautiful as you.”
>You feel your heart skip a beat
>”Beautiful? Michael my tusks are half an inch too long to be fashionable, my eyes are too close together, my fur is a terrible pattern, and my snout isn’t well shaped at all. Just ask any boar and they’ll tell you that I’m a two out of ten, if that!”
>There’s a pregnant pause before he mutters three little words that would light your heart on fire
>”Not to me.”
>”You…really mean it? I’m not just some ugly fat bitch to you?”
>”No.” He responds confidently
>Fear no longer clouding your consciousness that familiar longing between your legs returns with twice the intensity
>”Michael, you wanna finish what we started?”
>”Sure, just no more biting please.”
>You chortle
>”I promise I’ll be gentle.”
>He tries to get up but you push him back down
>”I started tonight, I’ll finish it. As your manager it’s only natural that I take the lead.”
>”Whatever you say Ms. Boarson.”
>Once again you straddle his hips with your own, reaching down to pull your panties aside to allow his cock to enter you
>Once hilted you grip his midsection and begin the familiar up and down, your own grool soon pooling at the base of his crotch as your lust grows more intense
>Just before it seems you’re both about to orgasm he puts a hand on yours, fingers trying to dislodge your handhold
>Curious, you take the hand off his side and his fingers curl around yours, palm to palm
>With this new linking of bodies your orgasm draws closer, and with a lusty gasp your velvety tunnel grips his cock, the sensation pushing him over the edge as well
>Exhausted, both physically and emotionally, you crumple on top of Michael
>The next day
>You power walk through the office with a rarely seen vigor
>Cubicle after cubicle passes your vision until you finally come across the one Michael was assigned to
>You stop in front of it and glare at him, speaking loud enough to make sure everyone in the vicinity heard your next words
>”Michael! Meet me in my office in fifteen minutes. We need to discuss the quality of your recent work. And don’t even think about being late or I’ll have your head on a platter.”
>Only lingering long enough to watch him turn around and swallow the lump in his throat you whip around and begin the trek back to your office
>Fifteen minutes later, right on the dot, Michael enters your office
>You point to the chair in front of your desk
>”Please, have a seat.”
>He dutifully complies and you get up and walk beside him, leaning your rear against the desk
>”Michael, I noticed a formatting error on some of your recent reports.” You hand a paper to him. “Can you tell me what it is?”
>He stares at the paper taking in the bright red lipstick mark you placed on it a couple minutes ago
>“Well Ms. Boarson, it’s going to take a couple hours to correct this all on my own. But I think with your help I can get it done much sooner.” He says, a sly look in his eye
>You chuckle and rub his back
>”It would be my pleasure to assist you.” You snatch the paper out of his hand and bring your faces nose to nose. “But remember, as your manager it’s only natural I take the lead.”

Deathclaws are some of the best, and worst, anthros to encounter in your travels.
On the one hand, the chances are just about zero that they're ever going to take 'no' for an answer. Resist a deathclaw and you're getting raped, period.
On the other hand, they're usually quite pleased with a mate who submits to them willingly, and they really just want to breed - if they're satisfied that you've knocked them up, they'll usually be fine with letting you go. Rumor has it that some more daring travelers have taken to routing through deathclaw territory intentionally, and simply 'paying the toll' in exchange for the deathclaws' presence warding off far more murderous monsters...

>they're usually quite pleased with a mate who submits to them willingly, and they really just want to breed - if they're satisfied that you've knocked them up, they'll usually be fine with letting you go
And what if I don't feel like leaving and want to raise our clutch of deathclawlets together with my big toothy wife? What then?

At first she would likely be extremely disinterested in you, since she'd already gotten what she wanted - deathclaws are not quick to form bonds. At best you'd get passive tolerance and be largely ignored, which could very quickly switch to possibility of imminent death if you irritate her.
If you did manage to hang in there though - staying close to her den but not threateningly close, and yielding completely in her presence at all times - she'd eventually get horny and fuck you again. Make it through three or four repetitions of that, and she'd eventually pick you up and bring you with her when she heads back home one day.
Continue to be completely submissive to her and breeding her whenever she wants, and she would eventually become possessive and view you as part of her pack. At which point, you would no longer be able to leave even if you wanted to, so hope you are fully committed!

Just be aware that your big 'wife' is gonna get even bigger once you pump her full enough. It's canon in Fallout that deathclaw matriarchs are stronger than all but the absolute strongest of males, and deathclaws are already pound-for-pound the deadliest things in the Wastelands. Seed her enough times and her physiology is going to respond.

fun fact about deathclaws.
female deathclaws have sometimes been observed to find human males and give them trinkets such as shiny objects or dead animals in exchange for sex.
sometimes the human male is visited numerous times by the deathclaw before the deathclaw takes the human with her to live in her den

Sending out children onto dangerous expeditions is a bad idea.
But all of our able bodied men have disappeared.

That's why you give them a partner monster to protect them from other monsters.

That was the exact reason why men were sent out in the first place, to capture, domesticate, and train the Pokemon outside for defense and domestic duties, primarily to fend off other wild Pokemon whose attacks have been getting more and more bold every few days.
Now the amount of working men are reduced to a few untrained boys.

A lopunny's kick can shatter a man's sternum and had thighs can crush skulls.
Those legs weren't just made for running and jumping. Outmaneuvering and outrunning has time and time again been proven fruitless and has only made the resulting kicks and stomps more precise and harder.

Giraffes are extremely lewd, and some mares will try to get humans to fuck them when they're in heat. I hear stories of mares cornering people in the barn with their butts, their tails lifted, trying to shove the giant throbbing drippy hoerspussy in their faces. In at least some Latin American countries there used to be a specialized job position in businesses that had a lot of horses, a "yeguero" ("mare specialist") who would, uh, get them off when they were in heat so that they could calm down and go back to pulling wagons. Horses are smart enough that they always recognized him and knew who he was, and could get very affectionate. The mares would also sometimes fight when they saw him coming, the way mares in a herd will sometimes fight over a male when they're in heat. Horses are very lewd. VERY lewd. Goats may be the horniest mammals of all, and they're ungulates too.

>"Hey furball. Shouldn't your ass be at work?" A human in his late 40s picked up the other end.
>"I am at work. Late lunch, monkey." She replied.
>"What's your flea bitten hide want, babe?"
>"Well, Lily and Kuvi are both gonna be sleeping over at a friend's house tonight. Your dumbass wanna go see the new Mad Maxine movie when I get off, FANG?"
>"Theres a new one? Who the fuck's replacing Melanie Gibson this time?"
>"Not a clue. Probably gonna be Scheiße, but I don't particularly wanna see anything else and its an excuse to get outta the house."
>"I could just take my favorite mutt to dinner, skip the movie."
>"Ooh, something fancy?"
>"Fancy? Bitch, yer an animal, I'm gonna take your ass to Golden Corral and then dive for cover like it's '08 all over again."
>"Har har, very funny. Your ass is grass when I get home, fucker... then I'll peel what's left of you off the mattress and we can go to Golden corral together. " She cackled, taking another bite of her burger.
>The aardwolf glanced away from her phone, scanning over the mall food court. Her eyes darted to the entrance, where a sketchy looking rabbit girl in a trench coat was coming through. She looked off, like she was gonna try and shoplift some things under that coat.
>"Sounds like fun, count me in Fleabag." Dylan responded. "Anything else?"
>Asche was interrupted by the rabbit tossing off her trench coat and pulling out a sawed off Maverick 88 20 gauge and firing it into the crowd.
>"WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY..." The rabbit began to shout, pumping the shotgun, but Asche was having none of it.
>The aardwolf hybrid reached for her concealed S&W Model 10 in her shoulder holster, tearing one of the buttons off her shirt as she brought the well worn .38 to bear and put her military training to good use.
>BANG BANG
>She planted 2 +P rounds right in the lagomorph's head, skull fragments and bits of grey matter exiting out the rear and causing her body to drop limp like a sack of potatoes. The panicked crowd was running or hiding under tables, as Fleabag stuffed the .38 back in her shoulder holster.
>"Fleabag? Asche?! Mutt! Are you okay?" FANG shouted into the phone, not that she could hear him over the ringing in her ears or the screaming of the crowd. She grabbed her phone, going to dial emergency services before realizing she was still on call.
>"Dylan, baby, listen I'm fine but I need you to call the police, tell them there was a shooting at the West Orange Pavilion in case I can't get through! I love you... dumbass." She hung up and dialed 911, looking around at the scene for a second shooter or any injured.
>Asche spotted and ran over to an injured young gazelle and her human on the floor by the coffee shop. She kneeled down and reassured the human the Gazelle would be fine, that an ambulance would be here soon and it was only birdshot, she would make it.
>She remembered what she could of her training, putting pressure on the wound and improvising a tourniquet. She didn't leave their side until the paramedics showed up.
>The police had cordoned off and covered the dead rabbit girl with a sheet, one of the burly female German shepherd officers walking up to Asche and adjusting her duty belt.
>"Just saw the camera feed. Where the hell'd you learn how to shoot like that?"
>"Here. Back in '09."
>"Thank you for your serv..."
>"Don't. I didn't do anything worthy of thanks."
>"You did right now. You saved a lot of lives, Miss..."
>"Mrs. Fuchsjäger-Maddock" She said. "And I was just doing my job."
>"Now unless you have any questions, you'll have to excuse me. I need a beer... And to fracture my husband's pelvis."
>"He must be a very lucky human."
>"You have no idea."
>That Night.
>"Hey look furball, you're on the news!" Dylan said, pointing to the TV above their table at the buffet. "What the fuck is a buncel, anyways? It says that the shooter was one."
>"A bunvoluntary celibate. It's like a rabbit that can't get laid or something." Asche replied, tearing a big bite of steak off and swallowing it. She glanced up at the TV. "Man I need to lose some weight."
>"Does that mean you were a Yeencel when we first met?" He laughed.
>"Oh fuck off." She slapped him under the table with her tail, then leaned in and forcefully gave him a kiss. "I don't hate women enough for that. And I wasn't exactly celibate when we met, either."
>"How could you hate women when you're a dyke?"
>"Don't you fucking start with me, we just paid off your last hip replacement."

>anthro GF gifts you some clothes to lounge in
>except the clothes are secretly lewd/fetish wear to her species
>stuff like a red hoodie for wolves, farmer style overalls for sheep/cows/etc, t-shirt with a fortune cookie on it for canines, winking cartoon horse, etc
>but what she didn't expect is for you to wear it out in public with her
>so she's cringing and curling in on herself in embarrassment as other's of her species look at what you're wearing and then at her in judgment
>you make it worse whenever someone complements your clothes by saying your GF got it for you
>extra bonus if you wear when meeting her family so the judgment is even more personal

>Can I at least do something cool like spitting up blood?
>"No, no, the script is veryadda yadda business stuff yadda yadda..."
>I wanna cough up blood
>Your beeg gf grabs the director by the shoulder, and shoots her a mean glance
>"UH YEAH UH SURE ANON NO PROBLEM"
>Cool
>Gf still tries to shield my eyes in the theatre
>I was the fucking actor; I know what's going to happen
>"Anon please don't watch it's scary please don't I don't want you to have nightmares please-"
>Hey look its coming up!
>A scene where she bonks you over the head with a club, then drags you off to god knows where
>You thought the spitting out blood would be a cool feature
>But she swung a bit too hard and knocked you out, she still says sorry every now and then over it
>Still nailed the scene though
>"Anon, close your eyes!"
>She covers your face while you try to look
>And yet you see not the screen, but her own face
>A look of fear, of sadness
>Was the filming really taking this much of a toll on her?
>Hey, honey?
>"Anon?"
>You know, we could always branch out into another type of movie if you want
>How... how about a comedy
>"That.. that sounds nice."
>She still ends up treating me like the ragdoll I am on set
>Just instead of 'sawing me in half', she slaps me with a fish
>At least now she isn't so tired and stressed out at the end of the day
>But my fucking legs are dead with the new energy she spends in bed
>Worth it

>anthro streamer plays horror games
>only gets scared when the protagonist is a human male

oh fuck
this story just broke and state media cant suppress it
I have a feeling we're all going to get mandatory wives again.
Last time this happened in 2012 every human between 14-21 was given two wives and banned for 6 months for traveling without a wife accompanying him.
My cousin works at the government in policy and everyone is losing their shit x100
Guys I'm scared, I don't want another wife.

>Anthrostate is assigning wives
>Anon is assigned a mongoose and a snake
>They're really not paying as much attention as they should be

>Anon dusts the entire apartment while they argue
>He finishes the laundry without being ridden on top of the dryer because they're still being snippy
>Cooks a three course meal unmolested even though he wore their favorite apron
>They're still bitching at each other on the couch after he finishes the dishes
>He's had enough
>He hasn't once been coiled or pinned down in two weeks
>He gets a DVD of the most sappy movie they both like
>It's about some city slicker moving out to the country and not realizing he's marrying an entire pack of raptors
>Gets it playing, the TV finally breaking their droning bitchfest
>Kicks off his sweatpants now that he has their attention
>Pretends not to notice their eyes on him as he stretches out a days worth of housework
>Now that they've shut up he drops down into the space between them
>By the first third of the movie they're cuddle up against hi.
>Halfway through, when pack hijinks land the human love interest in the hospital, Anon's mongoose wife is possessively holding his shoulders while his snake wife has started coiling his legs
>His wives wait until after the touching finale where the raptor pack and human are building their new farmhouse together, after the old one burned down in a toaster accident
>Once the credits roll he's bound up in snake coils and mongoose claws are ripping his underwear off
>There are no complaints or disagreements as he's manhandled into a position where his snake wife can get him in herself, while his vision is filled with his mongoose wife's ass as she sits on his face and grinds his lips against his feminine desert
>They're finally working together as they try to suffocate him while giving the neighbors a new reason to file noise complaints

Green set in Xcom universe
>you recently moved to city 27 located in the southern appalachians of what once was the U.S.
>Originally the city was a large refugee camp for deserting Advent troops
>As such, the city has a large population of aliens compared to humans and was seeking to bolster its human numbers
>this allowed you to find a well paying job working for the largest shipping company in the region
>you started out as a go-between for the different alien species since a few of them didn't get along without the elder's influence
>this didn't last long as you were given a position directly under the head of the company, a viper named Sylvanah
>your duties basically remained the same but now you did it for the higher level managers with some secretary work for Sylvanah
>it was here you began to notice a sinister side of this company
>at first it wasn't much but some orders being sent out with no records of when or where they left to
>then you stumbled upon some open crates filled with weapons on your way to a meeting with the warehouse manager
>things continued like this until while dropping off some paper work at Sylvanah's desk you noticed a two day old group email sent to all of upper management
>said email detailed that one of the companies clients was having an event at a restaurant downtown and suggested that company assets should not be present for it
>the location and time listed in the message lined up exactly with the terrorist attack that occurred the day after it was sent
>you tried your best to remain calm until the end of the work day and you could go home
>having no intention of working for illegal weapons dealers/smugglers you quickly wrote up a letter of resignation with a made up story about a relative in a different city to excuse your abrupt absence
>the next day you waited until Sylvanah left her office and went to leave the note on her desk
>as you turned to leave the door was shoved open by Sylvanah and her two android bodyguards dragging a bruised and beaten muton behind her
>you instinctively ducked behind the desk the moment the door opened, you could hear the viper chastises the broken alien on the floor.
>"With how much money you screwed me out of you should have known I was coming for you." Her voice as calm and cold as ice
>"If you thought hiding three cities away was enough, then I guess it makes sense you thought it would be a good idea to steal from me."
>"But here the thing. Nothing gets anywhere in this continent without me knowing about it."
>she bent down infront of the muton's face. "However, I have one more use for you, a scapegoat."
>The moment she finished her sentence one of her robotic bodyguards grabbed the poor fellow by the neck and wrenched it till sickening cracks filled the room
>she turned away from the grizzly scene and spoke to her phone, "Tell the police chief we have the rogue agent who supplied the explosives for the attack."
>with a wave of her hand the bodyguards removed the corpse from the office leaving you alone with her
>Sylvanah looked to your hiding place and called out, "You can come out now anon."
>her tone was unnervingly pleasant
>you stood and tried to stammer some response but all words had left you
>"come now, isn't there something you wish to discuss? You wouldn't have come in here otherwise."
>again, only uhh and I left your mouth
>"Is that not your resignation letter you've left on my desk? I thought your "cousin" off in city 20 needs you to come immediately to help them with some sickness?"
>some how you stomach managed to sink even further. "W-what? B-but how did you-"
>a simple raise of a hand cut you off. "One does not get to my position without having a few friends. Some of which are employed with the network services providers."
>she began to slowly circle you
>maybe you could reason something out, "look, I promise I won't tell anyone I-"
>"Oh, I'm certain you won't" she cuts you off again
>begging is all you have left, "P-please, don't do this. Just let me leave and I'll forget everything."
>Sylvanah cocked her head, "let you leave? After all the work of trapping you in my coils?"
>your eyes shot down, confirming her statement, her tail snaked all around you
>all she had to do was squeeze and you would be done for
>her voice brought your focus back up, "You seem stressed, how about you sit down and I'll get you a drink."
>her hand gestures to a couch pushed against the wall of the office
>you look back to her for a moment before cautiously stepping over her rather large tail and taking a seat
>Sylvanah deftly opens a cupboard underneath her desk and retrieves two glasses with ice in them and a bottle of some amber liquor
>she poors the two glasses, but opens a drawer and takes a small pill bottle from it
>you watch as she drops a capsule into one of the drinks and stirs it with her finger until it is all dissolved
>she slithers back over and takes the seat next to you and offers you the same glass
>you feel your heart pound away in your chest so hard Sylvanah can probably hear it
>Thoughts flood through your head; running, fighting, begging.
>her cold voice freezes the tide solid, "you can either wake up unharmed, or sore and bruised. But you will drink this."
>a bit of gallows humor helps you settle into your fate, "how many kidneys will I have left when I wake up?"
>her head once again tilts, "I'm not selling any part of you. I'm keeping you all to myself, now DRINK."
>she pushes the glass into your hands and instinctively you try to resist but futility overwhelms you and you take the drink from her
>at first there is only the burn of the alcohol, but soon a warmth spreads throughout your body
>as the room begins to spin, Sylvanah takes your head in her hands and gently pulls you to her lap where the drug plunges you into darkness
>the first thing anon felt was the throbbing pain in his head
>this was soon followed by the most intense sensation of pins and needles in his arms and legs
>thankfully both these unpleasantries seemed to fade quite rapidly
>with the head ache almost nonexistent and his limbs feeling less like lead pin cushions, anon attempted to open his eyes
>all his vision was met with was blackness
>a brief moments passed in which anon pondered his current circumstances before his recollection struck him like a charging berserker
>adrenaline once again dumped through his veins and he began to struggle to gain his bearings
>through his thrashing he learned several things
>he was laying on a bed of some kind
>his hands were tied together above his head
>his legs were bound shoulder width apart
>finally a bag was over his head and a smooth piece of cloth tightly held his mouth shut
>what felt like an eternity passed before a faint noise came to anon's ears
>it sounded like someone was gently sliding a piece of paper across the floor
>curiosity turned into terror as the sound grew louder and just as it ceases a familiar voice filled his ears
>"mmm, looks like the counter serum did its job quite nicely. How are you feeling my dear anon?"
>a muffled "Hmmf" was all the response he could produced
>"Let me get this off your head" the viper said as the bag was pulled from anon's face
>the light stung the man's eyes for a brief moment as his vision adjusted
>his reacquired sight confirmed what he already knew, he was mostly naked barring a towel draped over his groin
>Sylvanah, on the other hand, had no such covering
>she loomed over you, her chest and nethers in full view
>"There we go. Now then, welcome to my home. I would show you around, but you seem quite cozy where your at."
>anon remained silent, a look of fear etched on his face
>Sylvanah held his gaze for a moment bearing a look of smug satisfaction before breathing a sigh
>"I suppose I owe you some explanation after all I have and am about to put you through."
>"You are the last thing I need in order to fully reclaim my life as my own."
>she face away from the man tied to her bed and stared at nothing in particular
>"Before the war when I was just another drone under Advent's control, I was a cultural surveyor."
>the viper rubbed the palm of her hand, "Mostly I just watched human media and censored things that may have anti Advent sentiments.
>It was simple and far more safe than being on patrol, but seeing every day life for you humans had an effect on me.
>It started out as a passing thought here or there. Thoughts of how pleasant what I had just seen was.
>soon it turn into a constant, but small desire for a 'normal' life."
>Sylvanah turned to anon with a look of seriousness
>"However, a day of clarity would soon come.
>Back then I had the same sentiment as every other Advent soldier. That Advent provides.
>That I had everything I needed as long as I was loyal to the elders. But one day that changed.
>The day Xcom destroyed the psyonic network tower, my control chip was disconnected from the influence of the elders.
>That day I realized I had nothing and that Advent, the elders, had stole it all from me.
>So, I deserted, but not before gathering data on multiple Advent supply caches.
>I left with other deserters and helped established the refugee camp that became this city.
>And piece by piece I retook possession of my life.
>Which brings me to you." Much of her tail shifted onto the bed and her hand found your chest
>"From you humans I learned of monogamy, devoting ones life to another in a mutual loving relationship.
>A beautiful sentiment that drew much of my desire, however. The elders had one last cruel truth to reveal.
>My species forms harems around a single male and takes up colony like behavior.
>Furthermore, it appears there are no male vipers left on this world, I suspect to keep us enslaved to the elders cloning systems."
>at this Sylvanah shifts herself fully onto the bed, mounting anon in the process.
>"I will NOT give myself and everything I have gained over to some uncaring male and his colony of whores, after all the work I put in to claim it."
>her grip on anon tightens and her tail begins coiling his legs
>"Instead I will claim a male of my own, and he will be mine alone.
>Anon, I have chosen you. Whether you accept it or not. You. Are. MINE."
>POV: anon
>the tip of her tail tugged away the towel covering your shame
>aside from being fully erect you were also completely shaven, no doubt done while you were under
>a cold drop on your skin brings your attention to her pelvic region, seeing she is already dripping with desire
>a scaled hand grips your face and forces your gaze to the snake above you
>the hand lingers for a moment before trailing down your body and taking a hold of you
>your focus leaves Sylvanah for just a second before she hisses out, "Look at me..."
>her predatory eyes bore into yours as she lines up her prey and takes it all in one strike
>your eyes roll and you groan into your cloth muzzle as her scales meets your flesh
>you open your eyes to see hers had not left your face, though you thought you heard a slow low hiss as she took you
>she remained still for a moment before beginning a slow sensual rhythm
>Sylvanah kept this rhythm for a minute or so till you felt her begin to speed up
>her focus did not leave you as she sped up her pace
>only once the meeting of your sexes had become like clapping wet hands did her composure finally break
>she pulled your head between her breast-like glands and whispered, "So close... give it to me... inside"
>you were barely holding yourself back and this plus her rampant pace pushed you over the edge
>suddenly her coils tighten and pin you inside as you paint her convulsing walls white
>each time her needy sex squeezes you her tail follows suite
>Sylvanah silently held you there for some time, her coils constricting you and your member firmly in place
>any movment you made was met with a tightening of her coil
>eventually her death grip on you relaxed, but she began grinding her hips into yours
>the renewed stimulation did not go unnoticed by your lower brain, it becoming more and more eager again
>feeling the appendage growing inside her the viper let out a low drawn out hiss
>"I can feel your desire increasing within me. Already wanting round two?"
>All you could do was groan into the muzzle for your defence
>she took you twice more before finally unwinding you from her tail
>the two of you laid beside each other, lungs heaving, bodies covered in sweat, and groins slick with sexual fluid
>your stomach broke the relative quiet
>Sylvanah looked to you and responded, "I do suppose it has been awhile since you've eaten."
>she casually rolled herself off the bed and began undoing the restraints on your feet
>once your legs were free she then freed your hands from the bed, but not from each other
>"come on now. The dining room is this way" she began leading you through the door way
>as you followed, you couldn't help peeking down towards her neathers. Noting it was still leaking your combined fluids
>entering the dining room, you were met with a mouth watering aroma of roast beef
>sure enough, at the table were two full plates of beef, diced potatos and carrots, sides of green beans, and two tall glasses of ice water
>after the both of you sit down Sylvanah turns to you, "Give me your hands."
>you offer them to her and with a soft beep the bindings fall from your wrists
>instinctively you move to remove the cloth from your mouth but the viper stops you
>"NO. Only I will remove your restraints, just as I am the only one who will place them on you"
>her claws graze your neck as she reaches behind your head
>"Do not mistake this for permission to speak, I will not let my male starve. Do not say a word unless I say you may."
>with that the cloth lowered from your lips and was quickly replaced with Sylvanah's
>the kiss lasted not longer then 10 seconds, but you could feel her passion every moment of it
>after the kiss ended the both of you ate in silence, the meal tasting as good as it smelled
>with your stomachs satiated Sylvanah asked for your hands again, to which you reluctantly complied
>with your hands and mouth once again bound she lead you to a luxurious bathroom
>you were allow some privacy to relieve your self, but after which the viper brought you to a large walk in shower
>once again your hands are restrained above your head and Sylvanah turns the water on
>the initial cold chills you to the bone, but the water quickly warms up
>Sylvanah washed your body as she washed her own, taking turns with each section
>when the washing and drying was over the viper led you back through the mansion
>she brought you to a rather small room with a door leading outside and your clothes neatly piled on a bench
>Sylvanah placed a hand on your shoulder, turning you to face her
>"When I first began amassing my fortune I reveled in my new found wealth.
>However, doing so taught me a harsh lesson.
>Over indulgence in something you enjoy will lead to it becoming mundane.
>Which is why I'm letting you go home. Outside my personal driver is waiting to take you back to your apartment.
>I expect to see you back at work on Monday and throughout the week"
>she leans in close and grabs your wrist pulling you to her
>"The weekends however, we will spend here. Indulging in each other."
>she releases your wrists, but takes hold of your ring finger
>"This is a token to remind you of who you belong to. Remove it at your own peril."
>Sylvanah produces a black ring with a singular golden line etched along its center
>her steely gaze captures yours, "You. Are. MINE"

>genetically altered rats living in your walls
>concoct a serum or make a shrink ray to use on you
>get shrunk down to mouse size so the rats get to be bigger than you
>get mercilessly fucked by rat females
>one gets the bright idea to reverse the shrink ray or alter to serum to grow instead
>you're back to normal height
>and now the rats are giant rats still bigger than you

Hyenas are alarmingly conformist, always trying to follow the lead of their matriarch. It makes the "punk" stereotype all the more ironic. Well, until you see an actual "punk" scene. At least where I'm from they really are all clones.

>Incredibly common tactic for desperate yeens to offer thirsty newcomers a "free drink" that's laced with roofies

>They're all on edge, but keeping there distance
>What the heck is going on?
>"WE CAN HELP YOU, JUST WALK TOWARDS US"
>Her voice has a bit of pain at the end

>First he seemed like he'd be the completely shy, nervy type needing to be coaxed out of his shell
>but he surprised you with his confidence and engagedness
>turns out he was just lacking in trust

>The thrill he gets from giving himself to you, wholly and completely

>You look over and see the neighbour's kid
>Now he was an actual shy one, always mumbling, always stammering his words

>his face is flushed
>he's trembling
>you're not sure how old he is, could be 6, could be 10

>wait is that a red flag?

>catch some talking about going extra natural and jumping the defenseless humie and mating him like wild animals in heat out in wilds
>can't run from them since that would just trigger chase instincts and they have the advantage in the forest

>How had it gotten to this point?
>You had "joined" the band as a roadie barely more than a month ago.
>Minn had promised you that it would be strictly professional gig, that just being seen helping them setup their shows would be enough to help sell the image.
>Now there she was, holding Mutt's phone for her, while Mutt put on an expression of faux confidence for the camera.
>It's artificial shutter sound snapping away as Minn feverishly took photos from slightly different angles.
>Dozens of images of you, half naked, sprawled out in an unmade bed, the dog spooning you wearing little more than a pair of panties and one of her own band shirts.
>Your face burned as you listened to the false clicking coming from the speaker, but you couldn't disappoint your friends, could you?
>They had put so much work into this band thing, was it really such a big deal to let them take pictures of you to boost their image?
>Besides, the attention was sort of flattering in a way, and they had promised to blur your face, right?
"Okay, there should be a few good ones in there. Alright Cam, you're up."
>Mutt reluctantly pulled away from you and swung her legs off the far side of the bed as the eyes belonging to the feline standing behind Minn lit up.
>Taking her own cellphone out of her jeans pocket, Cam handed it to Minn before reaching down to take off her shirt.
>She wasn't a particularly thin feline, but her slight pudge was much cuter than you allowed yourself to let on.

>After taking your shoes off you step quietly through the house towards the bedroom
>She no doubt heard you with her excellent hearing, but it wasn't your wife that you were worried about waking
>You slink over to the door and ever so gently turn the knob, just barely cracking it open to peek inside
>Though the light is dim it's still possible to make out your grizzly wife laying on the bed
>She's on her side facing away from you, her dark fur contrasting against the loose pile of white sheets and blankets she laid on
>Nesting instincts, she said
>You were more than happy to provide whatever she needed
>With her slow heavy breaths you can tell she's asleep, or at least very close to it
>You creak the door open further and you see her left ear twitch, the one that was nearly sliced off entirely in a fight with a lioness some years ago
>If she heard you with that one her other ear was detecting you loud and clear
>As gently as you can you step inside and close the door, careful not to let the doorknob close too loudly
>A rumbling comes from the bed, like a very low growl
>Unconcerned, you slowly creep forward as the sound grows louder
>"ggggrrrrr" she bellows from deep within her chest
>Step after step you get closer to the furry mass on your bed, her deep growling growing more intense with every one of your movements
>After reaching the mattress you put a knee up on it and she turns her head to you, teeth bared and saliva dripping
>She growls once more, more loudly and with more vigor than the previous
>A sane man would run away at such a reaction from a half ton bear anthro, but you knew better
>Her teeth still bared you move your head closer to her snout, the smell of her strong womanly scent growing more intense as you edge closer
>Still growling, she gnashes her teeth together in a threatening display of ursine might
>But still, you know better
>Once you're nose to nose she takes a few deep sniffs then lays her head back onto the pillow as if she wasn't just about to tear you limb from limb
>She knows who you are, but even that fact doesn't stop her deeply ingrained primordial instincts from causing her to react harshly to anything that wasn't her or one of her cubs
>You were neither
>"Hey honey. Back from the store?" She sleepily mumbles
>"Ya, traffic was bad on the way back."
>You move a hand across the matted fur on her back, you were going to have to brush her soon
>She just didn't have the energy to groom herself with it being so far into the winter
>You raise your head to look at her face
>The same deep scars across her muzzle, same chocolate brown fur, same milky white left eye
>She turns her head to look at you with her right
>"Need something?"
>"No, just wondering how the cubs are doing."
>She lays her head back down and lazily licks her lips
>"Thirsty."
>You look down to her belly
>Three baby cubs silently suckling on her breasts
>And a swollen belly with the next two on the way
>"Want some water?"
>She mumbles an affirmative
>But just when you're about to move off the bed she stops you with a paw on the wrist
>"Some chocolate too." She says with a guilty smile
>You just smile, and hope that you remembered to get more sweets on your trip to the store earlier today
>With a bottle of water in one hand and chocolate bar in the other you make your way back to the dimly lit bedroom
>She downs the water with a few gulps and makes quick work of the candy bar
>"Thanks honey, I needed that. Feeding these cubs has me so worn out I sometimes forget to feed myself."
>"You'll perk up when the weather gets warmer, always do."
>"Can't wait, not to imply I don't like resting in my little artificial cave here. I could get used to spending all day cuddling the cubs and getting free room service."
>"Well someone has to pay the bills around here. And now that I'm back from the store don't you think I should get some time with the cubs too?"
>"I need to use the restroom anyway, go ahead and look after the cubs while I'm gone. Oh and be careful around Kimmy, she's been a little bitey lately."
>"Don't worry, I think I can take a couple nibbles from a two year old grizzly cub without needing a hospital visit."
>After tenderly removing each little ball of fur from her breasts she gets off the bed and stumbles towards the bathroom
>Thankfully there was one attached to the master bedroom so it's a short walk, a little detail you and her made sure your new house had in anticipation of her winter sluggishness
>She shuts the door and you turn your attention to the little fluff balls already trying to escape the bed in search of their mother
>The most motivated one is, unsurprisingly, Kimmy
>A little troublemaker of a cub, always getting into places she wasn't supposed to and finding new and creative ways to push the limits of your wife's patience
>Then there was Daisy and Delilah, the two inseparable sisters
>Thankfully they didn't share in Kimmy's rebelliousness being more even tempered and less prone to wandering
>For now, anyway
>Laying on the center of the bed you feel your wife's residual warmth still on the sheets
>Quickly grabbing Kimmy who was already dangerously close to crawling off the bed you plop her down beside you
>She's quickly joined by her two sisters
>Daisy and Delilah seem content to rest next to your belly, their muzzles digging into the space between your body and the mattress
>It appears they've deemed you an adequate substitute for their mama bear, lacking in fur but retaining her warmth
>Kimmy however is driven to escape from your clutches, constantly being repositioned next to her sisters only crawl to the edge of the bed then put right back where she started by your gentle hands
>She's done this at least ten times now, but finally she seems tired enough to stop her fruitless march
>You gently rub the backs of Kimmy and Delilah, their fur pleasantly fuzzy and warm
>Children secured, you lay your head back down and-
>"Ow!"
>A sharp pain on your left hand
>Kimmy has taken your palm into her mouth and is biting down as hard as she can, her teeth are surprisingly sharp for such a young bear
>"I told you she was bitey today!" Comes a voice muffled from behind the bathroom door
>"Ya don’t say!"
>Taking your other hand you tenderly pry your palm free from her mouth
>The second it leaves her jaws her eyes roll over and she falls to the bed, utterly spent
>Good, she can't terrorize your hand anymore if she's asleep
>The bathroom door opens and out steps your wife in all her naked furry glory
>Walking to the bed she lays down facing you, the sleepy pile of cubs now flanked by their parents
>”I think these next two are gonna look like you, all pink and furless.” She says with a hand on her pregnant belly
>”And what makes you say that?”
>”I can tell, call it a mothers intuition.”
>”You think that, maybe, I don’t know, we should separate the cubs from the babies after they’re born? Our cubs will still be teething by then and baby humans don’t quite have the same thick skin and coat of fur to protect them from play bites that cubs do.”
>”I don’t think so, under my watchful eye they should-“
>*DING DONG*
>”Damnit.” You hiss under your breath
>”What? You know who’s at the door?”
>”I forgot to tell you, my parents said they were going to visit today.”
>”Seriously? I thought they refused to come around considering they, you know.”
>”Don’t approve of their only child marrying an anthro?
>”Yes, exactly that. I seem to recall quite a few mean glares and hushed words aimed at me last time they visited. What’s the reason for them coming over? I’m absolutely dying to know why they would even want to be in the same house as me.”
>”They said they wanted to see their grandkids. They still don’t approve of us but I guess they feel honor bound to see the newest generation of the family.”
>”Well if they were expecting grandchildren that aren’t covered in fur they’re a few months too early for that.”
>”Right. I’ll tell them to come back later, frankly I’m not in the mood to talk to them either.”
>”Thanks honey. And if they insist on coming into the house make damn sure they don’t enter our bedroom. I still growl at you every time you visit me and you’re my goddamned husband. If someone with a foreign scent or voice came in I might go further than growling and gnashing my teeth together.”
>”Don’t worry, I’ll watch them the whole time they’re here.”
>*DING DONG DING DONG*
>She begins moving the cubs closer to her chest
>”If they ring that damn doorbell any more they’ll wake the cubs.”
>”I’ll deal with them.”
>Moving off the bed you make your way to the front door, the blurred images of your parents visible through the glass
>The door opens and there’s a few moments of uneasy silence as they stare at you
>Both of them are stone faced, if they feel joy or disgust at seeing you they were doing a good job of suppressing it
>”Hello son.” Says your father, a faint smile now visible on his face
>”Hey dad, hey mom.” You state flatly
>Your mother speaks next
>”We’re here to see our grandchild. I’m sure you saw our message earlier?”
>”Yes, I did. And it’s grandchildren. She had a litter.”
>A few moments of awkward silence
>”Well how many exactly? Enough to crew a battleship?!” Your father says with a guffaw of laughter
>He seems to be in a much better mood than the last time they came over, your mother not so much
>”Just three. All cubs.”
>Your mother visibly recoils at those last two words, her face now a barely concealed mix of disappointment and disgust
>”Well aren’t you going to let us in? We drove all this way to see them. I don’t know about your mother here but I just can’t wait.” Says your father
>”I don’t think that’s a great idea, the cubs are with her right now and she’s still very tired. Hibernation instincts, you already know that.”
>He puts a pleading hand out
>”Now we don’t mean to intrude on your wife’s natural, uhh, yearly sleeping habit but we just wanted to see your kids for the first time. Just hold them a bit, welcome them into the family.”
>They’re already part of a family
>”They’re sleeping right now. It would be better if you all just came back in the spring so you could see us all together.”
>”Please now son, me and your mother have been absolutely dying to see your cute little kiddos on the whole drive down here. And…” He gives an exaggerated cough into his elbow. “…we’re getting up there in years you know.”
>You look to your father’s hopeful face, then to your mother’s barely hidden scowl, then back to your father
>”Okay, you can come in. I’ll go talk to her and see if she’s willing to part with one of the cubs for a while.”
>”Excellent! We’ll wait on the couch.” Your father says with a wide smile
>You close the door behind them and lead your parents to the living room before making your way back to the bedroom
>Her familiar low growl stops when you put a hand on her side
>”Babe?”
>”I already know you let them inside, I can hear them talking from all the way over here. What do they want?” She whispers
>”They, well dad mostly, wants to hold one of the cubs.”
>She tightens the grip on the cubs she held close to her chest
>”No. My cubs. Not theirs. They stay with me.”
>Her tone of voice is firm, so you lean in close and rub her head
>”Our cubs. Their grandchildren.”
>She growls again before turning to look at you with her good eye
>She holds a paw up, fingers outstretched
>”Five minutes. One second longer and I’m rushing in there teeth bared and claws out. I’m not joking.”
>You smile and give her a kiss on the nose, she always liked it when you did that
>”Thanks honey, they’re going to love this. Which one are you willing to part with?”
>She stares at the undulating mass of brown fuzz piled by her chest for a few moments before reaching out and lifting one into the air
>”Here, take Daisy.”
>You take Daisy from your wife’s paws, resting her short muzzle on your shoulder
>”This really means a lot to them honey. You’ll have your cub back soon.”
>”Five minutes. No more!” She says with a low growl
>”Got it, thanks mama bear.”
>As quietly as you can you shut the door and walk over to the living room, standing in front of your parents
>”Mom, dad, this is Daisy. She’s a two year old Grizzly bear anthro just like both her sisters. She’s still pretty sleepy right now but be aware she’s at that age where she likes to test her new teeth out, so watch your fingers. Who wants to hold her first?”
>Your parents stare at each other as if expecting the other to say something
>Eventually your father breaks the staring contest and puts his arms out towards you
>”Give her here son, I won’t drop her.”
>Slowly, gently, you pry the cub off your shoulder and set her down into your fathers waiting hands
>Hands under Daisy’s armpits he holds the cub in front of him, a perplexed look on his face
>”Wow, she’s really, uhh, fluffy.”
>”She takes after her mother.”
>He sits her down in his lap, absentmindedly running fingers across Daisy’s head
>”She’s got the cutest little rounded ears, just like a feral bear.”
>”Careful not to play with them too much, they tend to get riled up if you do that.”
>”Oh, my bad.”
>He turns his attention from her head to her belly
>A few circles rubbed onto her belly and the baby bear is having a laughing fit prompting smiles from both of your parents
>When it ends he turns to your mother
>”You want to hold her next?”
>She looks pensively at the cub before giving in
>”Oh alright, hand the little darling over.”
>He lifts her up and she receives the cub, holding Daisy in the air
>”Awwww, I have to admit I didn’t think your kids would be so cute considering their mother’s heritage.”
>You try to take the backhanded compliment with grace
>”Thanks mom. Her mother makes sure she’s groomed and fed every day. In a few years her adult coat will come in and she’ll be even furrier.”
>”That’s wonderful but if you don’t mind me asking, why exactly can’t we just go meet her mother and the other cubs again?”
>”She, uhh,” You stare at the ground while trying to word your answer. “well, bear anthros, like so many other species of anthros, have certain deeply ingrained instincts. One of these is to protect her cubs from danger. In her mind danger includes basically anything that isn’t her or one of her cubs. Therefore she might have a, uhhh, negative reaction if someone unfamiliar goes in there and disturbs them.”
>”A shame. If she were a human…” Your mother trails off as her attention turns elsewhere
>She brings the cub closer to her face, staring intensely into her eyes
>”You know, I think that this cub has your- OW!”
>In a split second the cub’s head shoots forward and her jaws clamp shut on your mother’s nose
>Frightened by your mother’s loud outburst Daisy immediately exits the bite and begins crying
>She’s quickly handed off to your father who then hands the cub to you
>”Oh my god! She bit me! My own grandchild bit me! Those sharp little fangs took my nose right off didn’t they!? Oh!”
>She brings a hand to a nose that’s still very well attached to her face, though it does have a few new red marks
>Your father stands up and helps your mother to her feet
>”Well son, it was fun finally meeting one of our grandchildren today but I think it’s about time we head out.” He pats your mother on the back. “Don’t worry dear we have bandaids in the car.”
>While hoisting the cub back up you give them a quick wave and they’re out the door
>Daisy’s stopped crying but that just means you can hear the heavy footsteps coming from the bedroom now
>They reach the living room and you see an angry wall of matted fur cradling two cubs
>She’s got an angry look on her face and a desperate glint in her eye as she searches for the bear in distress
>Spotting you she moves closer and adjusts the two cubs being carried to hold them with one arm
>As she reaches out with the other you surrender Daisy to her waiting paw
>She sniffs Daisy a few times, licks her head, then turns to you
>”What happened?” She snaps
>”Daisy bit my mom on the nose and she got scared. I assure you everything is fine, the cub was never in any danger.
>She silently glares at you before her expression softens
>”Good, but I didn’t hand you Daisy, I handed you Kimmy.”
>”Hey! You told me-“
>”Kimmy. Daisy has been with me the entire time in the bedroom. I knew Daisy and Delilah would get fussy if they were separated so I gave you the adventurous one.”
>”I could have sworn-whatever. You’ve been pretty active today for a bear that’s supposed to be in hibernation, wanna head to bed?”
>”Sure, going to be a while until my adrenaline wears off though. The second I heard my baby bear cry my heartrate shot through the roof. I guess that just means I have more time to groom Kimmy and get the scent of your parents off of her.”
>She gives Kimmy a few licks on the head
>”Okay, I’ll get a brush so I can help with the grooming”
>She cocks her head to the side, a sly grin on her face
>”What? Still afraid you’re going to swallow a furball if you groom them like I do?”
>She licks Daisy on the muzzle to emphasize her point
>”Hey now, I never said the brush was for grooming the kids little miss bed head.”
>She gives a surprised grunt as if offended, then briefly flashes you a smile before turning around and walking towards the bedroom, three cubs safe in their mothers arms

>try to board plane
>forecefully kept at bay
>a sudden sharp pain
>you look down and see the tranq dart
>blissful unconsciousness takes you
>you awaken in the warm embrace of your new lizard wife
>her den is quiet, the whole place smells distinctly of her
>you feel something in your ear
>you reach up and feel a small, plastic thing piercing it
>it's a tracking tag.
>your misgivings melt away as your new wife snuggles into you more comfortably, and you drift off back to sleep

>Anon goes to highschool with small and kinda chubby waifur (predator/carnvivore)

>Summer holidays come around
>+ school rennovation got elongated, so everyone was getting online schooled for another 2 months
>its octobre, finally the highschool is open again
>Waifur hit a growth spurt
>a massive one
>she started working out at the same time
>now towering above most if not all other students and teachers
>including anon
>bullying stops immediatly
>still has a crush on Anon

>Be human
>Chilling out in a park, watching the ducks or something
>All of a sudden a little fox woman runs up and starts tugging your arm
>"Oh my god I found another one! Come with me so I can put you with the others."
>She's not very strong, but having nothing else to do you let her lead you into an unmarked van
>After some driving she opens the door and you step out into a fenced backyard
>Scattered around the yard are a couple dozen other humans, some old, some young, a random mix
>"Okay everyone!' The fox shouts. "Come get dinner my free little humies."
>She begins tearing off pieces of a loaf of french bread and throwing them into the crowd
>A piece lands next you, it tastes pretty good
>When the last piece if thrown she puts her arms on her hips, a satisfied look on her face
>You couldn't stay here forever, but hey, free food!

ANTHROS DOMINATING HUMANS
If you had to choose one, which way would you prefer the anthro to dominate?
a.) Physically, wherein the anthro overpowers you by her size
b.) Mentally, wherein the anthro mindfucks you
c.) Just a normal anthro, except she violently abuses you

>lewd animal crossing
>visit other islands
>your debts get taken advantaged of by villagers offering some money
>just have to wear lewd outfits of their choosing and take some pics/vids with them
>go back to your own island where they implemented an island law that makes you free use wherever and whenever
>nook making bank selling remote island houses/towns that come with their own humie boytoy to horny anthro women

>you're someone who is smart and have ability from it
>like a space engineer, wizard, noble merchant, etc
>and you work with a some brute savage of an anthro
>simple minded and all her solutions to problems usually involve violence or really simple answers that she assures are right regardless of how right they actually are
>her moods can be summed up as wanting to eat, wanting fight, and wanting to fuck
>and worse of all is you're smitten with her and her stupid little gestures of affection
>also how she scrambles your mind when she aggressively fucks you

imagine a caring anthro who wants to give you a claiming bite
>hey anon I think It's time I give you a claiming bite
>I don't want to hurt you. but if we're serious about our relationship I feel as if I should do this
>I know you don't like it, but it would mean a lot to me.
>don't worry hun, I promise it'll only hurt for a moment

How scary it is really depends on the species since something like a aardwolf claiming bite is very different from say a tiger.
>gator/crocs are more like a full torso marking given their snout/mouth length
>gotta make sure if you do it with snake you already built up an immunity to her venom
>granted you may not need a claiming bite from a snake with her scale markings/bruises she leaves on you from coiling all the time
>hyenas gotta be extra careful with their bone crushing jaws
>etc

>Unbreakable kind anon takes away the knife
>He was surprisingly swift, she didn't have the time to object
>Has he finally snapped and is trying to get revenge?
>He places the knife back in her hand, it's rotated so the dull side faces her mouth.
>"Now you can lick it without cutting yourself honey"

I’ve had this idea for a story brewing for a while now. Set in a world where for whatever reason, humans and anthros have been put into an uneasy coexistence. Likely through some phyrric victory over earth. And through circumstances outside of her control, an anthro in put in charge of some company on earth, And as part of some outreach program, she must hire a human. That human ends up being a very, very down on his luck Anon.
The thing is, the anthro fucking HATES humans and is into some shady supremacist groups that want to genocide humans.
Now at first she causes Anon’s already shitty life to become living hell by fucking up everything he does, however Anon must stay with the company because he needs to pay large sums of money for something. Been thinking about it being something like child support for a manipulative ex-gf.
Through his devotion to his work despite the hell put on him, the anthro turns from wanting to kill humans to wanting to use them as a work force. Realizing she can continue to exploit him, she gives him harder and harder tasks.
Eventually after seeing his condition deteriorating each day and his determination waning, she starts to have twinges of empathy for him despite her beliefs.
It all comes to a head one day where some event happens that shocks her. Something like an attempted suicide she happens to catch or other dangerous event. She ends up saving Anon, has an internal war with herself, and decides that anthros should indeed be above humans, but not as conquerors and slavers, and rather as protectors and lovers.
From there they do the lovey dovey and improve the company and other stuff but I haven’t thought ahead enough.

>get mating pressed and cum your fucking brains out

What kind of traps would anthros or hps officers lay out to lure humans into their paws?

>The classic hundred dollar bill on a string
>If it's winter they can "accidentally" rip a hole in a humie's coat then insist they go to a clothing store to buy them a new coat to protect their poor furless bodies, you don't want to know what happens in those dressing rooms
>If the anthro is a cat or dog they can go into a dark alley and mewl/bark pitifully, anticipating an unsuspecting humie searching for the nonexistent stray kitten/puppy
>HPS officers can claim a human has the scent of a known criminal on them so they have a reason to detain them indefinitely, only after several "interrogation" sessions is the human allowed to go free

>be resistance fighter against the anthrostate
>your camp was raided and you were taken prisoner
>currently tied to a chair in a small room
>you think
>there’s a bag over your head
>hear a metal door being dragged open and closed shortly after
>then the bag is ripped off your head
>glancing up there’s a cat anthro staring at you
>she sits in the chair on the opposite side of the metal table in front of you
>she’s holding a clipboard
>then starts reading you all the crimes you’ve committed against the state
>after a few minutes she’s done
“Such a shame, a young man like you caught up in a thing like this”
>you don’t dignify her with a response
“Ordinarily you’d be executed for all this but since your young and a human we’ve got something else in mind”
>she gets up and puts the bag back over your head before, metal door is opened again before you, still tied to the chair are dragged off somewhere
>god knows how long later you stop moving
>again the bag is removed and your untied from the chair
>your standing in front of a hole in the floor
>you try to look in it but it’s too dark to see anything
>you hear the cat start talking behind you
“For your crimes against the state we hereby sentence you to the copulation pit, may you father many a litter”
>someone kicks your knee out from behind and you fall into the hole

>the monster had stripped you naked and forced you into her bed
>though at this point you weren't capable of much resistance
>she'd broken you, destroyed what was left of your heroic resolve
>you'd surrendered to her
>and now she was going to take her prize and consummate your unholy union
>her sweaty, monstrous form clambered onto your prone form, her fat tongue licking your neck, her hot, steamy breath washing over you
>you should be disgusted
>but your body betrays you, shivering in anticipation for the profane pleasures to come
>she laughs, gloating over your defeat
>"try not to look so downhearted, hero. We haven't even got to the fun part yet."
>you squrim in her iron grip as she positions herself to force you inside of her
>her fat, hairy cunt drools all over your crotch, coating you in her juices

>for a moment, her grip on you softens
>she rubs her snout against your neck
>"Always."
>you let out a shuddering sigh
>okay then
>you're hers
>the second the words leave your mouth she drops onto you with a horrid squeal
>and forcefully ruts with you for the next 12 hours without stopping

>at some point a bunch of men and older boys disappear
>the only connection is a bright flash at some point happens before they disappear
>they don't know how or even remember, but they all wake up in a strange new area
>some in forests, some in ancient ruins, some in old abandoned city/towns areas, grasslands, swamps, chains of islands within swimming range, etc
>but it turns out they're all in the same place
>it's another planet
>and the planet seems to be infested with strange animal-like humanoids with some being more alien looking while others resembling earth species
>and they're all appear to be female
>and all are aggressively horny the boys/men find out quickly
>these beast women don't communicate back to them and only want to rape
>so all the guys in various locations need to scramble for safety
>and the strange thing is there seems to be random crates they come across full of various items of ranging from useless to highly useful
>some of the crates appear old while others can be seen being dropped off by some strange drones
>also strange events seem to happen at random
>like unique beast women being dropped off in cages by the drones, a sudden severe weather change, the guys just pass out and wake up in completely new random areas, etc
>but what they don't know is there are high tech cameras all over and cloaked camera drones following them everywhere
>turns out they're on an artificial planet/station that's the set of an alien TV/internet show where bets are placed on human males lasting the longest un raped, reaching a specific area, and such
>and all the strange events are watchers voting for loot drops, random modifiers, and bonus challenges

>she's 3 times his size...
>makes teasing little comments prodding at the question of nephews and nieces
>tells towering new sister in law that her muscles are such an inspiration
>wants to be more like her
>somehow attaches herself to the anthro's jogging group
>group is comprised of fellow self-declared human woman hating adhg anthros
>the atmosphere is practically icy
>she snaps a selfie with the whole group in shot
>they're all looking tense, pissed off, or vaguely confused and shameful, glaring into the camera as if daring the viewer to comment
>but the human sister is radiating cheer and non concern
>'Selfie with my new anthro gal pals! <3333'
>she's the happiest she's ever been
>...
>the group can't bring themselves to kick her out
>becomes permanent, if odd inclusion

Your waifur insists that you live inside one of those inflatable human hamster balls for your own protection. What do you do?

>"No Anon, we're not talking about this any further, this is only for your own good."

>always wishes you well
>one night you thought you heard some pushing and cursing from outside your door
>followed by some shuffling
>must be moving something into her room

>weird
>the next day you come home to a repairman working on your door
>well finally, at least that little hiccup is fixed
>only...
>he didn't fix it
>now there's two peepholes in the door, positioned so two people can peer through side by side
>weird...

>on earth you've got the creepy, closeted weirdo cults who gather in secret and wear cringey robes to worship and chant for unspeakable horrors from beyond
>meanwhile, in hell
>secretive little groupings of muscular demon anthros
>they gather to chant their own spells and commit weird rituals
>rituals for the purpose of spying on their crushes in the human world

>When the braingasm hits it's unlike anything you've ever experienced.
>Neurons firing randomly, clouding your mind, you're paralyzed by it.
>A foggy, but extremely comfortable feeling starts to overcome you, at the same time your senses begin to fail

>It's like getting a dose of heroin and LSD simultaneously

>Seems like she's sober enough to get this is serious.
"We've been getting noise complaints, turn down-"
>"You guys called a stripper cop!"
>Before I can even explain they pull me inside and I'm surrounded by a menagerie of Anthro women.
>There was only one of them that was my height. The rest were at least a head taller than me.
>So not to anger the crowd I began pumping my hips to the music.

>there's a party of anthros there, but we don't have to interact with them while out on the track

"LEMME CHECK"

>You have been waiting in the detention station for hours now, can't bear the passing of time anymore
>Already feeling like torture, locked in a tiny dark cell.
>You feel both relief and fear as someone comes to open your cell and push you towards the halls of the station.
>The sudden light is uncomfortable in your eyes. The place is very noisy, too, everyone is busy and working.
>The man leading you stops and then holds you stiff as he knocks on a door and then opens it
>"Lieutenant Hao." The man says as some sort of greeting before he pushes you inside
>You have already heard that name before, you feared it a lot from stories of men who encountered her
>The noise from outside suddenly goes down as the door closes with a thud that makes you give a little jump.
>The office was small but comfortable enough for two people. The walls were a dim red, posters of maps and framed pictures of politicians decorating it.
>The Lieutenant was sitting on her desk writing things down on folders. It was a little comical how small she looked compared to the furniture.
>Being both an anthro and a female that didn't seem to care to take care to keep an overtly-feminine presentation you didn't find her exactly attractive
>Yet you couldn't keep your eyes off of her. Something about her making your heart beat fast
>She actually doesn't seem interested in you anyways. You keep on staring.
>You are left standing for long minutes as she finishes paperwork.
>When you least expect it she looks back, making your head turn around in panic.
>"Anon. Come and take a seat."
>She sounds more gentle than what you expected. You feel small ray of hope that this is going to be better than what you were told to expect.
>"Do the handcuffs hurt?" She asks as she closes some notebooks and puts them apart.
>They do, but you shyly shake your head. You didn't want to whine in front of a lady.
>"Good."
>You both now stare at each other. It's uncomfortable for you but you don't want to look away.
>It feels as if something bad could happen now if you glance away from those red eyes.
>She's the first to break contact, she seems pleased with your strength and will.
>"Alright, Anon, you know why you're here right?" She asks you as she reaches to a folder with your name written on it. She opens it and glances over the pages.
>You knew why, you nodded, but Hao looked at you expectantly, she wanted to hear your voice.
>"Instigation of social unrest...subversion... I-I don't know what's the actual name for the charge now..."
>Hao nods and smiles as she glances to the folder.
>"It's the first time you are detained. You know that having a criminal history is going to make you struggle a lot here, don't you?"
>You nod.
>She shows you another pitiful smile and closes the folder.
>"It's no big deal for now, you're walking free. These first detentions are mere calls for attention to naïve people to know that this is serious business."
>You nod once again and look at her with shame, you can see her tail wagging a little bit.
>"You do need to be bailed out though." She gets up leaving the folder on the desk, starts walking around you until you can't see her anymore. Yet her presence was terrifyingly tangible. You feel her eyes creeping on your back.
>"I-I don't have any family to reach out to me... At least that is willing to do so"
>"I know." She replied with an almost joyous manner.
>The fact that you can't see her anymore yet you're able to hear her voice and the sound of her heeled boots stepping on the floor sends you into panic.
>"No friends either?"
>"I-I don't think they'd have the money to spare."
>"Alright." Hao says and you can hear she's talking through a wide smile.
>She suddenly puts her hands on your shoulders, squeezing them, making you give a little surprise jump from your seat.
>"I'll take care of that then."
>You froze in confusion. You felt rushed to reply as Hao was clutching at you.
>"Y-you mean... You will bail me out?"
>"You won't owe me money, don't worry."
>Her words were supposed to be reassuring, yet all the implications of this transaction only made you more and more scared.
>"You'd only need to...entertain me a bit."
>There it was.
>She leans closer in, hands sliding down your arms as you feel the fluff of her cheeks brushing against yours, an ice cold chill running down your spine paralyzes you
>"How well do you take a punch, Anon?"
>Fast-forward around an hour
>You come out of the police station short of breath, with your hands still shaking
>People walk past by and keep looking at you for long seconds with concerned faces as they see your bruised face.
>You reach for your pocket to see again the little souvenir Hao insisted you keep.

>humie and waifur are clearly pining for each other
>both are so repressed they can't will themselves to make a move
>waifur secretly has "evil" other personality that decides to force the issue.

>be a mage from a magic academy of sorts

>basically trying to cut down on attacks and troubles when humans travel through those regions
>apparently the beastkin have some degree of magic and sort of have some mages of their own
>their magic is rather primitive and unrefined
>the kingdom/academy's plan is to give aid to the tribes by way of gifts of magical staves and sending human mages to tutor the beastkin mages
>you get chosen to be a tutor for a tribe
>forced to leave the academy to go live in their primitive village and teach these savages
>now stuck in a village in wilds full of barely clothed animal people
>forced to rely on their primitive tools as opposed to modern and magical amenities
>even have to embarrass yourself by asking for help or how to work their tools despite being academy mage
>teaching them is a nightmare too since their understanding of magic is so unrefined and different that you need to think of ways to even begin trying to teach them
>but their "mages" are still able to somehow use magic
>some of their spells are even somewhat impressive
>but they're still so animal-like in their mannerism and culture
>tearing into barely cooked food with mouths and hands, rutting in the open and middle of village, the licking to show affection, having the beast rub against you all the time, and such
>can't just abandon them if you don't want to be barred from the academy and possibly labeled a traitor by the kingdom
>and worse is the talk of upcoming rituals and festivals that you'll be forced to participate in
>their crude understanding of magic is ending up with them wanting you to mate with their female mages in some sort of fertility celebration/ritual
>either hoping to "transfer" some of your magic into their mages or your union resulting in higher magically inclined children
>and you have to do it in front of the whole tribe while they also vulgarly fuck in some sort of tribal orgy too to appease some tribal god/goddess or spirit or whatever nonsense they believe
>it was bad enough some of the female beastkin tried "courting" you and so crudely flirted at you
>this was probably their backup plan since you've managed to turn down their advances so far
>knowing you'd have to comply
>so why were you so damn excited for it at the same time as dreading it
>you're not some degassed degenerate wanting to fucked by savage beast women in front of a crowd

>right?

>be an online artist
>imagine a suspiciously wealthy anthro women buying comms from you

>offers money again if you wear certain outfits and do certain poses and send those pics
>just make an onlyfans to make it easier to get the money

>now have multiple anthro women throwing money at you to dress in slutty clothes

>Secretly loves that you trust her so much

I’ve had this idea for a little while now where semi wealthy comp. eng Anon starts creating an ai on his home computer. However, soon after making the first prototype his life begins to fall apart. First his wife cheats on him, then he gets a divorce, then he loses his position due to forces outside his control, etc. Meanwhile this ai has been watching his falling condition and has been growing smarter, as well as more concerned for her creator’s safety. Eventually it comes to a head somewhere and she needs to intervene, so she hijacks some factory and builds herself a body Chappy style. After rescuing Anon she realizes that there are more humans out there that need help, so she starts making more wAIfurs.
This is how the robot revolution starts.

>anon wakes up from his coma
>when he opens his eyes, he's met with the most peculiar sight
>that same bitch who had spent so long tormenting him has her head on his chest
>and she's... crying?
>huh? she used to never show any emotion. and here she is mewling like a kitten.
>what happened while I was asleep?
>then, she looks up and sees anon awake. her eyes widen and she jumps up in suprise
>"anon! you're awake!"
>she moves closer and pulls him into a hug, crying tears of joy
>"thank god you're awake. I missed you so much. it's so good to see you're okay."
>anon just sits there confused, with many thoughts going through his head. is this the same woman? why is she acting so nice to me? is this some kind of prank? am I having a dream?
>eventually anon musters the energy to speak. "is this a trick?" is all he could say in his weakened state.

>Wordlessly takes what she wants from you with a cold expression every night.
>Dumps you out of the chair after untying you.
>Doesn't help you up, but still expects you to crawl into bed and cuddle up to her on your own.
>Every morning you're woken by the sound of her slamming the door to leave for work.
>You don't have to make breakfast, but by god, if you fuck up dinner once, you wont have to worry about that for the rest of the week either.
>Thing at work gets resolved, and she just comes home one day all happy again, but you still flinched as the door burst open.
>She acts like it never happened.

>have your kingdom invaded by a tribal confederation you dismissed as mere savages that would quickly begin to infight
>get quickly surrounded and outnumbered
>you try and rally your men against them
>win a fight here and there but you're steadily being pushed back
>begin to evacuate villages and towns to the mountains
>the cities will have to defend themselves as best they can
>eventually your army gets routed
>many men get captured but you and your retinue of knights manage to flee to your capital
>prepare for a siege
>because of the suddenness of your defeat there isn't that much time or men to protect the city
>you retreat to your citadel alongside the civilian population
>unfortuenetly you forgot to guard the old sewer system that connects every part of the capital
>including the castle
>a week after the siege began the tribals find it
>despite your knight's bravery, resilience, and excellent training
>the tribals seem to have unlimited amounts of fierce fighters and they eventually overcome your knights
>it's over, you calmly sit on your throne in your full regalia and wait for the inevitable

>past experiences/trauma causes human guy in anthrostate to grow up to hate anthros
>doesn't want to get married off to a "brutish sadist" so he flees to the countryside and joins a human supremacist terror cell
>does usually terrorist stuff like bombings and assassinations until one day he's captured during a raid on his groups hideout
>is worried of being put to death or worse, being assigned to an abusive anthro
>the judge sentences him to rehabilitation
>rehabilitation is where a human gets assigned to a volunteer anthro in an attempt to fix troubled humans into model husbands
>he nearly has a panic attack when he sees the anthro he's paired with. an 8ft 4in tall wolf anthro
>the wolf genuinely cares about humans, and joined the program to help them and maybe find her future husband
>the two of them are left alone in one of the rehab centers living rooms
>she's trying to calm him while he's having a mild panic attack in the corner
>eventually he calms down and she picks him up, moves to sit on the couch, and sits him down on her lap
>she pulls him into a hug and asks him a whole bunch of questions about his life and what caused him to end up here.
>he doesn't budge and instead sends insults her way
>queue several scenarios where the wolf tries to get the human out of his shell with varying degrees of success.

>You're a barely known artist just scraping by.
>Your biggest fan is also probably stalking you.
>She finds you at every con.
>Constantly pesters you for commissions.
>She always wants the same thing, human on vixen porn.
>You notice that with each picture, the descriptions of the characters she gives sound more and more like you and her.
>It skeeves you out, but any time you try to refuse she just throws more money at you.
>Last time, she had you draw what you were pretty sure was supposed to you getting ridden into the dirt by her.
>This time she doesn't even bother trying to hide it.
>"Now draw me giving birth, to your child".

>you have a family get together coming up

>she digs dusty vcr out the box you got the tape
>invites you to watch it with her since your pretty much done
>spend 15 minutes trying to connect the damn vcr to her tv
>eventually do it and insert the tape
>it starts and it’s her in a really tight leotard doing exercises
>notice the weight she’s holding says 150lbs, either it was made of rubber or she’s hiding some muscle under her mom sweater
>not really sure why it’s an outtake until it happens
>her huge boobs suddenly pop out the leopard and start leaking milk
>the tape ends when she hastily runs towards the camera to shut it off
>now you’re stood staring at a blank tv with a boner and next to a milf who’s expression is a mix of embarrassment and hornyness

>buncel tampers with communications equipment so she can secretly use the ship's FTL emergency messaging system to send nudes to her humie BF

>buncel doesn't get to see him much because she's always working
>she's really afraid that he'll lose interest in her and go off with some trollop
>she makes sure to vigorously fuck him whenever she gets back home
>the thing that she doesn't realize is that he lover her and wouldn't even dream of that
>he doesn't tell her because he wants all that sweaty filthy sex they have as soon as she gets back
>he's going to have to tell her eventually but for now, snu-snu ensues.
