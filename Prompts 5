Tech Terror Story
TT #2: Trickle Down Rumors
>To many in the Concord of Saviors, Split Hare was a humorous type that helped keep things from getting too serious
>She played her fair share of pranks, cracked jokes, and was always up for fun with the rest of the girls
>So when she came in with a hunk of junk vaguely resembling the head of a robotic villain that had eluded capture for a while, everyone waited for the punchline
>As she told her peers about what happened the previous night, they wondered why she didn't start laughing along with them, instead looking like she was quite serious
>The first to break the awkward air around what was perceived as stilted humor was Floodgate, a Beluga with control over all liquids
>"Hare dear," the aquatic mammal said with a twinge of concern, "you are just practicing your poker face, aren't you?"
>The rabbit shook her head, showing her and the rest of any onlookers the inside of what was once the high tech helmet
>"You know I can't keep a straight face very long, just look at this!" she said as she pointed inside the helm, "Tech Terror isn't a robot, or even an Anthro!"
>Murmurs made their way through the small crowd that had now formed, all with their own theories of what the villain was
>Some of the more confident members of the group asked to see the helmet, to which the speedster obliged them
>"Why is it so busted up?" a rat asked, "I don't smell anything other than metal n' burnt plastics!"
>"Yeah, what gives?" a snake agreed after trying her method of 'sniffing', giving the helmet back
>"It may have blown up a bit back when I tried picking it up," Hare says as she recalled the self destruct
>It kicked in shortly after she had touched it, starting to vibrate slightly
>She couldn't risk collateral damage, so she had to bring it under the nearby lake
>It wasn't too big of an explosion, but it had warped the inside to a terrible degree, making it very hard to determine what shape the helm was supposed to have
>And on top of that, bringing it underwater had help strip it of anything those with gifted scent could use to confirm or deny her claims
>No one would blame her for how she handled it, dealing with bombs in as quick and safe a manor as possible was part of the job description
>This however did nothing to make her less embarrassed with herself, what little proof she may have had being wiped away by her own doing
>It seemed as though nobody would believe her
>That was, until a curious observer made herself known
>A blood hound who went by Dogmata, armed to the teeth in gadgets and gizmos for any occasion, not unlike the villain in question
>Very stern, always focused, one hell of a tracker
>And one of Split Hare's long time friends
>"Hare, may I?" asked the canine
>She nodded and gave her the helmet
>"Think you can work some magic?" the rabbit asked hopefully
>Dogmata didn't respond, already at work with some form of multitool
>For a moment, nobody said a word, all eyes and ears were upon her
>Then with a click, the face plate popped open
>"Interesting..." she said took a look at the less damaged portion that had been revealed
>The crowd was starting to get antsy while they waited for the master investigator's findings
>Only to get disappointed when she shook her head, saying it was inconclusive
>She promised to take it to her lab and get results
>Everyone began to disperse from the area, but Dogmata gestured for Split Hare to follow
>They both went to a secluded area in the giant building
>Split Hare asked what was up, garnering a frown from the somewhat surly dog
>"Jane," she said with her arms crossed, "do you know what you've just done?"
>The speedster had no idea what she meant, but knew the answer wouldn't be a good one since Dogmata had just used her real name
>"You just announced to everyone that there is a human super villain out there. Do you really think all of them will just keep quiet about this?"
>Not fully understanding the reason this might be a bad thing, Split Hare, or Jane rather, instead focused on something else
>"Does this mean that you believe me?" she said, almost dizzily ignoring the issue that was posed
>The hound sighs in annoyance
>"Even if it makes no sense whatsoever," she admitted, "I trust you not to make something like this up."
>She shook her head, looking down at the helmet
>"Regardless of that," she said in a much more serious tone, "word WILL get out now, and what do you think will happen when a bunch of thugs and psychopaths with super powers hear about it?"
>When contextualized like this, the real problem finally became apparent to the now wide-eyed heroine, simply saying "Oh" in realization
>Dogmata set the helmet down, patting her pal on the back
>"It will be fine," the dog said in an effort to soothe, "we're just going to need to get to him first."
>This cheered up the rabbit, bringing her back to her usual demeanor
>"Now," Dogmata said as her informative visor dropped over her eyes, "let's find a way to force a confrontation."
>As the two superheroes started to form a strategy with some other friends in their circle, Dogmata's theory was made reality
>Within the day, some of the greener heroes had decided to hunt after information about Tech Terror possibly being a human
>This of course meant interrogation of other criminals
>They knew nothing of the sort obviously, but ended up in jail with others who had the same thing asked of them
>Low level gangsters talked with each other, boastful that even they could take on a super if it was a human
>This caught the ears of those with affiliation to villains, dirty cops and enforcers alike
>Rumors were like a wildfire, growing out of control as more participants joined in
>'Maybe this Tech guy stole his stuff from Dogmata', 'What if it's actually a shapeshifter?', 'Maybe she's a demon who stole some poor bastard's body'
>It happened like this all the way up the tree, until those who were truly dangerous had been informed
>Those especially dangerous being the criminal syndicate known as Dark Chimera
>Deep within their stronghold located in the center of a dormant volcano, they were in the middle of a meeting to discuss possible targets for their next operation
>Ideas included weather machines, invoking dark sorceries, political subterfuge, the bread and butter of evil
>When it seemed as though all the options had been laid out, a shark asked to include another
>Primevil, the only true chimera of the group as well as its leader, allowed the addition
>Riptide of the Depths slid photos around the table of a mid grade supervillain
>"I was recently informed of an up and rising supervillain." said the shark as she had the various shots of Tech Terror put on the big screen
>They were all taken from the bank where his heist had failed
>"He's been shown to have aptitude with all forms of technology, and there is little evidence he even exists". she said while using a laser pointer to draw attention to various sections of the photos
>"Excuse me seabreath," said a rabbit in gear resembling that of Split Hare, "did you just say 'He'?"
>The shark decided to let the childish insult off with a sneer, this time at least
>"That's right, I said he," explained the now somewhat irritated villainess, "I have reason to believe this is a man."
>Those in the meeting all began to pay more attention, leaning in
>"Many of my servants have heard that heroes have been rousting whoever they can, all asking about this thing right here being a human" she said elaborated, circling the image on screen for emphasis
>"So what?" questioned the same impudent rabbit, "I like a good shag like anyone else, but what are we gonna do with some skinny in a mech that we couldn't do before?"
>The leader slammed her huge claw on the table
>"s i l e n c e w h e l p" came the ethereal words of the chimera, speaking not with vocal cords, but straight into the mind of the rabbit
>The mental intrusion made the upstart mammal quiet, Primevil nodding for the shark to finish
>"We could always use someone who can keep things quiet," said the shark while glaring back at the dull colored rabbit, "and if all else fails, he would make for a grand bargaining chip."
>Questions circulated in an organized fashion under the gaze of the Primevil
>The shark took them all and addressed them like one would at a business meeting
>Q: How would we get him to join us?
>A: Blackmail of course. He seems to be going after very specific targets, so if we can narrow down what he is after, we can get at them before he does. Force him to come to us.
>Q: What worth does he have to the Concord?
>A: Going off of what my minions have told me, many of its members are very interested in this one. The reasons why don't matter as much as the fact they want him, and we'll have him.
>Q: Who gets to have him?
>A: This is not important to our operation. If you really can't help yourself, clear it with everyone else first. As with all our other endeavors, pleasure comes after business.
>"That should be all for the moment," said Riptide as she finished her proposal, "thanks for your time."
>A vote was counted for which projects would be put forward, with 11 of 13 votes giving the green light to Riptides proposal
>Thus, by the end of the day after his secret was laid bare, Tech Terror found himself with a worldwide target on his back
>He knew what his prior failure would bring forth, it would be inevitable in this world
>This could all be avoided, a simple life could be his at any moment if he just stopped right now
>But that same burning sense of pride and ambition that brought him so far wouldn't have it
>His greatness would once again be admired, he would once again be an icon, an aspiration
>There would be no substitutes for someone like him, his superiority would be acknowledged
>With that thought helping him along, he continued toiling away in his workshop, working towards making sure his victory was assured
>This was the only way
>The rest of the leaders of the Concord were all made aware of the situation from Split Hare and Dogmata, and although they also had a hard time believing it at first, that didn't stop them from readying a capture
>The man was drawn to the Arkanian Relic, which Split Hare had recovered after their confrontation
>From her other accounts, he had stolen various other specific items
>Nothing was known about what purpose they served, but they were all unobtainable anywhere else, including the most recent target
>The answer for them was simple then; set up a honeypot with the gemstone, then fall in when he took the bait
>Dogmata had cameras all surrounding the perimeter of the predetermined bank on separate networks, all made to look as civilian and nondescript as possible
>She had also taken the liberty of making more Energy Signature Triangulators for the rest of the team, making them shielded from E.M.P.s to avoid a repeat of last time
>Lastly, they had chosen a bank located in the territory of a few novice heroes to help sell the facade
>All the pieces had been set, they only thing missing was the quarry to spring the trap
>A month had passed in the blink of the eye, during which nothing had happened
>The greenhorn heroes had continued grilling other criminals about Tech Terror, more and more were alerted to his presence
>So when action had finally come about, chaos ran wild
>The Relic was once again out in the wild, but something felt off to the villain
>He couldn't place it, so he had his scout drone look at not only the bank, but everything in the area
>All of it was exceedingly average, but the twinge of paranoia was still present, and so he poured over all the information he gathered
>Then he noticed a pattern in the security cameras on buildings around the bank and a few blocks outside of it
>Despite them all being for regular businesses, they looked brand new
>He had his drone attempt to splice into one of their feeds, but it was blocked
>This wasn't right, consumer brand cameras were notoriously easy to hack
>His eyes widened in horror as he noticed the drone's output was starting to be traced
>He hit the self destruct protocol and sunk into his large chair as it severed connection with him, rocketing into the atmosphere before exploding
>He knew at that moment what was going on, and it meant he would have to delay his plans even more now
>Just upgrading his regular arsenal wouldn't cut it, he was dealing with the rest of the big shot heroes now, not just Split Hare
>So back to the drafting table he went
>It was grueling work for one person to do, supergenius or not
>But he wasn't taking any chances with his future
>He had to be on top of every possibility, every failure had to be stamped out, every danger to his success purged
>If he couldn't do this quiet, there was no reason to continue as though it was a possibility
>But as he scrapped idea after idea, a spark of brilliance struck
>Why let it be himself vs the world?
>Why be a dreadnaught when you could be a legion?
>And so he slaved for the next three weeks
>He would have preferred much more time, but there was an emergency
>The bank was already being attacked
>Goat Squad of Dark Chimera had begun their assault on the bank
>It consisted of LagoLess, inverse of Split Hare, Riptide, and Baphomet, dark spellcaster and the leader of the squad
>Civilians, anthro and human alike, had been corralled into the lobby and tied up
>Baphomet prepared a gateway to cross into the vault while the other two kept watch for any issues
>A smooth and easy job, just like they liked it
>That is, until the large front doors on the building had shot off their hinges in a shower of water
>Before they knew it, their hostages were disappearing in a blur
>It was only LagoLess who could perceive her eternal rival, seething in rage at her appearance
>She bolted after her without care for anything else, the two speedsters clashing once again in a way few could see clearly
>Through the destroyed doors came the huge whale Floodgate, both of the aquatic animals growling upon seeing the other
>"What are YOU doing here?" they both said to each other
>"You're ruining everything!" they both yelled at each other
>"ENOUGH." they both screamed as they rushed towards the other in a torrent of water
>"Team, what's wrong?" asked Baphomet as she continued her ritual, not able to take her eyes off of the spell she was preparing
>"Team?"
>When no response came, she had to drop her concentration and let the spell fizzle out to find out what was going on
>Her rectangular pupils dilated in shock as the saw a stream of heroes flood in through the busted down doors
>She tapped upon her dark crystal necklace, sending a message back to HQ
>"This is Goat Squad, we are in need of backup immediately!" she voiced with great urgency, almost bleating
>Primevil responded telepathically from the great distance, receiving no answer from the spellcaster as she found herself in battle
>She then tried to contact the other members of the group, having no difference in the result
>Left with no other option, the chimera scrambled both Snake Squad and Lion Squad for a rescue, grumbling under her breath as they were deployed
>By the time Tech Terror had made his way to the bank, there was a small scale war between the two different organizations
>Not only that, but it seemed non affiliated heroes and villains had joined in as well
>This was very distressing for him as he drew near, so many variables to account for, the capacity for that accursed randomness was sky high
>But when he thought about the circumstances more, he realized it could be a boon to his efforts, not a hindrance
>If he could play his cards right, he might be able to get away with the Arkanian Relic while they were busy pushing each others snouts in
>He decided to descend from the ceiling, hopefully avoiding the majority of the massive fight he could see from the lobby and street
>His entourage of AI controlled helpers followed his lead, helping him laser out a hole in the ceiling
>They all flew through the hole they had made, immediately working the vulnerabilities of the massive vault door
>A few from each side had noticed the third party as the massive vault was opened, informing the others of his presence
>The novice heroes that the territory actually belonged to were the first to get at him
>Tech Terror relegated finding what he came for to his upgraded drones, devoting all of his attention to the approaching supers
>A flying wolf announced herself with grand gestures, the two other supers at her side
>"Lucky us, this is that so called human supervillain!" said the boisterous wolf while hovering just above the ground
>"So called?" queried the filtered voice, "Why make the distinction?"
>The small group of three giggled
>"You know anthros have humans beat in every category! Come on, just give yourself up, we'll make sure you get some leniency if ya do."
>The wolfess folded her arms thinking that he would consider her words
>Perhaps it was their inexperience, maybe even some ingrained feeling of entitlement to the obedience of the men they protected, but they really believed he had surrendered when he put his hands in the air
>Of course, that made what came next even easier
>His suit's hands took the shape of claws, extending at breakneck speed towards the two closest heroes
>Neither were expecting it, so they could only flail about when the claws grabbed them by the face
>"Hmphphphph!" they both cried out
>Out of a small dispenser in the palm of the metal hands came a potent knock out gas, the struggles from the heroes ceasing soon after
>Letting the unconscious heroes hit the ground as his arms retracted back to his side, Tech Terror turned to the remaining hero who was standing in awe of his unparalleled ingenuity
>Or so he wished was the case
>"W-What did you do to them?" the slightly shaken heroine asked as she looked upon her comrades unmoving forms
>The metal man waved off the question, saying "Nothing much, they'll just feel numb when they wake up."
>He then assumed a more aggressive pose, pointing at her indignantly
>"Shall I do the same for you?"
>The heroine, also a wolf, snarled at the notion
>"As if! Human or not, I won't hold back!"
>The wolf leapt at the villain with her fists raised and her super sharp energy claws out
>The fight was of average length to some, but to the two speedsters it was a slugfest
>Blow for blow, tit for tat, the fight went on at a ludicrous speed
>Their speed made every hit thunderous
>The two were almost evenly matched
>But in the end, Split Hare stood over her dark reflection victorious
>Sore, but victorious
>Despite her hard fought win, she found herself very peeved at the situation
>The whole operation was going belly up, the wrong people took the bait
>She had wanted the best chances of bringing in that misguided man with as little resistance as possible
>But after today's fiasco, it was very possible he would stay under wraps
>That was the case, until she had received a transmission from Dogmata
>"Hey 'Mata, what's up?" she asked into her transceiver as she prepared special cuffs for LagoLess
>"Looks like our target still came around. Get over as soon as you can."
>The speedster breathed a sigh of relief, confirming she would be there
>She grabbed LagoLess and ferried her to the closest prison she could at lightning speed
>Though she would often make small talk with prison staff, she had no time to faff about today
>With haste, she made her way back to the bank
>Things were going relatively well for the machine marauder
>His bots had gotten the gemstone, and any who were foolish enough to not take him seriously had found themselves on the ground
>That wasn't to say this was a flawless victory by any means
>His trusty shoulder cannon was ripped off in a moment he was outnumbered, and he'd used up many of his ammunitions
>But even then, the pile of supers grew, and he hadn't even needed to bust out the big guns yet
>He and his bots flew back through the hole in the ceiling, only to be greeted by a fist to the face
>As he shook it off, he looked upon the perpetrator
>"Dogmata," the robotic voice said as the metal shell it came from assumed a defensive stance, "I had a feeling I'd see you here."
>The bloodhound had also taken up a stance of her own
>"It was supposed to be a surprise," the canine responded with a trained lack of emotion, "I take it you knew we would be here?"
>The supervillain scoffed at the remark
>"Of course I did, especially after my last encounter with that blasted rabbit. Speaking of which..."
>The suit turned suddenly to the side, a millisecond later catching the speedy fist of a very surprised Split Hare in its' large metal hands
>"Wha?" was all she could say before being tossed away, getting caught mid-air by Dogmata
>"I am afraid that won't work on me again." the villain said in his filtered voice
>The rabbit was left dumbstruck, while the blood hound maintained a cool and collected composure
>"How did you see me coming?" the hero asked with bewilderment
>From inside the suit, Tech Terror grinned
>No one could see this of course
>"That's the best part, I didn't!" he said with glee, evident even through his artificial voice
>He then realized what he was doing thanks to his interactions with other supers and villains in the past, stopping himself from elaborating any further
>Having stood back up on her feet, Split Hare began thumping the ground in annoyance
>"That doesn't make any sense!" she said as rushed forward into a flurry of blows, with Dogmata close behind
>Every single punch she threw, every kick she let loose, all were blocked and deflected with ease by the suit
>As this was happening, Tech Terror noticed that it seemed that the force behind the attacks was less than he had experienced before
>Before he could continue the train of thought, Dogmata had gotten up to him and somehow flipped him onto his back
>For him to be able to keep up with Split Hare, yet also not be able to react to the significantly slower throw, this confused both of the heroes
>Using his thrusters to propel himself into the air, Tech Terror hovered far above the ground
>He prepared to use a rocket salvo, but was forced to react to a lightning fast jump kick by the suit's programing
>A grave error in the strategy he came up with arose, and it wasn't just him that noticed
>As long as his suit automatically defended against Split Hare, he couldn't use anything else in his arsenal, nor pay attention to any advances by Dogmata
>His suit was getting hammered by the duo's efforts
>The dire situation he found himself in called for his trump card
>Still able to command his drones via voice, he called out "Strike bots! Triple Trouble!"
>His swarm of helpers came together, linking themselves to one another magnetically
>What was once one hundred and twenty little drones became three robots equal in stature and appearance to Tech Terror
>They then came after Dogmata, forcing her away from the fight at hand
>This left Split Hare and Tech Terror to fight by themselves
>"Why are you doing any of this? Why fight us TT?" the rabbit asked as she continued fighting
>Amidst all the fighting, the science supreme skirted around the question, instead saying "Oh, I get a nickname now?"
>Dogmata was slowly losing her ground to the bots, and Split Hare found the fatigue from her prior battle start to wear on her speed
>It all seemed to be going badly for the veteran heroes, until a burst of water erupted from the hole in the ceiling
>Emerging from it was Floodgate and an armadillo with a shell fashioned to look like a medieval knight
>They didn't quip or say anything, they instead got right into the fight with the bots
>This was the edge they needed, gaining ground on the machines
>Tech Terror could see where this fight would heading if it continued from a mile away, it wasn't one in his favor
>He might hold ground now, but more would join in as time went on
>He had to fold right now
>He disabled his RACE (Rapid Acceleration Counter Engine) long enough to key in his lair's coordinates for his teleporter
>This led to him taking some attacks straight on, but it was necessary
>He also ordered his bots to do the same
>None of the heroes knew what was going to happen except Split Hare
>"No! Don't do this! We can help you!" she said as she tried her best to get at the teleporter, failing to do so
>With a sharp crackle of energy, the teleporter field surrounded the villain and his inorganic minions
>"Who said I wanted your help?" said the man in the machine before a flash had whisked him and the bots away
>Split Hare, physically drained from everything, came over to check on her equally tired friend
>"Are you alright?" she asked as the bloodhound pulled out her teleporter tracker
>"I'll be fine," the gadgeteer said gruffly, "But we may have a problem."
>She showed the fleet footed rabbit her tracker
>There were 121 individual teleportation locations
>Split Hare's jaw dropped
>"That's... quite a lot." she said simply
>The blood hound put away the tracker, offering a pat on the back to her now saddened friend
>"Don't worry about that too much, we'll come up with a new plan. We made some big arrests today anyway."
>She pointed at the police vans picking up the member of Dark Chimera
>"Besides," she said as she reached into one of her many pouches, "he'll still be after this won't he?"
>She pulled out the Arkanian Relic with a slight smile
>The mastermind pounded his observation table in anger, what he had thought to be the gemstone cracking even further
>A fake
>He was certain, 100% CERTAIN that he had the real deal
>It had to have been during the fight, there was no other point it could have been switched
>That mutt had to have swiped it from him before his bots came into the picture
>It was all enough to make a lesser man cry in anguish, seethe in anger
>But that wasn't the man he was
>This was all just the result of a panic reaction
>Yeah, that's right, it was that other group of bozos that forced his hand early
>He hadn't failed, merely just a trial run of his technology
>...
>He knew was kidding himself, another big blunder
>Chance had forced him to acknowledge his own fallibility once again
>If he could, he would strangle the very concept with his bare hands
>But he hadn't the time to cry over spilled milk, nor his inability to defy the chaotic entity known as chance
>His bot diversion would only distract them for so long, he had to get moving
>Even without the final component, the machine in its' penultimate condition would help him
>He wired the thing to his lair, allowing it 20 minutes to charge up
>Then he pressed the big red button
>With a synthetic hum, he and his lair both zapped out of reality for a moment, abandoning the secluded area beneath the mountains for a new hideout
>This would not be over


>Multiverse theory
>There exists multiple universes
>And there exists one universe where humanities first contact with alien races were always extremely hostile
>Some races were just highly advanced, some magical, anomalous, etc.
>Humanity after every contact harvested the alien tech and studied alien magic or energy
>With each and every new contact leading to more advanced, and extremely messed up technology
>End result being an extremely milimilitaristic militaristic, think the Quincy from Bleach TYBW Arc
>So now you have a humanity with powers/anomalous abilities
>A malfunction with portable portal device causes a male solider to end up being pulled and thrown from his omniverse to an omniverse were males are rare and humans are the most desirable or something
>Now you got a supped up male human with the mindset of a space marine from 40k trying to get back home stuck with human loving xenos whom try to subdue the "damaged" human for his own protection no matter what reality/universe he goes to.

>Destiny Multiverse
>Male human guardian(Your choice of class)
>Ends up in another reality due to Vex shenanigans
>In this reality anthros coexist under the traveler with humanity
>Problem being that only females could become guardians
>Also the fact that human males are fiercely protected
>There ain't no male exos or awoken
>So here he is, a MALE and GUARDIAN
>If the city don't drag his back, the plethora of other races will
>Becoming a sex slave to big busty Eliksni and Cabal does sound good
>Becoming the sex slave to the Hive ain't as much
>Actually, no becoming a sex slave
>And pray to the light it ain't the Vex that get him

>Star Fox Rule63 and Reverse Gender Role
>I am Male Human Child found in an escape pod by Jamie McCloud
>Raised by her and her husband along with their daughter Fox McCloud
>Grow up with my stepsis, do kid stuff
>However, nearing the end of middle school she starts acting strange.
>Ignore it at first, but when highschool rolled around did it become more obvious
>She started becoming more protective of me, possessive one might say
>She started to make friends too
>A Toad names Slippy, a blue falcon named Falcy, a bulldog named Willa, a lynx named Miyu, and a spaniel named Fay
>They all wanted to become pilots
>I wanted to become one as well
>Made this known to the group
>They just stare at me, like I just said something incredibly stupid
>Sis gives me this glare and ends up telling her friends that her and I were going home
>Which was strange since it wasn't that late, only like 9 PM
>I attempt to dissuade her but she GRIPS my arm and drags me back home
>She drags me over to mom and dad
>"Anon apparently thinks he has a vagina and wants to become a pilot"
>Jamie gets up startled
>"What!? Anon is this true!?"
>I nod a yes, confused
>"A males place is not on the battlefield, or space, or whatever!"
>Jamie growls out
>"You are too precious to be put into such a dangerous place! Your place is in the home raising young!"
>I argue back
>"But I want to become a pilot! Just like Fox and her friends!"
>I was going to continue but Jamie's glare coupled with a hiss deter me
>"YOU WILL NOT!"
>I cower under the order
>Jamie sighs before turning her gaze to my sis.
>"I was going to gift you this when you turned 18. But your brother's apparent foolishness has forced my hand
>My father's eye's widen in realization, before turning his gaze towards me in... sympathy?
>"From this day foward, Anon belongs to you. You shall protect, care, and rear children with him."
>This is what my mother states to my sister
>I was too stumped to say anything
>My sister on the other hand...
>"Thank you mother! I will live up to your expectations! Well I've already been protecting and caring for him..but"
>My sister turns her gaze to me, her eyes filled with the one thing I'd never expect in her eyes
>The one thing I've only seen in other females eyes
>LUST
>"Give me a few years to get to the child rearing~"
>Jamie laughs and proudly slaps her daughters shoulder
>"I'm counting on it! Why don't you bring your new proper- I mean male with you to bed~"
>Fox gives a sly smirk to our mother before slithering her arm over shoulder
>"Sure, but I ain't gonna try to be quiet. And I don't he'd be able to keep quiet as well~"
>While I may be a virgin, I ain't dense
>And I don't want to be a sister fucker
>I quickly throw her arm off my shoulder and attempt to book it out of the house
>Right as I'm about to make it to the door, I'm tackled to the ground
>"Fox! Stop! Please! I'm your brother for goddesses sake!"
>I attempt to appeal with common sense while trying to struggle out of her grip
>"Not any longer your are~ You're my male~ My Property~”
> I could do nothing to escape, she was always stronger than me
>As I’m dragged to the fate that awaits me, my mother giving off a proud smile
>I noticed my father staring at me, eyes full of pity
>Before losing sight of him as I’m dragged up the stairs, he mouths off to words
>’I’m Sorry’
>The next few years were…
>DEGRADING
>When Fox decided to go to Flight Academy with her friends I thought that was it
>That I’d be able to spend the next few years home with Fox far, far away from me
>The day she went to the Academy pretty much meant a 4 year vacation.
>I wasn’t allowed to get a job
>’Jobs are for the female’ “mom” would say
>’Your duty is to please my daughter’ “mom” would say
>So that meant staying home, relax, play video games, and learn how to cook
>The cooking thing was mandatory
>The males duty so to speak
>That was what I expected for the following years
>So I head off to bed with this in mind
>I awaken to noise of a hover car starting up
>I attempt to move, only to realize I’m tied up, trapped in a box
>Ball gag included
>And am I wearing a mankini!?
>I attempt struggle against my constraints and voice displeasure
>All I get in return is a familiar feminine chuckle
>I could only lay helpless as I’m driven to an unknown destination
>The hover car stops, the engine noise dying down
> I hear the sound of a car door being opened and subsequently closed
>I hear the sound of door next to me opening, and the box is lifted out of the car
>I could hear the sound of people around me
>I think I heard something about flight exams?
>Flight exams….no
>The person, who is most definitely “mom”, positions the box as to hold it one handed
>Despite being a pilot she was still strong enough to carry me
>That or I’m just very light
>She presses on a door bell and says something dreadful
>“Hey Fox! It’s your mom! I got a gift for ya!”
>The door slides open, allowing for “mom” to step in
>”Hey Mrs. McCloud!”
>”Wassup Jamie”
>”Hello McCloud”
>”Hey Fox’s mom”
>”How ya doing?”
>”Hi Mom!”
>I heard 6 variating hellos
>One from Fox herself and the others from her friends
>Are they bunking with each other?
>”So Fox. I was able to sway the administrative head due to my connections.”
>Fox lets out a yes in excitement
>Falcy asks Fox what’s going on
>”You’ll see~ Mom? Would you mind placing the box down?”
>”Mom” places the box down as per request
>”Okay Gals! Gather around the box as I open the box to reveal to my pack what I am so generously gifting~”
>”Knock it off with the pizazz McCloud, open the box already.”
>”Alright alright Willa”
>I can hear the removal of tape, and then a sudden flood of light followed by gasps of surprise
>”Fox…You can’t be serious”
>Eyes having adjusted, I’m able to see everyone’s faces peering above
>*Splat* Did I just get drooled on?
>”Of course I’m serious. You guys have been my closest friends since the beginning of highschool”
>You can see them becoming emotional
>How touching..
>”We’re a pack now, and a pack watches each other's back. Not only that but shares as well.”
>She surveys her around, looking at each of her friends faces
>”It’s only natural I share him as well”
>I can even see them all smiling in camaraderie, I even see Slippy’s eye’s welling up with tears
>I hear a sigh of content from James
>”I’m so proud of you Fox. Not even I shared your father with my past pack mate. These friends of yours must be pretty special”
>Her head disappears from my view in the box
>”Any ways I best be going Fox. I don’t want to keep your gal pals waiting from trying him out”
>”Thank you McMCloud!”
>”Thx!”
>”We appreciate the gift!”
>“Have a safe drive!”
>“Bye!”
>”Love you mom!”
>As they finish their goodbyes, the smiling visage of the Fox and her pack disappear reverting back to last filled gazes and drool
>As they hands descend upon me, I could only allow my eyes to swell
>But unlike Slippy, whose tears were of joy
>Mine were of fear of the sexual servitude I would have to face for the next few years.

Ursa Story
>you reached up and pinched her butt
>”Eep!!” Ursa exclaimed, her arm reaching back to feel where you’d pinched
>she scowled at you while you laughed
>”What I don’t pinch back mister, remember I have claws” she told you, smirking
>”Yeah, yeah, why don’t you lie down? The mattress is pretty comfy actually” you asked patting next to yourself
>”eh why not” said the bear, taking off her shirt and lying down on her back
>”Comfy see?” You said reassuringly
>”I’ve had better” Ursa said sarcastically
>”Yeah, well maybe those beds were in one piece” you said back equally sarcastic
>Ursa didn’t reply, instead continuing to tap at her phone screen
>you put an arm over her belly and scooted closer, she hummed in a questioning way so you said
>”I’m a little cold is all and your the warmest thing in the building”
>she chuckled and spoke
>”not that you probably care but I’m just talking to my parents, seeing how Abigail-my daughter- is”
>”Abigail? That’s a pretty name, how’d you come up with it?”
>”Uh, not sure really, guess it just came to me and I liked it enough. Also I was dead set on giving my kid a name that can be considered normal, not like mine I mean”
>you led there for a bit, enjoying the feeling of Ursa’s fur and warmth, wondering if some anthros even needed to wear clothes to stay warm in weather like this
>suddenly a wave of fatigue hit you, brought on by alcohol and your body needing rest to fix itself
>your eyelids were feeling heavier by the second but you didn’t want to just fall asleep on Ursa like this
>no, you wouldn’t fall asleep yet, you just had to think of something to keep your mind active
>maybe you and Ursa could do something tomorrow?
>”so, you have any plans for tomorrow?” You asked
>”Hmm, nope, I was gonna have the day to myself, why?
>”I thought maybe me and you could do something? Seeing as I’m not doing anything tomorrow either”
>She thought to herself for a second
>”Eh, why not, it’ll be nice to get out some more, I enjoy tonight, as embarrassing and somewhat distressing it’s been for me”
>still not wanting to fall asleep you asked about her daughter
>”So Abigails with her grandparents right? She can’t be that old if you’ve left her with them”
>”Trust me, my parents take every chance they get to look after her, probably because it gives them something to do or reminds them of when they weren’t so old, she’s six by the way.
>So she had a six year old? She could be that old herself as her muzzle didn’t have a trace of grey on it.
>”Does she look like you?” You queried, nuzzling into her fur a little more
>Ursa scoffed
“Well yeah, though her furs a tiny bit darker, probably from her bastard father, not like she ever sees him though, son of a bitch walked out on me then -ugh” she groaned angrily
>Oh… that seemed like a sensitive topic, probably best to leave it for now
>Ursa pulled you onto herself gently, careful to avoid touching your back by gripping your hips instead
>your head rested on her chest pillows and you could smell her scent
>it was earthy and berry like, probably a whole shampoo bottles worth
>it put you at ease as you relaxed into her embrace
>”Why don’t you get some sleep honey, let that back heal up” Ursa whispered, kissing your forehead and gently stroking your head, her claws tingling against your scalp
>you closed your eyes and let fatigue take
>The next morning you woke, still laying in Ursa’s embrace
>slowly your senses came back to you and you realised she was whispering something
>She was cooing at you and talking lightly
>”Aren’t you the cutest sleeper, holding me like I’ll disappear if you let go, just like Abigail”
>Ursas claws were gently scratching your head, sending pleasurable tingles across your head
>you yawned, pretending to just wake up, looking around and at her
>she smiled warmly at you, yawning herself before speaking
>”sleep well?”
>you nodded, “yeah, these new pillows did wonders for my neck” referring to her breasts
>she scoffed “Heh, how’s your back feel?”
>”sore, how bruised is it?”
>Ursa frowned
>”a lot, like I thought it would, I’m sorry, so so sorry” she said, voice wavering
>”Hey, come on now you don’t need to apologise again, it was an accident, that I had a hand in causing by sucking tits a little too good”
>Ursa giggled and moved you off her belly onto the mattress before getting up herself
>she cracked her back and walked out the bedroom
>you thought about what you wanted to do today with her, what would she even be interested in?
>she was a mom and mom’s like shopping right?
>wait that might just make her feel like it’s a normal day instead or relaxing
>a movie, everyone likes movies right?
>the closest theatre was in the next town over though so you need to get there somehow
>your car was one of those tiny hatchbacks that you barely fit in
>you’d had it since you were a teenager and it had done you well so you’d not had a reason to replace it other than simply getting a better looking one
>anyway you’d have to get…public transport
>You stood up, also exiting the bedroom and heading towards the bathroom when Ursa exited it, her ears scraping the doorframe as she stooped under it
>you passed each other and just as you were about to close the door and take a quick shower Ursa asked
>”Hey you wouldn’t have any sewing stuff would you? I wanna try fixing my jean button”
>”Oh, I think so, under the sink.”
>washing yourself caused your back to ache but nothing unbearable
>clean you stepped out the shower and dried yourself
>wrapping a towel around your waist you left the bathroom
>heading back towards the bedroom to get dressed you saw Ursa sewing the button back onto the jeans on the kitchen countertop
>huh, can’t undo the button but can sew it back on with what looked like ease
>putting on fresh clothes you wandered towards Ursa in order to ask her about seeing a movie
>”Sooo, Ursa, would you, like to go see a movie?”
>She didn’t hesitate to reply with an enthusiastic “yeah”
>that was sorted then you guess
>”Oh Uh, we’ll have to take a train or something since I don’t think my car is big enough , sorry”
>checking for the next train you saw it was in just over an hour so you offered Ursa some breakfast which she gladly accepted
>checking your fridge you had some bacon, not a lot though
>whatever Ursa could have it all
>While you cooked it Ursa got properly dressed, still struggling with the button on her jeans which thankfully didn’t break
>you put the plate of bacon in front of her, which looked kind of pathetic
>to you it was a good amount of bacon but to her it was more like a small snack
>she didn’t even bother using a fork she just skewered the pieces on her claws
>either way she thanked you for the meal
>later you made sure you had everything you needed
>phone, wallet and keys
>you opened the front door and gestured for Ursa to exit first
>”Such a gentleman” she teased as you closed and locked the door
>as you exited the apartment building you passed Michelle standing in her doorway looking down the hall who upon seeing Ursa flew inside and slammed the door shut
>Ursa dragged her claws across the wooden door as she passed it, cackling to herself
>the train station was a small walk away so you’d get there with good time to spare
>Ursa suddenly starting holding your hand
>”Scared I’ll run off like a cub?” You joked
>”more scared you’ll fall over like last night, how is your ankle by the way?”
>” ’s fine, hursts if I move it too much to the left or right so I’ll just avoid doing that.”
>once at the station Ursa let go of your hand and pulled out her phone
>”just gonna call Abigail, see how she’s doing, I’ve got time right?”
>you nodded and Ursa put the phone to her ear
>after a few seconds she started talking, asking the young cub on the other side the usual questions, how she was, how much she’d had to eat, making sure she’d brushed her teeth ect
>then she said goodbye to Abigail and started to talking to one of her parents, getting into an admittedly funny argument about how much candy the kid should be allowed to have
>then the tracks started whining, subtly announcing the train was soon to arrive
>you motioned for Ursa to finish up the call just as the train came into view
>however as it stopped she was still talking
>”just, find us some seats” she said covering the mouth piece
>boarding the train it was pretty busy, luckily there were a pair of seats opposite each other free across the car
>you sat in one praying Ursa hadn’t used the call as an excuse to ditch you or something
>suddenly a bag was thrown into the empty seat opposite you
>a cat anthro tried sitting in it before you tried stopping him
>”Uh hey that seats occupied, sorry”
>he looked at you, raised an eyebrow and scoffed
>”I don’t see anyone in it”
>oh good one of those types
>”she hasn’t sat down yet, find another seat” you told him
>”Listen, I can sit where I damn well please, ya goddamn human!” The cat spat raising his voice
>*Thump* a hand grabbed your shoulder from behind
>”Is there a problem here sir?” Ursa said coldly in the same voice she had spoken to Michelle in
>”Yeah, this asshole thinks he owns the seat” the cat hissed, leaning back over and poking your chest
>that quickly proved to be a bad idea as Ursa grabbed the mans hand, squeezing it, causing him to reel in pain
>”I’m going to let go if your hand, when I do you best leave us alone or so help me I’ll show you what 975 psi can do to someone’s arm”
>she let go of his arm and he grabbed his bag, scurrying off
>you just sat with your jaw on the table as Ursa sat down
>she noticed your expression and said
>”I-I overdid it again didn’t I?”
>You picked up your jaw and said
>”Not at all and to be honest I found it kinda hot”
>you whispered the last part
>the rest of the journey was uneventful and you exited the train at the next town
>walking towards the theatre Ursa took your hand again, holding you a little closer this time
>you walked into the theatre building, smelling popcorn and other snacks aromas immediately
>now all you had to do was pick a movie

>You sit at the edge of king-sized bed, eyes fixed on the snow-capped forests outside,
>A flurry of snow beats on the brass-lined, stained glass window before you. The blur of gray conceals the never ending canopy of evergreens.
>A golden chandelier hanging from the sloped ceiling above gently swings back and forth with the beating of the howling wind outside.
>The swinging disrupts the thin film of dust on the dimly lit bulbs.
>You sniffle.
>Despite the fine, rich mahogany bed, and accompanying dresser, the guest room was barren otherwise.
>Your open suitcase was at the foot of the bed, your clean clothes freshly packed and ready to go.
>A flat-pack desk is set up in the corner of the guest room, its cheap but practical construction serving as the resting place for your closed laptop.
>You freeze.
>Hot breath tickles your neck.
>”Gotcha.”
>A furry arm locks around your neck, and you’re flipped over onto your back.
“Erma!” You gasp as you tumble to the bed.
>Your assailant snarls indistinctly at your call. “Silence, prey!”
>A seven foot wolf woman in a coat of dark black fur looms over you. She has both of your wrists wrapped up in one of her paws, and held above your head.
>You try and move your legs, but she has your knees pinned to the bed with her thighs.
>Her toothy muzzle is just a few inches from your face, bathing you in her heavy breaths.
>The pupils at the center of her red eyes dilate as she focuses on your own.
“Damn it!” You sigh, frustrated. “If you didn’t sneak up on me, there’s no way you would’ve gotten me in that headlock.”
>”Oh really?” She chuckles. There’s an animalistic, discordant edge coloring her deep feminine tenor. “I don’t think you’ve ever gotten out of one of my headlocks. Some things never change.”
>You try to turn away from her breaths, but she seizes your face in her other paw. The well-defined muscles of her forearm tense beneath her thick coat of fur to hold you in place.
>You wriggle against her.
“Erma M. House-” Your laughter fades. “-get off of me.”
>”When you say my name like that, you sound like my mother.” A wicked grin graces the wolf’s long snout. “’Erma M. House, come here at this instant!’” She lowers her voice in a feral mockery of her mother as she rocks on top of your body.
>Her mother did have a temper, but you rarely saw it.
>“Erma,” you repeat, your voice flat.
>”Ugh.” She rolls off of you with a groan. “Fuck, really?
“If you were my fiance, would you like another woman on top of me?”
>”Ew.” She grimaces, exposing her sharp canines. “The idea of your actual fiance on top of you is gross enough.”
>You blink, and the both of you fall silent.
>She stands from your bed. Tufts of her fur poke out through the carefully placed holes on the knees of her designer blue jeans. A red and black flannel over her top restrains her large bust.
>You turn to look at the blizzard outside the window.
“I’m going to miss my flight, aren’t I?” you sigh.
>”In this weather? You wouldn’t make it to the closest Seven-Eleven, let alone the airport.” Erma folds her arms over her large bust. Her voice quiets. “Nothing lost, if you ask me.”
“I need to go.”
>”For yourself, or your family?”
“You know how things are for people like us.” You’re resigned. “Sometimes we just don’t get a choice.”
>”Don’t give me that bullshit.” She points a claw at you. “You’re being used by your speciest Mom! She can’t be happy unless every scumbag in Washington and every Fortune 500 CEO knows her name, so she did whatever she could to weasel herself into another family name once she couldn’t use your father’s anymore.”
>You take a deep breath, bunching up the comforter of the bed in your hands.
“My mother loved my father, and not just for his money,” you offer in her defense. You sound uncertain, even to yourself. “She’s been through a lot.”
>”Yeah, well, you lost your father too. Nothing justifies marrying your own son to some useless, old-money whore he doesn’t love.” Erma taps a footpaw against the ground, her red eyes glistening in the light of the chandelier overhead. “I hate this.”
“I’ll inherit twelve percent of the Kozlova fortune. Do you understand what that means, Erma?” Your mouth is agape. “I’ll be able to build up my father’s company again! My children, and their children, and their children will grow up with more money than they could ever spend!”
>”Yeah, and they’ll grow up with a demonic, baby-eating Kozlova for a mother. It’s a lot of money, so what?” Erma brushes it off casually. “I’m worth over five hundred million. You’re really okay with being sold off?”
“You’re not going to change my mind.” You stand from the bed, and walk past her. You snatch a button-up shirt hanging out of your suitcase, and throw it over your shoulders as you walk through the open door of the guest room.
>Your wolf friend scrambles up to your speed. She walks at your side. “Why are you in such a rush?”
>The two of you progress down one of the many halls of the House Family Manor. Gray light is cast through the massive window at your back and onto the red carpet at your feet. The polished wood-panel walls are adorned with valuable paintings and dozens of heads of deer and other game.
>Some had been killed by her mother, but many had been killed by Erma.
”I’m glad we could have this week together before I left, Erma, but I can’t stay a kid forever.” your pace quickens. Your footsteps echo down the halls. “I need to go.”
>”In this weather?” Erma is incredulous. “I know that you have a four-wheeler, but aren’t you going to grab your luggage? At the very least come eat breakfast with me first.”
”I want to get my car started, then I’ll grab my stuff.” You look at the platinum-plated sapphire watch on your wrist. Each dial of the chronograph was made with a different precious metal. It was the last remnant of your father. “I still have five hours. It’ll take me two to get to the airport in this weather and another two to get through the TSA, so-”
>”You have an extra hour with me.” Erma smiles again, and it puts you at ease. You wish you could always see her light up like that. “Please, just let me make you breakfast.” The edge to her voice peaks as she tries to conceal her desperation.
>The two of you follow the hall to a long balcony that runs across the open foyer at the front of the manor. In the center of the second-story walkway is a set of steps down to the first floor. The space has half a dozen crystal chandeliers and two fireplaces crackling on either side. Their chimneys howl with each gust of wind outside.
>You stop, and lean up against the banister.
“Okay,” You sigh. “But then I leave, alright? Not a minute later.”
>Erma stops beneath an oil painting hung right above the staircase. The larger-than life canvas depicts a steely-eyed, middle-aged human man sitting in a velvet seat before a larger wolf woman. Her eyes are soft, and her fur coat has turned a silvery gray. Between them is a much younger wolf girl who couldn’t have been older than thirteen.
>You can barely remember the time before this painting was here.
>”Not a minute later,” Erma echoes with a nod.
>She smiles to match the expression of the elder wolf depicted behind her, but unlike her mother, she bears the points of her vicious teeth.
>The kitchen of the House Family Manor is something to behold
>The style of the low-ceiling room is rustic with brick walls and tiled floors, but all the appliances are sleek and modern.
>There are three industrial-sized refrigerators complete with a walk-in freezer. There must be at least a dozen ovens and stoves. All of them are properly ventilated, have their own sinks, and look as spotless as the day they were installed.
>”You know how many chefs usually staff this place?” Erma’s tail wags behind her as she steps up to the closest refrigerator.
>You follow close behind.
“Doesn’t Gordon Ramsay host his shows here?”
>Erma’s expression flattens, and she whips at your thigh with her fluffy black tail. “Very funny.” She puts her claws on the stainless steel handle to the matching fridge door. “You know, my dad almost hired him in the nineties as our head chef.”
>You snort.
“Bullshit.”
>”Swear on my mother’s tail.”
>You blink.
“That’s basically code for, ‘I’m Erma, and I’m lying’.”
>Erma swings the fridge door open from the brick wall its built into. “Shut up, humie-” The sterile white light from inside casts a shadow across her black-furred muzzle. “-And go take a seat.”
“You did not just call me that. We agreed that was off limits.” You smile despite your feigned anger. ”Do you want me to help, Erma?”
>She shoos you off with a claw, reaching in to grab a carton of eggs, a sealed pack of thick-cut bacon, and a stick of butter.
>“No, I said I would make breakfast for you.” She points to the closest table, right in front of a nearby stove-top. “Sit,” she commands curtly.
>You groan.
“Erma, you know I don’t like other people doing things for-”
>”Your father and that pesky self-reliance he taught you. Suck it up humie, this last hour with you is mine.” She puts the package of bacon on top of the egg carton with the butter, and kicks the door to the fridge shut with her footpaw.
>A gust of cold air from the industrial fridge chills you.
“Fair enough.”
>You walk to the polished steel table and sit on a padded stool facing the nearby stovetop and grill.
>”Nice spot, now I can watch that cute face while I cook.” Erma winks and sets her ingredients down on the non-cook surface beside the stove.
>You frown.
>Erma digs out the proper equipment for the job. She sets a pot on the stove, and clicks the burner on with the light hiss of natural gas.
“Erma, I’m sorry I shut you down earlier.” You lean against the cold metal table. “I know I haven’t been open about all of this the past few days.”
>”You haven’t.” Erma doesn’t look up from her work. She sticks the sealed pack of bacon with one of her fangs, and tears open the package like it was a carcass for her to feast on. “I just want what’s best for you.” She avoids your gaze as she clicks on the adjacent grill.
”I know, Erma, but-”
>She interrupts you, pulling a wood-handled knife from a nearby box-set. ”It’s nothing new. You’ve been this way for two years now.” Erma’s hands are unsteady as she slices off a chunk of butter from the stick. “You stopped talking to me. You stopped smiling.” Her voice wavers. Her black nose wrinkles at the end of her snout.
>Your lips part, but no words come.
>”Your Mom was too busy showing you off to every wealthy heiress East of the Mississippi to notice-” Erma shakes the chunk of butter off of the knife and into the pan beneath. The butter sizzles. “-but I noticed.”
“I lost everything-”
>”And I lost you,” Erma snaps, sliding the knife back into the wooden block it came from. “You were my best friend. My only friend! Everyone else-” She points toward the wall. “-they’re snakes and liars and thieves! But you dared to stay by my side despite your Mom’s disdain for me. Then your father passes, and suddenly, you do exactly what that speciest bitch wants. You let her give you away!”
>The stool creaks under you
“What can I do to make it right?”
>”You want to make it right?” Erma lays bacon strips out on the flat surface of the grill adjacent the stove-top. “Don’t go.” The pale pork sizzles on contact.
>”Shit!” Erma clenches her teeth as she accidentally folds a strip over itself. She picks up the strip in her sharp claws to lay it out flat.
>Soon, she empties the whole package onto the grill and the crackle of cooking bacon drowns out the faint howling of the wind outside.
“I’m all my mom has left, you know?”
>”What did she ever do for you beyond birthing you?” Erna cracks an egg with the side of her hard claws, and pours out the contents into the pan on the stove. She repeats this eight times, tossing the discarded shells into a nearby trashcan with perfect accuracy each time. “I showed you more affection than your mom ever did growing up. Now she’s using you just like she used your Dad.”
“My father would want me to take care of her.”
>”You know what your father actually wanted? It was the same thing my parents wanted.”
>You swallow and nod.
>”You and your Mom could’ve been provided for with my inheritance, but no, she shot that down.” Erma makes no effort to hide her resentment. She looks down to whisk the eggs in the pot with an eggbeater, biting her thin black lip. “She shot us down,” she grunts with exertion.
“I’m sorry we missed our chance.”
>Erma’s red eyes narrow. The canine whisks the eggs in the pot relentlessly. She throws in pinches of salt and pepper from two ceramic dishes on the non-cook surface with her other paw.
>”I guess we did miss our chance, huh?” Her words are that of acceptance, yet her tone is venomous. She speaks through grit teeth. “I underestimated your mother’s hold over you.”
“What does that mean?”
>”She hurt you endlessly, yet you’re sacrificing everything for her.” She growls, barely restraining her anger.
”I resent that, Erma. I made it clear that I’m doing this for myself too.” You shake your head. “More importantly, she’s family.”
>Erma takes the whisk out of the pot and throws it at you.
>It whips by your face, leaving a drop of egg yolk on your cheek before clanging into the sink behind you.
>“I’m your family!”
>You flinch away, your mouth agape.
>Her red eyes are wild for a moment, before they soften. “I’m sorry. I would never hurt you.” She trembles.
>After collecting herself, Erma takes a spatula hanging from above to flip the bacon over three strips at a time.
>You inhale deeply, wiping the drop of egg yolk from your cheek with a finger.
“I know. You wouldn’t hurt me.” You exhale. “The truth is that I don’t know how I could do anything else in my situation.”
>You grip at your neatly combed hair and prop yourself up on the stainless steel table by your elbows.
>She rakes at the steaming scrambled eggs with a spatula as the other side of the bacon cooks.
>”Why not?” she asks.
>It’s a sincere question.
>A good question.
“Near the end, when things were really bad.” You look up from the table. “I visited my father in a roadside motel twenty miles away from our home.”
>”He stayed in a motel?” Erma’s ears twitch, perking up. She continues to flip the yellow mass of eggs over in the pot.
“It’s all he thought he deserved.”
>She purses her lips. “I see.”
“He was staying under the room where some cat prostitute was working, so every thirty minutes without fail, we’d hear squeaking through the ceiling above us.” You point up at the pristine ducts and panels of the kitchen. “The radiator didn’t work so it was freezing cold, and the whole place smelt like it had been flooded ten years ago. My Dad was so drunk, though, that I don’t even think he cared.” You raise a finger to your mouth, biting your knuckle.
>”I’m sorry. That’s hard.”
>You put up a hand.
“No, no. It’s fine.” You focus on the memory. “We were laughing together, and then he looked at me. He had this-” you pause, looking for the words. “-clarity in his eyes. It was like a single instant of sobriety.”
>Erma takes the pot and dumps the eggs out onto two clean white plates with a spatula. She glances between you and her work, the wolf’s red eyes urging you onward.
“Then he took my hand in his cold and bony fingers.” You rub at your forehead with a palm. “And he told me the only thing that kept him going each day was a specific memory.”
>Erma turns off the grill, the crackling bacon grease calming. She scoops up fifteen strips of greasy bacon onto her plate with the spatula, and about half that amount onto yours.
“When I was just a boy and my father was first building his business, every night at nine o’clock he would stop working and crack the door to his study. He would listen to my mother sing me to sleep down the hall.” You turn on the stool, and stare at the featureless brick wall to your left. “He woke up everyday, and continued to exist on the hope that he might have a perfect moment like that again.”
>Out of sight, Erma rummages around through drawers and the fridge.
“He loved my mother. He loved me.” You bow your head. “I had to do whatever I could to preserve the family— to preserve what he loved.”
>Erma slides the ceramic plate across the stainless steel table and back in front of you.
>You turn to the generous helping of food before you.
>A zig-zag of ketchup is spread over top the yellow mass of scrambled eggs beside a pile of crispy bacon. You smile.
>”Just how you like it.” Erma returns your expression. The wolfess walks around the stove to sit beside you at the table. Her large rear strains her jeans and seems too big for the other stool at first, yet she balances on it effortlessly. She sets down two forks and two glasses of orange juice with one paw, and her own plate of food with the other.
>She looks at the glasses of orange juice, passing one of them to you.
“I know we don’t see eye to eye on my future, but thank you for this Erma. This is nice.”
>Erma’s grin brightens at your thanks. She finally sounds calm. “It was my pleasure.” She wraps an arm around your shoulder, gripping at you as she sticks two strips of bacon into her maw with her other paw. “Sorry I didn’t say much. Hell, it sounded like you just needed someone to listen.” Erma makes quick work of it.
“I did. Thanks.”
>You scoop up some steaming, ketchup-drizzled eggs with your fork, and stick them into your mouth.
>They’re salted to perfection. Her furious whisking has done wonders.
“Damn,” you mumble with a full mouth. “These are good.”
>She shrugs. ”Who says all of my parents’ money went to waste on me?” The black fur of her arm around your neck tickles your skin. She gulps down another handful of bacon without much chewing.
>You chortle lightly.
>You were going to live on the other side of the world as your best friend. You set down your fork, and drink half of the glass of orange juice.
“I’m sorry Erma. I’m sure we’ll find some way to talk when I’m not around here anymore. I-”
>”It’s alright.” The wolf woman squeezes your shoulder and continues to eat with one paw. “Just finish your food and your juice. Don’t want to travel on an empty stomach, right?”
>You nod.
“Right.”
>You focus on eating, cleaning the eggs off your plate.
>There’s a calmness in the two of you now. Occasionally, you’d hear the wind outside blow against the manor as Erma gulped down her eggs.
>”While I was listening to you, I thought about every second I ever spent with you.” Erma swallows the last bit of egg on her plate. “-and I realized how deeply you have been hurt. When I lost my father, he passed surrounded by loved ones at the end of a fulfilling life. Your father was annihilated by addiction.” She dumps her orange juice down her gullet and wipes the spillage from the fur of her snout with her sleeve. “You watched a great man disintegrate through his own faults.”
>You chew on a piece of crispy bacon. Erma’s arm feels like it’s getting heavier on your shoulder.
>”Did your mother even help you? No. You lost your father and the one other person who should love you unconditionally decided to use you.” Erma’s maw contorted in silent contempt. “I’m sure she drove your Dad to alcohol in the first place.”
“No, Erma. We don’t know that.”
>”I do.” Her paw clenches around your shirt collar. “She never loved you or your father like she should’ve. A human man needs tender care that she could not give, and look at what it’s done. You’re letting her sell you off just to gain the slightest inkling of her approval. I didn’t know if my plan was justified before, but I definitely do now.”
“What are you talking about?”
>Your lips tingle. You drop the next piece of bacon back onto the plate involuntarily.
“Wha-” your mouth goes numb before you can finish the thought. “What?”
>Your body goes limp, and the arm wrapped around you tenses.
>Erma pulls you against her plush side to prevent you from falling off the stool. “Sh…” She strokes your cheek with her leathery paw pads. “I dosed you according to your body weight. You’re going to be okay.”
>Your voice catches in your throat. Your head spins.
“I-I don’t understand.” You wheeze.
>”You will, baby.”
>The tips of your fingers go numb. Your whole body is heavy.
>The buzzing of the fans in kitchen of the House Family Manor never stops.
>Your best friend has drugged you.
>You try and lean away from Erma with a pained whine, but the wolfess holds you fast to her side.
>”Everything’s okay. I’m not going to hurt you, love.” She leans down to kiss your cheek with her snout. “I had to do this.”
“W-why?” you manage.
>Your eyes follow the uniform grid of mortar holding the dark-red brick wall of the kitchen together.
>”I’d never let that speciest sell you to some old-money vampire.” Erma’s voice is stern. “You think a Kozlova could show your children affection? Think she could show you affection? No. Did you know that addictive behaviors are genetic? I’m not letting the cycle repeat.”
>Pressed up against Erma’s side with a paw on the side of your face, you’re forced to smell her. The fresh detergent-smell of her shirt mingles with the musky smell of her fur coat beneath.
>Erma takes a bacon strip from your plate, and holds it up to your lips. “Eat.”
>Pressing your lips shut is the only resistance you can show.
>”I’m not going to ask again.”
>You whine, moisture pooling in your eyes.
“This… isn’t r-right.”
>”It is right!” Erma is quick to anger. “Now eat.” Her grip on the side of your head tightens. Her claws poke at your skin.
>You acquiesce, and open your mouth.
>”Good boy.” She rumbles with satisfaction and loosens her grip.
>You try and chew, but even that takes effort.
>”Just take your time. You should be able to swallow still.” Erma assists your chewing by placing her claws beneath your jaw.
>”When I look at you, all I can see is a hurt little boy; a beautiful flower that's wilted without proper nourishment.” Once she’s fed you the bacon, she moves the paw to the top of your head and pets you in long strokes. “Remember when we’d chase each other around this place?”
>Moisture pools in your eyes.
>”I’d always get you, my little prey.” She harrumphs, and ruffles your hair. “Even though we were kids, I felt how much you needed me. When I pinned you to the floor or put you in a headlock, you’d smile. In my paws, you’d finally relax.”
>She pushes your glass of orange juice across the stainless steel table and away from you. She takes her own half-finished glass.
>You shake in her grasp. Your mouth is so dry.
>”Drink, my human.” She tilts your head back as she raises her orange juice to your lips.
>Looking upward, you can see Erma’s dark muzzle. Her ruby-red eyes watch you like a hawk as you drink.
>”So obedient.” A grin plays at her dark lips. “All you want is to be held by someone who loves you, and no one can hold you like I do.”
>Once you finish the juice, she sets the glass back down and wipes your upper lip with the sleeve of her flannel.
>Erma uses her hold on you to face your head towards her.
>”I love you.” She brings her muzzle into your face and presses it into your lips.
>Your eyes widen at the kiss.
>Her spade-like tongue pushes your mouth open.
>You whimper into her as her claws tighten around the back of your head. Your part your lips to allow her slimy organ entrance.
>Erma grunts and growls, the guttural noises shaking you as she laps at the inside of your mouth.
>”Mine-” she smacks her lips. “-my human.” Her tongue spreading her faintly salty flavor to the back of your throat.
>The plentiful saliva from her tongue fills your mouth and forces you to swallow.
>Erma finally withdraws, her five-inch tongue hanging from her gaping, toothy maw.
“Don’t do this…” you trail off, dazed. “Erma.”
>With just a single sentence, you’re out of breath.
>She crooks her snout.
“Erma.”
>”No one else on Earth could love you like I can, and you know it.” The wolf smiles, baring her sharp rows of teeth. “One good squeeze, and you’re that boy again. I knew his pain; I know your pain.”
>You breathe heavily, your eyes lidded. Your lips are smeared with your combined saliva.
“What are you-”
>”I’m going to break you.” Erma runs a single claw along your red cheek, wiping away a tear. “And then I’m going to put you back together as my perfect human; my perfect husband.”
>Erma stands from her own stool, rising to her full seven-foot height. She keeps a paw around you to ensure you don’t fall.
>She lowers her other arm under your knees, and lifts you into a bridal carry. She cradles your head against her breasts beneath her red and black flannel.
>Erma starts out of the kitchen.
>“Then you’ll never want to leave.”
>Your body sways back and forth with each of Erma’s steps as she carries you through her family’s manor.
>The layer of plush fur and fat above the wolfess’ hard muscle warms you and envelops you.
>”That’s it, just hold onto me.” She beams down at you, and cradles you closer to her chest. “Good boy.”
>You have been holding tightly to the tufts of black fur around her collar bone without even realizing it.
>The top button of her red flannel is undone, forming a v-neck into the center of her furred cleavage.
“Don’t do this.” Your weak hands grip to her soft natural coat. “Erma, please.”
>The lights of the crystal chandeliers in the foyer fill your vision. The moisture in your eyes has you seeing double.
>The wind of the blizzard outside howls at the sealed entrance to her family manor.
>”This is what we always wanted.” Erma starts up the stairs leading to the second floor. “We had each other’s first kiss.” She glances down at you. “We were engaged until your Mom called it off.”
“The hunting trip…” you add.
>You were only sixteen. She had just turned seventeen. Images of Erma pushing you into her room and ripping off your shirt.
>The events of that day had gotten you worked up.
>Erma’s sharply defined cheeks flush red beneath the black fuzz.
>”I saved you from that bear, and now I’m saving you from this.” The paw resting on your head strokes your hair as you reach the top of the stairs. “It’s my duty.”
>You remember that day clearly.
>The crack of a shot in the forest. A feral brown bear, ready to swipe at you with its claws, collapsing to the ground.
>The fall of the creature revealed Erma standing a hundred feet behind, her smoking Remington raised into the nook of her shoulder.
>Erma had dashed to you, her digitigrade legs burying her bare paws into the mud of the forest. Anthro wolves preferred wearing no shoes for a hunt.
>She took your hand in her paw before pulling you up from the dirt and against her.
>”Even though you decided against it in the end, I know what you truly desired.” The two of you pass under the massive oil painting of her family. The visage of her parents look down at you two with subtle satisfaction. “You saw that I would do anything to protect you, and it made your heart ache for me.”
“I loved you.” You groan, turning toward her chest to avoid her eyes. “More than anything. You were…” You breathe deeply. This drug has exhausted you totally. “…the greatest thing in my life.”
>Erma comes to a corner in the wood-panel walls and starts down the adjoining hall. You pass by three rectangular stained glass windows on the wall displaying the drab white-out of the snowfall outside.
>You were getting close to her room and the master bedroom.
>”’Loved’?” Erma bristles at the word.
“You drugged me.”
>”You wouldn’t see reason!” She interrupts you. “No, you still love me, just like you always have, and I still love you. You don’t need to worry about saving yourself for marriage anymore, because we’re married now.”
>You whimper.
>”Now we’re going to do what we should’ve done a decade ago.”
“Erma.” You stare up at the underside of her muzzle. “Don’t rape me.”
>Was this happening?
>It couldn’t be.
>Yet it was.
“Please,” your voice is barely a whisper.
>She stiffens, her muscled arms tightening around you.
>”I’m sorry.” There’s a moment’s uncertainty in her ruby eyes. “To be a happy husband, you must first be broken.”
>The two of you come to a set of double doors at the end of the hall.
>”Just know that everything I do, I do out of love for you.”
>Erma takes the carved brass handle in her claws, and pulls open the heavy mahogany door just enough to get inside.
“If you love me, you won’t do this. There’s still time to get to the air-”
>”No.” Her response is instantaneous. She shuts it behind her. “I’ll never give you up to anyone; not to a human whore, and especially not for your speciest mother,” she promises with resolve.
>You let go of the tufts of soft fur at her collarbone. Above her muzzle is a domed ceiling with white clouds and a blue sky painted across the stucco. A crystal chandelier much like the ones in the foyer hangs over a lavish bed. Drapes hang from either side of the bed frame, concealing the massive thing behind a veil of white.
>She comes to the bed, and pulls the drape to the side. “You’ll enjoy it, I promise.”
>Erma takes you and gently sets you down on the plush foot of the bed. “You should be gaining more control over your muscles soon. I just wanted you weak enough to not hurt yourself by resistance.”
>You have enough strength to sit up, but Erma steadies you by your shoulders just in case.
>”How are you feeling, angel?” Her concern is sincere.
“Fine,” you mumble. “Betrayed.”
>She seems undisturbed by your jab. “You’ll see the truth.”
“The truth?”
>Erma steps away from the bed, and to a nearby dresser. Multiple jewelery cases with necklaces and rings rest atop the polished furniture.
>”When we got home from that hunting trip, we were so close to finally doing it.” She opens the top of one of the cases. She glances over her shoulder. “When you ran out of my room, it crushed me.”
>She closes that case and moves to the next. “I talked to my mom after, and she told me that human men were prone to get nervous around us. It was a primal instinct, and to overcome it, a human needed to be taken quickly.”
>Erma pulls something from the case, and walks back over to you.
>You crane your neck back.
>In her claws is a leather collar and a golden bracelet. “She said my father was the same way when they first met.” The collar is embroidered with golden thread spelling her name, “Erma House”. The bracelet is engraved with yours.
>”She finally decided to take him, and after one night, he was hers.” The platinum buckle is encrusted with flawless diamonds, sparkling in the light of the chandelier overhead.
>”I never understood the custom of rings among humans. The collar is a proper symbol of loving ownership.” She purses her thin black lips. “Just shows how unfit females of your species are to take care of you.”
>You reflexively lean away as she bends over to bring the open collar to your neck.
>”Hey, hey. It’s alright,” she whispers, tightening the soft leather around your neck.
>She tightens it enough to squeeze at you, but not choke you. “How’s that? Not too tight?”
“Alright.” You don’t know what to say.
>Erma holds up a paw for you to see, and snaps the bracelet engraved with your name around her fuzzy wrists.
>”Now we’re married,” she says. “We’ll worry about the paperwork when you’re properly broken in.” There’s a hunger in her eyes.
“No, Erm-”
>She places her paws on either side of you and lifts you up into the air. She brings your crotch near her face, resting your legs over both of her shoulders.
>You to her fuzzy head for support, balancing on her shoulders with the help of a paw on the small of your back.
>”No more waiting.” She glares up at you. “I need to taste my prize.”
>She unbuckles your pants, and slides them off of your thighs. She then lifts you over her head to remove them from you entirely.
>Your underwear comes next.
>You fluster, your excitement bobbing an inch away from the tip of her muzzle.
>Her hot breath washes over your sex, making you twitch.
>”It’s perfect.” Erma runs her wet nose along the bottom of your shaft and straight to the base. She inhales sharply.
>“You smell so pent up, angel.” Erma shudders, her face buried in your crotch. She puts one paw at your back, and the other wraps around your left thigh. “Let’s take care of that.”
>She sticks her spade-like tongue from her open maw. Slowly, and excruciatingly, she trails the soft wetness up the shaft and to the tip.
>Your breath catches in your throat, your hands clenching to the longer fur on the top of her head.
>Erma chuckles as she curls her tongue around your tip. “You’re going to be a good boy and cum for me, right?”
>Your response is a grimace.
“I don’t know,” you whine.
>”You will.”
>Her lips seal around your tip, forcing a hiss from you.
>She pushes you in by the small of your back until you’re totally buried in her muzzle.
“Ah!” You shiver. “Damn-”
>She chortles around your cock. The tip hits the soft tissue at the back of her mouth.
>You’re wrapped in contracting, warm flesh.
>She moves her muzzle forward and back, her tongue curling around your sensitive member.
>You rake your stubby nails along her scalp.
>Your wolf wife stares up at you as she takes you in and out of her.
>A few slurps, and you’ve become putty in her hands.
>She pulls herself off of you, leaving your saliva-drenched cock cold in the air of the master bedroom.
>”You like my mouth, angel?” She runs her tongue along her black lips, cleaning them. “Tell me how much you love it.”
“Ah- uh.” You wipe the sweat from your brow. “It feels good,” you admit.
>You blink. Your head is spinning from a mixture of the pleasure and the drugs.
>”Now give me what’s mine, humie.” The wolf growls, baring her teeth. “That sweet seed belongs to me. You’ll put it wherever I want it.”
>You nod, breathless.
>What’s happening to you?
“Yes, m-” the word dies on your lips.
>”What’s that?” Her eyes widen. “It’s okay, you can call me whatever you want, angel.”
>You hesitate.
>Erma’s unconditional affection makes your heart throb.
>It makes your thighs shake, and your member twitch right in her face.
>Even the soft tone of her discordant, animalistic tenor makes you weak.
“Yes, mommy.”
>”That’s right, mommy’s here. I’m the only one who can make you feel this way, right?” Erma coos, extending her tongue to lap a streak of pre from the tip of your member.
>The paw on your back moves upward and under your shirt. “You’ll wear the clothes I give you, not this mixed-fabric trash. Only the finest will do.” With her claws, she slices the button-up shirt right from you. “Now, tell your mommy what you want, angel.”
>Maybe the drugs are making you susceptible.
>The towering wolfess holds you in place, breathing over your cock.
”Please, just keep going!” You bite your lower lip, and rub your thighs into the fur of her neck. “I was so close,” you whine.
>”’Keep going’, what?” Her motherly voice comes through a satisfied smirk.
“Keep going, mommy,” you blush deep red. Your face burns.
>”Good boy. I’m going to change the position a bit, okay?” She rubs at the soft skin of your back with hear leathery paw pads. “Be brave for mommy. She’s not going to drop you.”
“What do you-”
>She lifts your thighs from her shoulders and holds your whole body sideways before her.
>You gasp. “Ah! Erma!”
>She curls your body around her head like a scarf. Both of your legs drape over one of her shoulders, and your head rests on the other. You crotch is right in the center, your member right on her fuzzy muzzle.
>”Now I can take you as fast as I want, angel. Just hold onto me.” One of her arms wraps around your abdomen, and the other around both of your thighs.
“Erma, I don’t know if this-” You moan as her tongue curves along to bottom of your cock.
>She pulls all the way back to your tip, before using her grip on you to piston you to the back of her muzzle in a single stroke.
“Fuck!” The noise that escapes your parted lips is less masculine than you would like.
>Erma pulls you out and then back in, rattling your whole body with the thrust. Instead of moving her mouth, she’s moving your whole body, using you like a toy.
>She has no trouble taking your cock to the base.
>Her hot, wet mouth exceeds what a human woman could ever manage.
>The sensation makes you writhe in her grasp.
>Moving your legs, you realized you’ve gained control of them again.
>As soon as she puts you down, you could run away.
>You love this more than you’d like to admit, but it’s still not right.
>Right?
>She pulls you from her, and licks your combined fluids from her lips. “I have an idea.”
“What’s that?”
>The edges of her maw curve upward in a wicked grin. “No reason mommy can’t feel good too, right?”
>Before you can respond, she lifts you by your ankles and leaves you dangling upside down in the air.
“What the hell?”
>”Don’t worry, angel, I won’t drop you.” She lowers you until your face is in front of her crotch, and hooks your legs over her shoulders.
>Blood rushes to your head, but her firm and reassuring grasp makes the position more comfortable than you expected.
>The wolfess undoes the button of her own designer jeans, and tugs the denim down along with her soaked panties.
>Erma steps out of pile of fabric at her foot paws, and kicks her discarded clothes to the side.
>Her thickly muscled thighs draw your vision to the dark lips of her moist sex right between them.
>The tufts of fur around her lips are matted with her liquids.
>A paw clenches around the back of your head. “Lick.”
>It’s not a request.
>As she brings your face in, you open your mouth.
>You run your tongue along the rubbery folds as she presses your face deeper between her thighs.
>”Good fucking boy.” She sticks your member back into her muzzle.
>You moan into her sex as her tongue curls around your cock above you.
>Erma rumbles happily, the vibration shaking the two of you.
>You build your pace in tandem.
>Your obedient lapping accompanies the brain-melting sucking far above your head.
>Erma gurgles as she holds you in her throat.
>Drool drips from the edges of her maw and splatters against your chin and the red carpet beneath.
>Erma snarls around your cock, sliding you in and out her muzzle.
>Each time she comes to the base, she runs her canine tongue along your balls.
>You find the nub nestled in her black folds and flick at it with your tongue.
>Her musky flavor fills your mouth, and your nostrils. She tastes like raw and chaotic feminine power.
>This predator is carrying you like you weight nothing.
>Your childhood friend is using you how she wants.
>Her sucking grows more fervent.
>Your face is sticking to the fur of her crotch with her juices, drops trailing up your upside-down face toward your forehead and dripping onto the floor.
>”Hmm!” you clench your eyes shut as her folds tighten around your tongue.
>Erma hisses around your cock in satisfaction as she fills your mouth with her musky lupine emissions.
>You manage to swallow her with much difficulty.
>Her tongue curls around your cock, and she pulls you from the back of her throat to accept your load.
>”Ah!” you gasp as she splatters your face and the ground beneath at the next twitch of her sex. Her fuzzy thighs tighten around your head and ears, muffling the outside world.
>She seals her lips around the head of your cock as you climax into her mouth.
>The seven-foot wolf woman nurses at your head with her black lips, coaxing each hot rope from your member with her swirling tongue.
>Your ankles clench around her head as you writhe, dangling mid-air.
>The next squirt from her dark lips blasts your cheek, filling your nostrils with her suffocating smell.
>Erma swallows you diligently, lumps trailing visibly down her tensing throat.
>She pulls you from her lips with a slick pop. She’s as breathless as you. “Thanks for the meal.”
>“What, too cheesy?” Erma looks down her body at you, her red eyes meeting your own. “You look fantastic. All human boys should have a collar around their neck and cum on their face.”
>The wolfess lifts your legs from her shoulders and turns you upright.
>Your face and your hair is dripping with her.
>She holds you up to analyze you with her ruby eyes. “Aw, was mommy too hard on you? I’m sorry, angel.”
>Erma slings you over her shoulder and lumbers toward the bed.
>The wolfess unbuttons her flannel. She makes quick work of her black bra underneath, and lets them both fall to the floor to leave her chest bare.
>She gingerly lays you down on the massive bed and curls up beside you. Both of her fuzzy breasts, large enough to give any human woman back problems, flatten over each other.
>”We can take a short rest before I break you, angel. Want mommy to clean you up?”
>You eye her erect nipples, one shade darker than her already black fur. They’re mere inches from your face.
“Yes, please.”
>Erma leans in to sniff you, combing her claws through your juice-splattered hair. “Fuck, yes, you smell just like me. Every bitch in sniffing-distance will know that you’re wolf-cunt only.” Erma brushes the stray strands of messy hair from your eyes, and styles it neat with her claws. “Are you okay, angel?”
“I’m alright,” you say, absentminded. You eye the double doors of the lavish master bedroom out of the corner of your eye.
>You could run for it right now.
>At least, you could try.
>Erma wipes her forearm along your face, soaking up her juices in place of the lighter musk of her fur.
>Do you want to leave?
>Erma brings her snout to your ear. “You won’t make it.” Her voice is low in warning, but there’s a hint of twisted amusement in her voice. “But you’re welcome to try. You know how much I love the hunt.” Her bushy tail whips behind her, slapping the velvet comforter of the bed.
>Your face goes pale. Your body tenses in her possessive grasp.
“Erma, I’m not going to-”
>”I’ll even give you a ten second head start.” She runs her tongue up the side of your exposed neck, and into your ear. She sucks the lobe onto her mouth, and nibbles at the skin. “It’ll end with you on the ground; buried deep inside of me, and screaming for more.”
>You lay in the plush velvet comforter of Erma’s bed.
>Erma’s grip on you loosens, the wolf’s fuzzy breasts resting against your side.
>”Come on. Do it. I left your keys on the kitchen counter.”
>You’re both eying the heavy mahogany doors of the master bedroom.
>The bed is so large that even the seven-foot Erna only lies about halfway down.
>A shadow is cast across your cheek by the ornate bed frame.
>Erma runs her paw down your bare chest. “If you make a run for it, and actually manage to make it to your car-” she sighs. “-I won’t come after you.”
”You promise, Erma?” You turn your head towards her.
>She’s onto you, might as well play her game.
>She bares her sharp teeth in a wry smile. She pats your abdomen. “I would never lie to you.”
>Your eyes narrow.
“It’s this or give in now, right?” Your half-flaccid member is still soaked with her wolf-drool.
>She’s silent for a moment.
>The wind of the blizzard outside howls.
>Erma nods. “If you don’t want to run, angel, there’s no shame in skipping to the fun part.” Her paw moves down your abdomen and towards your crotch.
>You intercept it with your hand, stopping its journey downward.
“Can I put my pants on first?”
>Erma’s eyes search yours. Her black lip trembles, but she makes sure to maintain her gentle smile. “Sure, but don’t start running until I tell you to. You get a ten second head start, no more, and no less.”
>You wriggle from her grasp, and she begrudgingly lets you go.
>You plant your bare feet on the carpeted ground.
>”Isn’t this exciting?” Her tone is wistful. “It’ll be like we’re kids again…”
>Wordless, you walk to the dark spot where your mixed fluids are soaked into the carpet.
>You take your underwear and pants and slip them up your legs to your waist. The crystal chandelier casts you in warm yellow light.
>You glance upward at the domed stucco ceiling which the chandelier is hanging from. The painting is simple, but clearly skilled. The clouds obstruct the sun midst an otherwise clear blue sky.
>”Ready?”
>You look to your wolfess friend and take a deep breath.
“Erma I-” you start, but don’t know how to continue. You want to say something that will make this okay. “I know why you did all this. I can appreciate your reasons, and I know that you love me.”
>Your hand turns the soft leather collar around your neck. You’re wearing her name, a name you’re still proud of somehow.
“I just hope that you can understand my reasons.” Your hand falls from your neck and to your side. “If I don’t see you again, just know that I do love you. I always have.”
>She crooks her snout. Moisture pools in her eyes as her gaze softens. “I’ve always understood.”
>”Thanks,” you reciprocate the smile.
>The black nose at the end of her furred muzzle wrinkles upward. Her eyes narrow and she sniffles as she steels herself again.
>Erma growls low and sits up on the bed, sliding towards the edge in preparation.
>”Go.” She mutters the command with a snap of her jaws.
”Erma, wait, I-”
>”Nine.”
“No!”
>Time to go.
>You scramble toward the double mahogany doors to your left, nearly falling over yourself and into the door.
>”Eight.”
>Glancing over your shoulder at the predator, you put your back into throwing one of the ten-foot doors open.
>You scramble up to speed in the hallway before you.
>“Seven!”
>To your left are the stained glass windows to the glowing, gray abyss of the white-out blizzard, and to your right are dozens of mounted heads of game.
>Erma had caught and killed many of those.
>The thud of the door to the master bedroom finally closing echoes down the hall.
>”Six!”
>The head of a bear and a bear-coat rug are right in the center of the hall.
“Five!” her voice grows more distant.
>Your arms swing at your side as you dash down the hall.
“Kitchen. Garage. Kitchen. Garage…” you repeat under your breath.
>”Four!”
>Veering ninety degrees to your right, you redirect yourself down an adjoining hall. Fighting to change your vector, you drift along the floor. Your inertia brings you right toward the wall.
You bounce off the dark wood with your shoulder, leaving a dull ache in your side.
>”Three!”
>Luckily the collision didn’t rob you of much momentum.
>“Two!”
>Just beyond, the hall leads to the balcony in the bright light of the foyer.
>The kitchen with your keys was on one side of the foyer, and the garage was on the opposite side.
>”One!”
>You’d have to cross back over, or make a whole loop around the circular floor plan of the manor.
>You push your already painful sprint just that much faster.
>Erma howls, the haunting, blood-curdling sound plenty loud despite the distance you’ve put between you and her.
>The hunt is on.
>You pass a few more guest rooms and the open library.
>As you reach the staircase and the oil-painting of her family above the foyer, you just spot a gray blur turning down the hall behind you.
>You dig your heels into the carpet to bring yourself to a halt. You eye the swooping curve of the polished wooden banister down the staircase in a moments indecision.
“Agh!”
>You grit your teeth and hop onto the banister butt-first.
>The polished wood screeches as you slide down it and you quickly getting up to speed.
“Shit! Shit! Shit!” You lean back with the curve of the banister outward, balancing yourself on the wooden rail.
>The air whips at your hair, still wet with Erma’s juices.
>Her voice echoes down the hall behind you. “A human is no match for a real predator in a hunt!”
>You come to the bottom, stumbling onto the red carpet floor with the momentum of your slide.
>”No claws! Little stubby teeth! Smaller, weaker! The only advantage you have is endurance…”
>You squint at the brilliant light of the crystal chandeliers bathing the foyer.
>The naked Erma emerges from the hall and onto the balcony of the foyer. “I’m coming, prey!”
>Her digitigrade legs propel the predator’s superior form with grace you couldn’t aspire to.
>You make horrible, terrifying eye contact.
>Erma’s pupils are dilated, her tail whipping behind her as she bears her extended claws.
>Her movement toward the top of the stairs breaks your trance and you make way toward the arched doorway to the kitchen
>”I’m going to fuck you silly when I catch you, human!”
>You pass under the brick arch and into the tiled, industrial-sized kitchen. The dirty grill and stainless steel table with the remnants of your breakfast are in sight.
>Your keys twinkle in the fluorescent light beside the white ceramic plates.
>”I’ll treat you better than anyone else ever could. Just give up!”
>You weave through the tables and grills until you come to the one with your keys.
>You snatch them.
>”There you are, cutie.”
>You whip around to see her standing in the doorway to the kitchen, just fifty feet away from you.
>You stop.
“This is it, huh?” you ask, holding out your hands with the keys.
>”Yup. I have you cornered. You could run all the way around the house that way-” She points past you. The wolfess takes a single step toward you, then another. “-but I’ll still catch you.” Her digitigrade legs bend inward with each step, like a spring ready to pop.
>Your eyes narrow.
“Then come get me.”
>She immediately lunges to full speed, weaving the same path through the stainless steel kitchen ware that you did.
>Right as she closes in on you, you vault over the table at your side, over what was left of the drugged food and drink that Erma provided earlier.
>Instead of catching you in her arms, the wolf slams right into the table with a loud clang.
>She howls in pain, and gnashes her teeth. “Agh! Get back here!”
>You make your way out of the kitchen, but you hear the claws of Erma’s foot paws scratching into the tile behind you as she comes for you once more.
>The light of the foyer bathes you. The heavy white door of the garage is just across the carpet.
>Freedom.
>So close.
>You smile, and laugh, the keys jingling in your hand.
>Erma snarls behind you.
>You look over your shoulder to see her launch toward you by her foot paws.
>You drop to the ground as over two-hundred fifty pounds of muscled wolf-woman latches onto you from behind.
>You are sent tumbling over each other.
>The two of you roll two a stop, with you laying on top of her, face up toward the ceiling.
“No, please!” You gasp as you flail around, trying to wrestle out of her claws.
>An arm locks around your neck, and pulls your head back to hers.
>The wet nose of her muzzle dabs at the sensitive skin of your ear.
>”Sh…” she coos into your ear as she slices your pants and underwear from you with her other claw. “You did well, my human prey. It’s time to give in to your wife. Give her what she wants.”
>Keeping you in the headlock, her other paw slides over your chest, your abs, and wraps around your now-naked member.
>A few pumps of her soft pads, and it’s standing at attention and throbbing.
>Heat radiates off of her.
>You stop writhing, and you stop fighting.
>As she pumps you, you stare at the door. It’s freedom, just out of reach.
>Freedom.
>Was it really?
>You’d be owned by someone that didn’t love you, and wouldn’t love your children.
>Why were you willing to live that way, again?
>For your mother?
>”Are you okay?” Her concern is audible.
>Your mother was the one who messed you up.
>She messed you up so bad, that you actually loved your now-rapist and wanted to stay.
>No, you loved Erma before that.
>She gave you what no one else did, what no one else would.
>You relax into the wolfess’ grasp completely, and she stops pumping.
>”What’re you-”
>You turn over in her headlock, putting your pecs to her breasts, your abdomen to her rock-solid abs, and your member to her burning slit.
“You said that you would break me.” You prop yourself up on her furred shoulders, staring into her red eyes. You shake your head. “Erma, I am broken.” The tip of your cock brushes her burning hot sex. “You make me feel not so hurt… not so fragile.”
>Her maw hangs open.
>You lean in to place a kiss on the wolfess’ black lips. You spear her other lips with the tip of your member.
>The both of you moan as you push further into her heat from above, her legs wrapping around your hips.
>She grunts at your thrust, and returns the kiss.
>Your tongues push at the other’s.
>Impatient with your slow entrance, Erma pulls you in swiftly with her densely muscled legs.
>”I love you,” She groans into your mouth. “Mommy will never leave you, angel.” Her thighs clench around your hips like a vise.
“I know,” you breathe, pumping your hips back for another stroke.
>She loosens up to allow you to pull back.
>You slam back down into her, your whole member alight with sensation.
“Ah!” you bite your lip to stifle a moan.
>”That’s it.” She pulls away from the kiss to watch your eyes. She cups your cheek in a paw. “Show me how much you want this, husband.”
>A wet squelch echoes through the foyer as you pump back inside.
“Please, hold me.” You quicken your pace.
>”Yes!” The wolfess hisses. On each stroke downward, she pulls her legs against your back, forcing you back in.
>Erma’s paw clenches around your chin, forcing you to look at her as you slam into her. “I’ve dreamed of us since I was ten!”
>The wind of the blizzard howls outside.
>You stop looking at the door to the garage, and focus on your partner beneath you.
>She chuckles. “I know it’s fucking embarassing, but-” She swallows thickly. “-I had my parents buy me a human family doll set, and a wolf family doll set!”
>Already tired from your chase, you let your arms give out under you to drop to her chest.
>”My father made me work for both of them. I had to clean the house with our servants.” She grits her sharp canine. “But it was worth it!”
>Your face falls right between her plush breasts, her bust spilling out and flattening off the sides of her chest.
>”I threw the human wife, and the wolf husband out!” Erma moans as you withdraw, and slam back inside. “I made the perfect family set. There was a tall, strong wolf wife and her beautiful, perfect humie husband! They had the most beautiful pup girls, and baby boys.” She chokes up. “I would play with them, imagining it was us!”
>Your arms wrap around her breasts, squeezing to her. You groan as her tunnel clenches to you, tight like her thighs on your hips.
>“And now it’s real. It’s finally real!” Her paws grab your sides.
“Ah!” You gasp as she leaps to her feet, flipping you onto your back with your cock still buried inside of her.
>She smiles as she assumes her position over you
>Erma holds you up by your legs in the amazon position.
>She’s going to fuck you in the middle of the foyer.
>A lit, brick fireplaces hisses with natural gas, the orange light of the hot flames falling over you and Erma.
>”It was fun to have you on top of me, but this is where you really belong, angel-” Erma clenches tighter to your cock. “-under the predator who’s collar you wear.”
>You bite your lip
>The wolfess pulls you up into her by your legs while she squats onto your member, meeting you right in the middle with a hot squelch.
>You writhe on the plush carpet, giving up on biting your lip to moan out loud.
”Yes!” you yell at the ceiling as your wolf wife fucks you into the ground.
>”Moan for mommy.” Her smile widens as her digitigrade legs bend at either side of you.
>You indulge her.
>”This cock belongs to mommy.” Her discordant, feral tone has a sharp edge to it. “Every human cock belongs in wolf cunt, not in human girls or other anthros! They can’t give you the companionship we can!”
>You breathe deep, trying to comprehend the endless, overwhelming sensation of her constricting tunnel.
>”We’ve been together-” she grunts as she readjusts her grip on your ankles. “-since the dawn of civilization! The oldest stories are of wolf and human tribes. You belong to us!”
>You wipe the sweat from your brow with your arm as you listen to her and the wet plaps of your coupling.
>”The first cave paintings are human hands inside of wolf paw prints!”
>You rock with each of her squats, pushed back and forth along the floor.
>Your breaths are rapid and ragged.
“Please, don’t stop, mommy,” you beg through grit teeth.
>”Who owns you?” She punctuates her question by burying you to the hilt in her sopping slit.
>She stops on the down stroke, holding you deep in her.
>Erma grinds on your pelvis, pleasuring herself on you. The sensation is torturous to your sensitive flesh.
>“You want me to keep going? Tell mommy who owns you!” The wolf’s dark fur is matted with your combined fluids.
“You do! You own me!” You cry in your daze.
>”Good fucking boy.” Her tongue lolls out of her mouth, and her eyes narrow as she resumes her frantic fucking. ”You’re gonna be a father to wolves… my house husband!”
“Yes, yes, I’m your good boy, your good little humie husband!”
>Erma falls over you, angling your legs right up into the air. She supports herself with her paws on either side of your head. ”Hold onto me, husband,” her voice is husky. Her muzzle hovers over your mouth.
>You wrap your arms around Erma, staring into her predatory red eyes.
>The wolfess keeps pounding into you, battering your hips and squeezing around you.
>Erma leans down, pressing her fuzzy breasts to your chest and lapping at your cheek with her spade-like tongue as she fucks you.
“Please, break my mind!” You stare up at the crystal chandelier hanging over you.
>One of her paws moves to your neck, pulling you up into a kiss by your leather collar. The battering of her hips into yours quickens at your request.
>You’re forced to swallow her plentiful drool as her tongue delves into you. Your owner’s distinct, wild musk is spread through your mouth.
>The kiss. The sex. It’s too much.
>Your eyes roll up as your mind is inundated in pleasure.
>The world is you, Erma, and the pleasure the wolfess gives you.
>She shudders as you hit a particularly sensitive spot in her constricting heat.
>The wolfess breaks her kiss to snarl, sending globs of her musky saliva across your face.
>“You’re mine, human!” Her discordant tenor is nearly feral. “You’re fucking perfect!”
>You shake at the force of her wet hips slamming into you.
“Rape your little human.” Your arms tighten around her and your mouth hangs open. ”I'm your good boy!”
>The two of you pant into each other’s faces.
>”Oh, really?” she mutters between breaths. Her paw trails from your collar to just above your hips, inches away from your point of contact with your mate. “You want a tattoo of mommy’s paw print above your hips, angel? Then everyone will know that you’re a good little wolf breeder.”
“Whatever you want, anything at all!”
>”When that speciest bitch of a mom sees you wearing my collar-” she gnashes her teeth, enraged at the mere mention of her. “-and she sees my paw print on your body, she’ll know! She’ll know that her son is wolf-cunt only!”
>The thought of Erma showing up your mother fills you with twisted satisfaction.
>”I’m close.” Erma’s dripping tunnel twitches around you. “You’re gonna be a good boy, right? You’ll fill mommy up and make her pregnant, won’t you?”
>You nod frantically, her paw still pressing against your abdomen. “Mark me, mommy! Mark me as your property!” You crook your neck, baring your sensitive flesh just beneath your leather collar.
>Her already rapid pace speeds up to a hip-bruising intensity, your legs bouncing in the air, and your tongue hanging out of your mouth as you’re screwed silly.
>Erma rears her open maw back, exposing her sharp canines. “Now! Cum, angel! Cum for mommy!” Her teeth come down to the base of your neck and she buries you in her to the hilt.
>You explode inside of her as her teeth pierce your skin and flesh.
“Yes! Breed me! Breed your good boy!” you scream up at the ceiling.
>Your soaked balls tense as you shoot your first rope deep in her wolf sex.
>Her quivering tunnel spurts and gushes around you, drenching your skin in her musky emission.
>Erma’s claws pull on your collar, pressing her teeth deeper into you.
>The mixture of pain and pleasure addles your mind.
>Erma growls and laps at you even as her teeth are buried in the base of your neck.
>Your legs shake in the air as your seed fills her burning quim.
”Deeper! Deeper!” You push on the back of Erma’s head, forcing her teeth as far into you as they will go.
>Your mixed climax splatters to the carpet beneath, soaking it dark.
>You fire your last shot into her tunnel.
>Her wolf cunt twitches she finally pulls your soaked member from her and her teeth from your neck.
>She laps lovingly at the set of canine teeth marks on your neck.
>At first, the wound pulses with pain and stings at her licks. With a few more seconds of your mate’s gentle ministrations, the pain diminishes.
>You’re both huffing desperately for air.
>Erma falls off of you, and to your side. She pulls you back into her fuzzy body with her muscled arms to embrace you right on the floor.
>Your neck nestles between her breasts, and you rise and fall with each of her heavy breaths.
>The wolfess continues to the lap at your bleeding bite, wrapping a paw around your chest to pull you flush to her.
>”You may be broken, husband, but-” her tongue trails from your bite up your neck, and to your cheek. “-I’ll put you back together, I promise.”
>You smile.
>That’s alright with you.

>"Ugh! That is it!"
>you hear a fist slam down on a table in the other room
>there's a rattle of empty soda cans and the clatter of old plates
>"Stupid fucking yeens! Dumb slut horses! Goddamn fucking dirty whores!"
>you sigh and set down your novel
>looks like you had to calm her down again
>you crack open the door into your roommate's room
>you hadn't seen the bunny in forty-eight hours, she never leaves
>but you had heard her plenty in all that time
>a beam of light cut through the blacked out room
>she hisses in shock as she turns about and is met by the light of the hall
>her eyes, wringed in sleep-deprived purple, narrow as they struggle to adjust from the glow of the computer screen
>"Anon!"
>you step into the room, flicking on the light to dispel the gloom
>"It's not fair Anon! Look at them! Those stupid bitches showing off their humie boyfriends!"
>she spins about in her chair and jabs an accusatory finger at the screen as you approach her
>"Just cause I'm not a seven foot tall yeen with a stupid fake cock! Humies should be with buns! I'm really gonna do it this time!"
>she's on that website again, even though all it does is send her into fits of rage
>you sigh and lean over top of her, putting your hand over hers to take control of the mouse
>"A-A-Anon!"
>she stutters, staring at your hand
>you just move the mouse to the top of the screen, and close down the internet
>"Hey! I wasn't done with that! I had to show those bitches that bunnies can get human boyfriends too!"
>with a sigh, you step back and look around the room
>it really is a sty
>how can she afford her half of the rent when all she does is sit around and yell at strangers on the internet all day?
"You really need to take a break, Minn. Have you ever tried going out and talking to a human boy? Or anyone? Or maybe just...being outside your room for a little while?"
>Minn lets her head slump down on her desk
>she whines
>"But outside suuuucks Anon!"
>she thumps her head against the desk again
>"Everyone out there is so mean, and no one wants to talk about video games or human/bunny compatibility or anything!"
>you cross your arms
"Meaner than those girls you're angry about on the internet?"
>"That's different! They're shitting up the thread with their dumb fucking yeen-posting this and winking-pussy that!"
>Minn slams her fist down on her computer desk and goes to pull up that website again
>you step around her chair and rest a finger against the power button on her oversized computer tower
"Minn. I will do it."
>"Wait! Anon waitwaitwait! Just one post! I gotta prove that bunnies can get human boys too!"
>she types frantically, glancing between you and the screen, before freezing
>"Wait a minute! Oh my god! Anon, you're a human boy!"
>you roll your eyes
"Gee, thanks for noticing."
>she picks up her phone, frantically trying to unlock it
>"Please Anon! Just let me take a few pictures with you so I can show those hyenas and I promise I'll stop! For at least the rest of the day!"
>you stare at her
"The week. And you clean up your room."
>"Deal!"
>Minn hops up, standing on her chair
>holy shit she's not wearing pants
>try not to stare
>Minn puts her arm around your shoulders and holds up her phone for a selfie
>"Okay Anon! Smile like we're in love, okay?"
>before you can even look at the camera she takes several photos
>then frowns when she looks at them
>"We don't look in love enough. Here, let me take one kissing you."
>what
"Hang on Minn, I don't--"
>Minn mashes her face against yours, taking the opportunity to push her tongue into your open mouth and make out with you sloppily
>all the while she keeps the camera clicking
>you're left dazed, bunny saliva trailing down your chin, when she finally pulls back
>"Those are awesome Anon! That'll really show those dumb sluts. Here, I have another idea!"
>she grabs a fistful of your hair, dragging your head down as she runs her tongue over your face
>"There! Now look all dazed like I just fucked you silly."
"Uh?"
>she take a few photos as you work on processing what's going on
>she still doesn't seem satisfied
>"The angle is right. A good human boyfriend would be on his knees for the perfect bunny girlfriend, right?"
>you don't know about that one, but Minn is already forcing you down the grip on your hair
>how is a bunny half your size still so strong
>"Here, just on your knees. A couple more photos and then I'm done, promise! I can't wait to show my parents I have a boyfriend..."
>did she say parents?
>Minn keeps pushing, but dropping to your knees just to prove a point was going a little far
>even for a pushover like you
"Minn what the fuck?"
>she stops pushing your head down
>"What's wrong Anon? We're almost done. Come on, we had a deal!"
>she suddenly gasps as she looks you up and down
>"Oh! Oh my god! You have a boner!"
>when did that get there?
>you are hard as a rock right now
>"Fuck yes! I gave a human a boner! I did it! Bunnies ARE the best! Fuck yeah!"
>she pumps her fists
>"Take that you stupid fucking sluts! I did it!"
>she spends a little bit of time in exultation before she stops again
>"Oh fuck, you have a boner. Fuck! Do you like me? Do you want me? Shit what do I do? I've never done this before. Anon are we married now?"
>she is a total virgin, but at least she's on the backfoot now and you have a little space to breath and collect yourself
"We aren't married Minn. We just made out a little bit. We could keep going if you want, but no more pictures, alright?"
>she looks at you with eyes like dinner plates
"And no more yelling about other species. The neighbors have complained."
>Minn drops down into her chair and lets out a jittery giggle
>"Holy fuck me and my human roommate are gonna fuck this is like all my hentai doujins."
>you think she might be having an actual meltdown
>"Anon what do I do? How do we start again? Do I just grab it? Anon please, do I grab it?"
>it's kind of cute how desperate she is
"It's okay Minn, take a deep breath. What do you WANT to do?"
>Minn follows your advice and takes a deep breath
>"What do I want? Um, I want to uh..."
>she tugs at an ear in thought
>"Oh! Can we do like--like the photos I was gonna take, only no photos? So you can be on your knees for me?"
>it's a start
>you drop down to your knees at the side of her chair
>you see Minn chewing her lip as she looks down at you
>"Then you could maybe uh, kiss my feet a little?"
>she extends one of her legs out to you, flexing her fluffy looking toes
>you hold on to her calf with one hand, and lean in to start planting small kisses on the pads of her footpaw
>she giggles and her breath hitches
>"Ooh just like that my cute little humie~"
>you roll your eyes but continue to shower her with affection
>until you hear the telltale click
>your eyes snap up
>Minn gives you a guilty grin
>"These ones are just for me. Promise."
>you huff around the toe currently pressed against your lips
>but you keep going, running your tongue over the top of her foot, and then kissing up the inside of her calf
>you hear a mixture of giggles and soft moans intermingled with snapshots being taken
>if you find your face on some kind of weird species based porn site, you're going to throw her computer through the window
>you trace kisses along Minn's inner thigh
>a thigh bigger than your head, thick with muscle and extra fat
>"You like my legs? My big strong legs? Bigger than any other girls?"
>she is really putting on a voice for this
>but it makes her happy
"They're amazing Minn."
>her fur gets matted and slick as you continue working toward her slit
>it smells of musk and sweat
>Minn's been looking at more than just imageboards in her room
>her other leg wraps around the back of her leg as she crosses it over her lap
>you're trapped now
>"This is a dream come true."
>Minn has finally dropped her phone, now focused entirely on you
>she tightens the leglock, pressing your face into her lap
>you do what comes natural, running your tongue over her vulva
>Minn squeaks and squeezes you tight
>you keep eating her out, exploring her folds with your tongue
>she may well pop your head off with her thighs as her breath hitches higher and higher
>finally your efforts are rewarded with a flood of femcum as Minn doubles over and spasms in climax
>her thighs finally cut off blood pressure, and the world starts to swim
>any attempts to warn her are lost in her orgasm
>you feel yourself slipping into unconsciousness when Minn finally releases you
>you topple back onto the floor, your head landing conveniently on a pile of her dirty laundry
>"That was amazing Anon. Better than the hentai..."
>you suck air, arguing how worth it would be to die in those bunny thighs
>definitely worth it
>"Anon? Anon?! Holy shit did I kill you? Oh shit they never warned me about this! Fuck!"
>silly bun
>she better clean her fucking room
>"Hey Anon?"
>Minn calls to you from her bedroom, though she's standing in the doorway to address you face to face
>she's been making an effort to get out more
"What's up, Minn?"
>Minn flops an ear to one side, a clear sign of nervousness
>"Are we...dating?"
>that wasn't the question you were expecting
>but it was bound to come up sooner or later
>you set down your novel
>never going to finish it at this rate
"Well Minn, we've been fucking like ra--crazy for the last two weeks now. You've bragged to all your internet friends about how you 'have' a human now. Those are usually signs of dating."
>she huffs and shakes her head
>"I know that! But are we dating-dating? I mean, could we go on something like, you know...a real date?"
>the rabbit wrings her hands and sways nervously as she manages to force out the question
>this is the girl who threatened to break your pelvis while in the throws of passion just last night
>nervous about going on a date
>your heart may stop
"I'd love to go on a date with you, Minn. Did you have something in mind?"
>Minn gasps and hops in place excitedly
>"Yes! Yesyesyes! I did! I'm gonna go on a date! Wait here, I'm gonna go change!"
"Hang on, should I--"
>she's already slammed the door and disappeared back into her room
>you shrug and go back to reading
>a few minutes later, the door slams open again and Minn is there
>she's wearing a plain white dress that almost blends into her fur at the edges
>she fills it out nicely, the short skirt giving a view of those legs you love so much
>you're stunned
>you didn't think she owned any clothing that wasn't repurposed pajamas or plastered in video game characters
>"Okay! Let's go Anon!"
>you fear you may be a bit underdressed if she's going in a full dress, but she doesn't seem to mind as you lace up your shoes
"So what did you have in mind, Minn?"
>Minn smiles
>but it's not a cheerful smile
>she looks like she's planning something
>"Oh, just this coffee shop by the apartment! My treat."
>Minn is practically bouncing with each step out the apartment and down the street
>she takes you to a place you had seen once or twice before
>"Cappu-yeen-o"
>a cutesy cartoon hyena sips at an oversized cup of steaming coffee on the sign
>this won't end well
>you go for the door, but Minn stops you
>"Waitwait! Anon, before you go in could we--would you uh, hold my hand? So it looks like we're together. Because we are together!"
>she stumbles over her words, looking a lot less sure of herself now than when you were leaving the apartment
>you put your hand out for Minn to take it
>and when she hesitates to take it, her hand hovering over yours, you just reach out and take it
>that little squeak of shock Minn makes is enough to make whatever comes next worth it
>she's so damn cute sometimes
>Minn finally works up the nerve to push open the door and lead you in
>with the jingle of a bell, you step into the cafe
>it's comfortable looking, with wooden tables and soft looking chairs, along with a bar set in the back for customers to sit at
>a hyena woman behind the counter waves at the pair of you
>"Welcome to Cappu-yeen-o! Take a seat and I'll be with you real quick."
>she's dressed for work in cheery yellow apron, with her mane pulled into a ponytail
>Minn hops up to the bar, jumping up onto one of the available stools
>you take the one next to her
>the hyena approaches a minute later
>"Oh! Hey there Minn, I almost didn't recognize you! Who's this?"
>the hyena gives Minn a friendly smile and then turns to you
>"Well Shay, this is my human boyfriend Anon! Isn't he so handsome? He loves bunnies SO much."
>Shay's grin tweaks into a knowing smirk
>"Oh! So this is that roommate you were obsessing over, huh? You're right, he is handsome. Hey there hun."
>Shay offers a hand, and you shake it politely
"Pleasure to meet you."
>Minn crosses her arms when you sit back down on the stool
>"Anon really, really likes me, don't you Anon?"
>she makes no effort to hide her jealousy as she puts a possessive hand on your thigh
"Oh, well, Minn is a handful some times, but she's plenty of fun when she's relaxed."
>you stress the last word, patting her hand to reassure her
>Shay laughs, leaning over onto the counter to look you in the eye
>man she is tall
>"Oh I'm sure. I hope you're able to keep her stress-free, Anon. Last time she was here, she got so excited she spilled her coffee everywhere!"
>Minn gives in an indignant huff
>Shay just continues
>"So, can I get you two lovebirds something to drink?"
>Minn cuts in first
>"A coffee! With extra cream, and whatever my boyfriend wants."
>she sets down her credit card on the table
>you make your own order, and Shay gives you both a toothy smile
>"Excellent choice. I'll have that right out to you two!"
>Shay stands up straight, and turns about to start working on your drinks
>Minn, meanwhile, is fuming in her seat
>"Thinks she's so great with her hair, and her...dumb coffee."
>you cock an eyebrow
"Minn, why bring me here if you're gonna get all jealous? This is almost as bad as that website you go to."
>Minn stops staring daggers at the back of the hyena and turns to you
>"I'm not jealous! I'm on a date with my boyfriend, getting some coffee from a...lovely...café!"
>you think she choked on the word 'lovely'
>honestly, she's trying way too hard right now
"Listen Minn, it's alright. You wanted to show off a bit, but Shay's playing the game too. She's just being friendly is all."
>Shay returns with your drinks, both of them served in cups with the same cartoon hyena giving an 'OKAY' symbol with her hand
>you take the cup and enjoy the first sip of the steaming beverage
>"Here you two are, hope you enjoy--"
>Minn jumps up in her seat, phone in hand
>"Here's me and Anon having sex! This is the part where he says he loves bunny pussy!"
"Ack!"
>you cough, choking on your drink as you struggle not to spill it
>what the fuck
>you hear your own voice, moaning and panting, coming from the speakers of Minn's cell phone
>"Say it!"
>her voice echoes out from the device
>"I love bunny pussy!"
>was your response in the video
>you grab the phone from Minn's hand, and desperately fumble with it to shut it off
>but the damage is done
>Shay stares at the two of you, eyes wide
>your face burns hotter than the coffee
>Minn beams, triumphant
>"That's how much Anon loves bunnies!"
>she stands on the stool, arms crossed
>the three of you are left in silence for several seconds before Shay breaks out into a cackle
>"Wow! I didn't know you had it in you Minn!"
>she laughs some more, slapping a hand on the table
>Minn's triumphant demeanor falters
>"What--What do you mean?"
>Shay manages to regain control of herself
>"I didn't think you were ever gonna snag that humie boyfriend you were after, but from your video it looks like Anon is really into. REALLY into you."
>she cackles a bit more when she turns her attention to you
>"You like 'em small, huh Anon?"
>oh god someone please shoot me now
"Minn. Oh my god. Minn."
>you're still at a loss for words, and now Shay was ganging up on you too
>"You ought to meet my husband, Minn. He blushes like that when I tease him in public. So cute."
>Shay sighs
>"Though he usually isn't so open about what we do in our bedroom. You post that anywhere?"
>Minn drops onto her stool again, wind taken out of her sails by Shay's complete nonchalance
>"Uh, no. No that kinda stuff I just save for me."
>this is it
>the most embarrassing moment in your entire life
"Minn. Minn. Why did you show the nice coffee lady a video of us having sex?"
>Shay loses her cheerful demeanor and steps back from the counter
>"Okay, maybe you two need some space."
>the hyena makes herself scarce while Minn turns to you as if realizing for the first time there might be something wrong
>"Anon, I..."
>you just stare at her
>she stammers your name a few times, gesture toward you, then the back of the café where the hyena had disappeared to
>"I can't--I don't--She was gonna--"
>you have to take a moment to restrain yourself from raising your voice
>you were a pushover, but this was too far
"Minn. You took me out on a date so you could, what, rub it in the face of a woman who's already married? And the moment you get jealous you start showing homemade porn to what, scare her off?"
>Minn folds, ears hanging down as she drops her head in shame
>"I just didn't know what do do! I was scared! What if she stole you? Or someone else does? I'm--I'm a loser Anon! You're way out of my league and I didn't--I don't wanna lose my shot!"
>Minn tears up, reaching out to try and hold on to you
>but you stand out of your stool, away from her reach
>Minn gasps and hiccups, not quite full-on sobbing
"I trusted you with that camera Minn. Because it made you happy."
>"I'm sorry Anon, I'm sorry!"
>you shake your head
"I like you Minn. When you're not going crazy over this species stuff, you're fun, you're sweet, and you're so damn cute. But it has to stop, okay? It's not healthy."
>you gesture over to Shay, who had reappeared to serve a couple other customers seated away from the bar
"And you're not just hurting me. I bet you could be great friends with Shay if you had made the effort."
>you run out of track, shutting your mouth a moment to look at the defeated bun on the stool in front of you
>you do feel bad about it, but some bandaids need to be ripped off
"I'll see you at home, Minn."
>Minn manages to pick up her head enough to look you in the eye
>"Will you want--want to talk then?"
>you sigh
"I just need some time to think, Minn. You should do some thinking for yourself.
>you turn on your heel and walk out of the coffee shop

Shelby Story
>you wake up, some unknown time later
>the bright light of morning shines through the window
>and manages to land right on your face
>you groan and try to roll over, only to find yourself still hunched over the edge of Shelby's bed
>the events of the middle of the night come back to you as you straighten out your stiff legs
>you must have fallen asleep while comforting Shelby
>she's still holding your hand, even in her sleep
>you slowly pull your hand out from hers and haul yourself up off the bed
>your sleeping posture left a lot to be desired, and your spine raises a crackle of indignation as you stretch
>and despite your efforts to be gentle while getting up, Shelby stirs
>her nose twitches and ears flick
>she reaches out with her paw toward where you'd been laying
>"'Non...?"
>she grumbles
>"Where're you?"
>she growls softly as she continues searching the bed
>she jolts, suddenly shoot up from the bed in a flash
>you stumble back a bit, not expecting her to jump up so suddenly
>her nightgown is twisted from the sudden movement, and sticks close enough to her fur to show her slim figure
>"Anon!"
>her eyes find and you, and all the tension runs out of her stance
>her fur settles and she takes a deep breath, smiling sheepishly
>"Good morning. I hope I didn't startle you, just uh...let instincts get the better of me."
>you nod slowly
>you had almost forgotten she was still an anthro
>and you still didn't know what you could expect of her once things got settled
>she must have sensed something of your thoughts, as she took a step back to sit down on the bed
>"Thanks for checking up on me last night, Anon. It made my night so much better."
>Shelby gives you a warm smile and pats the bed next to her
>"We've got a lot to take care of today, but I think we could take a little time right now. Join me?"
>you nod again, sidling over to sit on the edge of her bed
>Shelby reaches out and takes your hand
>once she's intertwined her fingers with yours, a change comes over her
>her tail starts to wag against the bed
>her ears perk up too
>"That's better..." she coos
>you have to admit, you don't mind the little bit of physical connection
>her fur is soft and smooth, and the pads of her paws are warm against your skin
>she didn't ask this time, but you guess it's only fair after you snuck into her bed late at night
>"We'll have to go get your stuff from the storage lot, maybe do some grocery shopping. I'm on leave the rest of the week, so plenty of time to get things done, and--"
>she frowns
>"And I left all the paperwork at the assignment office. In the waiting room. Damn it all."
>Shelby groans, before looking to you and smiling again
>"I guess that just means I'll have to give them a surprise inspection! They'll never see it coming."
>Shelby laughs as though she's hatching a conspiracy with you
"Shelby?"
>she cocks her head when you speak up
>"Is something wrong, Anon? You don't have to worry about that wolf when we go back. I'll be there with you."
>you shake your head
"It's not that."
>you try to figure out the right way to ask how she managed to cow an entire office of anthros with the flash of a badge
>she tilts her head the other way
>and her ears flop with them
>it's adorable
>damn it all, you can't hand this
"Could you pick up a uh, a cookbook or something? When we go out?"
>the collie gasps, and smiles wide
>did someone open a shade and let the sunlight in?
>"Anon! That's a great idea! Having home made food would be amazing."
>you just nod and look back down at the ground
>you guess you'll get your answers eventually
"Thanks Shelby. I'm not much of a cook."
>"That's okay Anon! Just another thing we can figure out together.
>she squeezes your hand and her tail wags faster
>wap wap wap!
>it thumps against the bed
>"I don't think I'll ever get tired of being close to you Anon. Gosh, I must seem like a little girl, getting so giddy over holding hands with a cute boy."
>she giggles
>you find you suddenly can't meet her eyes
>and your face is a little hot
>just remember there has to be a catch
>has to be something wrong you haven't seen yet
>you take a deep breath to try and still your thoughts
>you'll make it work
>you said you would
>Shelby leans her head down to catch your eyes with hers
>"Whatcha thinking about, Anon?"
>you blink
"Nothing. Long day ahead of us. We should get ready, right?"
>she lets out an exaggerated sigh
>"I guess we can't spend all day sitting together, huh? Why don't you go grab a shower and I can see about breakfast. Plenty of leftovers from last night!"
>when you stand to leave, Shelby holds on to your hand to keep you next to the bed for a couple extra seconds
>but she lets you go
>and her tail slumps
>it's not like you were going far
>you planned on a quick shower, but Shelby's was much nicer than your old one, and you spend several minutes relaxing under the spray of hot water
>you're startled by a knock on the door
>"Everything okay in there Anon? You didn't slip and fall did you?"
>how long have you been in the shower?
"I'm fine! Almost done."
>you scrub yourself as quickly as you can, and step out of the shower
>and right back into your old clothes from yesterday
>just have to shower again when you pick up your clothes from lockup
>Shelby is waiting for you once you open the door
>"Hurry hurry Anon, food's getting cold!"
>the takeout is less appealing the second time around, but you still eat quickly
>"Okay! We can clean up later, we're gonna be late!"
>she shoos you from cleaning up the empty containers
>Shelby runs off from the kitchen, down the hall to disappear into her room
>and she's back shortly after changing out of her nightgown
>she's dressed more sensibly for the weather, a heavy coat that covers down to her thighs and a set of leggings
>you find yourself mildly disappointed they cover up the fur of her legs, but they do show off their form
>"Ready to go?"
>you just give a nod, trying to suppress the more primal part of your brain
"Ready."
>"Great!"
>Shelby trots past you, taking your hand and leading you out the door
>"Let's get your stuff from lockup first, yeah? We need to grab you a coat!"
>you do need something like that
>even still indoors, you shiver in the chill of the building's stairwell
>as Shelby stops to unlock the door, you hear the sound of footsteps a floor above you
>and Shelby's tail droops considerably
>"Shelby! I was hoping I'd catch you!"
>a sheep comes down the stairwell
>she's shorter than Shelby and even you, but she has a wider frame, with wide hips and a somewhat ridiculous bust
>and she has to be at least fifty percent wool by body mass
>Shelby turns and gives a less than enthusiastic greeting
"Allie. How nice to see you."
>the sheep turns her attention to you
>"Oh, and who is this? Finally found yourself a human of your own huh? Where'd you catch a cutie like him?"
>Shelby steps forward, keeping between you and Allie
>"This is my husband, Anon. I put in for assignment. Anon, this my neighbor. Allie."
>Allie gasps and clasps her hands together
>"Oh that's so wonderful! I thought you'd never find yourself someone to settle down with. Always so busy busy busy! Better not work too hard, else someone might sneak in and snatch Anon away."
>Allie gives you a wink through a mop of wool that half-covers her eyes
>Shelby grips your hand tight, and even tugs you to stand closer
>"No one is stealing him, Allie."
>Allie laughs, ignoring the shift in Shelby's mood from tolerant politeness to open annoyance
>"Oh of course! I'm sure you'll keep a watchful eye on your human. Wouldn't want to steal a shepherd dog's property."
>Shelby snarls!
>she bares her teeth, letting go of your hand to bear down on Allie
>Allie stumbles back, tripping over the stairs and falling over
>"Wh--Wha--"
>Shelby cuts her off
>"Anon is not property! If you ever say such an awful thing about him again, I'll--I'll--"
>she stammers, before jabbing a finger into Allie's chest
>"I'll shave you bald and make a sweater out of your wool."
>Allie was sufficiently cowed, trembling as she laid back on the stairs where she fell
>"Now, Allie, I want you to apologize."
>"S-sorry Shelby, I--"
>Shelby barks again
>"No! Apologize to him."
>Allie scrabbles back up a couple stairs, and spare a glance your way
>"I'm sorry!"
>and then she turns about and flees the rest of the way up on all fours
>you hear a door slam shut above you
>once she's gone, Shelby sighs
>she spins about to face you, sitting down on the steps leading up where Allie had been just a moment before
>"I'm sorry Anon. I wish stuff like that wouldn't happen."
>you stay next to the door, watching her
>would she lose her temper like this every day?
>you're glad it's never been directed at you
>"Don't worry, I'm not really gonna shave her. I don't--I'm not a violent person, but she really shouldn't have called you that. Property."
>she spits out the word like a bad taste in her mouth
>"You're not property. You're still a person."
>you're not sure how to take it
>you were used to the kind of talk that your new neighbor was making
>and worse
>but it upset Shelby enough to make her snap
>you watch as she starts to shake
>and she whines softly
>there's a lot you don't understand about her yet
>but she's done her best to protect you
>your emotions wrestle over themselves as you approach your wife
>she looks up at you in questioning
>you sit with Shelby in silence for a short while
>you're more than happy to let her coat reflect heat back onto you
>just another thing she's given without expecting anything in return
>you still don't really trust her
>but hasn't she been kind enough for something?
"Music."
>you break the silence
>Shelby perks her ears, and looks down at you
>"What was that, Anon?"
>you look her in the eyes
>bright green eyes
"Music. You asked what it was like in the home. I did music."
>she blinks
>"Music? Really?"
"Yeah. They let us choose ah, 'life skills' classes. They said it would help our prospects. I played an instrument."
>Shelby's trail tries to wag, but trapped against the stairs, it doesn't have the room to make a full motion
>instead it whaps against your back and the next stair up
>"That's amazing, Anon! What did you play? Do you still play now? Oh! Do you think you could play something for me?"
>her excitement is infectious and you let yourself smile a little
>but it twinges into a frown when you go to answer her questions
"I don't really play anymore. It was the state home's instrument, and I couldn't afford one for myself on the stipend they gave me after I was on my own."
>Shelby's smile wavers
>"Oh, that's a shame, Anon. It must have made you happy to play music. What exactly did you play?"
>you had tried to dodge that one
>oh well, you prepare yourself for ridicule
"The banjo."
>the wagging stops
>Shelby stares in shocked silence
>her jaw hangs open
>and then she snorts
>her paws fly over her mouth to stifle the laugh building up in her
>"The banjo? Really Anon?"
>you roll your eyes and look down at the concrete between your feet
"It was that or the accordion. The banjo looked easier."
>Shelby breaks into cheerful giggles
>her tail wags against you in full force
>you should have just told her about your traumas
>that would have been easier
>"I'm--haha--I'm sorry Anon, I just--I picture you playing the banjo and it's just..."
>she breaks into another fit of laughter
>you hang your head and groan
"Forget it. Let's just go, please."
>you start to stand up off the stair, but Shelby catches you by the arm
>"Aw Anon, I'm sorry. Here..."
>she pulls you back down gently, then puts an arm around your shoulders to hug you to her side
>"There we are. No need to be embarrassed Anon. That wasn't the answer I was expecting is all. Did you like playing music?"
>she's holding you
>and though it's mostly just the bulk of her coat, there's still a little bit of her own warmth beneath it
>you nod your head stiffly
"Yeah. I liked it."
>Shelby hugs you tight
>then she lets you go, rising off the step to stand
>"Then that's what matters. I won't bring it up again if you don't want."
>she holds out her hand to you
>you barely hesitate to take it, and she helps you up onto your feet
>"You were right though, we do need to get going! It's going to be dark by the time errands are done if we keep at this pace."
>Shelby hurries downstairs with you in tow
>you forgot how cold it is outside
>a blast of icy wind to the face is enough to remind you when you step outside
>once you make it to the car, you're left shivering in the seat while Shelby works the controls to get hot air flowing
>satisfied, she works the lever in the steering wheel and the car rolls out of its parking spot and down the street

>the collar can only be turned off/taken off by an official with a unique key
>also the collar has a tracking chip install in it that's linked to a publicly available app/database an anthro can use to easily find the nearest free use bad boy

anthro taught history/evolution/biology of human males
>ancient humans found ancient wolves to get their protection
>the wolves kept them safe and warm which led to human becoming the soft clawless and tiny fanged cuties they are now
>no need of fur when an anthro can keep them warm with her own fur
>no need of claws or big fangs when an anthro can hunt for him
>hands evolving to better pet and stroke fur
>their hearing, sense of smell, night vision, and such became weak due to having ancient anthros taking care of them
>the reason human boys get boners when pinned and/or bullied by anthro females is a defesne mechanism ancient humans had when attacked by ancient anthro pred species
>offering themselves up as a mate instead of food
>ensuring safety and food for the human
>they evolved such nice lips and soft tongues from relying on the milk of anthros
>since why else would their moths be so perfect for sucking anthro tits
>can barely swim, but still wish to get into ricers/lakes/oceans/etc due to letting aquatic species keep them safe in the water
>and such other explanations

>humans main two advantages over anthros are endurance and intelligence
>humans are weak, soft creatures with little in the way of natural defenses and so naturally humans must think outside the box for dealing with threats
>anthros were already strong and capable, and simply never needed to innovate.
>while anthros still used their claws and teeth for fighting, humans invented spears and bows to stand a better chance
>while anthros still used their fur and huddled together for warmth, humans invented clothing, fire, and shelter to make up for their shortcomings.
>some anthro tribes realised this and reasoned that maybe these short furless weaklings with boundless ingenuity made better friends than food.
>after some "persuasion" various human tribes were absorbed into anthro tribes and were used now as mates
>humans without needing to worry about survival put their skills to work on other things
>developing agriculture, inventing medicine, building better structures, etc.

>anthros without humans could only do simpler and thicker war paint designs
>while the anthros with humans had much more intricate and complex designs since human hands could do smaller and more controlled designs

>Have tribal anthro gf
>An attack against a neighboring tribe is planned for tomorrow
>Spend the night devouring a mighty feast as ceremonial war chants and dances are played out around a massive bonfire
>When the night is finished and you're both pretty drunk you retire to your hut and make sweet sweet love
>In the morning the mood is grim as you and your fellow husbands begin the process of applying warpaint to your wives
>A red swirl across her cheek, thin wavy lines running down her arms, claws painted a solid red, thick red line across her forehead and down to her nose that you boop
>The brief toothy smile it ellicits manages to make the morning not seem so grim for a few short seconds
>Back to painting
>Her family symbol, a hare in the jaws of a wolf, is skillfully painted onto each shoulder much to her satisfaction
>Triangles symbolizing teeth on her palms for strength
>Wide swirls symbolizing the wind on her thighs for speed
>A thick red line below each eye for perception
>Finally, you stick your hand into the paint and place a handprint onto her belly while she does the same, the dual handprints symbolizing fertility
>She says you'll have to apply the paint for her first pup after she gets back
>You hope you'll have to as well
>You hand her her spear, painstakingly crafted by you after many moons so that it would be as strong and as sharp as possible, and slowly watch her leave with the other warriors into the sunset
>A sinking feeling enters your chest you can't seem to will away
>You'll be back with her again
>Maybe not tomorrow
>Or in this life
>But you'll be back with her again
>You know it

Imagine for a second, that you owned a Foxy plush as a child. You loved Foxy the Pirate more than any of the other animatronics, so much that you'd beg your mom for a photo with the rough swashbuckling vulpine every visit you made. There was nothing more you looked forward to for five consecutive personal birthday parties and about a dozen more between your friends, along with a handful of less scheduled visits at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, than to break a leg towards Pirate Cove after Freddy and the gang finished their official entertainment business for the hour. So many hours spent in unquestionable, childlike wonder as you took Foxy by the hook and leapt aboard the modestly-scaled pirate frigate within the cove, for tons of nautical adventures and pizza and cake-laden treasure to be found.
You would never forget the moment Foxy offered to let you sit up on his shoulders, against the considerations of the faculty. "That fox was always a little twitchy, and more than happy to give the workers a scare." you recalled one parent saying. But without those derring qualities and penchant for playing around the rules, Foxy simply wouldn't be himself.
That was fifteen years ago.
These memories had resisted the blur of your youth last of all, as you lay awake in your bed, three hours and some change shy of your Friday work alarm. Something possessed you to take the initiative and spend a vacation day lounging and trying to learn a little more about what become of the brand which played such a foundational role in your childhood. Until something pulled your eyes off the phone's light. A scraping sound, coming from somewhere in the corner of your room. Where your closet was, where your childhood memories had found themselves at rest. It was an unusually spacious closet, large enough to fit three oil drums side by side, and afforded you ample walk-in to take stock over the past during sentimental hours.
She was there again, waiting for her buccaneer.

>"Regan and Bush '84"
>You snicker as you stick the sign into the finely trimmed grass at your sneakers.
>"Hurry up, humie!" The voice of your eagle compatriot comes from behind.
>Her running truck sputters and rumbles behind you, ready to peel out of the culdesac.
>Sticking the lawns of the richest, notoriously blue, neighborhood in your county was the best use of extra resources the two of you could think of.
>"Hey! Get off of my lawn!"
>A shrill human woman in a pink bathrobe marches out of the double doors of the two-story plantation-style house before you.
>She waddles off of the white steps to her lavishly furnished wraparound porch, newspaper in hand.
"Shit!"
>You stumble away from her, and toward the old pick up waiting for you fifty feet away.
>"Get out of here before I call the police, you redneck!"
>You get up to running speed, leaping over a planter of rose bushes blocking your escape.
>You continue running
>The white, feathered head of a bald eagle sticks out of the window of the nearly brand new, blue '83 Ford Ranger pickup.
>"Get in here!" She beckons you with her taloned hand, hysterical laughter coming from her open yellow beak.
>You put both hands on the rim of the tailgate and vault inside with the momentum of your escape.
>"What are you doing?" the eagle protests.
>Your sneakers thump against the metal bed of the pickup as you run up to the rear of the cabin.
>You knock on the window separating you from the eagle.
"Go, go!"
>The wheels beneath you screech as she floors it.
>"Suck it, commie!" The eagle squawks at the fuming human woman.
>You slip from your feet and plop down onto the bed of the truck, your back against the rear of the cabin.
>Your hands grip the sides for dear life as she accelerates to no less than 40 miles per hour.
>"That was awesome!"
>You barely hear her over the rushing air about you.
>"Now get in here," the eagle commands.
>Safely off of your target's street, she slows down.
>She reaches over her shoulder to further push the small window into the cabin open.
"I'm not going to fit-"
>"You'll fit!" The yellow eyes of the bald eagle narrow.
>You grumble, and stand from the bed of her truck.
>Despite needing some extra force to get your waist through the window, you eventually plop down onto the plush backseat.
>You breathe deep, and collapse against the cushion at your back.
>"Think that was a good outreach strategy, Provi?"
>The eagle snickers. "Ah, they'd never vote our way anyways. Communist scum like them are the reason why the "Marxist Club" is even allowed on our campus." She keeps her eyes on the road ahead, her talons gripping tighter to the wheel.
"I guess you're right." You blink. "Most fun use of campaign resources ever."
>"Right? I knew I'd get you to have some fun." Provi has an American flag bandanna wrapped around her white-feathered head. The beginning of her brown feathers at the base her neck stick from her black tank-top. "So, you gonna stay back there?" her voice is low.
>She turns out of the neighborhood, and onto the main highway. The green and brown shrubbery typical of Oregon's chapparal covers the land along the sides of the freeway
"You want me up there?" you ask, raising an eyebrow.
>"Can you blame a girl for wanting some eye candy?"
"Are you hitting on the Vice President? How irresponsible, Secretary." You smile.
>You climb into the front seat.
>She sits right beside you on the bench. The multiple lanes of the highway stretch on.
>The sun was setting over a mountain range in the distance.
>"Time to go home, huh?" There's a longing in Provi's voice. Her talons rest on the cushion beside you, inching toward your thigh.
"Tomorrow, we're going to win."
>Her claws move to your upper thigh. "I know." Her talons poke you as she squeezes you.
>Your hesitate at her grasp.
>Her beak remains shut, eyes fixed on the road ahead.
>The bald eagle takes her other claws off the wheel to turn on the radio, before returning them to the wheel.
>Some Duran Duran song comes on, and Provi doesn't smile like she usually would.
>The bird doesn't bob her head along with the bassline like she always does.
>"I don't want this to end," she mutters, her muscles tensing beneath her fluffy coat of feathers. "I don't want 'us' to end."
>She punctuates her point by pulling you against her fluffy side. Her blue jeans are a shade lighter than yours.
>"This isn't just about the election anymore."
>You put your hand over her claws, gripping to the coarse yellow scales.
"No, it isn't." You speak gently. "Provi, I've enjoyed campaigning with you more than with anything else in college so far."
>"And I've learned so much from you." The bald eagle builds on your compliments. "I thought you were a bit of a square at first, but you really care." There's the slightest mischievous edge to her sincerity.
"I'm not a squa-" your voice catches as she turns to stick her beak between your lips.
>She pries your mouth open with the hard implement, and buries her slimy tongue inside.
>The taste of the long, tube-like invader is slightly salty.
>Provi pulls away as quickly as she engaged to focus on the road once more, leaving your lips slick with her avian saliva.
>"You're not a square, humie?" she spreads her legs, the edges of her beak perking upward in a wicked smile. She gestures down to the floor with her beak. "Prove it."
>Your mouth hangs open.
>Was she seriously suggesting this?

>be KGB agent
>grow disillusioned with communism and defect to the west
>CIA sets you up with a new identity in exchange for whatever intelligence you have
>move to America and score yourself a well paying job. along with a nice house in the country.
>nothing much happens for the next few years
>then one day you get a knock on the door
>"that's strange. who could it be at this hour"
>open the door. only to find the KGB bear wife you left behind standing there.

>holy shit your job sucks
>the life of a wagie is not a pleasant one
>even worse when you're stuck doing overnights
>nobody likes a gloomy nightstalker who wakes up past noon every day
>you're in the middle of hauling a box of cleaning supplies up into storage when your phone starts buzzing
>who the hell is calling you this late?
>you check your phone
>it's Brittany
>you answer instantly, not wanting to miss your friends call
>you hear Brittany's sing-song voice teasing you through the speaker
>"Anon~ Did you forget what tonight was?"
>oh no
>you did forget what tonight was
>the full moon
"The full moon!"
>"That's right! You better get over here soon, or else you might be in trouble."
>you drop what you're doing and make a break for the store's front door
>hopefully they're not locked yet
>you zoom past your manager, who questions what the fuck you're doing
"Sorrygottagojustrememberedihavecovid!"
>and you're gone before he can manage a response, out into the night air
>you hear Brittany snickering through the phone still clutched in your hand
>you slam bodily into the side of your car, working the door-handle frantically for several seconds
>the keys
>idiot
>you unlock the car and climb in, tossing your phone on the seat beside you as you punch it
>"Ooh, I don't know if you'll make it, Anon. I think I'm--Oh!"
>her bubbly voice lowers suddenly in pitch
>you hear movement, the tearing of fabric
>"Where aaaare you Anon?"
>there's a snarl at the edge of Brittany's voice now, as it gets more husky and bestial
>you tear down the streets, weaving through the late-night traffic as fast as your shitty four-banger can go
>only five minutes to Brittany's place
"Almost there! Almost there Brit!"
>"Taking too long. I NEED you Anon! You can't hide from me."
>you are not hiding
>you swing onto her street, blazing past high-class houses toward the biggest one at the very end
>so close!
>WOOPWOOP
>red and blues light up behind you
>this has got to be a joke
"Fuck!"
>you slam on the breaks, veering over to the side of the road
>there's just snarling on the other line
>that is not a good sign
>you hang up as the officer approaches your car
>you give him all the excuses you can manage to come up with along with your license and insurance
>he returns a couple minutes later with a ticket
>"You're lucky I'm not arresting you. Drive home safe."
>you thank him profusely and roll down the street
>praying for your poor bones which will surely be ground to dust
>you make it to Brittany's property, the long driveway hidden behind high hedges
>there's not a light on inside or outside, making it near impossible to see anything
>you're halfway out the door when something snatches your arm to drag you the rest of the way out
>you're held in the air by your arm, face to face with a snarling monster right out of Victorian folklore
>"Anoooon! Laaaaate!"
>her hot breath washes over your face, giving you a view of her tooth-filled maw as she admonishes you
>you open your mouth to make excuses, but Brittany simply uses the opportunity to stuff it with her tongue
>the organ fills your mouth, choking you as she forcefully makes out with you
>she pulls out, giving you a chance to breath
>but she's not done, her tongue travels from your mouth over your face and hair
>over and over the heavy organ slides over you until your entire upper body is covered in werewolf saliva
>once she's satisfied, Brittany lowers you to the ground and pushes you against your car
>with her other hand, she traces a razor sharp claw over your cheek
>"Myyy Anoooon."
>in a flash, all your clothes are gone
>all shredded to bits and left dangling from your now nude frame
>that claw now runs up the length of your already erect member
>fear is a potent aphrodisiac
>it gets even harder
>Brittany wastes no time, straddling you with her legs while one powerful arm adjusts your position against the car to line up with her dripping cunt
>she has you mounted against the car
>Brittany presses herself against you, enveloping you
>you thrust your hips forward, forcing your cock into her as she takes you to the hilt
>you wrap your arms around her, your face pressed against the soft fur of her chest
>her breasts completely engulf your head
>this is heaven
>Brittany howls out to the moon, relishing her willing conquest
>and then she starts to thrust, using the car for leverage to roll her hips back and then slam down on you again
>your legs and thighs are already soaked with her juices
>your cock throbs inside her, her muscular insides squeezing you tight despite her size
>"Miiiine!"
>she roars the word
>thrusting faster and faster
>her free paw clutches and tears at the roof of your car, rending long lines in the bodywork
>that's gonna be expensive
>the stray thought is jarred from your mind by another thrust from Brittany
>she snarls and huffs wildly
>you buck into her desperately, working to pleasure the wild beast
>your fingers rake through the fur on her back
>you cling onto her like your life depended on it
>pressure and heat builds with every thrust
>you're getting close
"So close! Come on, fuh--fuck me Brittany!"
>you encourage her on, faster and harder
>"Yeees! Cuuum! Miiiine!"
>she roars as you twitch and spurt inside her
>your breath hitches and shudders and your back arches to force yourself as deep inside her as you can
>Brittany doesn't let up, continuing to fuck you through your orgasm
>and past it
>your sensitive member remains painfully hard inside her
>"Not doooone."
>she rumbles
>it's going to be a very, very long night
>you wake up, you don't know what time it is
>you're sore all over
>and painfully dehydrated
>you must have lost half your body weight in fluids last night
>you're no longer laid out on top of your shredded car
>or splayed out on the front lawn
>or rolled up with your legs in the air against a garden wall
>you're instead stretched out on a soft mattress, covered in a heavy comforter
>"Well look who's finally up!"
>you flick your eyes up to see Brittany stepping out of a doorway
>her slim human figure is wrapped in a towel, and steam billows out from the doorway behind her
>"You really gave me a workout last night, Anon! I hope you enjoyed yourself."
>she smiles brightly
>"I left some water on the nightstand, I think you could use it. Breakfast is in fifteen, and be sure to shower!"
>she leaves you to recover as best as you can, dragging your sore body to the edge of the bed to grab the life-restoring drink
>once you're restored and showered, you relax on the bed a little longer
>all things considered, maybe the night shift isn't so bad

>anon gets brutally raped by a trusted friend (wolf)

> "Wait a minute, hold on. Does anyone here actually know what species Anon is?"
> "I thought he was a canine...?"
> "What? No way, the helmet shape is all wrong. Besides, where's his tail?"
> "Maybe he just tucked it in?"
> "Maybe for an hour or so, but all day? That would drive me nuts."
> "A rabbit maybe?"
> "No way. I snuck a peek at his logistics registry, he's definately an omnivore."
> "Well shit, I'm stumped then."
> "Maybe he's some kind of reptile? The suit could be keeping him warm."
> "Maybe... but do you know any reptile species without long tails?"
> "No..."
> "Yeah, I'm stumped too..."
> "..."
> "Maybe... he could be a human?"
> "Shut up Sasha, that's ridiculous."
> "I'm telling you guys, Anon is a human!"
> "Yeah, wouldn't that be great? It'd be nice to have a little bunk warmer around here."
> "I'm serious! Why won't you believe me?"
> "Because it's impossible! Where would we have even picked up a human anyway? You know they hardly leave their own systems."
> "Speaking of, when did we take on Anon anyway?"
> "You know, I'm not sure?"
> "Hasn't he always been here?"
> "Well... I know he wasn't with us when we hit that human freighter a couple months ago."
> "Holy shit, you guys hit a human ship?"
> "Yeah, kinda. We were taking a shortcut through Sirius on our way to a bigger job. Jumped in right on top of a cargo hauler. Didn't want to pass up something like that, so we pounced on them."
> "You didn't miss much. System patrol was hot on our tail, so we couldn't stay. Crew boarded up in their quarters and we didn't have time to get them out."
> "Real shame. So we just grabbed a bunch of their cargo crates and booked it."
> "Really? Damn..."
> "I know right? So close. Totally wasn't worth it. For some reason, we got a kidnapping charge pinged on our ID. That was a total bitch to scrub clean."
> "Weird..."
> "Wait, that can't be right... Didn't we dock at Arcturus after that job?"
> "Yeah, so?"
> "I remember Anon asking me a whole bunch of questions before we docked there, he said it was his first time. He must have been with us then."
> "No way, I swear he wasn't with us before that."
> "Well, one of you must be misremembering. It's not like he climbed in through the airlock or something."
> "Woo! First round in on me!"
> "Somebody is in a good mood."
> "Hell yes! It's finally time for some shore-leave!"
> "Does it really count as shore leave if we're still in space?"
> "Don't ruin this for me. I'm just happy to get out of that tin can for a while, even if this is just a bigger can."
> "All I know is these credits are burning a hole in my pocket, and I'm ready to party!"
> "Woah, check it out! That wolf over by the bar!"
> "Yeah? What about her- oh damn!"
> "Holy shit, that's a human!"
> "Aw! Look at his little collar!"
> "I just want to scoop him up and run off with him..."
> "I think that's why she's got the leash."
> "I want one too..."
> "Pipe down! She's looking right at us and- woah..."
> "Damn, she's really going at it."
> "That bitch. Who does she think she is? First she flaunts him all over the place, then shoves her tongue down his throat..."
> "She could at least let the little guy breathe."
> "Dammit, it's not fair! How come that skank gets her own personal human, and we don't even have one to share?"
> "I haven't gotten laid in months..."
> "Well, if you have a certain itch that needs scratching..."
> "I told you before, I'm not interested-"
> "No no no, listen. A friend of mine passed through this station a couple rotations ago. She told me about this little place, totally off the books."
> "Yeah?"
> "Apparently somebody converted a derelict part of the engineering deck into a place where you can spend the entire night with a real human."
> "Are you serious? A human brothel!"
> "Shhh! Pipe down!"
> "Oh, I am so in. Are you sure you can find the place?"
> "Definately. I had her ping me directions as soon as the captain said we were docking here. So, you all coming?"
> "Hell yes! I can't wait. What about you?"
> "I don't know... it's probably expensive..."
> "You've never had a human before have you? Trust me, it will be worth every credit. They make these cute little noises..."
> "Okay, okay! Fine, I'll come..."
> "Alright! Now it's a party! This is going to be so great!"
> "Do you think they'll let us all share a room?"
> "Probably. What about you Anon? Want to tag along? Maybe we can get a cute human to peel that hardsuit off you."
> "N-No thanks, I'm good."
> "Alright, 'suit' yourself! Ha! See you back on the ship."
