ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

Anyone have any cool ideas for the mythos in their world? Religion? Origin of anthros?

God created fuzzy women as the stock race, and humans are the weird amazon ass civilization that need to be brought to heel to worship superior puss puss.

In the beginning God created man in His likeness and saw that it was good. He saw that it was not good for man to be alone, so he brought him all the beasts of the land and birds of the air and fish of the sea and man gave them names, but for the man there was not found a partner. As the man slept, God remade some of the beasts from man and made woman and brought her to the man and man saw that these women were good. They were all naked and not ashamed.
The serpent woman was more crafty than God's other creations and one day tempted man to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree of knowledge. Now man was doomed with the knowledge of good and evil, but in the likeness of God his heart was full of forgiveness for the serpent. God chastised the serpent and and sentenced her to suffer the pangs of bearing man's children and to be his protector and companion forevermore.

>"Nonny! You've got to come back with me!"
>"Where?" You stammer, still a little shaken up from getting raped by so many Anthros from a time before rape was a misdemeanor.
>"Back to my isl- Is- My I- BACK TO THE FUTURE!!" She shouts over herself.
> She rummages through your trash to reclaim the candid photos you found and threw out yesterday.
>"What are you doing?" Your Foxy GF asks her while she opens the Mrs. fusion reactor on the back of the car.
>Without any shame Emma goons her puffy yeen pussy into the reactor, achieving climax in 5.18 seconds to a photo of your naked back. "I needed fuel."
>"No no, Doc I just got here-"
>She grabs you both by the throats with her freshly lubricated gooning hands, and tosses you into your seats. (You get back seat of course)
> Fops waifur beans you in the face to get back out of the seat. "Doc, what's this got to do with me and Anon? What, does he become MGTOW or something?"
>"Nonono, you and assnon, I mean cocknon, I mean Anon who I will rape turn out fine! It's your kitts! Anon jr. is trying to have a relationship with a human woman, and 2 of your 75 daughters support his decision!"
>GF does her locks the fuck in face
>Car pulls out of the driveway so hard that the pitbull on the sidewalk never stood a chance.
>Racial police one block away thank Omnifur that they can finally shoot a yeen for an actual crime.
>"Hey Doc, we're going to need to back up, we don't have enough road to outrun the cops before we reach 88."

.

>TFW when the realization that you were bred and born only to be emotional support for your cheetah childhood “friend”

Cheetah mom grooming you to only focus on her daughter. Makes sure you never develop strong interests that don't involve her daughter. You never question why everything you do revolves around her, it just seems natural to you. Any time you try to act out of line, you get corrected instantly by a very big Meow.
You help make an entire bloodline, and you think that it was your idea.

How would Cheetah mom deal with Anon starting falling for her instead of her daughter ?
How would Cheetah reacts to the idea of loosing her Anon to her own mom ?

What behaviors and actions that would be considered innocuous/normal by humans but would trigger anthros's "must protect/cuddle" instinct hard?

>go out at night
>swimming
>going out in cold weather

>and now a single human too
>the current landlord, a slightly older she-wolf, shows to your new apartment
>kept getting weird almost angry looks from every wolf you passed and landlady wasn't much better
>guess the fact you weren't family wasn't settling too well with them
>decided it was best to stay quiet, out of trouble, and out of the way of all the wolves
>you left them alone and they left you alone
>end up chatting with one of the older she-wolves one time when you bring groceries to your apartment and she was out smoking

>from then on your getting all sorts of wolves knocking at your door just saying they were checking on you everyday
>different wolf families asking you want to come over for diner
>the mother wolves kept coming by to give you various things they cooked since they always make a lot since they share with the whole pack

>Always watching for when I fuck up anything, so she can pounce me.
>Shockingly, we are now the only positively reviewed fast food joint in the area.

Did you know that the anthrostate has purposefully plotted to make all of society low key fem-findom?
Like the way the government defunds and disinsentivises male-work programs, or the way it gets cold feet whenever a refferedom for making it illegal to pay male workers less gets proposed, or the way all the TV and advertisements push this agenda about how its acutually empowering for a man to spend all day at home cooking and cleaning.
They're trying to keep us broke so we're reliant on our wives for anything that costs money!
I won't take this blatant discrimination laying down! Men deserve equal pay. They shouldn't have to live under their wives' thumb/claw.
I won't fall for their propaganda! Their games!
I know we can beat them!
I know what they did to the HUMAN wome-
>WE'RE SORRY. THE POSTER OF THIS MESSAGE IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR POSTING.

All of you are familiar with /adhg/ settings in an anthro state but what about settings where humans are struggling to remain the dominate species over the large rape monsters that roam the land.

>monster hunter, but humans are an all male species and every monster species is all female and needs the humans in order to breed
I will now put this in my idea roster

I like a world with normal relations between the sexes but you just happen to date into a family that practices extreme matriarchy.
Better for being disabused of your delusions of authority, broken down humiliated and brought to heel.

the closest I have to it at the moment is this old promp
>Be dating a lioness
>Things seems to be going well
>Then she starts setting up dates and trying to hook you up with her sisters and some of her friends
>They keep pressuring you to quit your job and move in with then
>One straight out says that you should let they bring in the money and food and your job should be just to look good, take care of home and watch over the cubs
>You said that neither you nor any of them have any cubs
>Your first lioness just laughed and says that they will take care of that by spring

Worlds where anthros are dominant societly miss out on the unique opertunities where female anthros are submissive generally.

>Be Anon
>Be at collage
>Get an internship at an office along side an extremely shy and demure anthro girl
>You never payed much attention to her and she also never really spoke much
>Every day the rest of the office dump piles of work on both you, forcing you to do overtime while everyone else checks out and go home
>One day after the normal shift you fellow intern call you to look at something on her paperwork pile
>As soon you came near her she pins you against the wall and aggressively forces her toungue in you mouth
>Afer a few second of oral rape she pushes you away
>She looks deep into your eyes with a cheeky smile on her face
>"No one will ever believe you"

>spend 4 years in law school
>completely wasted your time because you're a human
>every time you have to defend someone the other lawyers will just ask the judge for permission to rape you which invalidates all your points and gathered evidence the second they're riding you bareback on the middle of the courtroom
>you've won zero legal battles
>but you did have about fifty offspring with seven anthros twice your size this far

>be you
>anon
>just a normal dude living a normal life
>in the Magical States of America
>you know, normal stuff
>you work with a couple goblins in an office building
>have to look out for centaurs on the way to work
>gnolls playing pick-up rugby that devolve into laugh riots
>that sort of normal stuff
>you just moved to the city for your job
>one day you're having lunch at the park outside your office when something taps you on the thigh
>"Um hello."
>look over
>it's a kobold standing by the bench you're sitting on
>a little red one with jagged horns and a raggedy t-shirt and big soft eyes
>she's small and scrawny and looks terrified
>"Kobold sorry to bother, but you share? So long, no food and--"
>she starts to tear up
>great big teardrops that roll down her snout and fall to the ground with a soft 'plop'
>"--B-bad kobold should not beg but--"
>with balled up fists she struggles in vain to wipe the tears from her eyes
>"--p-please just a bite..."
>you finally relent
>your heart isn't made of stone
>you rip your sandwich in half and hand it over
>the kobold takes it with a happy squeak and hops onto the bench next to you
>she snaps up the half sandwich in an instant
>then just sits there, happily swing her feet that don't reach the ground and humming to herself
>you do your best to ignore her as you finish your lunch
>lunch hour’s over
>you get up from the bench
>the kobold hops up from the bench
>you walk back to your office building
>the kobold follows you back to your office building
>you stop at the front door
>the kobold bumps into you at the front door
"What are you doing?"
>the kobold looks up at you and smiles
>"Following you!"
>you wave her off
"I don't have any more food."
>the kobold cocks her head to the side
>her tail twitches
>"Yes."
>she really doesn't get it does she?
"I have to go back to work now. Inside. This is my company's building."
>the kobold nods eagerly
>"It's a very nice building!"
"Okay. Bye."
>you go inside
>"See ya!"
>four hours later you walk out of the office building
>the kobold is there
>she's sitting on the sidewalk looking down
>but then she hops up when you walk outside
>"Hi!"
>you stare at the little red kobold
>her tail is wagging
>her ruby eyes are shining
>you roll your eyes
"I can't give you any more charity. I don't have any money or food."
>the kobold shrugs
>you keep walking
>"That's okay. We go home!"
>you make it down to the subway
>so you can argue with the little thing while you're waiting for your train
"You're not coming home with me. I don't know you."
>the kobold gasps
>"Oh! Oh no! So sorry!"
>she bows down at the waist, tail sticking straight up in the air
>and she speaks, still reverently bowed
>"Am Yip! Kobold! Yip serves you forever and ever and a day!"
>she announces so loudly her voice echoes around the station
>a few other humans look over in confusion
>a pack of goblins break into snickers
>an elf scoffs and takes to big steps away from you and the kobold
>you blush
"What, just because I gave you a sandwich?"
>Yip remains bowed
>"Yes master."
>you hiss
"Don't call me that."
>"But you are master! You provided for Yip. Now Yip is your kobold, master. Yip!"
>you groan
>just your fucking luck
>another mouth to feed
"Shouldn't you be serving a dragon or something?"
>Yip's body stiffens
>her upright tail turning into a rigid pole
>damn that thing is as thick as she is
>"There are lots and lots and lots of kobolds. Not lots of dragons.
>she whimpers
>"Not enough dragons. Lots of bad kobolds, no masters."
>oh
>well fuck now you feel kind of bad for her
>you sigh as the train rolls up
"And if I take you in, you won't make a mess? Or eat all my food?"
>Yip hops upright and beams
>"No master! Yip will eat leftovers! Yip can clean!"
>Yip hums happily as she follows you onto the train
>and when you take a seat she hops up on your lap and wraps her tail around you
>"Yip has a master~"
>oh boy
>what have you gotten yourself into
>the kobold doesn't let go of you the entire train ride
>you get whispers and stares from the rest of the train's passengers
>you do your best to ignore them
>and ignore the feeling of Yip's body, swaying with the motion of the train, rubbing against your lap
>you're only human, and she's a warm, mostly soft body rubbing up against you
>thankfully she doesn't seem to notice when you get your stop and go to leave
>the kobold trails behind you
>by now the others on the train ignore you
>but you do get a snort from the centaur that's waiting on the platform to board
>he glares at you and the kobold
>"Degenerate."
>Yip stops, staring at the horse-man as he stomps past onto the train
>"Master."
>she whispers
>"I should kill him? He insults you!"
>you blink a few times, parsing her words
"What? No! Don't-- You shouldn't-- No!"
>you're pretty sure she couldn't do more than gnaw the centaur's ankles, but you didn't want to make things worse
>you rush home
>Yip stays at your ankles, keeping up easily
>you let yourself into the living room/kitchen of the cozy apartment
>still a mess from the move
>but you have the essentials
>a couch
>a TV
>a fridge with eggs and half a bottle of ketchup
>piles of clothes
>yep
>living the life
>Yip seems to think so
>the kobold gasp's the moment she steps inside
>"Master's home! So nice!"
>she snaps a rigid salute
>"Yip gets to work now!"
>before you can stop her, she disappears down the hallway to the bedroom
>in no time she's a blur of energy
>using cleaning supplies you didn't even know you had
>you amble to the kitchen and start making some eggs for dinner
>then Yap somehow appears at your side and chases you off
>"Yap cooks! Yap cooks for master."
>okay
>you don't mind
>somehow she knows how to cook like a pro
>she uses salt AND pepper
>and she washes up afterwards
>after dinner you sit down on the couch
>and Yap is there, waiting with hands folded hopefully
>"Master mates Yap now?”
>you choke
"What?!"
>startlingly fast, Yap pulls herself up on your lap, draping her arms around your shoulders, molding her small body against you
>her tail curls around your leg
>"Master has no mate. Master use kobold! Yip is good kobold. Yip wants mate with master!"
>she already has your shirt unbuttoned
>and she going for the pants
"Whoa! I can't just-- Yip! Yip, no!"
>you try to stop her, grabbing her shoulders to push her away
>the kobold just squirms out of your grip, managing to grind her body against you as she evades your grasp again and again
>"Yip yes! Yip is good kobold. Good kobolds mate with master!"
>this is going way too far
>you JUST met her!
>but she's already pulling off her tattered t-shirt
>her body is petite, scrawny but not starved
>warm red scales, smooth and softened to pink on her belly and chest
>small, but perky breasts, and bottom heavy hips that your imagination can't help but dream of how they'd fill out once she's had more food in her
>but this is going to far
>she's already got your pants down somehow
"You can’t mate with me! I’m human!"
>Yip freezes
>then she smiles
>"Human is okay! Yip is city kobold! Very tolerant!"
>you can't get her off of you
>but you sure as hell can get away
>you stand up, with Yip still clinging to you
"No. No way you--Aghfuck!"
>the tail wrapped around your leg clamps down
>Yip twists suddenly, clambering down your body to wrap her arms around the other leg
>you go down
>and she's on top of you again
>sitting on your chest
>by the time you come to your senses, you realize your cock is already out
>because Yip is stroking it with her tail
>"Bad master! Master supposed to take care of kobold!"
>Yip scoots forward, wrapping her thighs around your head
>her pussy is surprisingly human
>soft and pink
>you can tell because she's pressing it against your lips right now
"Stop! Wait! I'm the mast--mmf!"
>your objections are muffled by a mouthful of kobold
>you shut your mouth to try and avoid the inevitable
>Yip growls
>the sound is adorable, like an angry puppy
>less adorable is how she manages to leverage her weight on your shoulders to keep you pinned
>and the forceful grinding against your chin and lips
>"Master is bad! Good master takes care of kobolds! Good kobolds take care of master!"
>you make one last attempt to push her off, dragging your legs under you to push against the ground
>that stops immediately as her dexterous tail wraps around your balls and squeezes
>you let your body fall flat, and glare up at Yip
>she regards you, red eyes flashing in triumph as she pulls her hips back a fraction
>"Master will be good?"
>you grunt
"Can I talk?"
>"No."
>the thighs squeeze around your head again, warm scale squishing your face as your mouth is covered once again
>"Kobold was bad last time. Trusted old master too much. Old master threw us out. This time kobold is good! Kobold make sure master knows better. Kobold teach master how to be good."
>all the while she's talking, Yip grinds her pussy on your face
>getting sloppier as she goes, smearing your cheeks, chin, lips with more and more of her arousal
>she finishes by pressing her lips to yours and looking you in the eye
>"Be good master and Yip be good kobold."
>fuck
>you really don't have a choice
>you just have to eat this kobold's pussy while she strokes your cock with her tail
>and she squishes you with thighs that managed to remain plump in spite of her otherwise scrawny figure
>okay
>maybe you actually want this
>"Be. Good."
>Yip grabs a fistful of your hair
>but you're already opening your mouth
>Yip's claws immediately release your hair as she coos
>"Good master~"
>the tail stroking your falters a moment as you press your tongue into her
>she hisses
>"So deep!"
>you barely started and she’s already shaking
>but the way she's squeezing it doesn't seem like she wants you to stop either
>Yip squeezes your cock in the coil of her tail, running from base to tip
>the sensation of smooth, warm scales lubricated with your own pre-cum, is more pleasurable than you expected
>it has you twitching almost as bad as Yip herself as you swirl your tongue over her clit
>she shivers and shakes
>"T-too much!"
>she grabs your head
>pulling away
>"Master is being--being too good! Yip still needs mating!"
>the tail squeezes you one last time, playing at your tip
>"Master will be good if Yip lets master up?"
>you look up to her, still glazed in her lust
>and you nod
>"Carry Yip. To bedroom. Master should mate with kobolds in bed."
>Yip shuffles back, crawling gingerly with her knees until she's on your lap
>you rise
>pushing off the ground with one arm, the other arm wrapped around her waist
>all the way to the bedroom, Yip's tail stays wrapped around your shaft, pumping away steadily
>clinging onto your shoulders with her claws, and your own waist with her legs
>and the little red kobold keeps her snout in your face, licking your face clean
>though it's more like mixing her saliva with her other bodily fluids
>you stop before a bed that's been stripped of all but the fitted sheet
>you look at it in confusion, before Yip snickers in your ear
>"Yip needs to clean sheets anyways. Now hurry! Yip wants mating!"
>you let her guide you by the tug on your cock
>falling back on the bed with Yip on top
>and in another lithe movement, your cock is trapped between her cheeks
>she grinds on it a moment, gasping
>"Yes! Mating with master~ Good master~"
>Yip leans forward, pushing against your chest to lift herself up
>and with her tail still wrapped around the base of your cock, she lines herself up
>and lowers herself down
>her cunt is tight, befitting her size
>so tight she has to stop nearly halfway down
>it'd be painful if she weren't so wet
>she whimpers, but Yip doesn't give up
>claws digging, teeth grit, hips wriggling
>Yip works all the way down
>"Good kobold~"
>Yip sits there, wrapped around you tight and hot
>you hold onto her hips because it's the only thing you can think of
>every slightest movement sends pleasure through you
>tiny, twitching adjustments she makes for her own comfort have you panting and whimpering
>it's hot
>burning hot
>and her claws feel sharp as glass as they press into your skin
>"Master."
>Yip whines, throwing her head back so her snout is pointed up in the air
>"Master. Master. Master! Yip's master!"
>the whine turns into a growl, then a yowl
>as she starts moving
>grinding back and forth, lifting herself halfway up your cock
>twitching and yipping as she contracts around you, gripping you tight
>then on shaking legs dropping down again and rolling her hips hard this way and that
>it's debilitating
>you can't take it so slow and so long
>you grasp her hips tighter, trying to force Yip to go faster
>but her claws dig into your shoulders
>and her head snaps down, eyes burning red
>"No! No master stays still! Yip almost done! Yip almost done no moving!"
>she babbles furiously
>her grip getting tighter
>claws on your shoulders
>thighs around your hips
>cunt around your cock
>and she grinds
>slowly, forcefully, desperately
>with more power than should be possible in such a small frame she holds you down to rock her hips back and forth
>though she goes no faster, she stares at you intensely
>digging in with her claws harder
>wrapping her tail around your leg
>her moans getting louder, mixed with soft yips and hisses
>and her blazing eyes bore into you
>and she contracts around you with every roll of her hips
>"Good master, good m-master, good master!"
>the last devolves into a moan as she gives a truncated thrust of her hips and clamps down
>if you thought she was tight before, it's unbelievable now
>constricting around you painfully as the little creature climaxes
>you feel almost crushed
>and you cock is left twitching and balls aching from overstimulation
>Yip whimpers through her orgasm
>until finally she slows to a standstill and sighs
>she releases you from her claws, leaving four little pinpricks on your shoulders
>Yip licks her lips as she studies you
>"Good master. Now is Yip's turn. Good kobold make master feel good."
>you pick your head up to ask what she's going to do
>but she shows you in a flash
>hitching her tail up to use your leg
>first pushing off
>then pulling down
>jerking herself off your cock, and then impaling herself to the hilt again harder and faster than she could with just gravity
>your head falls back on the bed
>you see white
>Yip works her hip in a blur, squeezing you with her thighs as she rides you faster than you can perceive in your worked-up state
>just a blur of red, hot pleasure
>"Good--masters--cum--in--kobold!"
>Yip is snout-to-face with you
>admonishing you eve as she rides you so hard you're bouncing off the mattress
>you're close to bursting
>and impossibly, Yip manages to go even faster
>"Be--good--master!"
>you be a good master
>cumming inside Yip as she pistons herself on your cock
>she keeps up the breakneck pace even as you shudder and thrust, arching your back so you lift her off the bed
>but with her tail's grip she just keeps on going
>and you keep on cumming
>filling the little kobold with so much seed than it leaks out of her with every thrust
>making an awful mess of the bed sheet
>with a final buck, you lose your tenuous traction on the sweat-slick sheets, and Yip drives you back down on the mattress
>a final burst of pleasure that leaves you reeling and gasping
>Yip slows to a halt, dragging herself off your cock with a coo of satisfaction
>"Good, good master~"
>leaning down, she presses a scaly kiss to your lips
>for a while you lay there, catching your breath and holding your kobold
>when there's a knock on the door
>you blink lazily
"Huh?"
>Yip gives you another kiss
>"No worry master. Is just other kobolds."
>you barely comprehend
"Other kobolds?"
>Yip hums
>"My sisters. Good kobolds come in packs."
>she picks her head up and calls down the hall
>”Come in! Yip unlocked door!”
>you hear a babble of at least three more chattering kobold voices entering your apartment
>gasps and exclamations and cries of ‘master’s home!’
>”In here!”
>Yip calls to her sisters
>you hear feet rushing for the bedroom
>Yip smiles down at you
>”Good kobolds share, too!”

Being physically stronger than human men is one of the best parts of anthro women. Simping femdom is just basic bitch boring.

>Human woman tries getting you to simp for her
>Based Harecel picks you up off the ground, and takes you back to the burrow for some inter species relations, away from white women.
>A few months later sales of carrots have octupled (How strange?)
>"Can higgers even compete?"

"Too freaking warm for a coat..."
>I chided myself under the fading hues of twilight
>the rising moon was almost as yellow and shining as gold, growing to a straw color as it rested to the opposite horizon of the sun that scattered the last light through late summer clouds
>although this was the moon christening the first lunar eve of autumn, no sign of the light chill came like I anticipated
>this evening was balmy, and a little humid. the kind of warm day where the air must take time to let off the heat before any cooling breeze could come and sweep away the heat radiating off the concrete, stone and tarmac of the small township street
>my phone was vibrating
>ugh
>I felt that little tugging at my chest. That little jolt of something between anxious dread and a tired spite
"Ngh... What now...?"
>I grumbled. I didn't want to text her right now
>frankly I couldn't stand to say her name
>or think about her stupid face
>she was the reason I wasn't even in home right now, buying cheap booze and walking as far as I could
>"Where are you? I was not done talking to you!"
>I felt the hot feeling of anger and the tensing of muscle in my face as I tried to hate her away
>my fingers channeled the spite and frustration in the back of my throat
"Oh yeah? well I was. leave me the fuck alone."
>so fucking tired of this bitch, saying just that to her was deeply cathartic
>I was tired of being always wrong, always profiled as the antagonist, always having my vulnerabilities turned against me like jagged knives
>the only regret I had right now was leaving with just my wallet, phone and pocketknife
>still on my phone, I texted my best friend, Philip
"Hey man, big fight with Gina. I think I'm done..."
>"Shit bro, I'm sorry... what are you going to do?"
>I replied pretty fast. on second look the way I wrote my last message seemed a bit too final not to make a friend worry
"Right now, I'm gonna find a nice quiet motel to drink and cool off in. then I'm going back once I'm sober, packing my shit and getting the fuck out of there for good. Gina can keep the place, I want nothing to do with anything she's so much as touched."
>"alright, if you need a place to crash after the fallout. you go ahead and let me know."
>if ever there was a reward for dealing with someone like Gina for as long as I had. it was having a friend in Philip
>he was the gentle sort; was I can remember at least 2 occasions where he very gingerly voiced concerns over Gina
>I wished I'd listened sooner
>Phil was never the kind of guy to hold it over my head, even when he felt the need to say 'I told you so'
>the moon was higher now, its hue more like a straw color now. and the lamps appeared brighter in the lower light
>what a piss poor night to explode
>though, on the other hand, it's a great night to break a few chains
>even if that took a breakdown and an epiphany while I was being emotionally raked over the coals
>this was for the best
>the local motel should be this way... but...
>this brush around me feels a little much
>isn't there anyone taking care of this side street?
>the brick wall with grey capstones along its length was swallowed by vines, shrubs and all kinds of the local vegetation
>maybe the city's been slacking off here
>checking my phone along the road to see if I'd somehow taken a wrong turn didn't help
>no signal
>whatever, I'll wait till I see a landmark with some Wi-Fi and course-correct then
>a breeze came along, frigid in that unforgiving way
>and the streetlamps appeared more and more antiquated
>the realization suddenly hit me
>where was the ambient heat?
>why was the pavement replaced with dirt?
>the moon...
>that was not my moon
>nevermind the lack of any yellow, it was... different. characteristic dark markings looked like nothing what I knew
>it was a face, skeletal and sunken, screaming silently in terror... forever
>no plausible deniability or rationalization would ever shirk the fact that something was wrong
>not with the evidence in the sky, glowing balefully
>and now with any illusion gone. something was indeed, horribly, excruciatingly... wrong
>to my right where the brick garden wall was before replaced with the thick foliage of vines and brush
>my heart pounded in my chest with a pure panic that had no way out, no outlet to react against and no
>how did I get here? why am I here? is this a dream, or hallucination?
>it took all of my will to check my phone a second time
>the time was midnight... and I stared at it long enough for a minute to have definitely passed
>the rationalist within me was still fighting tooth and nail, however. and I used my phone's timer to test if a minute had passed
>a full 60 seconds on the stopwatch... and yet midnight remained on the clock
>an epiphany, like a glacier crept into the back of my mind like it was crawling up my spine- brining terror as its companion
>an urge, a dreadful thirst to know for certain, a need to see
>the impulse begged me: 'look behind you. you must know, you must see if you can turn back'
>I had to wrench control from the sense of impending doom to turn my head to see the path behind me...
>horror... pure, pitch black, as sharp as knives and cold as ice, swallowed me whole
>the lamps that were my loyal attendant through the night on the path behind me were gone
>replaced by a narrow dirt road who's only feature it shared with the one I knew was high wall of vegetation on the easternly side
>the path behind stretched into the shadow beyond the border of the lamp I stood near like a child clinging to his mother
>I felt like I was going to vomit, faint, and suffer a heart attack all at once
>the only thing that vaguely gave me any succor was the stretch of lamps that seemed to go on still on the narrow, winding and uncertain road ahead
>no other options, I had to walk on into the path encased by a canopy of gnarled trees and flickering, now somehow encased-flame lamplight
>another thing to add to the long list of things that inexplicably changed some time along my trek to a motel
>the trees above obscuring the sky gave me a little solace, at least
>I was starting to get the sensation that awful, vile moon was watching me...
>my lack of any means of defaulting to my visual senses made my ears more sensitive, small noises caused my eyes to dart in its direction somewhere in the dark, praying each time it was merely the wind
>I still had the cider, rum and vodka I bought from the liquor store...
>while still walking, I take one of the many Wayfarer Cider bottles and uncap it with my pocketknife
>after a hardy swig from the bottle, my eyes wandered to its label as I savored the sweet and tart taste
>the oval depicted an armed, journeying adventurer at night by a river under the crescent moon. motioning to cut free an apple shiny like a candy red by its stem between a dagger and his thumb from a wizened and knotted old tree that hung over him, almost with a kind of benevolence
>irony, thy name is wayfarer tonight
>I wish right now so badly to switch places with the man in the drawing
>not upon any star though... no star in these skies was my comrade
>no, definitely not
>warmth was spreading to my extremities again a bit more, and the edge of everything was starting to fade away
>I could at least walk with a bit more uprightness now
>still following the lamps, and still afraid
>but with some comfort
>a small itch in the back of my skull told me that the lamps I passed by I would never see again
>and once more, upon checking- that instinct was woefully correct
>I wasn't sure what I expected by now. this evil place, whatever it is- has pulled the floor from under me 3 times before already
>whatever this place was
>it was somehow, someway, out to get me
>that much I think is an undisputed fact
>part of me also realizes these lamps could be some kind of ploy
>like the bulb of an angler fish baiting an unsuspecting prey near enough its sharp, glassy needle-toothed maw to handle the rest
>I really need to stop with the imagery, Christ...
>I'm frightening myself unnecessarily
>my hand lingers a bit on my pocketknife in my jacket, a token of feeling at least a little prepared for something to happen
>eventually the forest road dotted with those lamps still faithfully flickering with warm light opened up, and there were no more posts beyond the few ahead and behind that I could make out
>end of the line...
>I couldn't help but notice the pattern
>my whole walk has been characterized by the world changing incrementally, each time intended specifically to make me afraid, and to draw me into one particular direction
>but the real question was, was this by design? deliberate? or was the fear just some kind of byproduct of a place truly terrible?
>going back doesn't seem wise, my gut tells me those shadows are somehow lethal in ways never, ever want to know
>and my gut has been right two times in a row tonight
>the only way to know was to have courage and go forward
>I brandish my knife in my right hand and hold the bag of bottles in my left like a flail in my left. and I walk into the haze barely illuminated with moonlight
>I didn't bother using the flashlight on my phone. I wanted to preserve as much charge as I possibly could. so much so that I completely shut it off
>it would negatively affect my natural vision in the low light too, something by now I was able to depend upon
>I wandered the wooded road; somehow subtly aware I was properly "inside" these woods now. like the path with the streetlamps was some kind of... bridge, neither really here nor there
>It felt far more supernatural than these woods
>no... thats not right. not *more* supernatural... but different, more transient and strange
>I don't know... it just felt less... real? like it wasn't made of "stuff" like everything else is
>like that part in the beginning of a dream that feels like its just you, thinking about whatever as you nod off and your thoughts slowly turn to a proper dream
>more like a nightmare here though
>maybe this is all just a bad dream
>maybe I actually made it to the motel, and this is just an alcohol fueled fever dream jumpstarted with the turmoil of dealing with my gi-... *my ex*
>maybe...
>certainly doesn't feel like a dream though. the fact that I'm as lucid as I am and somehow not in control at all of what I see in front of me
>no, for all its incredible qualities, this was real
>terribly, horribly, morbidly real...
>small, uneasy sounds became more common now
>some were because of me slowly wading through the dark, the earth and leaves lightly crunching underfoot
>eventually, the path no longer is a road nestled under an oaken tree line
>the forest byway stops completely, only some parts of it suggest anything resembling a beaten path
>I needed to decide what my heading would be or else I'd be aimlessly wandering until I starved or something unsavory found me
>my path until now was pretty consistently northbound. so that's what I would stick with
>but here I had no idea what north really was
>I looked again to the moon that looked like a damned soul, and for the time being that would have to suffice as my north
>it wasn't in the same position as the old moon anyway
>its pale light helped me see more than 10 feet in front of me clearly
>the path opened up slightly, less thick with trees
>as I skulked around the forest, following the path of the moon, I came upon a grotto nestled in the forest again
>much deeper within, I could see a faint firelight glow
>by now even with the cider still numbing me slightly, i was wiser than to rush toward any light warmer than the pale blueish of the moon
>through the trees, I crept towards the light
>the silhouette of a small, wooden cottage took shape, still with the faint glow
>only now I could perceive it was coming out from the windows
>I edged to the corner of the cabin, trying to see through the glass and inside to check for signs of life
>nothing... nobody was home
>creeping towards the door, I turn the heavy iron latch and slowly and quietly let it swing open
>a small number of chairs of different kinds and sizes all huddled around modest, low table
>in the first room, there was an assortment of hanging oil lamps. only one was lit at the moment
>just enough to illuminate the room, subtle and dim
>on the far wall of the living room, a cast iron oven and hearth sat, looking like it was retrofitted to be part of the old traditional hearth
>the coals from within the small slats in the door of the opening burned brightly, casting little slits of light into the room
>what stood out to me the most however, were the weapons
>they were everywhere, some by the chairs, many more hung up on the walls
>a good few were in some form of decrepitude, some looked like they were obliterated by something big
>none of them appeared like they were made any later than the 19th century, mostly flintlocks. but a scant few looked like they were for rim or centerfire cartridges
>the second room was a workshop of sorts, tools and disassembled equipment strewn about on desks and counters
>there were even a small forge and anvil
>the room to the left of the entrance held something like a second living room or den, the windows in this spot were much smaller
>connecting to this room was a latrine, and a stairwell that went up to a study and some partitioned sleeping quarters, and a downstairs cellar that had some food in it
>this house was obviously lived in
>but by who? or how many?
>I suppose I could just return when whoever lives here comes back
>it'd be impossible to carry even a fraction of all this
>I put away my knife and take a hatchet, mentally noting this location
>I decided to leave my drinks there in the chilled cellar, the extra weight would have slowed me down
>I kept the empty bottle of cider and the plastic bag though. Stuffing both into my coat pockets, I had something in mind for them
>the modest where the hidden path seemed unique enough to remember this spot generally, but I didn’t trust my memory that well
>i cut a strip of plastic from the bag’s handle as long as I could without ruining it, and tied it to the lip of the bottle
>the other end of my makeshift string I tied to one of the branches at the entrance to the grotto where it meets the clearing
>it glistened in the light of the moon, easily visible from a distance
>satisfied with my handiwork, I carried on, following the direction of the moon
>a moon that I couldn’t help but notice was not moving basically at all
>somehow. The road once again presenting itself to me. Still a path following the direction of my own path
>feeling more confident with a hatchet than with just a knife, I walk down it readily
>the tree canopy once again seemed to encase the road somewhat, and a thick fog seemed to dwell here
>it was perhaps another 30 minutes of treading through the dark that another pin prick of sunset glow through the obscuring haze
>as I got closer though… that unnerving sensation sensation of forboding overtook me again
>on the approach, I began to hear a muffled cacophony of sounds
>the loudest among them was… crying… sobbing
>and another noise that for some reason was paradoxically quieter than the sorrowful wailing
>the sound of men shouting and fighting
>I began to move faster, against my better judgement
>the singular flicker of light I realized was actually two
>and one was getting closer fast
>out of the fog, three men blew passed me
>the third, who was holding a lantern, slowed down from his sprint to look my way and warn me
>”you had better run boy!”
>he he rasped as loud as he could
>just from behind me as my head was turned to the path I’d just taken. The great blasting *CRACK* of a gun went off in the direction of the light that still stood where it was
>followed, by a sickening crunch, the sounds of wet tearing and slopping. And and something like rage and agony bellowing from the mouth of a man about to meet his end
>my head whipped back to the forward path, and I see something that will haunt my nightmares forever
>the source of the sobbing and womanly crying that boomed like it was coming from an amplifier was a great, horrid beast, gored beyond belief, but none the wiser to it’s grievous wounds- new and old
>a man, screaming in agony and a kind of final glorious rage was having his bowels eaten by the fetid thing
>a smoking gun was laid beside him, having missed its shot
>but the stranger was not just laying down
>no, an axe was in his right hand
>and his roar was accentuated by the hard cracking of metal on the bony skull of this terrible thing that looked like an undead, unnaturally long armed chimera of an elk, and a wolf
>fire, FIRE was in his eyes as he refused to die like anything but a man
>“we need to move, NOW!”
>the second man with a lantern said, the rest of the men backing off from the creature
>for some reason, he stopped only to grip my shoulder as my eyes refused to look away from the scene unfolding
>“quickly, John is doing what he can to buy us time!”
>he ran, and all I could still see and hear was that man. John
>”RRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGHGHGHGHGHGHGHHHHHHH…”
>*CRACK, CRACK… CRRACK.*
>each blow was powerful, chipping skull and rending flesh
>a blow like that would have completely brained any beast from back home. though the monster gave no sign of pain, or stopping to do anything but eat his guts and weep
>he fought, wild and hard
>to the bitter end…
>his blows and roar eventually snuffed like a candle. And he was no more
>only when his body finally slumped over dead did my legs obey my pleas to run
>for a quiet, excruciating moment. I know the giant, wretched creature was taking it’s sweet time to savor its latest meal
>this man, John, still in death was buying me time, though I wasted most of it before watching him suffer and perish
>I had never run so fast in my life
>the beating and scuttling of limbs on the earth began following me, first slowly and shambling, then with a terrifying cadence and slow increase in volume that told me this monster was getting closer
>I wasn’t far behind the other men, all sprinting for their lives
>but close to not getting last didn’t count for anything when the man in last would be unmade in the most terrifying and painful ways
>my lungs burned, my legs were so tense I thought they might cramp at any moment, and my heart thrummed with a pain brought on by pure dread
>I practically flew back out into the craggy clearing. Moving as fast as I could toward the cottage
>the shambling, sobbing beast somehow by some miracle lost it’s footing and stabled. Still skidding over dirt and grass as I chased the lantern that jostled in the black
>I was close to the shack again, when the vile thing nearly caught up with me
>”DUCK, GET DOWN!”
>I could feel the beast mere feet behind me as I leapt as hard and as far as I could
>I heard the sound of huge jaws snapping shut, another deafening CRACK of a gun, and the absence of the incessant weeping
>…was I dead? Was I waking up from this nightmare to find myself in the motel with a hangover?
>”…you alright boy? Not injured?”
>… I guess not

>The check up at the hospital regarding your broken legs was over
>Only a few more weeks in a wheelchair and then you could walk again
>Having broken both of your legs in an "accident" as you told the doctors then
>But you knew the truth to your injury and so did a certain someone
>That someone, that was pushing you along the hospital corridor towards the elevator
>Hao, the ever so serious tanuki girl, you had a misfortune of meeting
>You didn't really have a choice back then, forced herself into your life
>"I can roll fine by myself you know?" you tell her
>"And have you rolling off without me? No way." she huffs back
>Arriving at the elevator and going past it, you look over your shoulder
>"Hey we went past it, I can't take the stairs like this."
>"I know." she tells you calm, her eyes focused ahead
>You are getting nervous as you get near the stairs leading down
>She stops you at the edge of the steps
>You look down the steps worried now, as hao leans into your ear
>Inhaling sharply through her nose, making you shiver
>"Since you will be walking again soon, how about we break something else hmm?" whisper in your ear
>"Wait! We are in public, not here please." you turn around in your seat to protest her plan
>"I take that as a yes then." a delightful smile forms across her snout
>"No! WAIT!" you yell as she pushes you across the edge, sending you tumbling down the stairs
>You land at the end hard, the wheelchair slamming into you
>Everything hurts, it's a miracle you didn't crack your skull on impact
>"Well it looks like that didn't work then." she sounds disappointed at the results
>Hao moves the wheelchair off your back and helps you roll over
>"Let's get you back in it." she says
>Taking you by the armpits she begins helping you back into the chair
>"No need to hold on so tight to me, I'm not going anywhere." she teases you while you hold onto her
>"I know." you tell her with a sigh as she sets you down
>"Good." giving you a kiss on the cheek

>Playing my gamestation too much
>Mommy comes and starts yelling at me
>Pushes me down to the carpet with her paw
>Rubs my gamestation in my face and asks me "Is this the most important thing in your life?"
>Then rubs her pussy in my face and says "Or is THIS is the most important thing in your life"
>Apologize and do my best to make it up to her

>accidentally sign up for the wrong gym and they just train dogs there
>you already paid the membership fee.. and the trainer says they to be a personal trainer as well...
>maybe you can just use the employee weight room in the back?
>might as well take the personal lessons. surely they wont be dog themed

>"Pssst, humie, hey wake up."
>Raspy voice entering my ears beside my head, wakes me up
>The canine skull with empty eye sockets greets me from the edge of the bed as i open my eyes
>"Christ, dont scare me like that." as im startled by her closeness
>"What is it?" i ask her
>She turns her head to look over the bedroom door, ears flicking
>"Theres someone in the house." she whispers back to me
>"What!? Wdym ther-"
>My question is cut off as she presses her fuzzy hand againts my mouth
>"Shhhh, not so loud."
>I nod and she lets me speak again retreating her hand
>"How do you know theres someone in the house?" i whisper at her
>She points at her alert pointy dark fur coverd ears
>"I can hear you know, lets hide in the closet."
>"Lets just call the cops HEY!" i try to offer a different approach
>She yanks me out of the bed, carrying me over her shoulder as she skips over to the closet
>Opens it, stuffs me inside and follows behind me
>My vision is filled with anomalous wolf tail and ass as she tries to settle in
>"Its a bit cramped in here." i note
>"Oh i know, come here." she reaches over and pulls me into her
>Fur coverd titties burshes against my face as she hugs me tight
>

>"Cockcage? You some kind of a faggot?"
>Hao cranes your head backwards by your hair, confused by your suggestion
>"W-ell it was just a suggestion, youd have more control over me." you tell her
>She looks disgusted by your words, her other hand slaps your face
>"Ow! Whats that for?"
>You rub your cheek in pain before letting out a yelp from pressure on your dick
>Hao had set down her paw on your dick pressing down on it
>"Listen you idiot, ill tell you how i feel about your suggestion." she huffs angry
>You nod rapibly wanting some relief from the squeeze
>"Im more happy to cut off your dick and balls than put you in a cage."
>"You want me to fuck you in the ass next huh? What is going to be?"
>She hisses at you, pressing her paw down more
>"Im sorry okay! it was just a idea, i thought youd go along with it hao." you plead
>She graps you by the throat, your nose almost touching her snout
>"You know nothing about what makes me tick."
>Her red eyes drilling holes in to your soul
>"This is the last time you suggest anything or it will be your dick on the chopping block. Clear?"
>You nod understading whats at stake
>"Good." she says while lifting her paw off your bruised cock
>You are relived now that your penis is no longer trampled on
>Then she kicks the shit out of you anyway

>"This is beyond fucked."
>You think while hiding in some bushes from your chaser
>Hao had the great idea of having you being chased down in the woods by her with a gun
>You first voiced your thoughts on it but she didn't take a no for an answer
>Resulting in you being tied and tossed in the trunk of her car, heading for the woods
>Arriving at the edge of the forest, she opened the trunk and laid the rules
>"If i catch you, i WILL kill you but if you pass a certain time mark i wont do that."
>"Ill beat you up instead, we clear?"
>She asks while looming over you in the trunk
>You nod, fearing for your life now
>Hao helps you out of the trunk and cuts your ties
>You think of running then and there but she gives you a look that making you stay
>She goes to the side passenger door, opens it and pulls out a rifle
>"Fn fal, 7.62x51. More than enough to shoot you dead."
>Sinister smile on her snout as she shows it off to you
>She pulls out a mag from her camo cargos, inserting it with a click
>"Well? What are you waiting for? Get running idiot!"
>The tanuki tells you, nudging towards the forest with the barrel
>You turn and start running, hoping she wont get you
>"I'll find YOU!" She yells behind you, gunshot following after
>Back in the bush where you lay, hearing shuffling from your left
>You try to get up and run away but Hao bursts through the bushes
>Kicking you in the ribs, forcing you to keel over
>"Found you, you shit." she exclaims in joy
>She stands over you, pointing the barrel of the gun at your chest
>"You know what happens now, don't you?"
>A beeping noise interrupts her, she takes a stopwatch out of her pocket
>"Hmm, i found you before the time ran out so.."
>You really dont wanna die right now
>"Wait! Please don- *BANG* AAAAAA"
>Dirt rising and hitting you in the face from the impact near your head
>Ears ringing you look at hao in disbelief
>"What?"
>"Cant play with you if you are dead silly."
>She smiles before dropping the gun and lunging at you

>hao takes you to the gym, calling you a fat piece of shit on the way there
>she tells you to put on gloves and spar
>1st thing she does is kick me in the balls
>one of the coaches tries to moralfag
>hao pokes him in the eyes then goes back to kicking me while I'm down

>be anon
>have femdom golden retriever waifur
>at least she tries to be femdom, most days she’s just very very affectionate
>she decides one day she wants to try a new fetish
>she put a blindfold on you and she's leading you to the bedroom
>"Okay babe, I've been reading about this online."
>uh oh
>Christa is cute, but she lets herself get too into whatever catches her interest
"Chris, my love, what exactly are we doing?"
>the canine giggles in your ear and presses herself against you
>her boobs squish against your back and all your doubts wash away
>Christa starts undoing your blindfold
>"Alright, so this is pretty controversial on the GHDA threads but my friend Gertie said it was the kinkiest thing we could do."
>oh lord
>not nerdy Gertie
>you can barely understand her lisp, and what you do understand terrifies you
"Listen babe, what you heard..."
>but Christa is not listening, already working at your blinder
>the blindfold comes off and you see in the middle of your bedroom is a cage
>a big metal cage, big enough to hold a human being
"A cage?"
>Christa bounces around to the cage, wagging her tail
>"Yeah! A cage! The thread said how awful cages are but Gertie told me they can really increase sensitivity and make you focus entirely on the woman’s pleasure!”
>you stare at the huge bird cage sitting in the middle of your bedroom
>you're pretty sure it's not supposed to be this big
"Christa...
>"Mistress."
>Christa corrects you
>she's already out of her shirt and skirt
>her tail wags incessantly as she pushes you toward the open door to the cage
>all your protests die as you watch her squeeze into a leather corset
>she jumps in place as she works to slide it up past her hips
>making her breasts bounce hypnotically
"I'll get in the cage Mistress."
>Christa pauses to give you a wide grin
>"You will? Yay!"
>she bounces more, this time with joy
>boy you're feeling pretty joyful too
>you step into the cage, watching the show the whole time
>the jiggling stop once she's got her corset in a comfortable spot
>as always, you feel no need to point out that Christa isn't wearing it right
>the way it scoops her tits and squeezes them together is way too mesmerizing
>one pink nipple, one black stare back at you
>you lick your lips

>Christa hitches up her corset
>the straps that are meant to connect to stockings clink softly
>"Man, it is pretty hot seeing you all caged up. Like you're so desperate for me and you can't break out. Like I own you."
>Christa giggles as she works her panties down her legs
>her tail wagging makes it a bit of a struggle for her
>and a show for you
>until finally she pulls one up and kicks her panties away
>very flexible
>you start to undo your belt
>but Christa gasps
>"Hey! No! You're not supposed to be able to jerk off with your cage."
>she bounds up to the bars, grabbing them to stare you down
>"Tell me, are you desperate? So needy you want to be mindbroken by my pussy? Beg for a single taste?"
>well, you've only been in here for a few minutes
>but you shrug
"Yeah, I wanna eat you out. You know I like it."
>Christa smiles bright as her golden fur
>she bounds back and sits on the bed, spreading her legs wide and beckoning with a finger
>"Come to mistress. You're gonna--Wait!"
>you freeze, reaching for the door
>"This is a trick. You just want me to let me out of your cage. Because you're so desperate and pent up."
"Well, I do wish I could take off my pants. Mistress."
>Christa rolls her eyes
>"Okay, fine, take em off. But you shouldn't get a boner in the cage."
>too late for that
>Christa doesn't look to upset as you drop your pants and stand proudly for her
>she licks her chops
>"Whoa. I guess the cage really is sexy."
>she plays with herself as she watches you
>chewing her lip
>"Well, if you can't lick my pussy from your cage, we'll just have to move on to the next thing. Pegging!"
>you stare at Christa
>she stares at you
>and fingers herself
>"You get started."
>what
>what does she think pegging is?
>what did Gertie tell her?
>"Oh! Right sorry, let me give you the thing!"
>okay this may be going too far
>you were not planning on fucking yourself with a--
>WAP!
>a cell phone slaps you in the chest
>"Okay! You start pegging and I'll watch."
"You want me to...peg. With this phone."
>Christa stops masturbating, a look of concern on her face
>she whines
>"Oh I'm sorry babe. Gertie said it was really hot, even if the sensations aren't the same."
>she gestures at the cage
>"I couldn't fit your gaming PC in the cage though."
>you look at the phone in your hand, and see that open on it is 'Peggle Blast'
>peggle
>pegging
>huh
"So you want me to uh, start playing this?"
>Christa nods, already rubbing herself again
>"Mhm! Gertie says I should feel something on my clit if we go fast enough."
>well
>guess you're gonna play peggle
>it's the phone version so it's kind of shitty
>at least you can watch while you play
>Christa starts moaning as she hears the gameplay from the phone's speaker
>"Oh fuck yeah. You like getting pegged? You like it when mommy puts you in a cage and pegs you?"
>you grunt
>you'd be liking this a lot more if you could jerk off
>but watching is pretty fun still
>she fingers herself like you're putting on a strip tease

>Christa howls and whines as she kicks her legs out

“Fuck Christa that was good.”
>the golden girl whines and pants, her arm still twitching as she rubs herself slowly
>"Hoo yeah baby. I love pegging. I..."
>she picks her head up
>and suddenly the satisfied smile drops from her muzzle
>"Hey!"
>Christa hops off the bed, rushing over in two jumping steps, making her corset fall out of place again
>"Put that penis back inside! This is a cock cage! The cock stays inside the cage!"
>chastised, you step back from the bars
>Christa tuts
>"Really, Anon. They say pegging should be stimulating for the man. As much pleasure for you as me. If you can't cum hands free then we'll just have to move on to something even more extreme."
>she spins about and bends over at the waist
>extreme measures are working
>her tail wags in the air as she searches around under the bed
>"Gertie said if we got really, REALLY kinky we could try this. But it might be so kinky it changes you. Here, put on this dress."
>she throws a long, black garment at you
>it takes a few moments of searching to even find how to put it on
"Christa are you sure about this?"
>she nods her head
>"Gertie said it'd be a whole other world of eroticism. Out of this world."
>you're not sure how to feel about this
>but you throw it over your head, pulling your body through, and arms down the sleeve
>a long flowing garment that goes from head to toe
>Christa gasps and clasps her paws together
>"Oh yes! It's all coming together. Now we just need the accessories."
>another show of her ass produces more accessories from under the bed
>she bounds over to the cage to start your 'makeover'
>and then finally she finishes with a toy she forces in your hand
>you look down at yourself and frown
"Christa, why am I dressed like Count Dooku from star wars?"
>Christa beams
>"It's Sithification!”
>Christa stands and wags, ears perked, panting happily
>you clear your throat
“Listen Christra. Mistress. Er, apprentice. This was fun and all, but maybe we could just go to normal sex now?”
>Christa suddenly growls, her hackles raising
>”I didn’t say you could turn away from the dark side!”
>oh
>right
“Sentry.”
>that’s your safe word
>Christa immediately relaxes
>”Sure! You wanna do cowgirl or–”
“Missionary, so we can kiss.”
>Christa gasps and then growls playfully
>”Ooh you dirty boy. And I thought I was a freak!”
>she pulls open the door to the cage
>it was never locked
>and she picks you up in a bridal carry to toss you onto the bed
>”But next time we’ll try watersports. I just don’t know how we’ll have sex on jet skis…”

My current rapi- Loving wife, has 8 sisters of varied descriptions as well as coat colors, and they would all love to have an exotic human to snuggle with.
On the off chance that you are curious, we don't talk about Vexcis' twin, Evil Vexcis a.k.a. Heckcis
>Leah- bit of a runt at 7'3, blonde, and very affectionate. Probably the most normal since she actually went to medical school. I hear she does that venom snake metal arm shit on people.
>Nadia- core gray, got some scars from 2 campaigns against the pirates, and buncel's. She may demand you cry into her gargantuan bazongas, she does weird stuff to feel in control.
>Ruby- Oddly enough, light brown coat. Developed deep red eyes after birth by coincidence. She has mild psychic abilities; can read your mind if you're upset, or really happy etc. I don't know what she does for work, but I have a feeling it's in crime. Don't ask her if she does crime.
>Carmen- Massive ass, so much ass, you wouldn't believe. Also black, and brown coat. I haven't seen her much since she's in the order of silence, but I know enough that she would definitely want a husband. The girls really like having a man on hand when they need to get closer to Yuria. I mean seriously, that thing was clapping when I was off world-
>Talia- Used to be core gray, Not really sure anymore, got messed up from some kind of chemical accident. Still has fur, but I don't know besides that. She's been reclusive since that happened. Someone should keep her company, especially since women have been going missing in her neighborhood lately.
>Vus'sorva- weird name, and she's from an older litter. Fur white as virgin snow. She's lived on the core worlds for most of her life, so don't expect her to be tolerant of any bullshit. Has at least 20 million Sedika, and a Yacht. I heard she has 4 tits.
>Selkaiyam- bluish coat. Honest to God moral authority shock trooper. Been burning the candle at both ends to get a human.Been busting heads in at ashe dens across the inner colonies, and putting men in their place. She can stretch her body in whatever way she wants. I saw her coil one of her subordinates once.
>Molly- Jet black fur. She's been a hellhound for at least 20 years. I've never met her, but she is in the Sol system now. Women in her line of work do some pretty terrible things on behalf of the queen, so I would stay away if I were you. I don't even know if hellhounds can have males, but I can imagine it would be uncomfortable being leashed to a blood soaked psycho 24/7 for the rest of your life. Apparently she likes baths, and pets behind the ears.

You shouldn't have taken that universe hopping machine to the jurassic timeline. Now you've been captured by a pair of married dinosaurs who want you as their meat dildo/househusband. I hope you're ready for a lifetime of sweaty sex, ass eating and making dinner once they've finished pumping you full of bonding and growth hormones.

Female leopard seals are also larger than males and can be up to 600lb so she'd be bigger than him...

Regular leopard seals are already bigger than humans. Anthros would be massive.
Also, this is the first I'm hearing of this reverse sexual dimorphism in mammals. I thought it was a bug thing.

There are quite a few mammals where the female is bigger like hyenas for example.

>leopard seals
>several monk seal species
>spotted hyenas
>baleen whales
>some bat species
>some rabbit/hares species
>a couple of hamster species
>naked mole rats
>not mammals but bird of prey species have larger females for pretty much every one of them

And so Anon is forced to take an aggressively extremely horny shortstack otter on an otherwise normal date in his small town, while she acts a little like Q if he was a she and unbelievably horny. She quizzes Anon on what’s happened since they last visited around the late 20th century and tries to spend as much time on or in contact with Anon’s dick as possible. (It’s the perfect size/shape to hit her spot with every thrust, and she uses vague alien technology to “assist” him)

>You can barely speak. "I was afraid Talia."
>She shushes you. "No fear. There's nothing for a human to be afraid of. All the bad ones are bound for oblivion, but you, you are loved."
>Talia brings your face in between her breasts, keeping her soft paw pressed against the back of your head.
> Her fur is still stained with blood. She made you watch when she tore the head scientist in half, and let her sisters eat the organs off the floor.
>And despite that, she's caressing you like a lover having you back after a long day.
>Her paw squeezes a little harder to make you lap against her nipple. The soft bud rubbing against your cheek while you suckle.
>"After this, a human will never lead, or command, or prod anything with needles."
>Her natural scent overpowers the gore. The pungent, earthy tones of her coat fill your nostrils as she grips your cock between her fingers.

>The screaming stops for a moment. Kieth bled to death, and now someone else is going to take a turn.
>Talia holds your head, so that you look into her eyes.
>"You will do no evil, and you will be happy."
>She kisses you on the shoulder, partly biting to ensure that the marks from before remain visible.
>The hand on your groin speeds up until there is a massive explosion.
>She perks up to see the commotion, wiping your cum against her thigh.
>"Looks like B wing blew through the outer wall. A pity we couldn't stay any longer. Now we need to carve up the last of the living dead, and then we can get back to what we were doing."
>She slings you over her shoulder.

>cums inside her ass (condom) and pussy (no condom) maybe knocking her up.”

I wish I had a rottweiler/doberman “service dog” anthro (the service is relieving clinically significant depression and suicide prevention (whenever she determines I’m sad, usually with a lot of touching and sniffing, she forces me to cum, fuck her, kiss her very loudly in public with people watching, etc.)) that was actually protected by the legal system so long as she is performing her trained task.

>tfw your service dog alerts in the middle of a grocery shopping trip and you have to beg her to drag you somewhere out of sight rather than just taking you in the aisle like last time
>tfw you got a little sad on your way to a job interview and your service dog remembered that facesitting always cheers you up
>tfw you’re at home crying because no one will ever love you due to your many well documented failures and your service dog takes her little container of instant heat inducer out of her vest and holds it up asking if you really mean any that (you do - you fundamentally hate yourself as a person and do wish you had the courage to end your life)

I would much rather rather date an anthro vaporeon who turns out to have the sex skills of a succubus queen. The meme is real and it’s terrifying. “She is a goddess and her pussy is my altar” level skill. Makes Alma Elma look like a virgin dweeb.

>she kisses you first date and you cum on the spot
>she lets you give you cunnilingus and cum on the instant you feel her cherry at the second
>blowjob at the third and you cum instantly, again at the third
>fourth one and she must have done some juju in your body for you to have that much spunk to give her womb
>she actually did, she cursed you to be her seed provider
>you couldn't get to her house on the 5th day but you're so, so pent up
>look at porn
>feel nothing
>use a toy
>feels like the mildest edging ever
>get so desperate you offer a quickie to a passing by anthro girl
>fail to get erect, she laughs at you and leaves
>feel her slippery body crawl on your back
>instant throbbing boner
>you can't ever feel sexual pleasure if it isn't with her
>welcome to your own personal fishy hell

I need to live in a society where a friend group of foxes starts competing over who gets to date me

When foxes compete over something they scream really loudly do group handstands and sometimes pee on the thing in question. I don’t know what you’re talking about but it sounds serious I guess. Hopefully it works out.

Imagine getting on the bus to work in the morning and a vixen sits on your lap and just pees your pants for you right there in front of everyone and it's not socially acceptable for you to complain because it's just how foxes tell men they want them.
And this starts a competition as every single vixen at work who had eyes for you smells it and tries to stake her own claim. One lifts up her leg and pees on your shoes right in the hall, another perches on the dividing wall between your cubicles and showers you, one of the shyer girls catches you with a cup of pee balanced on top of a door, and even your boss calls you into her office and offers to promote you if you drink it from the tap (there aren't any hard feelings if you say no (which makes saying no harder because she's one of the good ones)).
Only the tod janitor takes pity on you 'cause he's been there before and lets you use his mop bucket to wash yourself and your clothes in the WC while he stands guard. The smell doesn't really come out and holding your clothes under the hand dryer is so slow you put them back on while they're still a bit warm and damp and it's like the effort made no difference at all.
And when you're on the bus going back home at the end of the day the bitch who started it all smells the new competition and decides you need a refresher to make sure her mark is the strongest.

Can someone please give me a hot concept/prompt involving pokemon?

>Anon doesn't subscribe to the monster battling culture and would rather chill with his pokemon (all rescues).
>They nevertheless level up and evolve trying to protect his dumbass every time he walks into tall grass or caves all willy nilly.
>His pokemon are now all max levelled and anon has 0 badges.
>they slowly realize they could do whatever they want with him
Uhhhhhh
>hilarity ensues or something

>you're on the beach, chilling with your favorite gal
>and by that, you mean typhlosion
>the beach is weirdly empty
>eerily quiet save for the waves splashing on the shore
>doesn't stop you and typhlosion from having a gay old time
>after a long day, she's all tuckered out
>you decide to go for a swim while she naps
>you're floating on your back when you hear loud rumbling
>the winds have really picked up
>overcast sky
>you start swimming towards the shore
>oh shit
>the waves are too strong
>you yell out for typhlosion
>she can't hear you
>you're pulled under
>you hold your breath and flail, trying to break through the surface
>it's no use
>out of breath
>water floods your mouth and nose
>the world fades away as the sweet seawater fills you up
>...
>sweet
>...
>your eyes snap open as you gasp for breath
>you're in bed
>it's the middle of the night
>what a terrible dream
>you rub your tired eyes
>your face feels wet, and kind of... sticky
>weird, there's that sweet taste in your mouth again
>your pillow is completely soaked too
>it smells a little funky, not unpleasant though
>you stare at it for a second
>you decide it's way too late to be worrying about stupid shit
>you give the pillow a quick fluff, slump into it, and pretty soon you're drifting off again
>...
>...
>...
>unbeknownst to you, several sets of eyes stare through the crack in the doorway
>hushed giggles barely stir you from your sleep as the voyeurs excitedy discuss what they should try next.

>You're standing at the corner, waiting for a bus
>A tall anthro woman steps beside you
>She looks you up and down, before reaching down to grasp your crotch with one hand while gripping your ass tightly to keep you from pulling away as she firmly gropes your junk
>"... Hmph, bigger than my man. But I guess that's not that high of a bar to clear. I've got a friend who hasn't been able to get her hands on a human for the life of her. How about you come with me and I introduce you?"

>"Aint this pleasant sharing a drink with me, wouldnt you say?"
>Hao asks you across the table pouring another drink for the both of you
>"Sure." you respond, taking the glass in hand
>"You dont sound like it." she doubts your words, taking a sip from her drink
>"Do i?" you ponder taking a swig from the glass
>Surely this is different from her usual acts inflicted upon you
>Keeping you chained in the basement, starving you, few cuts and bruises
>You stare at the now empty glass, going over her acts
>Having no idea how long its been already, feeling of drunkness coming to you
>"C-could you take me back to the basement? I think ive had enough."
>You ask Hao with a slight slur, eye lids drooping
>"Why? are you not having a good time with me?"
>She asks suprised
>"No, im just tired."
>You try your best to not doze off
>"Hmph, have it your way then." Hao stands up from the table, coming over to your side
>As you try to stand up from the chair, she hits you on the head with the bottle, shattering on impact against your skull
>You fall backwards on the floor holding your head, dizzy from the hit
>Pain is there but numb from being drunk
>Hao stands over you, holding the shattered bottle in her hand
>"Learned your lesson?" she asks irritated
>"What lesson?" you mumble back
>"The one where you dont quit till i say so."
>Confused and not really there from the hit, you just say yes
>"Good but im not dragging your ass down to the basement, you can crawl there your self."
>Hao drops the bottle top against your chest, walking out of the room, shutting off the lights
>Leaving you in the dark room as you shut your eyes
>Waking up from your sleep, still laying down on dining room floor
>You groan as the pulsing headache starts to make itself know
>The bump on your head not making it any better too
>"Look who's finally awake."
>A familiar voice greets to you, hao
>Turning your gaze towards the table, you see her sitting at it, eating breakfast
>Wearing a pink t-shirt and black panties, tail poking out of the chair
>"Sleep well? I sure did." she asks, munching on a sandwich
>Sleeping on the hard floor wasn't the best of places
>"No, not really." you reply
>She says nothing back, eating her breakfast in silence
>After a while, she's done eating and stands up, coming over to you
>"Alright, let's get you back where you belong."
>She says offering her hand to help you up
>Taking her hand you stand up to your feet, flexing your joints from stiffness
>The two of you walk to the basement door and descent the stairs
>You have your own little corner in there, a bed and a chain tied to the wall
>Sitting down on the beds edge, you raise your left leg for Hao to set the cuff around your ankle
>"There, do you need anything?" she asks as the cuff locks
>"Ibuprofin, my head is killing me."
>"Awww, you poor thing." raising her hand to brush you cheek in comfort
>"I think you'll manage just fine without it."
>"Besides, it's nice you didn't vomit and choke on it while you slept."
>Her expression changes from a pleasant smile to something sinister, as her hand trails down to your neck
>"Wouldnt want anything taking away MY chance to snuff out your worthless existence now do we?"
>Her grip tightening around your neck while she speaks
>"O-of course not Hao." you say to her
>Hao releases her grip, gving you a kiss on the forehead after
>"Im glad you understand." she grins, reveling her teeth

I like the premise of anon being picked up as a project by a gym rat and slowly being sculpted and groomed into her ideal partner

I’ve been reading the human domestication general and realizing the nicer stories there are basically what I want from a waifur. Are there any explicitly /adhg/ stories about a human playing the role of basically a scared and lonely feral animal being gently but completely dominated by a furry woman who physically, hypnotically, and chemically dominates him?

Not really, and that general would've been kinda interesting if not for the troons.

Yeah the trans stuff isn’t for me at all. I’ve been reading the lesbian ones and they’re very cute. But I want a loving anthro alien to install a post scarcity luxury petplay anthrodom government with soft sci-fi elements and pet my head when I’m a good boy for her (almost never I would be evasive and bratty)

>In times of famine and death, human villages would offer their sturdiest studs for a bountiful harvest and strong children

Does anyone have any ideas for degrading sexual positions? I feel like there's just too many options for maledom positions while femdom's limited to Amazon or reverse mating press. Are there any wrestling holds that a woman could use on a man?

>Snek wrestler gf comes up behind you
>puts you in a headlock
>Chokes you for a bit, lifting up slightly
>brings you to a kneeling postion between her legs
>She maintains the hold, or progresses to half/full nelson hold
>Tip of her tail slithers around and starts jerking you off slowly
>She coos about you being a "poor thing" and encourages your squirming
>brings you to the edge of consciousness and orgasm repeatedly

Cow GF who gets upset anytime you buy milk.
>"What's this?"
>Puts gallon of milk on the table.
"It's milk."
>"So you admit it."
"Admit what?"
>"You're basically cheating on me! Do you even know the whore's name, or did it not occur to you, and you just went straight to sucking on her tits?!"
>Try to explain the many uses for milk
>Try to explain the human adult ability to consume milk
>Nothing works
>Have to apologize with 7 hour full body worship sesh.
>Now she insists that any time you need milk for anything, you suck it out of her tits, no exceptions.

“Skyrim belongs to the Nords.”

>"Damned faithless Imperials. They think we need their laws."
>you nod along
>those Imperials ARE faithless
>you don't need their laws

>you raise your glass to the last speaker

>they come to your city and expect the royal treatment just for grunt work?
>bah!
"And those khajiit! Damn thieving cats!"
>you drink from your mug, savoring the sweet taste of good Nord mead
"They'll rob you blind as soon as look at you. And their caravans are bringing skooma into our cities!"
>there's a rousing chorus of 'aye' and 'damn cats!'
>you lean back in your chair, satisfied that you've put those damned furry bastards in their place
>finish big
>a big boast to earn your next round for free
"The next khajiit that walks into my city is going to be--"
>"Oh! Beloved is speaking of Taj'ra?"
>you freeze like you've been bitten by an ice wraith
>despite the fact that the purring voice against your ear is warm and pleasant
>"Taj'ra is so happy to see her beloved~"
>a muscled arm covered in grey and black fur wraps around your shoulder, and a hand ending in sharp claws cups yours cheek
>Taj'ra is right behind you, giggling softly as she places a long, rasping lick on your other cheek
>"This one's quest was easier than Taj'ra expected, so she is home early! This is good news, no?"
>you don't move
>maybe it's all a hallucination
>a nightmare from the deepest pits of Oblivion
>no
>it's definitely real because she's purring in your ear and leaning her head against your shoulder
>"Taj'ra never gets to meet her beloved's friends! He is going to introduce khajiit, no?"
>you open your mouth and try to speak, but no words come out
>your throat is sealed tight in horror
>as all your drinking buddies stare at the beautiful khajiit warrior clad in leather armor that drapes herself over you
>she kicks up one long, shapely leg, and folds it over the other as she nestles into your lap
>that arm still wrapped around you as she presses against you with a toned, but lithe and agile body
>"Oh but Taj'ra's legs are tired from such walking. Let her sit in beloved's lap first."
>you turn your head slowly to look up at her
>her muzzle turned in a teasing smirk, her mottled gray fur ruffled up in the heat of the hearth, and her eyes twinkling with mischief
>she winks
>"Since Taj'ra's beloved is tongue-tied with her beauty and charm, Taj'ra will introduce herself!"
>she smiles, flashing big fangs at your companions
>"This one has the pleasure to be Taj'ra of the desert sands. Warrior extraordinaire, adventurer, and most luckiest wife to her beloved Ingen."
>the khajiit sighs and nuzzles against your cheek again
>you twist and grit your teeth, trying not to enjoy the feeling of her fur against your skin
>you fail
>"It is so nice to meet beloved friends, it reminds Taj'ra of how she met beloved. Shall he tell it?"
"No!"
>you gasp
>Taj'ra takes it in stride, lashing her tail and giggling
>"That is okay! Taj'ra prefers to tell stories."
>Talos preserve you
>"So! Taj'ra is walking around in wilderness, yes? Very dark, very scary. She hears screaming! Terrible frightful screaming! But Taj'ra is brave, so she runs to source of screaming! And what is the source?"
>Taj'ra bats her eyelashes at you
>"It is handsome Nord! Being robbed by evil scary dark elf bandit."
>Taj'ra cups your cheek again
>"Oh he was so terrified? Is that not so, beloved? How he shook and trembled!"
>you remember it well
>a routine trip to Kynesgrove when you were ambushed
>hopefully she doesn't tell the rest--
>"And he cried! Poor thing. Taj'ra saved him, of course. The bandit only had a dagger, and was not much threat to powerful adventurer such as Taj'ra."
>she flexes her arm to prove her point
>"And handsome Nord is so grateful! He says 'I will pay brave khajiit all my coin! I will do anything!' But Taj'ra does not need little pocket money. Taj'ra says to handsome nord, 'It is cold at nights in Skyrim. Khajiit does not need money, khajiit needs body to keep bed warm.'"
>Taj'ra looks so incredibly smug
>you have to look at her because you think you'll die of shame if you look at your drinking buddies
>she just smiles wider as she goes one
>"But this is clever plan. Taj'ra was cold, yes, but she wanted for handsome Nord's body! So she took him again and again until handsome Nord cannot walk right anymore."
>with a sigh of contentment, Taj'ra gives you a squeeze around the shoulders
>"Then she takes him all the way to Riften for Skyrim Nord marriage ceremony. Taj'ra wants handsome Nord to herself! There she learns his name is Ingen, such a nice pretty name for nice pretty Nord."
>more giggling as her eyes twinkle triumphantly
>"Plus beloved lets Taj'ra live in his home! No more cold camps for khajiit, except when she wants to remember first lovely night with her beloved."
>she strokes your cheek, and for all your shame and embarrassment, you're putty in her claws
>the way she showers you in compliments, the feel of her fur, the fact she saved your life
>for some reason it's all irresistible
>so you don't resist as she pulls you in for a kiss
>her whiskers brush against your proud Nord beard
>and she rumbles
>"Mmh. Must shave your scruff, beloved. Taj’ra has enough fluff for both of us."
>so it may not yet be a proud Nord beard yet, but you were working on it!
>or you were until just now
>with her claws playing across your cheek and chin, you think it's best not to deny her request
>no sense upsetting her
>though upset is how she looks right now
>a frown replacing her usual mischievous smile
>"Oh beloved, this one is sorry. She was so excited, she has given beloved no chance to speak! He is so shy."
>she starts stroking your hair
>and flashes a winning grin to the group again
>"Ah how cute he was on our first night. He blushed and covered his face! Adorable. And I called him the cutest name, it was--"
>she taps her chin with her other paw
>"What did I call you, beloved?"
>you mumble
"I uh, don't really uh..."
>Taj'ra's head snaps down, and she frowns
>not just a frown, but a full-on pout
>lip curling, whiskers drooping, eyes big and watery
>"He does not remember? The special sweet name Taj'ra has for her beloved? But beloved loved it so!"
>you know she's just doing this to tease you
>you know she knows you remember
>and you know those tears at the edge of her big golden eyes are purely affected
>still you crumble under the assault
"She called me her... her sugar-snowhare."
>there's a long drawn out 'ooooh' from the crowd of Nords
>you wince, not just from the crowd's reaction, but from the sharp pinch of her claws on your cheek
>"Aww! That is it. Taj'ra's sugar-snowhare. Her precious little bunny, sweet like moon-sugar and soft like snowhare! Who is Taj'ra's beloved sugar-snowhare?"
>you cringe inwardly
>but with bowed head you answer
"I am."
>Taj'ra gasps and leans into you, nuzzling your face
>the pommel of her sword pokes into your ribs
>be she goes on nuzzling and purring
>"Taj'ras precious snowhare. He is a good sugar sweetie, no? Taj'ra knows it to be so."
>draped across your lap, you can feel as Taj'ra tail flicks side to side in obvious contentment
>"And does beloved's little friends know that he calls her 'mommy'?"
>"Shor's bones!"
>Hroni's exclaims in disgust
>you're too far gone to care now
>you're in the fluff
>face-full of Taj'ra's downy soft neck-fur
>it's an odd kind of suffering
>on the one hand, you will never be able to show your face in Windhelm again, your reputation is ruined
>on the other, Taj'ra
>purring and mewling and scratching your head gently with her claws
>your head spins when she finally pulls back
>"Ah, all this reminiscing makes khajiit thirsty. What is beloved drinking?"
>you blink slowly, remembering you had a drink on the table
"Uh, mead, Taj'ra."
>she frowns
>"Bah. Mead. Taj'ra brought home fancy plum brandy, do not waste tongue on cheap stuff."
>the khajiit waves over the serving maid, who gives a distasteful grimace at the tavern's newest patron
>until Taj'ra pulls a handful of coins from her pouch
>"This one and her beloved need milk to wet our throats."
>you're aware of the murmurs of 'milk drinker' from the onlookers
>you clear your throat, mustering the last of your resistance
"Taj'ra, uh, my beloved, I wanted to finish my mead with my friends..."
>the last of your meager defiance melts as Taj'ra lashes out with a second barrage of drooping whiskers and wide kitten eyes
>"This one is sorry, so very sorry. She simply wished to spend time with her beloved. Taj'ra gets to bed down with her sugar-snowhare never as often as she wishes."
>Taj'ra wilts like a mountain flower in harsh Mid Year heat
>"Taj'ra understands. If beloved wishes to spend his nights drinking with ugly friends and boasting 'I hate khajiit', she will leave him to it. That is what he wishes, no? To be rid of Taj'ra?"
>you wince
>and flounder
>your drinking companions offer no help, suddenly interest as they are in the floorboards and ceiling
"I-- I didn't mean it, my love--"
>you flimsy excuse is cut off when Taj'ra kisses you violently
>you rock back in your chair with the force she uses to press her lips to yours
>a rough feline tongue invades your mouth, cowing you
>Taj'ra's claws rake your hair
>and she squeezes you so tight you wouldn't be able to breath even without her tongue filling your mouth
>she pulls back smiling ear to tufted ear
>"He means it?! Oh beloved! Taj'ra is so relieved! Beloved snowhare will come home with khajiit, yes? Yes?"
>you blink
>regaining your balance both physical and mental as she bombards you with more kisses
"Y-yes love."
>Taj'ra yowls with joy and bounces off your lap
>oh Talos preserve you don't let the fellas see that you have a--
>"Come! Come!"
>Taj'ra grabs your shirt and drags you to your feet
>barging past the serving maid, she stops only to snag the flagon of milk from her
>"Taj'ra almost forgot, drink your milk beloved. Handsome Nord will need strong bones for tonight~"
>you're dragged, hand in paw, down the stairs to the entrance of the hall
>just in time to pass an Argonian woman with a furious expression on her face marching in
>you hear her yelling even on the streets
>"Hroni you lazy good for nothing husband! You promised to help me clean the assemblage--"
>Taj'ra snickers as she dashes down the stony streets of Windhelm
>squeezing your hand as she turns back to give you a sneaky grin
>"Taj'ra does not really mind if husband does his tough talk in taverns. He must remember one thing though."
>you come to a stop in front of your door
>Taj'ra pulls you into an embrace, pressing her forehead to hers
>golden amber eyes filling your vision
>"Skyrim can belong to Nords, but handsome Nord belongs to khajiit!"

I’m bored of anthro women beating up their men. Are there any stories about anthro women beating up other people for their men? I want to marry an unstable supervillain who gets her best ideas while in reverse mating press.

>aww, does my widdle wageslave human fuckmeat want a job at mommy’s quasi-legal international military profiteering organization?

>of course that was taken last night! you have never looked more beautiful than than when you’re buried to the hilt begging me to slow down

Enough about the yucky list, let's shift topic to the yummy list.
I have always been of the opinion the the top of the yummy list should be whatever part of your waifur she likes your tongue on the most. Bit of a toss up between cookie and cake in my case.
Unrelated, but I wish there was more tail huffing going on 100% of the time. Tails deserve to be huffed, and worshiped like you are trying to get high off of car exhaust.

What if you COULD get high off tail huffing

>Waifur wakes up to a snorting sound next to her.
>Turns around in bed to see you mid trip, frothing at the mouth.
>"Not this shit again."
>Leads you by the nose to the bathroom, and waterboards you in the tub to force you through a crash.
>Drags you back to bed while you feel low as shit from getting the scent particles removed from your silly head.
>She forces you to eat pussy so she can get back to sleep.
>Tongue feels heavy, and she's hard to please when you get like this.
>"If you don't get me off, I'm wearing the tail sleeve for the next month."
>You turn on turbo to obliterate her clit. You don't even think for the whole process, just making sure you swallow all of her juice so she isn't angry about it in the morning.
>"Ahh so sleepy. :3" Sleepy time.
>Go easy on the huffing, only taking small breaths to go to bed.

no… i would want it to be more like a LSD/ecstasy combo… and she would fetishize it and make me huff her more…

would you prefer something like,
>Criminal waifur is convincing you to smell her tail
>"Don't be such a brat anon! Plenty of good boys like sniffing tail. You want to be a good boy right?"
>it's... musky, kinda sweet?
>You smell again.
>And again.
>and again.
>It's like power running through your brain.
>You come up for air after a deep breath, and just as quickly go back in.
>Her tail does smell rather good.
>She pulls it away from you, and the motion feels like you've been tilted on a new axis.
>"You can barely stand, here this should help."
>You feel something latch around your neck, then draw you close to her tail.
>"Be a good boy, and huff the aroma until we get to the club."
>Her tail is so much more vast than you first thought. Every tuft of fur dazzling against your nose, into your mouth. It goes on forever.
>The uniform colors start to melt into each other as you sink deeper into her. Nebula of the galaxy planted into your face with fluffy texture.
>You breathe in, and out.
>The space breathes in time, molting before your eyes as her tail rubs across your face.
>You're naked now.
>She's taken you somewhere else.
>The sound of techno music nips at the edges of your perception.
>"-he will stay hard, just tell me if he's slipping off and I'll give him another hit."
>The feeling of something pressing down on your cock takes you out of it, enough that you question where you are.
>"No you don't. Lose yourself in there. Don't wake up. Good boys don't wake up."
>Just as fast, the aroma of her tail traps your head again, and you lose yourself in the pleasure of it. The pleasure of getting fucked. The pleasure of being a good tail loving slut.
>You eat her out while her tail is coiled tight around your head.
>Her musk burns into your brain with the colors of the strobe lights until you cum, again and again and again and

Interesting green from a kindred thread
>with the midterms coming up, you and some likeminded activists decided to organize a protest outside the white house, to demand they give men the right to vote
>the previous attempts never picked up much momentum, so this time your friends suggested you dressed in a way to get women's attention
>you weren't used to wearing bikinis, since you didn't like how they treat men like pieces of meat, but after your fellow protestors put theirs on, you were feeling some peer pressure
>and it seemed to have worked, with a sizeable crowd forming around your picket signs, but whether they cared about the message or about your pecs under your bikini tops remained to be seen
>you even managed to see the lawmakers come out of their meeting with the president to greet you
>as the leader of the men's voting rights movement, you tried to sound confident and strong, to make your message understood
>you cursed yourself for stumbling over your words when she slightly shifted her weight on her ankles, causing her topless chest to subtly swing back and forth, using more willpower than you would like to admit to lock your eyes onto hers
>you ignored the hardness in your bikini, since you assumed it went without saying that you weren't intentionally getting a boner
>she giggled and you could tell she wasn't taking you seriously, reflecting that maybe this attire was a mistake
>she must have noticed how sad you looked, because she offered to drive you to her place to chat more about this subject
>your expression changes from despondence to courage, and you thank her for this opportunity, with your fellow boys cheering at this victory for the movement
>...
>ok, so maybe she didn't actually want to talk about men's rights
>and maybe her pussy was to die for
>but still, you saw opportunity
>you made her bacon and eggs the morning after, and left her your number to meet again soon
>after all, politicians love their bribes!

>Get Cerberus wife
>Love petting her
>You only have 2 hands, so one head always gets left out, and starts biting and growling.
>idea
>Tear off nearest demon fag's arms..........................
>Toss them bitches in tha trash and bio clone a third arm

>their intellectual depth, shown in the casual discussions at dinner, also slowly gets to him. when they stare, their eyes are an abyss. he's swimming with the sharks. the few hours where the lab equipment isn't creating noise aren't enough to get rested.
>over the weeks, he quickly gets worn down and dismantled. number and number, unable to do anything because someone immediately takes charge and does it instead, better, faster.
>they start openly discussing what they could use him for, and ask him to make suggestions, all of which are shut down or not even worth a comment.
>one day while in the shower, all his clothes vanish...as well as the towel. forced to get out naked, he gets scoffed at, not getting any answer to what happened. he's trying to wear his sleeping blanket for dinner, but they pressure him to drop it 'for hygienic reasons'.
>that evening, they look for something to 'make him more presentable'. After all, he's the morale officer. He's supposed to make them professional, not the other way around.
>for some reason, the only thing they can find is a collar, heavy finger-thick silver woven in artistic patterns.
>when the journey ends, the women come back with a different man. Unable to do anything, scared, waiting for instructions, staring into the void, naked save for a collar. conditioned to their touch, put on a high-protein diet to maintain his duties as morale officer.

>Permanent mark of what she did, taking you against your will and using your body for her own pleasure

Ok, question. Take Beauty and the Beast but gender swap em and make the whole thing ADHG, who're you picking and why,
>the beastly princess? "Be my guest, adorable little man. I promise to sweep you off your feet... "
>or Gaston? (idk, she'll be like a muscular doe or wolf or something) "Men shouldn't learn how to read! Men, like you, should be learning how to rub my feet and praise my, heh, natural good looks..."

would love for a gender bend beauty and the beast, but with this timeline: It would turn into a monkey's paw somehow

I think a real genderbent beauty and the beast would really be about masculine expectations being subverted rather than feminine expectations getting in the way of female autonomy. So it really should be about a dude who wants to be valued as more than just a bank vault to be withdrawn from being pressured into being a provider for a human woman who just wants to extract value from him. I think it would mostly play out the same after that, but the dichotomy of the princess being both a powerful beast and elegant woman would probably stand out more than the original.
I'm probably preaching to the choir here when I say that I'd prefer to be entrapped by a strong bestial woman who's major personality "flaws" are arrogance and cruelty. Rather than how it ends with the love of the protagonist turning her human.

>you guessed it
>molested too

>this is it
>this is what you've trained for
>the purpose for which you have armed yourself with a powerful magic sword, armored yourself in a shining breast-plate, and taken up a life of adventuring
>you are going to slay a dragon
>you had heard a rumor in a local inn about a princess from a far-off land being kidnapped by a dragon along the Falchion Coast
>and following local stories of a dragon spotted flying around with a human woman clutched in its claws led you to the rocky foothills of the Easthorn Mountains
>it was surprisingly easy to track your prey
>apparently the dragon's cave has had many dragons come and go, and great bouts of roaring and rumbling in the night
>so every villager in the area knew exactly where to avoid
>of course that's exactly where you're going
>to a long, wide-open valley full of scorched earth and torn-up and smashed trees
>a desolation
>it appears to have once been a fertile, pleasant place judging by the small surviving patches of greenery and remains of a stream flowing down from the surrounding mountains
>but the rest is laid to ruin
>once you purge this valley of evil, it will return to its natural beauty
>forging on, you reach the entrance to a cave
>easily large enough to fit a dragon
>steeling your nerves, you march inside
>at first the entrance is barren, nothing but a rocky floor and bare walls
>the tunnel winds deeper and downward, turning this way and that, until you are swallowed in darkness
>then you smell it
>you had expected sulfurous brimstone of it's smokey breath, or perhaps the stench of blood and rotten carcasses
>but it's something else
>a sharp, oddly musky smell
>you ignore it and descend
>until finally you see light
>not the flicker of torch or candle light, but an odd, blue glow that shines steadily from around the next corner
>sword raised and shield ready, you step around the turn in the tunnel, ready to face your foe
>only to find it empty
>at least, there's no dragon there
>the tunnel opens up in a wide cavern, strangely adorned, but with obvious signs of habitation
>with sword and shield raised, you slowly march through the bizarre anteroom
>the entire chamber is lit by floating globes at near twenty feet overhead
>they shine bright and harsh, throwing the room into cold, stark light
>clearly some kind of draconic magic
>the stone floor is smoothed, unlike the craggy entrance, and there's even a few rugs scattered about
>though they're gouged with claw marks
>on the walls are massive tapestries of thin glossy paper
>they depict scenes of battle and leisure
>humans, dragons, elves
>bizarrely stylized, the figures depicted have brightly colored eyes, and wield weapons twice the size of themselves
>and they all appear to be quite destitute as they do battle in naught but scraps of clothing
>okay actually they may just be erotic illustrations based on the way this one has her breasts exposed
>clearly this dragon is a vile defiler of more than just nature
>with your gaze on the tapestries, you stumble into another oddity
>a box
>made not of wood, but of some strange waxed paper, folded into a tall square the size of a bucket
>the inside half filled cuts of meat
>at first you thought they were human flesh swimming in sticky blood
>but a closer look reveals it's just beef, swimming in some sweet red sauce with strange bits of grain mixed in
>in fact, there are a dozen such boxes of discarded food in this room
>but they do not hold your focus for long as you see the most horrifying sight of all
>statues
>strange, human-sized statues, made of some glossy lacquered substance
>the figures contorted in strange poses, doll's limbs bent this way and that
>the most terrible of all, a maiden on her knees
>her eyes are wide with shock, her mouth hangs open and her tongue lolls out, and she holds her hands up with two fingers raised in some sign of surrender
>you can only assume these are grisly recreations of the dragon's past victims
>"It's not fair, it's not fair!"
>an echoing cry grabs your attention
>that must be the princess!
>you turn from the grotesque statuary toward the source of the cries
>a tunnel on the far end of the channel opposite the entrance
>the crying from the tunnel sounds strange, it reverberates deeper and louder than a fair maiden's voice should
>you proceed with caution down the tunnel
>this one is short and straight, lit by those same glowing globes from the antechamber
>as you descend the tunnel, the crying grows louder and more distinct
>and you feel as much hear a deep rumble along with it
>when you step into the next chamber, you're greeted with a most unexpected sight
>a dragon
>but not the dragon you were expecting
>instead of a four-legged beast of legend, you find the twelve-foot tall creature in the shape of a man
>more accurately, the shape of a woman
>a shape you could only describe as pudgy, with a thick wobbly tail wrapped in green scales that go all the way up her back and head
>equally plush are her belly, thighs, and ample chest that are covered in smoother, soft tan scale underbelly
>she is kneeling in the center of the cavern at the foot of a dragon sized bed, surrounded by stacks of books and more discarded food boxes
>her head is bowed so you can't see her, and thankfully she can't see you
>"Those jerks! Those bullies! They destroyed my Princess Kagehime figurine!"
>you hesitate, lowering your sword
>a weepy woman not what you were planning to fight
>the dragoness holds two halves of another statue, one in each claw
>it's dressed up in a puffy pink dress, and the head has a crown attached to it
>just a figurine
>at least it doesn't seem to have the sinister origin you had guessed
>just some strange form of art
>as strange as the arcane tomes scattered around the floor of this apparent bedroom
>you can see the pages of one that's half-burned
>the illustrations are all in the strange style of the hanging tapestries
>and most appear to feature human men in compromising positions
>"And all my hentai is-- oh!"
>you look up
>right into the dragon's eyes
>well
>her eyeglasses
>somehow, impossibly, the dragoness has a pair of thick round spectacles sitting atop her snout, giving her an incongruously bookish and civilized look
>the tears pooling at the bottom of those thick glasses make you hesitate
>what knight would not be turned by the sight of a weeping woman?
>"Did they throw you around too, Sir Akihito? At least you're not damaged."
>setting down the broken statue with reverent care, she sets down the broken figurine
>then with equal tenderness she reaches out for you
>"Oh my knightly nii-san, only you can understand my tender heart."
>at the last second you jump back out of the reach of her grasping claw
>the dragoness gasps
>"Sir Akihito! Did my love bring you to life? Like in 'Heta ni on'yaku sa reta ningen no sekkusu manga'?!"
>the dragoness reaches again, but this time you can't escape
>in spite of her size and girth, she's blindingly fast in grabbing you up from under your arms
>you squirm
>even though her touch is delicate, you can feel there is strength in those fingers that could easily crush you
>if only you hadn't dropped your sword!
>"You don't have to be scared Sir Akihito! I know you're a gentle soul that..."
>the dragoness pauses
>then sniffs
>and sniffs again
>you scrabble for a handhold on her fingers as she shifts her grip to hold you one-handed
>and with her newly free hand, she adjusts her spectacles to peer closely at you
>a gesture that makes her seem surprisingly human
>"You're not Sir Akihito. You're-- You're a human!"
>she gasps
>"A real human man! Oh my gosh! A human knight! Actual flesh and blood! Oh my gosh oh my goshohmygosh!"
>she starts to shake and tremble
>so you start to shake in her trembling hand
>"You're a real human man like real flesh and blood and you're a knight and it's just like my Dragonese Manga and you're so small and your armor is so cute and--"
>she freezes
>the grip around your torso getting tighter
>"You're a knight. Come to slay a dragon. And I captured you."
>she shudders
>"Just like my Draginshi."
>she reaches for you with a trembling claw, drawing a long, sinewy split-end tongue over her scaly lips
>"And the captured human knight is no match for the dragon's sleek, beautiful form."
>oh no
>you don't know what manga or draginshi is
>but you know where this is going
>with one extended finger, she starts to dig at the waistband of your trousers
>her tongue lashes the air
>you wince at the touch of her claw on your skin
>but she shushes you
>"Shh, shh my prince. Your skin is so soft, like porcelain. Your dragon princess will take good care of you."
>try as you might, you can't stop her from drawing you trousers down
>even as you pull with all your might, her single finger is enough to to pull them down to your ankles
>she holds them there, forestalling an attempt at pulling them back up
>and she stares
>her maw hanging open as she pants
>ogling your bared manhood
>you think she's drooling
>"Oh wow. I've never seen one before..."
>another lick of her lips
>she reaches a trembling claw
"Wait!"
>you gasp
>finally manage to break your silence
>the dragoness looks at you in confusion
>"Wait? For what?"
>you cover yourself with your hands, trying to recover from a little of your shame
"This isn't right! We're not married! You're a dragon! I'm a knight! I don't even know your name!"
>rather than deterring her, your protests only seem to excite her more
>her shuddering breaths coming through clenched teeth
>"I know! It's so naughty! It's just like in 'Doragon ga kishi o reipu suru'!"
>the claw comes up again, this time gently pushing your hands aside
>still she manages to so precise as to avoid hurting you, even as you put all your strength into resisting
>this time she runs the flat of her finger over your groin
>"Huhuhu. Peeny."
>she strokes you again, this time lifting your cock to feel it pulsing in her palm
>"I'm Tiffany. But you can call me 'imuoto'.
>you clench your teeth
>her scales are smooth and cool against your skin as she strokes your manhood
"But what if I don't want to?"
>Tiffany laughs, baring her teeth in a razor grin that reminds just exactly what's got you captured
>a dragon
>"That just makes it even hotter!"
>her grip around your torso firm, the dragoness wraps two fingers and her thumb around your shaft
>all she needs considering your size difference
>and starts stroking again
>you bite your lip, but don't give in to her demand
>you will not beg
>you are a knight!
>but Tiffany doesn't seem to care
>she's too lost in playing with your body
>huffing so hard her glasses are fogging up
>"I could write my own dragoujin. Call it 'I Can't Believe my Human Knight Big Brother is so Rapeable'."
>you're not a writer, but that seems to be a great many things for you to be
>a knight
>a human
>and older brother to a dragon
>"And we'd always spend time together and you'd be so cool and smart and nice and buy me sweets."
>she tastes the air
>"And we'd steal glances at each other. And feel feelings we know aren't right that we try to ignore!"
>you hear something like leather rubbing against leather
>after a quick glance downward you see it's her thighs as she works herself up
>"And-- and you don't make fun of me for being a loser, or a virgin. And when-- and when the other dragons come bully me you protect me!"
>Tiffany's nostrils flare
>each puff of breath rolls against your face, and you can feel the heat of fire behind it
>"And then one night, you find me crying all alone in my bedroom and I can't take being alone anymore and I grab you!”
>you feel her squeeze your torso
>just a squeeze
>but it still frightens you away from struggling
>"And you squirm in my claws because you know, big brother, that it's so wrong. Hah, hah--"
>she strokes faster
>and speaks faster, practically babbling in between growling moans
>"--but it feels so good and you just-- nng! -- you just can't help yourself!"
>your manhood twitches against the dragoness's palm
>practically polishing the scales with your pre-cum
>Tiffany leans her head in closer
>she breathes in hard through her nose, and out her mouth in quivering giggles
>"Hehehe. Imuoto no."
>she speaks for you, putting on a falsetto
>"It's not right."
>you're squeezed tighter
>and she growls
>"Say it!"
>you flinch
"I-Imuoto no! It's not right!"
>Tiffany rumbles from her chest in satisfaction
>"But onii-san, it feels so good~"
>the fingers around your shaft give it a squeeze as they stroke you, forcing a fresh bead of pre to your tip
>the dragoness's snout is so close she doesn't have to move to take a taste
>just flick out her tongue to lash against your tip
>she shudders
>"And it tastes so good."
>drawing her tongue back into her muzzle slowly, she smacks her lips
>then she giggles nervously
>"Actually it's really salty. Not in a bad way but it tastes funny. I didn't think it would taste like that. Do all humans' cum taste..."
>she trails off
>and you could swear the green scales on her cheeks turn slightly red
>"Sorry. I'm just gonna suck it now. But keep calling me imuoto, okay?"
"No I won't--Ah!"
>without bothering to listen to your protest, Tiffany open's her jaws wide
>for a moment your vision is filled with rows of sharp teeth and a lashing tongue
>instinct tells you you're about to be devoured howl
>and a little bit of you, detached from the terror, notices that she has metal rods running from one tooth to the next
>how bizarre
>but then--
>"Aaaaa-glomp!"
>Tiffany makes her own sound effects as she shuts her mouth around your groin
>your legs are left straddling her chin as she envelops your entire pelvis
>the burning heat of her maw is a strange, but surprisingly pleasurable sensation
>her tongue, impossibly dexterous, starts exploring
>wrapping around your balls, and squirming up to coil over your shaft, and the split end of it teases your tip
>she moans and your whole body shakes
>"Tafe gugg."
>she mumbles with her mouth full
>the graze of her teeth forcing you to grip her fingers and kick your legs
"Careful! Careful please!"
>"Mmo-do!"
>the glasses flash in the light
>and you kick even more
"Imuoto! Imuoto please your teeth!"
>in complete defiance of your pleas, Tiffany giggles
>"Oop! Thorry!"
>but thankfully she stops talking after that, and focuses on using her mouth to make you squirm in other ways
>mostly by stroking your with her tongue while also tonguing your sack and lapping at the slit
>you twitch
>the tongue strokes faster
>you moan
>Tiffany rumbles
>your hands grip her fingers tightly
>her hands are split between holding you to her maw, and down between her legs, doing exactly what you think she's doing
>judging by the musky smell that permeates her lair growing stronger with each rumbly moan, she does it a LOT
>she's masturbating
>and sucking your cock
>and somehow jerking you off with her tongue
>and all you can do is hold on for dear life
"That's-- That's-- Ooh gods..."
>you moan
>even though you've been sitting in her mouth, you're not adjusting to the heat
>in fact it feels like she's getting hotter
>it grows from further down her throat
>enveloping your lower half
>you're sweating
>the heat isn't the only thing building up
>your loins are burning of their own volition
>and Tiffany rumbles and rumbles
>you're certain she can feel your member twitching with her entangling tongue
>she just works faster
>her entire body swaying as her moans grow ti earth-shaking levels
>you're squirm and moaning
>about to burst
>when she stops
>at least, her tongue stops
>she's still swaying, and you can see her other arm still moving
>but her tongue is unmoving, and she stares at you with eyes that burn with madness
>"Sthay it."
>what
"What?"
>"Sthay it!"
>she practically roars
>and your lust-possessed mind sparks
"I-Imuoto! I'm cumming!"
>the tongue springs to life
>her arm works in a furious blitz
>her roar shakes the mountain
>with her long, coiling, impossibly dexterous tongue, Tiffany licks and strokes you with maddening fury
>you’re melting in her mouth
>heat meeting heat
>as your cock spasms and pulses
>that tongue laps at your head, lapping up your seed with every throb of your cock
>she's practically milking you
>wringing you dry with every squeeze and pump of her tongue
>until your head is lolling and body limp in her maw
>Tiffany swallows every drop easily
>that damnable tongue refuses to stop
>lashing the head of your oversensitive member
>until you mewl desperately
"T-Tiffany! It's too much. Too mu-u-uch."
>she rumbles
>brows furrowing
"Imuoto..."
>her maw opens wide again
>and she drags her tongue all over your cock and balls one last time before releasing you
>tenderly she lowers you onto her bed, where you stand on shaking legs
>though you only accomplish the feat by holding onto the dragoness's hand
>she drops back on her haunches, sitting on the stone floor so she can look you in the eye
>"That was better than any of my dragoujins."
>you just pant for breath
>it was the best sex you've ever had
>it was the only sex you've ever had
>that knightly vow of chastity is out the window now
"Yes. Well..."
>you puff
"It certainly was something. I think I should be--"
>"Dork! Hey dweeb!"
>you're taking your first wobbling step toward the edge of the bed when your petty excuses are interrupted
>a new draconic voice, echoing down from the cave's entrance
>"I heard you got a new toy, dweeb. Is it another fake princess?"
>the new dragon is taller than Tiffany, has a far more womanly figure
>long slender legs, a slim waist, and a bust that's even bigger than Tiffany's
>she's a brilliant fiery red, compared to Tiffany's muddy green
>and she stands with hands on her hips, a smile showing off rows and rows of fangs on her face
>a cruel smile
>"Oh, my, Tiamat, Tiff. Did you break your princess toy already? That's like, totally sadge."
>the red dragoness stomps over to where Tiffany is kneeling, looking down at the forgotten remnants of the princess figurine
>Tiffany looks aggrieved, a scowl on her downturned snout
>"Drax'lissar. What do you want?"
>the newcomer just scoffs, ignoring Tiffany's question
>Drax'lissar kicks aside the remains of the toy and snickers cruelly
>"I heard you have to buy the toys cause you totally can't kidnap a real princess, Tiffany. That's like, so messed up. Like, what kind of dragon can't kidnap a princess?"
>Tiffany squeaks, a very un-dragon-y sound
>"I just like the design of--"
>"Yeah whatever four-eyes. I don't actually care. Where's your hoard? I need some gold to buy more enchantments for my lair."
>the red dragoness stalks off, toward a small opening at the back of the cavern, likely leading to another tunnel
>you look to Tiffany in confusion
"Why do you let her insult you so?"
>Tiffany sniffs, clearly holding back tears
>"She's just like-- She's popular. And she can breath fire. And she's friends with Chaddeus the Immolator."
>that name means nothing to you
>but you can see this girl needs your help
"You are a dragon. You must stand for yourself! If you do not, who will?"
>your speech seems to have the opposite of your intended effect
>Tiffany deflates even further
>"You're right, I don't have any friends. I'm such a loser!"
>her glasses are even foggier
>and she sniffles noisily
>"Ugh!"
>a shout from the back of the cave alerts you to Drax'lissar's return
>she stomps up with shreds of those glossy paper books in her claws
>"Did you spend all your hoard on porn? You're such a fucking virgin Tiffany oh my Tiamat!"
>she tosses the shreds in the air, and with a puff of flame, burns them to fluttering cinders
>Tiffany gasps and reaches out for the ashes
>"My special editions..."
>you step to the edge of the bed, nudging the green dragoness's shoulder
"Stand up for yourself. Be like the hero in one of your strange stories."
>Tiffany seems to take some comfort from that
>she straightens out, rising to one knee
>"I-I'm not a virgin! I totally had sex!"
>oh
>this is not going the way you wanted it to
>"Yeah?"
>Drax'lissar sneers
>"Who would sleep with a fat mud-scale nerd like you?"
>Tiffany puffs up her chest proudly and gestures with both arms toward the bed
>toward you
>at least you get a good view of that puffed up chest bouncing as she makes the theatrical move
>"My human boyfriend!"
>Drax'lissar stares at you
>you tear your eyes off Tiffany long enough to stare back
>and then the red-scaled dragoness breaks into laugh
>loud, cruel, mocking laughter that shakes the cavern
>"Ha! Ha! Hahaha! Tiff you-- Ha!-- You total fucking loser! You fucked a human?! You actual soft-skull idiot! Humans don't count, you're totally still a virgin!"
>she bends over at her waist, hands on her hip, a smile of cruel mirth on her face
>"You fat, ugly, stumpy, stubby-horned, slime-dwelling VIRGIN!"
>that's it
>Tiffany may be a dragon
>a strange dragon, with thick thighs and a potbelly and a pudgy tail
>who collects strange, lewd artwork
>and insists you call her 'little sister'
>but she is still a lady!
>and you cannot abide such evil speech toward a lady!
>you're a knight, after all
>you jump off the bed
>scooping up your sword and charging for Drax'lissar
"Dragon!"
>you roar
"I will silence your vile tongue! If I have to cut! It! From! Your!-- Oof!"
>a casual flick of the red dragoness's tail catches you across the midriff
>sending you flying
>you smash into hard ground
>rolling several feet in a tangle of arms and legs and pain
>until coming to a stop against the rock wall
>you groan
>some things are definitely broken
>"Ugh. Humans are SO gross. I'm gonna squish it."
>Drax'lissar makes it one step toward you before a mass of green and brown slams into her
>Tiffany is moving so fast she's a blur
>smashing the taller, slimmer, lighter dragoness to the ground
>"YOU HURT ONEE-CHAN!"
>stalactites fall from the ceiling
>bookshelves and figurines topple and tumble
>you're jostled painfully up and down
>Tiffany holds Drax'lissar down, pummeling her head against the floor and walls
>"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You're so mean and I hate you!"
>Tiffany roars
>Drax'lissar shrieks
>"And it's my gold! I can spend it on figurines and dragoujins if I want!"
>Tiffany slams a claw down on Drax'lissar's snout, forcing her to bite down on the gout of flame she was trying to lash out with
>"And sex with a human totally counts because I am a dragon and I say so!"
>with a final roar and a mighty heave, Tiffany hurls her tormentor clear across the cavern
>the red dragoness slams head-first into the wall beside the entrance tunnel
>with a 'crack!' one of her horns snaps off
>Drax'lissar tries to pick herself up, but when Tiffany rushes for her, she merely hisses in fright and scuttles out of the cave on all fours
>Tiffany roars her triumph
>standing tall, legs spread, arms over her head
>tail swinging from side-to-side
>it's cute, really
>in a terrifying, awe-inspiring way
>then she gasps
>"Sir Knight! Sir Knight!"
>whirling around, she drops to her knees and crawls over to you
>"Oh no! Oh no oh no! Are you okay? Can you walk? Do you need the kiss of life?"
>she's already starting to pucker up
"No! No, I'm alive. I am unhurt."
>you try to stand
>you fail
"Ah! Ow! No. Nope. I am not well. I think my leg is broken."
>Tiffany reaches out
>you flinch
>but she takes you up with the same gentleness she did when she first caught you
>"Oh brave knight. My hero. You stood up for me like you really were my older brother."
>Tiffany sniffs again, this time true tears form from beneath her opaque glasses
>big blobby tears that roll down her snout
>"Don't you worry. I'll take care of you until you're all healed."
>she lays you down on the bed
>then crawls up with you to cradle you in her arms
>"It will be just like my dragoujin, "My Pretty Patient is my Prisoner~"

>An argonian warrioress and a young nord restorationfag (lmao) sit at a table
>"So, culturally... you reverted from stone pyramids to mudhuts."
>"It's a philosophical thing. Vastei- change. Nothing lasts forever, don't worry too much."
>"But... wouldn't your descendants like a warm wooden house?"
>"Ah, if it even lasts that long? You worry yourself, all things change. Empires fall, temples crumble, you'll even forget about being raped."
>"...I wasn't raped?"
>"After tonight I mean. Go pay the innkeeper, Uxith-Beeko."
>"One day I'll learn what that means..."

>Be an orphan since a car crash in your infancy
