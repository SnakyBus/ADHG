ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

Anyone have any cool ideas for the mythos in their world? Religion? Origin of anthros?

God created fuzzy women as the stock race, and humans are the weird amazon ass civilization that need to be brought to heel to worship superior puss puss.

In the beginning God created man in His likeness and saw that it was good. He saw that it was not good for man to be alone, so he brought him all the beasts of the land and birds of the air and fish of the sea and man gave them names, but for the man there was not found a partner. As the man slept, God remade some of the beasts from man and made woman and brought her to the man and man saw that these women were good. They were all naked and not ashamed.
The serpent woman was more crafty than God's other creations and one day tempted man to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree of knowledge. Now man was doomed with the knowledge of good and evil, but in the likeness of God his heart was full of forgiveness for the serpent. God chastised the serpent and and sentenced her to suffer the pangs of bearing man's children and to be his protector and companion forevermore.

>"Nonny! You've got to come back with me!"
>"Where?" You stammer, still a little shaken up from getting raped by so many Anthros from a time before rape was a misdemeanor.
>"Back to my isl- Is- My I- BACK TO THE FUTURE!!" She shouts over herself.
> She rummages through your trash to reclaim the candid photos you found and threw out yesterday.
>"What are you doing?" Your Foxy GF asks her while she opens the Mrs. fusion reactor on the back of the car.
>Without any shame Emma goons her puffy yeen pussy into the reactor, achieving climax in 5.18 seconds to a photo of your naked back. "I needed fuel."
>"No no, Doc I just got here-"
>She grabs you both by the throats with her freshly lubricated gooning hands, and tosses you into your seats. (You get back seat of course)
> Fops waifur beans you in the face to get back out of the seat. "Doc, what's this got to do with me and Anon? What, does he become MGTOW or something?"
>"Nonono, you and assnon, I mean cocknon, I mean Anon who I will rape turn out fine! It's your kitts! Anon jr. is trying to have a relationship with a human woman, and 2 of your 75 daughters support his decision!"
>GF does her locks the fuck in face
>Car pulls out of the driveway so hard that the pitbull on the sidewalk never stood a chance.
>Racial police one block away thank Omnifur that they can finally shoot a yeen for an actual crime.
>"Hey Doc, we're going to need to back up, we don't have enough road to outrun the cops before we reach 88."

.

>TFW when the realization that you were bred and born only to be emotional support for your cheetah childhood “friend”

Cheetah mom grooming you to only focus on her daughter. Makes sure you never develop strong interests that don't involve her daughter. You never question why everything you do revolves around her, it just seems natural to you. Any time you try to act out of line, you get corrected instantly by a very big Meow.
You help make an entire bloodline, and you think that it was your idea.

How would Cheetah mom deal with Anon starting falling for her instead of her daughter ?
How would Cheetah reacts to the idea of loosing her Anon to her own mom ?

What behaviors and actions that would be considered innocuous/normal by humans but would trigger anthros's "must protect/cuddle" instinct hard?

>go out at night
>swimming
>going out in cold weather

>and now a single human too
>the current landlord, a slightly older she-wolf, shows to your new apartment
>kept getting weird almost angry looks from every wolf you passed and landlady wasn't much better
>guess the fact you weren't family wasn't settling too well with them
>decided it was best to stay quiet, out of trouble, and out of the way of all the wolves
>you left them alone and they left you alone
>end up chatting with one of the older she-wolves one time when you bring groceries to your apartment and she was out smoking

>from then on your getting all sorts of wolves knocking at your door just saying they were checking on you everyday
>different wolf families asking you want to come over for diner
>the mother wolves kept coming by to give you various things they cooked since they always make a lot since they share with the whole pack

>Always watching for when I fuck up anything, so she can pounce me.
>Shockingly, we are now the only positively reviewed fast food joint in the area.

Did you know that the anthrostate has purposefully plotted to make all of society low key fem-findom?
Like the way the government defunds and disinsentivises male-work programs, or the way it gets cold feet whenever a refferedom for making it illegal to pay male workers less gets proposed, or the way all the TV and advertisements push this agenda about how its acutually empowering for a man to spend all day at home cooking and cleaning.
They're trying to keep us broke so we're reliant on our wives for anything that costs money!
I won't take this blatant discrimination laying down! Men deserve equal pay. They shouldn't have to live under their wives' thumb/claw.
I won't fall for their propaganda! Their games!
I know we can beat them!
I know what they did to the HUMAN wome-
>WE'RE SORRY. THE POSTER OF THIS MESSAGE IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR POSTING.

All of you are familiar with /adhg/ settings in an anthro state but what about settings where humans are struggling to remain the dominate species over the large rape monsters that roam the land.

>monster hunter, but humans are an all male species and every monster species is all female and needs the humans in order to breed
I will now put this in my idea roster

I like a world with normal relations between the sexes but you just happen to date into a family that practices extreme matriarchy.
Better for being disabused of your delusions of authority, broken down humiliated and brought to heel.

the closest I have to it at the moment is this old promp
>Be dating a lioness
>Things seems to be going well
>Then she starts setting up dates and trying to hook you up with her sisters and some of her friends
>They keep pressuring you to quit your job and move in with then
>One straight out says that you should let they bring in the money and food and your job should be just to look good, take care of home and watch over the cubs
>You said that neither you nor any of them have any cubs
>Your first lioness just laughed and says that they will take care of that by spring

Worlds where anthros are dominant societly miss out on the unique opertunities where female anthros are submissive generally.

>Be Anon
>Be at collage
>Get an internship at an office along side an extremely shy and demure anthro girl
>You never payed much attention to her and she also never really spoke much
>Every day the rest of the office dump piles of work on both you, forcing you to do overtime while everyone else checks out and go home
>One day after the normal shift you fellow intern call you to look at something on her paperwork pile
>As soon you came near her she pins you against the wall and aggressively forces her toungue in you mouth
>Afer a few second of oral rape she pushes you away
>She looks deep into your eyes with a cheeky smile on her face
>"No one will ever believe you"

>spend 4 years in law school
>completely wasted your time because you're a human
>every time you have to defend someone the other lawyers will just ask the judge for permission to rape you which invalidates all your points and gathered evidence the second they're riding you bareback on the middle of the courtroom
>you've won zero legal battles
>but you did have about fifty offspring with seven anthros twice your size this far

>be you
>anon
>just a normal dude living a normal life
>in the Magical States of America
>you know, normal stuff
>you work with a couple goblins in an office building
>have to look out for centaurs on the way to work
>gnolls playing pick-up rugby that devolve into laugh riots
>that sort of normal stuff
>you just moved to the city for your job
>one day you're having lunch at the park outside your office when something taps you on the thigh
>"Um hello."
>look over
>it's a kobold standing by the bench you're sitting on
>a little red one with jagged horns and a raggedy t-shirt and big soft eyes
>she's small and scrawny and looks terrified
>"Kobold sorry to bother, but you share? So long, no food and--"
>she starts to tear up
>great big teardrops that roll down her snout and fall to the ground with a soft 'plop'
>"--B-bad kobold should not beg but--"
>with balled up fists she struggles in vain to wipe the tears from her eyes
>"--p-please just a bite..."
>you finally relent
>your heart isn't made of stone
>you rip your sandwich in half and hand it over
>the kobold takes it with a happy squeak and hops onto the bench next to you
>she snaps up the half sandwich in an instant
>then just sits there, happily swing her feet that don't reach the ground and humming to herself
>you do your best to ignore her as you finish your lunch
>lunch hour’s over
>you get up from the bench
>the kobold hops up from the bench
>you walk back to your office building
>the kobold follows you back to your office building
>you stop at the front door
>the kobold bumps into you at the front door
"What are you doing?"
>the kobold looks up at you and smiles
>"Following you!"
>you wave her off
"I don't have any more food."
>the kobold cocks her head to the side
>her tail twitches
>"Yes."
>she really doesn't get it does she?
"I have to go back to work now. Inside. This is my company's building."
>the kobold nods eagerly
>"It's a very nice building!"
"Okay. Bye."
>you go inside
>"See ya!"
>four hours later you walk out of the office building
>the kobold is there
>she's sitting on the sidewalk looking down
>but then she hops up when you walk outside
>"Hi!"
>you stare at the little red kobold
>her tail is wagging
>her ruby eyes are shining
>you roll your eyes
"I can't give you any more charity. I don't have any money or food."
>the kobold shrugs
>you keep walking
>"That's okay. We go home!"
>you make it down to the subway
>so you can argue with the little thing while you're waiting for your train
"You're not coming home with me. I don't know you."
>the kobold gasps
>"Oh! Oh no! So sorry!"
>she bows down at the waist, tail sticking straight up in the air
>and she speaks, still reverently bowed
>"Am Yip! Kobold! Yip serves you forever and ever and a day!"
>she announces so loudly her voice echoes around the station
>a few other humans look over in confusion
>a pack of goblins break into snickers
>an elf scoffs and takes to big steps away from you and the kobold
>you blush
"What, just because I gave you a sandwich?"
>Yip remains bowed
>"Yes master."
>you hiss
"Don't call me that."
>"But you are master! You provided for Yip. Now Yip is your kobold, master. Yip!"
>you groan
>just your fucking luck
>another mouth to feed
"Shouldn't you be serving a dragon or something?"
>Yip's body stiffens
>her upright tail turning into a rigid pole
>damn that thing is as thick as she is
>"There are lots and lots and lots of kobolds. Not lots of dragons.
>she whimpers
>"Not enough dragons. Lots of bad kobolds, no masters."
>oh
>well fuck now you feel kind of bad for her
>you sigh as the train rolls up
"And if I take you in, you won't make a mess? Or eat all my food?"
>Yip hops upright and beams
>"No master! Yip will eat leftovers! Yip can clean!"
>Yip hums happily as she follows you onto the train
>and when you take a seat she hops up on your lap and wraps her tail around you
>"Yip has a master~"
>oh boy
>what have you gotten yourself into
>the kobold doesn't let go of you the entire train ride
>you get whispers and stares from the rest of the train's passengers
>you do your best to ignore them
>and ignore the feeling of Yip's body, swaying with the motion of the train, rubbing against your lap
>you're only human, and she's a warm, mostly soft body rubbing up against you
>thankfully she doesn't seem to notice when you get your stop and go to leave
>the kobold trails behind you
>by now the others on the train ignore you
>but you do get a snort from the centaur that's waiting on the platform to board
>he glares at you and the kobold
>"Degenerate."
>Yip stops, staring at the horse-man as he stomps past onto the train
>"Master."
>she whispers
>"I should kill him? He insults you!"
>you blink a few times, parsing her words
"What? No! Don't-- You shouldn't-- No!"
>you're pretty sure she couldn't do more than gnaw the centaur's ankles, but you didn't want to make things worse
>you rush home
>Yip stays at your ankles, keeping up easily
>you let yourself into the living room/kitchen of the cozy apartment
>still a mess from the move
>but you have the essentials
>a couch
>a TV
>a fridge with eggs and half a bottle of ketchup
>piles of clothes
>yep
>living the life
>Yip seems to think so
>the kobold gasp's the moment she steps inside
>"Master's home! So nice!"
>she snaps a rigid salute
>"Yip gets to work now!"
>before you can stop her, she disappears down the hallway to the bedroom
>in no time she's a blur of energy
>using cleaning supplies you didn't even know you had
>you amble to the kitchen and start making some eggs for dinner
>then Yap somehow appears at your side and chases you off
>"Yap cooks! Yap cooks for master."
>okay
>you don't mind
>somehow she knows how to cook like a pro
>she uses salt AND pepper
>and she washes up afterwards
>after dinner you sit down on the couch
>and Yap is there, waiting with hands folded hopefully
>"Master mates Yap now?”
>you choke
"What?!"
>startlingly fast, Yap pulls herself up on your lap, draping her arms around your shoulders, molding her small body against you
>her tail curls around your leg
>"Master has no mate. Master use kobold! Yip is good kobold. Yip wants mate with master!"
>she already has your shirt unbuttoned
>and she going for the pants
"Whoa! I can't just-- Yip! Yip, no!"
>you try to stop her, grabbing her shoulders to push her away
>the kobold just squirms out of your grip, managing to grind her body against you as she evades your grasp again and again
>"Yip yes! Yip is good kobold. Good kobolds mate with master!"
>this is going way too far
>you JUST met her!
>but she's already pulling off her tattered t-shirt
>her body is petite, scrawny but not starved
>warm red scales, smooth and softened to pink on her belly and chest
>small, but perky breasts, and bottom heavy hips that your imagination can't help but dream of how they'd fill out once she's had more food in her
>but this is going to far
>she's already got your pants down somehow
"You can’t mate with me! I’m human!"
>Yip freezes
>then she smiles
>"Human is okay! Yip is city kobold! Very tolerant!"
>you can't get her off of you
>but you sure as hell can get away
>you stand up, with Yip still clinging to you
"No. No way you--Aghfuck!"
>the tail wrapped around your leg clamps down
>Yip twists suddenly, clambering down your body to wrap her arms around the other leg
>you go down
>and she's on top of you again
>sitting on your chest
>by the time you come to your senses, you realize your cock is already out
>because Yip is stroking it with her tail
>"Bad master! Master supposed to take care of kobold!"
>Yip scoots forward, wrapping her thighs around your head
>her pussy is surprisingly human
>soft and pink
>you can tell because she's pressing it against your lips right now
"Stop! Wait! I'm the mast--mmf!"
>your objections are muffled by a mouthful of kobold
>you shut your mouth to try and avoid the inevitable
>Yip growls
>the sound is adorable, like an angry puppy
>less adorable is how she manages to leverage her weight on your shoulders to keep you pinned
>and the forceful grinding against your chin and lips
>"Master is bad! Good master takes care of kobolds! Good kobolds take care of master!"
>you make one last attempt to push her off, dragging your legs under you to push against the ground
>that stops immediately as her dexterous tail wraps around your balls and squeezes
>you let your body fall flat, and glare up at Yip
>she regards you, red eyes flashing in triumph as she pulls her hips back a fraction
>"Master will be good?"
>you grunt
"Can I talk?"
>"No."
>the thighs squeeze around your head again, warm scale squishing your face as your mouth is covered once again
>"Kobold was bad last time. Trusted old master too much. Old master threw us out. This time kobold is good! Kobold make sure master knows better. Kobold teach master how to be good."
>all the while she's talking, Yip grinds her pussy on your face
>getting sloppier as she goes, smearing your cheeks, chin, lips with more and more of her arousal
>she finishes by pressing her lips to yours and looking you in the eye
>"Be good master and Yip be good kobold."
>fuck
>you really don't have a choice
>you just have to eat this kobold's pussy while she strokes your cock with her tail
>and she squishes you with thighs that managed to remain plump in spite of her otherwise scrawny figure
>okay
>maybe you actually want this
>"Be. Good."
>Yip grabs a fistful of your hair
>but you're already opening your mouth
>Yip's claws immediately release your hair as she coos
>"Good master~"
>the tail stroking your falters a moment as you press your tongue into her
>she hisses
>"So deep!"
>you barely started and she’s already shaking
>but the way she's squeezing it doesn't seem like she wants you to stop either
>Yip squeezes your cock in the coil of her tail, running from base to tip
>the sensation of smooth, warm scales lubricated with your own pre-cum, is more pleasurable than you expected
>it has you twitching almost as bad as Yip herself as you swirl your tongue over her clit
>she shivers and shakes
>"T-too much!"
>she grabs your head
>pulling away
>"Master is being--being too good! Yip still needs mating!"
>the tail squeezes you one last time, playing at your tip
>"Master will be good if Yip lets master up?"
>you look up to her, still glazed in her lust
>and you nod
>"Carry Yip. To bedroom. Master should mate with kobolds in bed."
>Yip shuffles back, crawling gingerly with her knees until she's on your lap
>you rise
>pushing off the ground with one arm, the other arm wrapped around her waist
>all the way to the bedroom, Yip's tail stays wrapped around your shaft, pumping away steadily
>clinging onto your shoulders with her claws, and your own waist with her legs
>and the little red kobold keeps her snout in your face, licking your face clean
>though it's more like mixing her saliva with her other bodily fluids
>you stop before a bed that's been stripped of all but the fitted sheet
>you look at it in confusion, before Yip snickers in your ear
>"Yip needs to clean sheets anyways. Now hurry! Yip wants mating!"
>you let her guide you by the tug on your cock
>falling back on the bed with Yip on top
>and in another lithe movement, your cock is trapped between her cheeks
>she grinds on it a moment, gasping
>"Yes! Mating with master~ Good master~"
>Yip leans forward, pushing against your chest to lift herself up
>and with her tail still wrapped around the base of your cock, she lines herself up
>and lowers herself down
>her cunt is tight, befitting her size
>so tight she has to stop nearly halfway down
>it'd be painful if she weren't so wet
>she whimpers, but Yip doesn't give up
>claws digging, teeth grit, hips wriggling
>Yip works all the way down
>"Good kobold~"
>Yip sits there, wrapped around you tight and hot
>you hold onto her hips because it's the only thing you can think of
>every slightest movement sends pleasure through you
>tiny, twitching adjustments she makes for her own comfort have you panting and whimpering
>it's hot
>burning hot
>and her claws feel sharp as glass as they press into your skin
>"Master."
>Yip whines, throwing her head back so her snout is pointed up in the air
>"Master. Master. Master! Yip's master!"
>the whine turns into a growl, then a yowl
>as she starts moving
>grinding back and forth, lifting herself halfway up your cock
>twitching and yipping as she contracts around you, gripping you tight
>then on shaking legs dropping down again and rolling her hips hard this way and that
>it's debilitating
>you can't take it so slow and so long
>you grasp her hips tighter, trying to force Yip to go faster
>but her claws dig into your shoulders
>and her head snaps down, eyes burning red
>"No! No master stays still! Yip almost done! Yip almost done no moving!"
>she babbles furiously
>her grip getting tighter
>claws on your shoulders
>thighs around your hips
>cunt around your cock
>and she grinds
>slowly, forcefully, desperately
>with more power than should be possible in such a small frame she holds you down to rock her hips back and forth
>though she goes no faster, she stares at you intensely
>digging in with her claws harder
>wrapping her tail around your leg
>her moans getting louder, mixed with soft yips and hisses
>and her blazing eyes bore into you
>and she contracts around you with every roll of her hips
>"Good master, good m-master, good master!"
>the last devolves into a moan as she gives a truncated thrust of her hips and clamps down
>if you thought she was tight before, it's unbelievable now
>constricting around you painfully as the little creature climaxes
>you feel almost crushed
>and you cock is left twitching and balls aching from overstimulation
>Yip whimpers through her orgasm
>until finally she slows to a standstill and sighs
>she releases you from her claws, leaving four little pinpricks on your shoulders
>Yip licks her lips as she studies you
>"Good master. Now is Yip's turn. Good kobold make master feel good."
>you pick your head up to ask what she's going to do
>but she shows you in a flash
>hitching her tail up to use your leg
>first pushing off
>then pulling down
>jerking herself off your cock, and then impaling herself to the hilt again harder and faster than she could with just gravity
>your head falls back on the bed
>you see white
>Yip works her hip in a blur, squeezing you with her thighs as she rides you faster than you can perceive in your worked-up state
>just a blur of red, hot pleasure
>"Good--masters--cum--in--kobold!"
>Yip is snout-to-face with you
>admonishing you eve as she rides you so hard you're bouncing off the mattress
>you're close to bursting
>and impossibly, Yip manages to go even faster
>"Be--good--master!"
>you be a good master
>cumming inside Yip as she pistons herself on your cock
>she keeps up the breakneck pace even as you shudder and thrust, arching your back so you lift her off the bed
>but with her tail's grip she just keeps on going
>and you keep on cumming
>filling the little kobold with so much seed than it leaks out of her with every thrust
>making an awful mess of the bed sheet
>with a final buck, you lose your tenuous traction on the sweat-slick sheets, and Yip drives you back down on the mattress
>a final burst of pleasure that leaves you reeling and gasping
>Yip slows to a halt, dragging herself off your cock with a coo of satisfaction
>"Good, good master~"
>leaning down, she presses a scaly kiss to your lips
>for a while you lay there, catching your breath and holding your kobold
>when there's a knock on the door
>you blink lazily
"Huh?"
>Yip gives you another kiss
>"No worry master. Is just other kobolds."
>you barely comprehend
"Other kobolds?"
>Yip hums
>"My sisters. Good kobolds come in packs."
>she picks her head up and calls down the hall
>”Come in! Yip unlocked door!”
>you hear a babble of at least three more chattering kobold voices entering your apartment
>gasps and exclamations and cries of ‘master’s home!’
>”In here!”
>Yip calls to her sisters
>you hear feet rushing for the bedroom
>Yip smiles down at you
>”Good kobolds share, too!”

>surrender to the anthros
>The war was lost a long time ago
>Get brought in for re education
>"I saw these foids rip men apart on the battle field. What diabolical torture do they have planned now?"
>paw worship time :3

Being physically stronger than human men is one of the best parts of anthro women. Simping femdom is just basic bitch boring.

>Human woman tries getting you to simp for her
>Based Harecel picks you up off the ground, and takes you back to the burrow for some inter species relations, away from white women.
>A few months later sales of carrots have octupled (How strange?)
>"Can higgers even compete?"

"Too freaking warm for a coat..."
>I chided myself under the fading hues of twilight
>the rising moon was almost as yellow and shining as gold, growing to a straw color as it rested to the opposite horizon of the sun that scattered the last light through late summer clouds
>although this was the moon christening the first lunar eve of autumn, no sign of the light chill came like I anticipated
>this evening was balmy, and a little humid. the kind of warm day where the air must take time to let off the heat before any cooling breeze could come and sweep away the heat radiating off the concrete, stone and tarmac of the small township street
>my phone was vibrating
>ugh
>I felt that little tugging at my chest. That little jolt of something between anxious dread and a tired spite
"Ngh... What now...?"
>I grumbled. I didn't want to text her right now
>frankly I couldn't stand to say her name
>or think about her stupid face
>she was the reason I wasn't even in home right now, buying cheap booze and walking as far as I could
>"Where are you? I was not done talking to you!"
>I felt the hot feeling of anger and the tensing of muscle in my face as I tried to hate her away
>my fingers channeled the spite and frustration in the back of my throat
"Oh yeah? well I was. leave me the fuck alone."
>so fucking tired of this bitch, saying just that to her was deeply cathartic
>I was tired of being always wrong, always profiled as the antagonist, always having my vulnerabilities turned against me like jagged knives
>the only regret I had right now was leaving with just my wallet, phone and pocketknife
>still on my phone, I texted my best friend, Philip
"Hey man, big fight with Gina. I think I'm done..."
>"Shit bro, I'm sorry... what are you going to do?"
>I replied pretty fast. on second look the way I wrote my last message seemed a bit too final not to make a friend worry
"Right now, I'm gonna find a nice quiet motel to drink and cool off in. then I'm going back once I'm sober, packing my shit and getting the fuck out of there for good. Gina can keep the place, I want nothing to do with anything she's so much as touched."
>"alright, if you need a place to crash after the fallout. you go ahead and let me know."
>if ever there was a reward for dealing with someone like Gina for as long as I had. it was having a friend in Philip
>he was the gentle sort; was I can remember at least 2 occasions where he very gingerly voiced concerns over Gina
>I wished I'd listened sooner
>Phil was never the kind of guy to hold it over my head, even when he felt the need to say 'I told you so'
>the moon was higher now, its hue more like a straw color now. and the lamps appeared brighter in the lower light
>what a piss poor night to explode
>though, on the other hand, it's a great night to break a few chains
>even if that took a breakdown and an epiphany while I was being emotionally raked over the coals
>this was for the best
>the local motel should be this way... but...
>this brush around me feels a little much
>isn't there anyone taking care of this side street?
>the brick wall with grey capstones along its length was swallowed by vines, shrubs and all kinds of the local vegetation
>maybe the city's been slacking off here
>checking my phone along the road to see if I'd somehow taken a wrong turn didn't help
>no signal
>whatever, I'll wait till I see a landmark with some Wi-Fi and course-correct then
>a breeze came along, frigid in that unforgiving way
>and the streetlamps appeared more and more antiquated
>the realization suddenly hit me
>where was the ambient heat?
>why was the pavement replaced with dirt?
>the moon...
>that was not my moon
>nevermind the lack of any yellow, it was... different. characteristic dark markings looked like nothing what I knew
>it was a face, skeletal and sunken, screaming silently in terror... forever
>no plausible deniability or rationalization would ever shirk the fact that something was wrong
>not with the evidence in the sky, glowing balefully
>and now with any illusion gone. something was indeed, horribly, excruciatingly... wrong
>to my right where the brick garden wall was before replaced with the thick foliage of vines and brush
>my heart pounded in my chest with a pure panic that had no way out, no outlet to react against and no
>how did I get here? why am I here? is this a dream, or hallucination?
>it took all of my will to check my phone a second time
>the time was midnight... and I stared at it long enough for a minute to have definitely passed
>the rationalist within me was still fighting tooth and nail, however. and I used my phone's timer to test if a minute had passed
>a full 60 seconds on the stopwatch... and yet midnight remained on the clock
>an epiphany, like a glacier crept into the back of my mind like it was crawling up my spine- brining terror as its companion
>an urge, a dreadful thirst to know for certain, a need to see
>the impulse begged me: 'look behind you. you must know, you must see if you can turn back'
>I had to wrench control from the sense of impending doom to turn my head to see the path behind me...
>horror... pure, pitch black, as sharp as knives and cold as ice, swallowed me whole
>the lamps that were my loyal attendant through the night on the path behind me were gone
>replaced by a narrow dirt road who's only feature it shared with the one I knew was high wall of vegetation on the easternly side
>the path behind stretched into the shadow beyond the border of the lamp I stood near like a child clinging to his mother
>I felt like I was going to vomit, faint, and suffer a heart attack all at once
>the only thing that vaguely gave me any succor was the stretch of lamps that seemed to go on still on the narrow, winding and uncertain road ahead
>no other options, I had to walk on into the path encased by a canopy of gnarled trees and flickering, now somehow encased-flame lamplight
>another thing to add to the long list of things that inexplicably changed some time along my trek to a motel
>the trees above obscuring the sky gave me a little solace, at least
>I was starting to get the sensation that awful, vile moon was watching me...
>my lack of any means of defaulting to my visual senses made my ears more sensitive, small noises caused my eyes to dart in its direction somewhere in the dark, praying each time it was merely the wind
>I still had the cider, rum and vodka I bought from the liquor store...
>while still walking, I take one of the many Wayfarer Cider bottles and uncap it with my pocketknife
>after a hardy swig from the bottle, my eyes wandered to its label as I savored the sweet and tart taste
>the oval depicted an armed, journeying adventurer at night by a river under the crescent moon. motioning to cut free an apple shiny like a candy red by its stem between a dagger and his thumb from a wizened and knotted old tree that hung over him, almost with a kind of benevolence
>irony, thy name is wayfarer tonight
>I wish right now so badly to switch places with the man in the drawing
>not upon any star though... no star in these skies was my comrade
>no, definitely not
>warmth was spreading to my extremities again a bit more, and the edge of everything was starting to fade away
>I could at least walk with a bit more uprightness now
>still following the lamps, and still afraid
>but with some comfort
>a small itch in the back of my skull told me that the lamps I passed by I would never see again
>and once more, upon checking- that instinct was woefully correct
>I wasn't sure what I expected by now. this evil place, whatever it is- has pulled the floor from under me 3 times before already
>whatever this place was
>it was somehow, someway, out to get me
>that much I think is an undisputed fact
