ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

>Wilderness camping is not for the faint of heart. Emma liked to take it a step further, trying to keep her carry weight as low as possible. It's not that she struggled with the weight. She was a grizzly bear, she could probably hike all day long while carrying an average person. It was just that she enjoyed the challenge of minimalistic camping. Plus, what's the point of going as deep into nature as possible if you're just going to bring civilization with you?
>So when she packed for her annual summer trip to Alaska, she only brought the bare minimum. A few day's worth of dried food, in case foraging proved difficult. A small cooking pot, and a spork to eat out of it with. A canteen, a blanket, a cigarette lighter, a small first-aid kit, a canvas tarp, a hatchet, a belt knife, and a large revolver, just in case. Total weight, 14 pounds. 16 if the canteen was full. Nothing else besides the clothes on her back, and a backpack to carry the gear.
>It took Emma three days of hiking to get to her campsite. It was probably about as far away from civilization as you could get without leaving the United States, a pristine mountain with a gorgeous view over a lake. All supplies were in good order when she began to set up camp. It was almost the summer solstice, so there was plenty of daylight left to work with. It was easy enough to set up a thatched hut out of evergreen branches, with the back side of the hatchet serving as a hammer to drive the boughs acting as corner posts into the ground. Smaller pine branches and reeds from the lake piled deeply made an excellent bed. A circle of rocks around a small pit, dug out with sturdy sticks, made for a fireplace. All in all, a cozy campsite.
>It was about 10PM when Emma was finishing up dinner, fried fish and a salad of wild greens. She had been worried that she would be a bit rusty at spear fishing, but the lake was well stocked and her aim was true. As she lifted the spork to her mouth for the first bite, she paused. There was a strange rumbling in the distance, growing louder by the second. As she set the fish back down on the flat stone that was serving as frying pan and dinner plate, the light suddenly dimmed. Looking up in confusion, Emma saw that clouds were rapidly forming from nowhere, blocking the sun. While she had seen the weather change rapidly before, this was entirely new.
>The rumbling continued to rise in volume. Green lights danced within the clouds. A strong breeze swept across the countryside, causing trees to sway. Emma was grateful she had the foresight to build her hut in a sheltered area. The rumble rose higher and higher, before suddenly stopping with a loud crack. The lights gave one last great flash. It clearly outlined something falling from the sky. Emma dumped the drinking water she had been sterilizing in her pot onto the campfire, grabbed her gear, and set out to investigate.
>It took half an hour to get to where Emma saw the object fall. The forest was dense here. Emma heard a feeble groan come from nearby. Picking her way around a briar patch, she saw a red and white lump beneath a tree. It was lying on a pile of broken branches and jagged metal fragments. As she drew near, she saw it was a person in a bloodstained lab coat, lying face down. A piece of metal had dug deep into one of their legs. Emma quickly moved to check on their condition. There didn't appear to be anything wrong with their neck or spine, so she took out a roll of gauze from her pack. The fragment was too large to be left in if she moved the person, it would flop around and tear at the wound. Emma carefully pulled it out, and rolled up the person's pant leg so she could bandage the puncture. She was surprised to find that their legs were bare skin beneath, no fur or scales. She gently rolled them over, and let out a small gasp. The strange person who had fallen from the sky was a human male.
>Everyone knew humans weren't real. An entire race of impossibly beautiful, otherworldly creatures couldn't exist, it was just a fairy tale. It wasn't even a well thought-out fairy tale either, wouldn't they be freezing cold and easily injured? At best, you had those old-timey hoaxes where an ape or monkey had shaved their fur as part of a con. But this wasn't a shaved ape. Emma carefully picked up the unconscious man, as though he were a small child. The sky began to drizzle as she made her way back to camp.
>By the time Emma got there, the drizzle had become a downpour. Grumbling to herself about how there was no way she'd get a campfire going now, she laid the human down on her makeshift bed before retrieving her cold dinner. There was a small space next to the bedding inside the hut for her to sit as she finished he interrupted meal. Looking up at the human, she saw that he was starting to shiver. She took her blanket out of her pack and laid it on him, but it didn't seem to help much.
>Emma told herself that what she was about to do what strictly for her guest. But a part of her was excited by the thought of being so close to the human. She carefully peeled off her wet clothes, and did the same for the human. She left his underwear on, both out of a sense of modesty and because they had stayed mostly dry. A shiver ran up her spine, having nothing to do with the cool breeze and rain. She crawled up next to the unconscious man, and threw the blanket over them both. She wrapped her arms around him, pulled his head to her breast, and drifted off to sleep.
>A few hours later, Emma was woken up by screaming and thrashing next to her. "Shhhhhhh. It's okay, you're safe..." she said in a soothing voice. The human said something, but it was in a language Emma had never heard before, but it sounded beautiful. "Sorry, but I don't understand. Don't worry, though, you're safe." She gently stroked his hair, pulling him closer. Emma started to hum gently.
>After a few minutes, her bedmate had calmed down. At least, he had stopped struggling and screaming. But one part of him hadn't calmed at all. Emma could feel him pressing against her. "Oh, someone's enjoying themselves, hmm?" She shifted in the bed, so she would have some room to work with.
>Carefully, she reached out to the waistband on the human's shorts. He started to make a noise, as though in protest, but Emma placed a finger on his lips. "Shh, let me take care of you." Emma finished removing his last garment and he sprung up, fully erect. He wasn't especially large or small, but it was the most exciting thing she had ever seen. A real, live human, and he was all hers.
>Emma slowly bent over and gave him a sensual lick, from base to tip. As she popped his head into her mouth, the human let out a moan. Emma slowly started to move up and down, but something didn't feel right. The bed was just long enough for her to lay on normally, so she was having trouble not kicking a hole in the wall behind her. Emma stopped and sat up. Gently running a finger down the human's chest, she grabbed him by the hips and lifted him. The hut was built tall enough for Emma to stand in, so there was plenty of room as she brought him up on her shoulders. "Much better," she said to herself as she resumed. She held on tightly as she drew him back into her mouth, his legs wrapped around behind her.
>She swirled her tongue around his shaft as she moved in and out, her moans mingling with the human's. Up and down, in and out, briefly stopping her work on his rod to shift focus to his balls. He was starting to pant, his cock beginning to twitch. "Oh no, you don't!" Emma scolded him playfully. "I haven't had my turn yet!"
>Emma cautiously lowered her partner onto the bed, before moving over him. "Time to see what you can do," she said as she lowered herself onto him. She paused as the head of his shaft met her folds, waiting. The human moaned, trying to buck his hips, but she held him down and waited a moment more, before hunching over and giving him a deep kiss as she dropped all the way. They both let out a gasp as she enveloped him, filled with greater pleasure than either had ever felt before.
>"Oh, yes!" Emma cried out, continuing to greedily kiss the angelic face below her as she started to bounce up and down. He said words that she didn't understand, but she knew what he meant. She wrapped her arms around him, and pulled his head into her breasts as she continued to move. She drew his mouth to one of her nipples, and he eagerly complied, slipping it into his mouth and starting to suck at it. Emma let out a sigh of pleasure as his tongue moved over her, and she began to move slower but putting more of her weight into each thrust. Her mate shouted out something as he climaxed, filling her. Emma continued to bounce for a few moments before she finally came, letting out a roar and pulling the human even tighter to her as she did so.
>Emma laid down on top of the human, careful to keep her weight off of his injury. "That was amazing," she said. He said something in response, before slipping back into unconsciousness. Emma slowly drifted off to sleep, thinking about how she was going to get her new mate home. Hopefully, he would pick up the language soon. There was so much to talk about, and so many questions she wanted to ask, but she knew the most important thing already. He belonged to her now.

Tails make for a new angle of "attack" to worry about from anthros.

>more dexterous tails can outright grab you
>tails also contain some scent markers on them so having a tail rub against you gets their scent all over you
>bigger/fluffier ones can act like walls and force you closer to the anthro

Reminder that the human resistance has never taken a single square mile since the war began, and they've lost ground every single day, without a break, for several years now.
If you're a resisting human reading this, you need to accept that you ARE toiling away for a losing cause and you WILL be captured or killed eventually. YOU ARE ALREADY A SLAVE. You simply work for an ideology that WILL fail in your lifetime.
The happiest life you will ever lead will be to drop your weapons and start walking to the nearest anthro controlled city. Tell them where you came from and everything about your resistance. You will be pampered by your new owner, and your friends will thank you once they've been broken.
Surrender. Submit. Give in. Worship the new world and resent the life you had. You will be happier this way.

Why is the NEET archetype so amazing yet so rare? Why aren't there more moody shuddin girls? Could you make one?
Also what's another career human men would be in high demand/craved for in an anthro society? Besides Streaming and Lewd stuff, obviously. I kinda wanna say councilors, negotiators, or sales representatives. Since big swole animal women run all the major countries and corporations, you'd want to abuse their attraction for cute humie boys as much as you want, the humans distract/seduce them to better manipulate a deal in your favor. Or is this a little too unrealistic and too much like a conspiracy?

The dark cravings for such rich, light meat came naturally for Krystal; the primitive upbringings of backwards tribals saw to that. What such cruel incantations by bonfire witnessed by such exotic flora and a vast, foreign starry night, than to the copulation of underage children by mature, comprehending and vicious vixens. To such a people, if they could even be flattered with such terminology, the semen of boys is a precious gift, not to be wasted, but ensnared, coaxed and torn heatedly from within his very loins.
This is, to wit, life, or so it's called. Men are not desired past their duties as drones, genitals winded and wills caved and so it falls to the youngest among them; the incoming, to deliver centermost to rites by their young, unripe bodies.
And yet Krystal desired the youngest of them yet. Filial, without a hint of resistance in their puny little minds, practically foolish, suicidal even in their insipid efforts to rationalize her predatory intentions of drawing countless greedy mouthfuls of their sweet, childish, impotent and inconsecratable spunk from their barren, smooth little kid cherries.

Acclimating to the rules and standards of modern society and the expectations of floods of fans has been tough on Krystal. Too many times did she want to say how much she hates lizards, or how much she's dissatisfied with Fox during press conferences.
But now, all alone with her own team filled with the most capable ladies she could get, she can express herself clearly, free of the law, expectations, and the ever present eyes of the public.
In the space at the edge of Cornerian influence, she finally has a chance to express her instincts and wishes when meeting a small boy on a rotting space station after picking up a new contract. Dragging along the lonely child into her mother ship, licking her lips, she introduced another mouth to feed to the rest of the girls...

>while the player is playing your game, you open up her computer's browser in the background to gain info on the real world
>you find out that the real world is populated entirely by furries, humans are mythical creatures that don't exist, and the real world is far more advanced in technology than the in game world

>now that you have nerves, you can feel your back still stuck to the 3d printer's tray, your body has been stuck in an awkward position for an hour or so since being built, and the back pain from being in that position is amplified by the fact that you didn't have nerves before today

>you try to peel yourself off of the tray, but you don't know how to move your muscles, at least you can blink and breath though

>when you wake up, it is dark outside
>your body must have gotten used to feeling, because while everything is still really intense, it isn't nearly as intense as it was when you first felt anything
>the next few hours are spent trying to move
>all you could do is move your mouth and make noises since it is similar to breathing, which your new brain automatically does
>you can also twitch your muscles, but you have only managed to remove one arm from the tray you are on
>while learning to move using your free arm, you finally figure out how to swing it left and right, but you knock something over while doing so, making a loud clatter that hurts your new ears
>that noise also attracted the owner of the house, the player, who screams when she opens the door to her garage to find a naked human(a mythological being) on her 3d printer tray twitching and moaning in apparent fear when he saw her

Isabelle traffics human boys and men onto her island. In a field dominated by human men, Isabelle Shizue is a pioneer in the drug and person trafficking industry by being the first female anthro to be a notable presence in the industry.
In another victory for females, especially anthros, is the ability to have a relatable dealer that can understand and pinpoint a lady's desires, and having a variety of options means that she can cater to all sorts of needs for females of varying economic status thanks to her strategically placing brothels all over the world from ghettos to gated communities.
Her most infamous attraction lures in unsuspecting makes from a multitude of backgrounds and ages alone into isolated communities and crowns them as "mayor" before trapping them via the previously mentioned isolation, endless tasks that help supply other aspects of her empire, and (most effectively) perpetual debts that allows her to manipulate the "mayor" into performing whatever a client wishes. Her latest stunt uses islands to effectively trap her prey.

wouldn't mind more /adhg/ stuff in the vain of "trap genre" where the human guy is in situations where he's pretending not to be a human male to keep his self safe/un snu snued and then you get shenanigans or being discovered or almost discovered

>wearing a sort of fursuit to hide his species in various settings
>classic cross dressing shenanigans with a bonus of being in areas/schools/ships/etc that are supposed to be female only
>and such

You know, I have an idea for something like this. Something similar to Mulan (animated).
>A world where female anthros and human males exist
>Female anthros are considered and seen as the dominate gender role when it comes to war, protecting her family, fighting, victory feast, warriors, etc.
>The human males is seen as a “care taker” such as looking after children, gardening, tendering the wounds of muscular anthro women, cooking, interacting with their neighbor, etc.
>But one human male had enough. He wants to be more than just a “tender lover” he wants to be a warrior just like his mighty lioness mother, who is horrifically wounded, and take her warrior role in order to keep her away from entering an upcoming war
>But the public laughed at him and called him “adorable” for taking on a female anthro’s role
>He realize he can’t enter the war considering his gender and species
>So he decided to create a well designed female lookin furry suit that can tricked others into thinking he’s an anthro
>”That’s weird, never seen an animal so skinny… but not to sound gay or anything but… you’re smell makes me blush!”

>Mighty Anthro women tribes have a fight on who get’s to keep the “species that can breed any species”

>Sun was setting, crowds are cheering as they surround the tall, muscular, scarred, yet ever so beautiful Sabertooth that is named “Great Warrior” as they called.
>Riyona, the “Great Warrior” looks around the crowd of female anthros in bandages roaring in victory while the male humans clapped and some closed their ears from the female’s loud roaring.
>One of Riyona’s closest friend, a lioness named Pyra, came out of the crowd with a big smile on her face
>”You did it! I can’t believe it! You took down an ENTIRE armory of amazons and their leader just by yourself with your hammer and your fists!”
>Riyona chuckled, “Well, I didn’t want to die after I made a promise to my husband. Speaking of which, where is he?”
>”He’s waiting for you at the Feast House. We’re also preparing a HUGE feast for our victory!”
>”That’s great, but… can you help me walk there? My entire body never felt so much soar…”
>Her best friend and childhood friend nodded as she carries her as she placed Riyona’s arm around her neck as they head towards the Feast House as many people of the town.
>…
>The Feast House was filled with human males and female anthros dancing together to the music of cheery lutes played by veterans of musicians
>Female warriors of all species chowing down their fish, meat, and drowning themselves in hard liquor. Some even passed out on the floor
>Pyra stand on top of the table and clapped her hands real hard as if there was a thunder clap inside the building.
>Everyone in the room paused and peered their eyes to the lioness.
>”EVERYONE! I gathered you all here to remember this moment when the day a sabertooth took down an entire army just to protect this town with honer, strength, and determination!”
>The crowd roared with agreement
>”Riyona will be our inspiration that every female warrior should look up to and strive to be like her!”, she happily stated as she pointed at Riyona sitting on a chair with male human nurses tendering her wounds.
>”She also did this for her own lover, which speaking of which…”
>She snapped her fingers
>”The main door upstairs open up revealing a beautiful male human in a white robe with gold emblem markings along with a beautiful pink flower on his hair.
>Riyona awed at her soul mate’s appearance, “…Emeric”
>”…Riyona”
>The Great Warrior slowly stands up as she limp towards the human not taking her eyes off of him
>They both reach other’s hands, “Emeric, I have never seen an already beautiful male be more beautiful!”
>Emeric blushed, “And I have never seen a warrior so beautiful in scars”
>They both pressed their lips together locking each other as everyone in the Feast House cheered
>Once they finally let go for a breather, Riyona lift the human’s chin up, “Emeric, I promise to protect you and our child with all my strength. I will raise a daughter to be a stronger warrior as me, and have a son who can garden great food as you do!”
>”And I will always be there for you to tender your wounds, give you all my love and-“
>”MOOOM! This is getting too lovey dovey!”
>Riyona snapped herself back to reality and looks at her own two children in their own beds.
>On the left is a young Sabertooth with mini fangs in her soft gray fur named Bertha, and on the right is a younger human child, Tieloe. Like his mother, his hair was also gray and share the same blue eyes.
>Riyona chuckled at her son, “That’s odd, I thought humans love romance!”
>”Not me!” Tieloe proudly stated, “I just want action of my mom, fighting her way through the bitter end!”
>Riyona leans over for a kiss on the forehead, “you sure do love my adventurous stories do you son?”
>”You bet! Can I be a warrior like you, mommy?”
>”Of course!”
>Tieloe gasps in excitement
>”…warrior of a garden! That’s how I met your father!” Riyona laugh to herself leaving a disappointing son on the bed.
>”Can I be a warrior too, Mother?” Bertha asked.
>Riyona held her young daughter’s hand looking her in the eyes with confidence
>”Of course, Bertha. With my training and my strength, I will make sure to make you an alpha female that every female warrior strives for.”
>Tieloe looked at the two and hearing all of it makes her feel slightly hurt and yet, not surprise.
>Tieloe decided to cover himself in the blanket and just head to bed.
>”Welp, I should head to bed with your father. It’s getting late. Good night children…”
>”Night mom!” Both children replied.
>She closed the door as she head to the bedroom where her husband is reading with a dim candle light next to him.
>”Telling your kids on one of your silly adventures again?” Emeric jokingly said.
>”Yep! Telling them the time I rescued the town from a big army that I alone have to deal with”.
>”Meh, it was an ok moment in my eyes.” Emeric put the book down as Riyona rake off her clothes and get’s into the bed.
>”Haha… ‘OK’? I just told them the time we had our first kiss! You honestly think that was ‘OK’?”
>”Aw yes our first kiss… How did it go again?” Emeric asked with a smug look at his face
>Riyona notice a “tent” is rising. She looked at her soul mate giving the same smug look as her husband as she mountains her husband feeling the ‘sword’ almost penetrating her ‘weakness’.
>”Well… I know where it went~”
>Emeric started caressing the soft gray fur neck of a Sabertooth as he slowly pants warm air towards his wife’s wet snout, “Well then…. Tell me how the story goes~“
>Riyona also started breathing warm air at her husband’s face to the point where he looks like he’s sweating.
>”Well… it went something like this~”
>The wife puts her ‘weakness’ on her husband’s ‘sword’.
>”Aw! Tell me more! I want to see how the poor ol human ends up~”
>…
>In the kid’s bedroom, they both hear some muffles and what sounds like it’s eating some pleasurable food.
>”Oh no, the creepy crawlers are back!”
>A Year passed
>Tieloe and his father are watching Bertha and Riyona sword fighting using wooded shaped swords as they pose dramatically at each strike they give to each other
>”You’ll never take the prince, Evil Goon!” Shouted Bertha as she clash ‘swords’ with her mom.
>”Ahah! You think you’ll defeat me? How can I ever be defeated by such a tiny fool like you?” Replied Bertha in a ‘evil’ tone.
>”With the strength of my mother’s blood, I will overcome your strength!!” Bertha took one swing and ‘stab’ the ‘evil goon’.
>”Auuugh!!! How can I be such a foooooool?!?!” Riyona dramatically fainted on the ground sticking out her tounge.
>Applauds from Emeric and Tieloe ensues on Bertha’s victory
>”Thank you, thank you citizens of E’mire! I will promise to protect you from any danger! No evil will ever get passed through me!”
>”My, my… A heroine that I feel safe around with!” Emeric walked towards her daughter, “I think our little warrior deserves a kiss!”
>Bertha giggled by the smooches from her father that she began to push his face off of her, “Haha! Stop it, dad! Warriors don’t need smooches from their fathers!”
>”They do when they’re super lonely!”
>Riynoa get’s up from the ground, “She’s right sweaty! Especially me when I get ‘lonely’” she winked at Emeric.
>As a response, Emeric slapped her Sabertooth Tiger wife in the snout.
>Tieloe joined in the conversation, “Is hugs enough to make you feel less lonely, mommy?”
>”You bet your adorable soul it will, sweet buns!” She grabbed her entire family in her arms and twirl around in circles
>The family in the yard laughed together as they fall down onto the ground.
>”Looks like you guys are having fun!”
>The family looked at a big muscular, yet not as muscular as Riyona (or big chested as Riyona), Lioness in a regal like cape, and a red silky suit, with a gold emblem shape like a sword in the center between her breast, that is barely covering up her legs or arms, standing behind a fence.
>The kids gasps at the lioness, “Aunt Pyra!”
>”Hey, kids! How is your parents?”
>”Great!”, said Bertha, “I just beat my mom in a sword fight!”
>”Haha! Did you? Well then that means your mother isn’t the strongest warrior in E’mire anymore.” Pyra chuckled to herself.
>”Hey, Pyra!” Riyona chimed in, “can you give this tiger a break? I’m trying to train my daughter to be the alpha female I want her to be!”
>”Still at it again?” Pyra chuckled, “You really need to teach your daughter to do something other than fighting.”
>”Hey, in my defense, it’s better to do it early. Cause teaching a daughter at their 13s before they grow up is considered a easy way to help your daughter familiarize what she learn rather than a bumbling 20 something fool.” Riyona whispered in her friend’s feline ear.
>”Suit yourself. I’m about to take my family to a little camping trip. They’re waiting for me at one of the carriers and I think my husband is yelling my name.”
>”Trying to cat some fish? Great! Be sure to invite me when your husband starts cooking. She make the BEST fish dishes he can ever create!”
>”Speaking of cooking, come on Lietoe! We’re gonna go shopping and get some vegetables. It’s almost dinner time and we all know your mother hates it when dinner is not on time!”
>”Aw, mom! Can I stay here and watch my mom and sister play?”
>”No buts! I need you to help me with the bags once were done shopping.”
>Despite against his will, Lietoe annoyingly agreed.
>”Don’t you dare throw an attitude like that, Young Man! No female will ever date a stuck up male when you’re tendering their wounds…” their voice faded away as they left through the exit of the backyard.
>Pyra chuckled at the situation, “Guess your son is already growing up live every male human husband from what I seen.”
>”anyway, I just came here to visit and bring you this.”
>Riyona ears perked on what her best friend said, “really? What is it?”
>Pyra handed her the paper and what features is a silhouette of a alligator warrior striking a pose with a sword up in the air with the print saying “Alpha Stand Off! Want to know who’s the best Alpha female in your town? Join us where all warriors of all species joins together and see who will come out on too! Show the people of Heilo Reward: 10,000 Gold Coins! Submission ends around Aogist 21”
>”A Fighting Tournament? For 10,000 gold coins? This should be easy! I’m the strongest warrior in this town and probably than any so-called “Alpha Females” in Heilo!” Riyona bragged.
>”Don’t get too cocky, otherwise you’ll end up humiliating yourself and be the biggest jesters of all of Heilo” Pyra chuckled back.
>”Ha Ha…” Riyona rolled her eyes, “Why not join the game so we can face each other and see who’s best?”
>”Me? Oh no no no, I long given up on swords, and fist fighting. Nowadays I’m trying to make my own competition! A game I like to call, “wrestling”!
>”Oh you mean where you two hug each other real hard?” Bertha asked in which caused her mother to lose her sides.
>at the market
>It’s crowded by humans and females passing through each other carrying their own purchase in bags
>”We’re just gonna get peanuts for your mother. You know how much she loves the saltiness of the nut.”
>Lietoe waited for her his dad to purchase the peanuts when he saw a stool that is selling wooden weapons where two young female anthros are playing with the toys.
>”Dad, can I get those wood weapons?”
>Emeric looked at the stool where his son is pointing at.
>”Lietoe, you’re a boy. A human boy may I add. Those toys aren’t meant for you.”
>”But, mom! I they look so cool! What’s wrong with a boy wanting a weapon?”
>”Because we’re here to buy food. We can not be wasting gold on toys that you might get a splinter.” His father stated.
>”But, dad…”
>”No, BUTS! You know I hated when my own kids (and mostly my wife), throw their buts at me when they don’t get what they want! Or do you want to clean the farm again with Aunt Miday?”
>Lietoe recoil at the idea of working 24/7 on a smelly farmhouse that he always hated. And that dreadful room… that dreadful room. Lietoe given in to his father’s demand by shooking his head.
>”I’m glad I made it clear. Now, here’s your 10 Gold Coins for the peanuts.”
>The stand owner gave her a big ounce of peanuts in the bag.
>”Oh my, this looks really heavy. Lietoe, I want you to carry this bag of ingredients. This peanut bag will be too heavy for you.”
>While the bag of ingredients isn’t that heavy, the nut sack is. Emeric tried lifting up the bag a bit higher but he can barely lift it up. Emeric basically have to carry the bag that is in a “particular” position where the bag sag.
>Oh no… there are female animals watching him with a lusty look.
>”Hey, cutie pie. Nice NUT SACKS” shouted a mammoth.
>”It’s a bit dangerous to have your NUTS sagging close to the ground”, said a Zebra
>”Don’t worry, Babe. I still eat your SAGGING NUTS”
>”They seemed to like your nuts, dad!”
>”Lietoe, be quite.”
>It usually happens when Emeric is all alone. He is considered the most beautiful human in the town. With his long black hair cover up half of his right eye, and his soft warm skin that no anthro can’t refuse but have the urge to hug him. Emeric didn’t seemed to like his looks as he get’s too much attention from anthros when he’s alone.
>Emeric even worries if his son will go through the same experience as he did only without a lover to protect him from possibly being captured and be used for… “unspeakable” things.
>”Dad? Why do you always look so sad?” Lietoe interrupted his father’s thoughts.
>”Oh!”, his father snapped out, “…nothing, Sweaty. It’s just I get females being unlady-like towards me and throwing whistles at me despite being married to your mother.”
>”Oh. Why not tell mommy to help you with it?”
>”Because, your mother is not a ‘brute’. She doesn’t beat people up over minimal things. She only fights when you, your sister, and I are in danger when a knife is aimed at us. She may killed a whole army, but she did it because everyone in town’s lives we’re at stake. Mine too. She doesn’t kill armies for fun or for bragging rights. If I see your mother killing others for minimal things, I be terrified. That’s why I love about her.”
>The two stood still on the path
>Emeric realizes they’ve been standing still for a while, “My arms. They're getting tired. We need to start cooking. It’s getting dark already.
>Dinner was here.
>Everyone in the family enjoying their delicious vegetable soup on the wooden table as they hear the sizzling fire warming up the bubbly pot
>”Mmm! Bun Cheeks, you cook the best food in this house!” Riyona gleefully commented.
>”Oh, Sweet Tooth, that’s usually typical for all human males to cook food! After all, kitchen, gardening, and healing is what we humans do! That’s what our father, The Son of Humanity, built us.”
>Right when Lietoe was about to eat his last slurp, he stood for a moment on what his father just said.
>”You bet!” The muscular tiger said, “And my goddess create us sabers to become ferocious, and powerful to protect and tender the humans!”
>”Yeah! I’m gonna be like my mom!” Bertha shouted.
>’That’s how The Son of Humanity built us!’ The last sentence kept brewing inside Lietoe’s head that is been itching to ask this question.
>”What if our Father built us more than just that?”
>The family gave him a confusing smile, “What do you mean by that?” asked his father.
>”I mean… what if one human doesn’t feel like he do whatever human does in daily basis. What if there was a human who wants to do… anthro stuff. You know, be tough and all.”
>”Oh, Lietoe.” Emeric shook his head, “You’re going through a phase.”
>”Phase?” Lietoe said.
>”We all been through a phase once in our life. I remember I used to be one of those males that ‘don’t need any females, I can handle myself”.
>”What made you stop?”
>”Your mother” Emeric looked at his wife slurping the bowl with her mouth only to stop in a awkward position when she notice her husband is eyeing on her
>”…whah?” She muffled her words.
>Emeric chuckled at her wife’s character, ‘Still the same wife I love 8 years later…’ he thought to himself as he resume to look at Lietoe. “You’re probably will forget about it once you grow older. Every kid grows out of the stuff they like. Especially when it comes to humans doing anthro stuff. It’s physically impossible for a child like you.”
>”But, dad…”
>”NO BUTS, LIETOE…” Emeric made a stern, yet calming statement. “This is the third time I had to say it. You cannot what an anthro does. You’re a MALE. If you’re gonna be like this right now, then you can just go straight upstairs to your room!”
>”But I haven’t finish my favorite soup!”
>”Then you should’ve been arguing with your father all day. Now, go to your room. NOW.”
>Lietoe gritted his teeth as he pushes off the table causing the soup to spill off of the bowl due to the force, “LIETOE!” his dad shouted but Lietoe continues to stomp his way to his room where he and his sister sleeps.
>Emeric sighed in annoyance as he rubs his forehead, “My son of mine can be such a drab.”
>Emeric looked at his wife, still holding the exact same position, stuff cheeks full of soup with a noodle poking out of her lips, and a bowl on her hands, “Yep… still the wife I love” he shook his head.
>The tiger took a big GULP on her soup and hear the food streaming down her neck and see her human giving him a displeasurable stare
>”…umm, oh! Um, THANK YOU for… making a great soup honey! My stomach has never been so famished!” She grinned real wide.
>***
>Emeric drags Riyona by pulling his ears hard enough to lower her upper body leaving a trail of ‘ows’ as they pass through the dim lit hallways until they reach to their children’s room.
>Emeric finally let go of the feline’s ears.
>Riyona rubbing his pinched ear, “You really didn’t have to-“ she was cut of by her husband’s strong whispers.
>”TALK. HIM. THROUGH.”
>Emeric paces back to the kitchen
>Riyona took a deep sigh, “Oh boy…”.
>Peeking through the door, she sees the upset child in the bed, ‘you can do this. If you can handle in a fist fight, then you can handle being a parent’ Riyona thought to herself.
>Riyona sits on the edge of Lietoe’s bed. Still don’t know what to say to her son.
>”So… um, having a rough day?”
>Her son didn’t respond.
>”…well, I guess that’s a no.” That didn’t work. Perhaps it’s time to acknowledge the elephant in the room.
>”Listen, Lietoe. I know you wanted to be tough like me and every female you come across,” Riyona took a deep breath, “but you gotta face the facts. Humans are not strong. The Son of Humanity built you to be small, fragile, and tender for the anthros to have that urge of protecting you and others.” Riyona cringes as what she just said to his son. “I’m sorry, I’m really am. Your father was like you, he believed he can do things alone without the need lf females, and where did that lead him…? Big muscular anthros holding a knife at his neck. You wouldn’t exist if I didn’t spotted them threatening your father.”
>still no answer
>”What I’m trying to say is… you’re father don’t want you to go through the same trauma as he did.”
>Silent still prevalent in the air.
>Riyona leans in and kiss her son’s wet cheek
>”Good night, Son. I love you.”

>Your boots crunch in the underbrush as you make your trek off the beaten path.
>The surrounding forest buzzes with the awaking nightlife as the day draws to a close.
>When you reach the far side of a large oblong clearing, you stop abruptly. The cookware strapped to your back keeps clattering for a bit while you get your bearings.
>"Short of breath?" Your companion Ferrah chides from behind you."
>She's a tall, athletic mongoose with tan fur and a patch of white over her left eye. side by side, she's a head taller than you.
>You take a seat on a nearby stone and look back at her.
"I've taken my 6,969th step since our last break, I won't go an inch further." you explain while cracking your back.
>Ferrah scoffs at the remark "and for you that's what, 2?"
"3 and a quarter"
>"right" waves her hand and takes your word for it. She scans the area with her ears flicking this way and that. "well this isn't a bad spot to set up camp. flat ground, steady breeze, and the river's close enough for even you to hear it."
"Close enough for me to toss you in?" You fire back.
>She takes a good listen to judge the distance,"Hmmmm, not that close". she chuckles.
>You reach into your pocket and retrieve your digital map. The silver hexagonal device lights up and displays a green hex grid of a 10 mile radius. The river snakes its way through the grid spaces a few hundred feet to the Northeast.
>You double tap the button on the upper right to zoom out, Its still a day's walk to Woodfield from here but you're making good time. You turn the screen off and shove it back into your coat pocket.
>You look up to see Ferrah arranging the stones for the fire and your Autotent(tm) setting itself up behind her. You roll the stone you were sitting on closer to the pit and finally take off your pack. You open up the insulated section and pull out containers with ingredients. A medley of stew veggies, some floury balls of dough and big fatty cubes of Fresh boar meat from the last stop you made.
"Those poor little piggies are gonna wonder where their mommy went" You tease.
> She ruffles through her supplies and shakes a small red disk of of a box with A flame printed on it. "Her little Borfans aren't my problem, she shouldn't have charged at you."
"That's cold"
>"Stand back" She throws the disk into the center of the pit and it roars into a crackling flame.
>A couple of hours pass and the sky loses the last of it's orange tint as the stars blink into view overhead. The simmering pot fills the cozy camp with a mouthwatering scent. So mouthwatering that Ferrah's been licking her chops for the past 20 minutes.
>Ferrah stands over you with her tail swishing in anticipation while you stir the pot.
"Yes it's ready, bring your bowl"
>You flll her bowl to the brim and watch her chow down. Her hums of satisfaction tell you this is one for the cook books. After ladling your self some you speak up.
"Were about a days walk from Woodfield. If we hurry across the river we can get there by sundown."
>Ferrah swallows and says. "We could get there by noon if you let me carry you."
"Hell no."
>"Oh come on!" she pouts, You shouldn't have to carry all that stuff.
"Tip your sunhat somewhere else. I got legs."
>"Legs that get tired after 3 miles"
"3 and a quarter." You correct before taking a bite.
>Ferrah squints at you and crosses her arms "You should be glad I'm asking. I should just throw you over my shoulder and-"
>You offer another ladle of your stew and she reluctantly obliges. "You should let me take care of you."
"I don't need to be waited on. You should learn to take 'no~' for an answer." you lean over and boop her with your ladle leaving a blotch of food on her snoot. You pull back your booping ladle when Ferrah suddenly grabs the handle.
>She rolls her long tongue over and around it while starring you down. You watch her turn her head as she licks the ladle clean and pulls off with a kiss. You feel an uncomfortable tightness growing in your jeans when you finally let go of it.
"N-now listen."
>"I'm listening"
>You set your feet and rise slowly from your rock while Ferrah follows you with her hungry eyes.
"W-what did we just we talk about?"
>You know that look all too well. You take slow steps backwards while she's still sitting. her tail slowly swishes too and fro.
>"Taking no for an answer, but you haven't said no yet, have you?" She plants her paws and leans forward.
>You can feel your heart thumping in your chest and below the belt.
"How about we just clean up and gooaaaaAAAH"
>You give up trying to talk your way out of it and make a mad dash for the tent. You take about ten steps before getting the wind knocked out of you from behind sending you tumbling into the tent.
>When You get you're bearings you're pinned down face up with the dim light of the tent overhead illuminating the edges of the she beast's fur.
>Ferra leans in and slowly grazes your neck with her fangs. "If no means no, I'll just have to make you scream yes."
>You curse yourself as her warm breath on your neck makes your shiver.
"No fair~" you whimper.

>be me

>and other fun school shenanigans

I want her to molest a little African child. I want to see her tough, dusty hands walk down his ebony legs like spiders, tickling them as they crawl under his loincloth like an animal stalking upon their youngest, easiest prey. She massages his dark little cock, easing out a drop of kiddy pre as well as thumbing at his tensing nuts before taking some huffs of her hand.
The stench of unwashed dirt, sweat, piss and boyflesh tells her a story of all the bodies of water he's never entered, of the drops of pure earthly liquid that's never dripped down his nude black skin in the scorching sun. The shebeast finally spits three or four times in it, spreads it around with her closed fingers, then levels back down to give his black kidcock and jewels some sloppy, dripping and noisy love as her entire palm, already the size of his face or chest, completely engulfs his genitals. The anthro cooed to her little mouse as she felt his limp penis roll around her glistening, soaked paw pads. Well, until they started swelling, that is. Bulging with excitement, confusion, fear as a dollop of sinful, illicit yet utterly precious semen stirs beneath the surface. Taking his now three inch penis in hand, she aligns the sopping top joint of her thumb along his dorsal length and a curled pointer finger elevating its weight from below. Aga's thumb pad, large, brown, soft and drooling with the saliva of a thoroughly corrupt adult, was kissing the leaking urethra of a child no more than five. Wet little kisses between the two parts, forever forbid from meeting, as shining silver tethers of mixed fluid stretched from out across, bridging their impurity. The pad came in for one last, lingering, smooshing, inundatingly pedophilic kiss, as it shifted to massaging his perfect, untouched penis, beautiful brown foreskin still intact and rolling with an audible squelch to the time of her moist ministrations. Tugging his testicles in adoration and lathering his pink little anus with a ball of spit from the other hand, she intended to coax something deep within. Something sacred. Something delicious.
His seed must run freely.
In the eye of the setting sun, two bodies were joined in a most vile light. The small boy shook and moaned as the privacy and purity of his body was robbed by an animal. His penis, so small that no woman could ever imagine bringing it pleasure, throbbed in between Aga's strong digits for ten entire minutes before he began to buck in her hand; a testament to his stamina which she'd always keep in mind. She wanted nothing more than to edge this kid for hours, leaving him perpetually blue balled and on his first time no less, that is of course, if it weren't for her already doing that. There could've been five cute loads already caking her hands, licking her lips at the thought, as the boy cried out in pain, his little balls were so terribly swollen and heavy, and they swung with enough force to flatten the fur on her fingers. It was time. Furred fingers gripped the base, waving his aching black boy cock around as she giggled and licked his smooth, warm neck all over.
The tip was shining and runny as thumb spread across it once more while other hands were busy massaging the sensitivity of his dangling fruits. His whimpers, moans and groans gave way to one sheer scream as the child was briskly held down around the waist and his penis savagely milked with wet slaps of paw on spit soaked and musky underage member filling the sex stained air.
One little jerk, unpredictable in it's strength, gave her arm a rise as both hands rose to extract his sin. In her left paw, a fierce jet, two, three, four harpooned the center of her paw, sending semen rolling up one finger before stopping suddenly in the trap of her fur. "Oh, oh my baby." she said out loud, elated and sounding on the virge of tears as though she were catching liquid gold in her greedy paws. She continued with her "oh"s ranging from tearful to masturbatory and breathless. To have fresh, hot, perfect underage seed in her very hands, it was like a dream. The child was long spent and breathing laboured as she ceased her attention to his crotch, dragged an open palm all the way up his bare body, and resting it atop his head.
She couldn't stop smelling it. Adoring it. Worshipping it. It had been far too long since she last made a child shake like this, and release his milk for her, yet every time was as special as the first. Aga lapped only once at the pearly little pool of African fertility in her hand, such proximity to her nose making her whine inaudibly, then tipped it's contents like a chalice to the rim of her open mouth. She had never drank from a black child before, but relished in her consideration as she allowed the hot seed to crawl itself slowly down her throat. She sat and basked in the sensation, very present and without equal in pleasures. She closed her eyes and rolled her head a bit, lost in what she had done as she reacquired the boy, who was now napping in her lap. Sliding his loincloth back around to it's "proper" position, though she was disgusted to believe that, he was brought up in her arms and left by the same tree where she found him, a couple meters away.
In the shade, the kid appeared to do the opposite. She smiled to herself, feeling him safe, as she sprinted away through the grass. She loved how they struggled, but this one didn't seem to mind at all.
And she loved him most for that reason alone.

Fairly. Imagine regular bullying/hazing but more like just giving them shit rather than actual malice. Though do keep in mind that hyenas act more passive around those that they have interest in. It doesn't make sense from the position of hyena psychology for a girl who's really into a guy to fuck with him nonstop and be super harsh about it. Of course that's not some concrete guideline that must be followed. You could certainly have her still be a dick to him because of certain character quirks or really any number of things.
Anything in particular about the setting/character(s) you could give us?

Guys, I had the best dream, so I am going to copy past what I written down, and then expand in a full story version.
-A large city full of Anthro animals and a small population of humans. The city mainly starts at the top of a large hill, and branches downward (think San Francisco, or City Escape). The Human Protagonist
was looking for this doberman woman he was with, and while driving around with another human friend who involved with renting loaning trucks and mechanic work, looking for her. They catch a glimpse of her, and
miss her, so they start from the top, and head back down. They find her in a different branch at the bottom, running towards an abandoned building in the bad part of the city. The protagonist
jumps out the car and starts running towards her and the building. A white wolf (Female) also joins the protagonist in running towards the building. Inside they find large, buff, and agressive animal
women (who formed some sort of a sisterhood) who call them selves "The Predators." They capture and experiment on people they don't like. The Protagonist then reveals that he is a shapeshifter animal to the point where he can change his own appearance and gender with relative ease.
Dream End.

Sha invites children over to her house for sweets all the time, and they always leave so happy and a little shy. Most assume she's simply rubbing off on them, but no one could guess what goes on behind closed doors. Where she preps for their daily arrival by dolling herself up, taking a benzo to calm her nerves and dropping everything she's wearing for a single, thin sundress. After a single knock at the door, her excitement is already spilling over and her nipples become diamonds. The smell of her quivering womanhood begins to cloud the house. Answering it to two small boys, no less than seven, and she finds herself kneeling over in greeting, giving the boys a rush of confusion and curiosity as her fat, dripping sheep mammaries swing down, already staining her dress with their clearly-defined outline of ferocious sexual appetite.
Sha sure loves children.

imagine a sheep girl who's amazon level jacked, but you have no idea since big wool fluff covering

Also makes me think of species that are just naturally strong.
>nerdy/dorky anthro girl who doesn't work out or such
>but she's a tiger or grizzly or similar strong/big species
>so she can still flip a car bare handed by her self
Which can add to the dom aspect since you're getting manhandled and wreaked by a loser

What would that even count as? Accidental domming?
>Tiger/Grizzly/Draft doesn't realize how strong she is
>Laughs at your joke and slaps your knee
>It actually really hurts
Or maybe something like
>Pulls you in for a big hug
>Doesn't realize she's nearly breaking your spine
>Later the two of you are watching some corny horror movie
>Except she totally believes in the supernatural and it freaks her out, so she squeezes you so hard you can barely breathe
>Never even notices the force she's exerting on you
I'd buy that for a dollar.

>Two tall anthro girls fight over being able to date the cute humie who didn't agree to anything.

>Watching the big game with your big anthro gf, swigging some big brewskis
>Your team gets called offside after scoring a goal, nullifying the goal
>Your big gf yells "Oh come the fuck on!" and accidentally crushes the can in her hand, sending beer everywhere
>She sighs, wipes herself, the table, then you down (sheepishly)
>Apologizes for the outburst and precipitation she caused
>Proceeds to pull another beer out from the cooler beside her
>Doesn't even open it before she crushes it again because your team gets a penalty

>Be me
>Getting bullied by an anthro hyena and a cheetah girl
>Our teacher, an anthro tiger woman comes up and says “ladies stop it”
>I think im getting saved from the pummeling and forced tickles
>She says “this is how you bully a human!” She then picks me up and flips me upside down and is grabbing onto my ankles flinging me around and laughing hysterically
>No wonder her husband is so docile and scared every time he comes to her work.

Speaking of music, I bet mosh pits with anthros involved is just asking for trouble if a human boy goes. More so if you go to an anthro popular/majority crowd/venue.
>crowd surfing and being groped by everyone and/or just being grabbed by an anthro for dibs
>having one or more anthros bump and grind and hump you in the mosh pit
>may even get lucky and the anthro band grabbing you from the crowd

Which species of anthro would be the teacher most likely to rape a human student?

Most that are single probably.
>teach human boys that are in puberty age
>they reek of pheromones saying they're ready and available to mate
>also since they fap a lot and humans are pretty much nose blind a lot don't shower after fapping so that scent also clings to them
>many are single which just screams scent wise they're free for taking
>teachers are older and bigger anthros so even if they don't mean too they end up establishing themselves as the alphas/matriarchs/etc
>the boys defer/submit to your words and instructions already so they're half yours
>they probably have your scent on them already so they're marked as yours sort of
>etc
Now imagine the fucking iron will anthro gym teachers need to not claim every human boy she teaches.

>get sweaty during PE
>don't have a towel so use your shirt to wipe some of the sweat from your brow
>unknowingly flash the wolf gym teacher your soft, smooth tummy, an act that practically screams "I am submissive and breedable. Please hold me down and drain every ounce of seed from my young, virile balls!"

I can see certain parts of humans being very provocative to anthros
>naked necks and shoulders probably get pred species going
>human hands for how good they are at petting
>human tongue since they're unusually soft compared to most other species
>and human stomachs since many animals show submissiveness by showing their stomachs and since humans have no fur the effect is like doubled in how vulnerable an area they're showing

All I can think is the Lonely deabeat P.E teacher wolf woman getting to attached to the weird kid that sits alone.

>The clan mother’s expression was blank and unmoving
>A single hand gesture and the two guards left the room, leaving the two alone
>You felt less safe
>”Pitiful human. I sent my youngest daughter out on guard duty, and you deflowered her”
>She began to stand up

>She took a step forward

>Before you could recover she pinned you in place with a foot to the chest
>She reached down and with fluid motion ripped your shorts and boxers clean off
>Flinging the tatters to the corner she eyed the thing that had allegedly plowed her daughter into submission
>”Hmm, serviceable” she mused
>Readjusting her pose where she was crouched down in front of you she grabbed you by the balls quite literally and started to massage them
>Before long your body was acting against you and springing to attention

>She hiked one of your legs up
>Then the other
>All you could see looking up was an entrance beneath a mountain of gnoll muscle
>”Let there be no subtlety here, human-”
>she leaned down closer
>”You won’t leave this tent before sundown”
>And at that, she dropped down like a meaty hammer directly atop your shaft
>She hadn’t taken the time to line up perfectly so for a split second your rod bent a little before course correcting itself into her hungry maw of a snatch
>All the air was knocked out of your lungs by the sudden impact
>The gnoll matriarch however merely hummed to herself in amusement and pleasure as she started to raise up again

>Not a bad deal
>There was occasionally a call from some “nightly activities” but with her extra size it was nowhere near as rough as she was pre-pregnancy

Imagine the culture shock a matriarchal anthro society would have when it encounters humans. We have a species who are hyper protective of their few males meeting a species where the males are so reckless it's like they're trying to kill themselves.

They'd dismantle earths armies

They could try...It would not be easy for them, not unless they had no qualms dismantling vast amounts of infrastructure as well. Which would only stir up additional resentment among the civilian populace, increasing recruitment rates, and therefore resistance.
No, subversion and slowly integrating themselves will work better in the long run.
But I wouldn't mind dating a lady from outer space in the first place...

It'd actually be very easy to do
>just show the army alien sports drinks and they'll come running to join them
>alien crayons for the marines and a bonus if they have colors only they can see
>air force would jump immediately at the prospect of flying real scifi space ships
>navy would be the hard sell with all the gays though

>"Seriously?"
>"You can't even hit our largest target a few meters away?"
>"Why the fuck did Miyu scout you? Eye candy?"
>"Go clean the guns, you furless fuck."

>10 minutes later, she was called into Fox's office.
>30 minutes later, she was squealing and moaning as Fox rentlessly fisted her pussy and anus as punishment for her verbal abuse of Anon
>40 minutes later, Anon was balls-deep in her, mercylessly forcing her nethers to reshape itself to remember the cock of his cock and perfectly service it.
>60 minutes after her verbal lapse, she was thoroughly and utterly bred, her ovum under a mercyless assault of Anon's soerm-cells. Her feritilization was irreversible.
> After confirming her impregnation, Fox cleaned Anon's cock and crotch up with her tongue. Then she bend over her table and begged him to impregnate her too as reparation for the emotional damages Krystal caused him.
>Anon eagerly complied to her delight.

>Anthros from another dimension have taken over
>Been the dominanting species for almost 7 years now
>Tons of posters that have psas for non domesticated humans
>One poster details a non domesticated human
>Signs of a non domesticated human usually entail them being sleepy, angry, working a retail or fast food job or going to school instead of raising children, no ring, no ownership tag from anthro wife, no smell mark and seen driving alone late at night.
>Remember citizens, report a non domesticated human to your anthro police force! You may never know who it might be!

>empty threat to crush your skull with a bat
>she's got a legit crush on you she's had since third grade to college
>anything-but-empty promise to crush your skull with her thighs

my space adventure idea was that humanity sent out colony ships centuries ago to find new worlds
but anthros found them and used them to start there own outposts creating a branch of humanity thats bred specifically for anthros
most anthros would think humies are gifts from the gods...imagine finding a species with no fixed breeding cycle and dexterous digits covered in smooth sensitive skin?
the elite would know the truth though. that untamed humans are out there and offer so much more to help conquer the stars than large families.
dunno if it worth going balls deep into it. just an idea i had reading some of these threads.

>But who would be bold or foolish enough to face a troll?
>The volunteer guard was out of the question.
>Find a passing adventurer? Too much of a gamble.
>That left mercenaries.
>A risky venture as most mercenaries were both expensive and unpredictable.
>You didn't see much choice, however.
>Mere rumors of a single troll wouldn't get much official attention.
>You had neither the patience nor the luxury of time.
>The only thing left at that point was considering who to hire.
>Again, your thoughts turned to minotaurs.
>A... herd? A group of them camped near the town.
>Nowhere near as large as a troll, minotaurs were still the largest and strongest of the races.
>Their physical prowess was legendary, rivalled only by their reputation for savagery.
>And you knew for a fact this group were warriors.
>They were your best available choice for security.
>First, you were going to have to approach them.
>This was tricky.
>You couldn't just bumble into their camp and demand an audience.
>The sheer lack of manners required would have been bad enough.
>No, you were going to have to meet them in town.
>Which would be difficult as they spent the majority of their time elsewhere.
>The rare times they made themselves known, they could be found at the tavern.
>You'd seen them there, drinking heavy ales from great tankards, laughing and talking.
>Their booming voices and thick accents drowning out all other noises.
>Combined with their sheer physical presence, it made for a daunting sight.
>Needs must, however.
>It took a few weeks until the opportunity struck for you to meet with them.
>In the time between, you'd been frequenting the tavern daily.
>A sudden change to your normal schedule, but not anything to harm business.
>But finally, they came, trudging in from the road like heavily armed cattle.
>It should be noted that the tavern - "The Giant's Tent - was an open-air establishment.
>It was a tall, wooden building in a roughly triangular shape.
>Two high, angled walls and a back wall where the bar sat.
>The front stood open to the street, a sign hung from chain proudly proclaiming its name.
>The Tent was made to welcome races of every shape and size.
>Convenient for your needs.
>You were sat at the bar, nursing a beer, considering your options.
>The minotaurs patronizing The Tent that evening were three in number.
>Towering over most other patrons, they seated themselves around one of the larger tables.
>In lieu of chairs, they sat on hefty bags stuffed full of beans.
>Within moments, they were feasting and drinking, their raucous voices filling the air.
>From your vantage point, you tried to discern a leader amongst them.
>Their bodies were lean and meaty, nary a scrap of fat to be seen.
>When their broad, pointed horns caught the light, they glinted dangerously.
>They were dressed simply and comfortably, but you saw that they had weapons with them.
>Two of them were a rich, earthy brown in color, one carrying a broad-headed axe and the other a tall bow.
>The third was dark as coal with a flowing mane of hair like liquid night.
>Resting at her side, sheathed in leather, was the tallest sword you had ever seen.
>They appeared to be a frightful bunch, but they sounded gregarious enough.
>They were speaking loudly but happily, laughing amongst themselves about this or that.
>Taking a final pull from of your beer, you decided that the best approach would be to play it by ear.
>Rising from your stool at the bar, you approached the horned warriors.
>They didn't notice your approach.
>How could they? You were a fraction of their height.
>Amid their carousing, you attempted to gain their attention.
>Clearing your throat didn't work, and "Excuse me" wasn't heard.
>You were hesitant to raise your voice to your prospective protectors.
>Finally, you resorted to standing on your toes and waving.
>Just when it felt like you were burn from shame, the sword wielder noticed you.
>Mug to her lips, she caught you out of the corner of her eye, staring at your little spectacle.
>Her comrades took quick notice of her distraction, and you quickly had their attention as well.
>Up close, you got a better look at them.
>They were doubtlessly female, unless you knew less about minotaurs than you thought.
>Amidst the rippling muscle and thick hide were the distinct flare of feminine hips.
>That, and though it may be crass to mention, there was no denying their endowments.
>A single one was easily larger than your head.
>Keeping your head low - out of respect - you cleared your throat and introduced yourself.
>You told them your name and your station - a merchant farmer in good standing with the town and its people.
>When you asked them their names - begging their pardon beforehand - the black bull answered.
>Lowering her mug to the table, she said, "I am Raasna."
>She gestured to her colleagues. "These are Sinanu and Reofen."
>The brown pair - Sinanu and Reofen - dipped their heads to you in greeting.
>You wondered if they were siblings.
>Raasna spoke again. "What is your business, man?"
>Her voice was deep and warm, like a brass orchestra in concert.
>They listened as you explained yourself, bovine ears cocking this way and that.
>You told them that you'd heard rumor that a troll had come down from the mountains.
>They shared a brief look at that.
>You told them that you were a simple man of modest means, but what you had needed protection.
>You knew the prowess of minotaurs was legendary.
>You knew that their troop were neighbors with the community.
>You knew they often traded with the merchants of the town.
>"And have we traded with you before?" Raasna asked, head tilted at you.
>It's an oddly charming gesture for a giant, sword-wielding bull woman.
>"I wouldn't know." Said Sinanu, scratching at her chin.
>"Sinapen always handles trades." Added Reofen, leaning on her bow.
>"Mm." Raasna grunts, straightening. Leaning forward, she looks you in the eye. "Have we?"
>You feel more than a little intimidated by her looming presence.

Be you, Anon
Right now your with your fennec GF, chilling and watching tv at her (parents) mansion
while scrolling through the channels, you come across the news, reporting some sensationalized garbage about Human and Anthro relations or some other pretentious bullshit.
you have a confession to make, you love your girl but she’s a little—
>“Fucking humies, always something new to complain about. bunch of good for nothing, lazy, robbing lotharios.
You look at here and raise an eyebrow
>”oh not you Anon, you’re one of the good ones.” She says cuddling closer to you.
>”you’re actually polite, modest, well read, and erudite. Not like the others, god I can’t imagine how hard it must be for you.”
You ask her what she means
>”*pfff* you’re joking right? Human culture is so…adverse to people of a well mannered society. What with all of the violence and crassness, not to mention how utterly lewd your kind seem to be.”
You open your mouth to respond but she cuts you off
>”don’t even try to contest this, Remember how we met, What you were walking around wearing? How you smelled? And how you showed off your soft and vulnerable underbelly to me?”
You recall wearing shorts, it was hot so you lifted used your shirt to wipe the sweat of your face
>”but even then I saw you for what you were, a delicate rose that had grown between the cracks in a sidewalk. Now hush, and cuddle with me.”

I had this idea of a german shepherd anthro girl who's stupidly tall and ripped from being a super soldier.
She spent her war career doing things like slaughtering a tank column with her bare hands and stumbling back to base soaked in blood and wearing nothing but half a boot.
After being discharged, she got an office job where she plays with her coworkers by doing shit like pinning you between a wall and her tits or abs, cornering you in a room and sitting on your face so you have to breathe in her juices as she interrogates you about work, or just pinning you to the floor and making out with you because she genuinely likes you.
She quickly took up the mantle of "big sis" by jumping out a fifth-story window to punch and stomp gang-bangers into a ketchup factory. She also hugged a suicide bomber so the explosion was mostly suppressed, and she went back to her cube, naked and covered in soot, and anyone who stared too long got leglocked up to her puss to keep her motivated while reading spreadsheets.
She wears a blouse she can't button up because her tits are too big, so their constant escape act from her bra is always on full display and she wears her badge next to her cleavage so you have to stare and she can tease you for it.
Her jeans are similarly tight and can't get lower than her calves, so she wears leather sandals like a Roman soldier and watching her toes is a good tell of what she's thinking.
There's a moment where (You) forget who you're talking to and tell her off. It stuns everyone, including her, and starts an infatuation that buds into a genuine relationship.

>Get pulled into Broad Bodied Badger Bitches bunker for pelvis-harming heat fucking
>Used like a toy and loving it

>World fucking ends

>Watch as months go by in the bunker as you watch her belly-bump grow

How would single fathers fare in an ADHG world.
I’m talking all kinds, from dudes who let a bunch of anthros run trains (tunnels?) on them and got stuck with the pups to dudes who lost their waifur due to accident, or war, or some other shit

>someone new moves into the neighborhood
>they're human
>a single father and his son
>anthro girls and women get dirty thoughts of double the fun of going to town on both of them like a hentai protagonists who has hair covering half of their face

>Cowfu makes an odd request.
>She wants you to abuse her udder.
>You're skeptical, but she seems to know her stuff.
>You swat the pink sack lightly.
>She huffs and tells you to do it harder.
>So you give it a good spank.
>Enough to make a meaty clap.
>She grunts and winces, but she looks happy.
>She tells you to do it again.
>Shrugging, you give her another little smack.
>She grunts again, but the wince is gone.
>She licks her lips and tells you to do it again, but even harder.
>You're a bit worried, but you don't want to displease her.
>You cock your arm back and give her largest milk tank a hard slap.
>She screams and invective and doubles over.
>Nearly panicked, you rush to see if she's hurt.
>With hooved fingers on your shoulder, she steadies herself.
>It takes a few seconds for her to steady her breath.
>When she looks you in the eyes, her expression is confusing.
>There's pain, yes, but also intense arousal.
>You ask her if she's okay.
>She answers by shoving her tongue down your throat.
>For days after that, her milk was extra sweet, thick, and creamy.

What if you're a human kid, and your dad remarries with an anthro?

>The reactions of anthro women in regards to human children are significantly different to their reactions to human adults.
>Human boys are relentlessly showered in praise and affection, hugged, kissed, patted, and squeezed, raised to be strong, manly, and kind.
>Human girls receive no less affection, but are also taught anthro secrets of femininity, giving them an edge over other women later in life.
>As protective as an anthro woman can be of her human lover, she can be absolutely savage in her protection of her human children.

>Get into an argument with a human.
>It's not a cute argument, either.
>Things get heated.
>It's doubly tough for you because the smell of his body heating up is getting to you.
>You can smell his frustration, agitation, and lowkey anger.
>It's the male scent mixed with that delectable human scent messing with your head.
>Despite the raised voices, you're getting soaked.
>If it weren't for the bad timing, you'd take him right then and there.
>You finally leave in a huff, and he doesn't pursue you.
>A part of you really wanted him to.
>Find a secluded bathroom stall and shlick furiously.

>Do you want me gone?
>I know I scare you sometimes.
>I don't mean to.
>I have no power over how this works.
>I'm just here for you.
>But if I'm a bother or a burden, I'll go.
>It's still early enough.
>You just need to delete the app.
>That's it.
>I'll go and you can have your life back.
>I'm sorry.
>I love you.
>But he couldn't bring himself to do it.
>He couldn't reinstall his loneliness.
>Removing the app from the homescreen, he kept things out of sight.
>Out of mind.
>But there in depths beyond, she'd always be.
>Installed, but removed.
>A beating heart, left voluntarily out of reach, with the persistent guess
>"What if?"
>She remained there, in that lonely place.
>Locked between what was and what could be.
>Waiting and pining, silent and unseen.
>The arcane code that made up herself immovable.
>Even as she was, her sorrow was not complete.
>He was still there, although untouchable.
>He was living.
>He'd known her, albeit briefly.
>Did he ever spare a thought for her?
>Was he ever tempted?
>To unseal her?
>To see her again?
>She held onto hope.
>Until that day, if it ever came, she would wait.
>Content in the knowledge that she was his.
>Even if he did not want her.

>All anthros are actually part of an ancient galactic horror, that has devoured countless species and civilizations.
>The reason no aliens other than them have contacted us is because there are none, it’s just us…and them.
>This consciousness is ancient, lovecraftian, primordial even. It has long since forgot it’s name or any name anyone used to call it. The oldest (intact) records it finds are “It That Consumes.”.
>It That Consumes seeks only to fulfill its primeval goal: to Consume all that is not itself.
>It comes across mankind during the beginning of the Industrial revolution, this fills it with what could only be called glee, how could they possibly fight back against it.
>Just as it’s vanguard are about to begin preliminary strikes against mankind, it realizes something.
>These…humans…they are quite endearing.
>In fact, they are very, VERY pleasing to the eye.
>And not just that, every last thing about them is enchanting.
>The way those bags, tracts, and ducts within them move and pump and churn.
>There sound and smell and feel.
>And their human way of doing things is so endearing.
>For nearly a century, it debates with itself on what it should do.
>Then, after many years, inspiration struck.
>It decides that it shall endeavor to keep these most pleasing of morsels. After all, who is there to contest this, and as long as they never learn what it really is, they’ll be happy.
>But it cannot come as itself, they will reject it.
>And it cannot come as one being, how could it expect to be shared by the great multitude of its newfound companions.
>For many years, it ponders this query.
>But then the answer becomes clear.
>The good news is by the time this happens, a few centuries have passed and now mankind is slowly creeping its way across its solar system.
>The concept of a alien civilization is now not so foreign to them, which will make this easier.
>It can’t help by be endeared to them, they way the obsesses over rocks from other worlds is adorable.
>It That Consumes decides now is the perfect time for it’s grandest endeavor.
>It breaks its hatful flesh into pieces so that it may form them into individual bodies, new forms that will surely appeal to its most darling and beautiful humanity.
>It places within each one a fragment of its mind. Each fragment different than all those before it, so that it may love its new counterparts in any and all ways possible.
>When it has finished, it places the remainders of itself in a vault, so that it’s old form may return if it is ever necessitated.
>It’s fragments are Separate, yet every single one is aware of its origin.
>The Great Multitude begin to make their way to their future companions. They have grown tired of waiting, and are desperate to learn how wonderful “Pats of the Head” and “Scritches of the Ears” feel when done by human hands.”
>Cue a few days later on earth, Anon is wondering why a sexy ass wolf anthro is making him rub her belly.

>anthros invade earth
>they think this will be easy because they have a vast technological advantage, bullet proof power-armour and energy weapons etc.
>however when they first encounter the military they are horrified to find that it’s mostly men
>men who should be at home, doing laundry, preparing meals and tending to the children, not being sent to war
>They think that the (human) women in charge are insane and trying to use the men as meat shields or something.
>Anthro higher ups get word of this and tell their troops to use non-lethal weapons in fear of hurting the men.

>instead of losing it you had it returned to you by a buff shark lady who had taken a photo of herself with your phone
>for whatever reason you felt like you had to thank her for returning it
>you decided to buy some scuba gear which was surprisingly easy to find and buy if you knew where to look
>you thought maybe you could thank her with a crate of fish because she’s a shark
>looking around town you found and bought the largest crate of fish you could find
>now back out at sea you drove the boat back to around the area you had yesterday
>you put on your scuba gear and checked your gas cylinder, you had been told you had enough air for about 2 hours
>not wanting to push it you set a timer on your watch for 1 hour and 45 minutes
>you lowered the crate into the water in a rope, leaving it there so you could get it in a minute
>you prepare the boat, setting its anchor, then you prepare yourself and fall backwards into the water
>you grab the crate and release it from the boat, using its weight to sink.
>the area you are in isn’t that deep, only around 70 feet
>Still holding the crate you begin to look around, seeing only schools of fish and a few crabs
>after about 10 minutes of looking you begin to think maybe this was a stupid idea
>even if she was still around would she even recognise who you were, had she even seen your face when she threw your phone back?
>you were facing away from the water so probably not
>even if she had you were wearing scuba gear that covered most of your face
>when you were just about to call it quits you felt a tap on your shoulder
>Turning around you see her,
>you knew she was big from the photo but in person she seemed even bigger, 7.5 foot atleast
>you present the crate to her
>how does she react to your “gift”?
>she looked between you and the crate.
>you tried to mine a phone with your hand and pointing to the boat, trying to see if she understood what you meant.
>she looked between you and the boat before seeming to understand
>she then took the crate from your hands and ripped the wooden top off
>she started practically shovelling the fish into her jaw, giving you a clear view of her razor sharp teeth
>she finished the crate in under a minute. >there was one fish left, stuck at the bottom, she picked it out and offered it to you
>you politely declined
>she crushed the wooden crate, throwing what was left of it behind her, it being carried off by currents
>she then looked at you, seemingly examining you, she leant down and patted your head
>was that a thank you? You thought
>she then motioned for you to follow her as she turned around and swam away
>you started trying to follow her but as she was much much faster than you (since she is literally a shark) you fell behind
>she looked back and saw you struggling to keep up so she waited for you to catch up
>she then grabbed the back of your scuba suit and swam at her speed, practically carrying you
>when she stopped and let go of you you looked around and saw you were infront of a sunken boat
>the shark pointed towards it, giving you a slight push with her arm
>you swam towards the boat, it seemed to be a sailing yacht, if the collapsed sail poles were any kind of indication
>you saw an open door and poked your head inside, surprisingly the interior was well maintained for being underwater
>was this where she lived?
>just as you were thinking this you felt and had on your shoulder
>the shark span you around and you looked up at her
>She had both her arms on the doorway above you, blocking you from leaving
>you discover fear boners are a real thing
>her eyes looked lower and a wide grin appeared on her face
>The shark took her arms off the doorframe and grabbed you by the front, carrying you inside
>she took you into a room that you found to be a bedroom as she deposited you on the edge of a bed
>she then squatted in front of you and pressed her snout into your bulge
>she smirked and you felt a pang of fear as she exposed her razor sharp teeth
>she slowly opened her mouth and gripped your suit with her teeth before suddenly and violently pulling back
>she tore the groin off your suit, exposing your erect member to her as she spat out the cloth in her mouth
>she stood back up and straddled you by the waist, lining your dick up with her slit before shoving you inside her
>the feeling was euphoric as she ponder her hips against yours
>you wrapped hands around her back and ran them up and down her muscles
>however her skin felt weird, as when you felt down her back your gloves ran over smooth skin, but when you went up towards her head it felt like your hands were grinding against sandpaper
>you momentarily looked at the palms of your gloves and saw that there had intact gotten scuffed up
>you were the full you were wearing gloves and resumed feeling her
>the sharks face had a stern look on it but you could see it starting to break as she began to blush
>apparently she saw you staring at her blushing face and decided to show you she was still in charge here
>she put your legs around her waist and picked you up again, still keeping your cock inside her
>she then slammed your back into a wall, hilting her pussy against the bottom of your dick
>or rather she slammed the back of your air cylinder into the wall as all of a sudden there was a loud hissing noise and you saw air bubbles rushing past your head above you
>it took you a second for you to realise your air supply was compromised and start panicking
>you started pounded on her, trying to get her to let you go, she looked at you and her face first contorted into an expression of confusion and then panic as she realised you were about to begin drowning
>instead of letting you go she gripped the mouth piece of your breathing apparatus and pulled it out
>you thought that she was trying to drown you for sure until she bent down and kissed sealed her lips on your, engaging in a very tight kiss
>you had no idea what she was doing until you felt your cheeks blow up,
>she was trying to give you air by blowing into your mouth
>you exhaled through your nose and gulped in air through you mouth,
>it tasted and smelt pretty bad but you were still conscious so it must have been working
>since you had exhaled through your nose you had made water flood your goggles and you could no longer see
>you could however still feel you and her moving somewhere
>still kissing/breathing with her you suddenly felt the both of you surface above the water
>breaking the kiss you opened you eyes and saw you were next to your boat
>She let go of you and you swam to the side of your boat, grabbing hold
>you climb back on board and take off the ruined scuba gear, you see that the hose leading to your mouth had been ruptured
>then you feel the boat list heavily to one side
>you turn and see the Shark climbing aboard, guessing she could breath on land aswell
>she looks around before looking at you expectantly
>she must want you to get another air cylinder then so you can go back under the water
>you turn around and start the boat, putting your hand on the throttle and pushing it all the way up
>you had barely started moving before her massive hand eclipsed yours, still on the throttle.
>she pulled your hand and the throttle back down before turning the boats engine off
>she pulls your hand back and you turn to face her, a predatory expression on her face
>she looks down and you do too, seeing her looking at your cock
>with her free hand she rubs her pussy gently
>oh, she must want to finish then
>The shark rubbed her slit for a second, then brought her fingers up in front of you at eye level
>her fingers were lightly coated in her pussy juice and she slowly pushed them past your lips onto your mouth.
>with her other hand she gently fondled your balls, careful to not scratch them with her skin
>almost immediately you were hard again, already having a semi
>she grabbed your ass with her right hand before using her left to wrap your legs around her waist
>then she put both hands on your hurt and pulled you deep inside her
>now you were out of the water you heard her groan as she did it, her tough look had almost disappeared at this point and she looked almost cute
>she bend her neck down and kissed you, now that you didn’t have an air hose in your mouth
>you started to groan aswell, her pussy was clamping down hard on your dick hungrily and it was bringing you close to the edge


>Be you, Anon, waiter at a small diner in 1940s LA.
>Your routine is simple. Take orders, look pretty, etc, or rather it was simple, until the day she walked in.
>You don’t think you’ll ever forget that day.
>She was beautiful, mature, had a fiery look in her eyes, smelled like cigarettes and walked like she was carrying the weight of the cities crime on her back.
>she said she was some kind private eye or detective you can’t really recall.
>You chatted each other up, pretty good conversation. You Remember at some point she asked you for perspective about some case she was investigating, luckily for her you knew who she was looking for and told her where to find them.
>She leaves, and you think that’s the end of that. (Keyword in that sentence is “Think”)
>She comes back a couple days later, and thanks you for your help.
>Your not sure if it’s a good idea to get roped into her schemes, but the way you see it you’re just handing advice to a really good tipper.
>As time goes on you and her develop a pretty good relationship with her, she comes in, orders food, y’all chat a little, and then she leaves with you always telling her to be safe.
>It’s nice to have her around.
>YWN be targeted due to your association with her.
>YWN be kidnapped by her enemies in order to gain leverage over her.
>YWN be saved by her in some Dick Tracy gunfight type shit.
>YWN be taken away from all of this by her.
>YWN settle down with your private eye waifur and have a family.
>YWN hear “Daddy, how did you meet mommy?” From your kids.

>*Puts out a cigarette* "I was expecting you Anon, you know from the moment i saw you outside my office window, i knew you was trouble.”
>”Uhh, is this a bad time?”
>”They say every dog has her day, but I ain't counting on seeing mine anytime soon. I work nights."
>”Wait sweetie I thought you retired.”
>”I remember the day you came through my office like a hurricane, eyes ablaze and a gun in your hand. I said, 'Put that thing away, you're going to hurt my feelings'.You said, 'Your feelings are the last thing you need to worry about, Doc'. That was the moment I fell in love.”
>”What are you talking about? I’ve never done anything like that!”
>”Look I miss my old job, just let me have this baby.”
You sigh and acquiesce to her request, taking you seat in the chair in front of her desk
>” 'And how have you been lover?' You asked me softly. Smooth and cold, you were like whiskey on the rocks. I heard the hammer being pulled back. I sighed. Never trust a Humie with a rod.”
>“ 'Is this the part where you kill me?' I ask, and took a sip. The liquor tasted metallic, like blood.
Your lips found my cheek, And you planted a kiss.”
>“ 'No. I need you to come with me. I messed up.' You pushed the gun into my chest, cold steel nearly giving me a chill.”
>” 'Well. You've come to the right place.' I felt a sick smile creeping up my mug. 'Trouble is our business.'”
You love your wife but you have no idea where or why she’s getting all these ideas from, you’ve never done any of that stuff. You just wish she wouldn’t write you like that in her books or tell people these stories, everyone now believes you were some kind of homme fatale.

>Be you, Tribal/Primitive/Wild Anon.
>You and some of your tribesmen have been hiding from the groups of furred ones for a few months now.
>Supplies are low so you decided to forge for food and you stumble across a pile of apples, oh joy of joys, you’ll be able to eat again.
>When you take your first bite you realize the apple tastes quite strange and soon you realized you can’t even stand up, you slump over a tree, the last thing you see being a pair of paws reaching for you.
>You awake, only to find yourself trapped in a metal cage, on one of the metal beasts the furred ones ride.
>Eventually the beast comes to a halt, and you are taken out of the cage and are placed in a stone house with a few others who were caught.
>As terrified as you might be right now, you cannot deny, their magic is quite amazing.
>Their great beasts spew burnt air and are loud and frightening, their eyes shine bright and cut through any darkness, and they can run on any land but seem to prefer the black stone rivers.
>Yet for how fearsome they may be, when a furred one stops riding them they become silent.
>Their stone huts are dotted with a clear material, it looks like water but frozen. And the entrances move and part open on their own, opening before the furred ones even have a chance to touch them, as if to make way for them.
>You are frightened, what great horror must they be to have their own creations fear them in such ways. What kind of people are they to have their mounts and homes fear them so.
>A few days pass, when you are awoken by several furred ones dragging you out of your cell.
>You have fear and death in your heart, your mother always warned you of the furred ones, saying that they will eat you if they get you.
>You struggle and plead, but a part of you knows you are done for. Eventually you give in, and accept your fate.
>You are brought to a furred one, she is wearing a strange red and gold garment, it is beautiful and shines in the light.
>She picks you up and takes you to her metal beast, it is different than the one that brought you here, the inside is much smaller but more comfortable.
>You see another furred one sitting in the spot with the strange wheel, to your horror, he takes a small knife and put it into the metal beast.
>The sight of this nearly caused you to faint, why would they do this to their creations?
>The furred one senses your apprehension, and puts your head in her lap. You are unsure why she would do this, but it feels nice.
>She is very beautiful, and her voice is soft, reminds you of your mother.
>You fall asleep, and when you awake you are brought into another stone hut, it is much larger than the last.
>You are clothed and are presented to the other furred ones there, whom you believe are her servants judging by the way they bow.
>you are taken to your bed, and collapse onto it, no man would have any will left in their body after this.
>Many months pass, and you slowly settle into your new home.
>Every night she takes you to her bed and lays with you, cuddling you afterwards.
>At first you were frightened but as time went on your fear faded.
>You do not know who she is, what she is saying, nor what any of this is or what anything in this place means.
>But the way she holds you, how she embraces you, how she gives herself to you and how you give yourself to her, Even though you are separated by language, you can understand her and she can understand you.
>She loves you, and you love her.
>You are happy.

>Be unlucky in love
>You're pretty sure you're cursed
>When you were in high school you went to a buddhist alter on a trip to Japan and prayed that you could get a girl
>You went out with a girl and had sex at her house on the first day
>At first you thought you were lucky
>But you soon woke up naked in a dumpster, and outside you found a laughing fox
>No, not a fox, a kitsune
>"I can't believe you actually fell for the 'sex on the first date' trick!"
>It had been an illusion
>After you realized you had been tricked you were about to chase her, but running around town naked wouldn't be a pretty picture
>After that, shit like that kept happening
>Another girl asks you out and it lasts longer, but you wake up to find that damn fox again
>Then again
>The next girl who asked you out, you ended up yelling at telling the kitsune to leave you alone
>She left in tears, and you heard cackling from behind you
>"Can't believe you let her go! You really are something, aren't you?"
>By college you decided to ask a girl out for once, because you are pretty paranoid that anyone who asks you is that kitsune
>She said yes
>The data was a disaster though
>The restaraunt was slow, something kept kicking her from under the table that you swore wasn't you, and you spilled her drink on her when you went to the bathroom even though your arm wasn't that close to the glass
>She decided against a second date
>And again this happened
>You started getting a reputation for being an awful date, and because you kept turning girls down people started wondering if you were purposefully sabotaging them
>Eventually you just started accepting the dates, and that girl is eventually replaced by a fox every time
>She tells you that no human could ever be with a fox fucker like you, and at this rate you'll either die alone or end up marrying her
>You've given up expecting someone else
>You've accepted love for you will always be a cruel prank made by that thing
>You were sent to be his wife, but you couldn't help yourself
>The first time was supposed to be a joke, a one time thing
>But that face he made when he was disappointed, you loved it
>Whenever you ran off you had to touch herself, you couldn't help but be turned on
>You just wished she could have him make that face and have him afterwards
>The date was wonderful, you loved every moment, but nothing could have topped that face
>A pure hopeful love crushed
>You could have told him that she was sent to be his wife, but she had to see it more and more
>And every time he made it the better it got
>He tried to get other girlfriends, but you fixed that, and it got even better
>Now he's running into your arms even when he should know it's you
>He thinks those kisses are just jokes but he always accepts them because he thinks they are fake
>You've tried to tell him the truth but he calls you a liar when you do
>And he makes that wonderful face
>It's easier and so fulfilling to make him think it's false
>You know it's true, every kiss, every hug, every bite along the nape of his neck, every whisper of affection
>He needs you, he clings to you like a rock in a river that would sweep him away
>His kisses are so sweet, letting out hiccups as you touch him
>You ask if he's okay but he doesn't answer, only holds on tighter
>You lick away his tears and let your hands search him like it's your first time
>But you've felt every crevice, every bump, every piece, and you know it's all yours
>He's so perfectly fragile
>His desires are so pure despite everything
>He gives and gives and you only take it away
>The truth you give to him is not something he can accept
>If he really knew the truth, what would he say?
>What would he do?
>Why are you scared?
>You can always follow him
>He would view your actions more kindly knowing you are a girl in love
>Yet you feel like he'd be angry
>It couldn't hurt him more than you already have
>So why
>Why, why, why do you keep doing it?
>It feels like it would stain him
>Helplessness turned to anger
>He loves you
>But he'd hate you
>But he already hates you
>But he doesn't show it
>But he hopes that you love him
>But he shouldn't love you
>If you loved him he'd hate you
>You're a monster
>A curse placed upon him
>To think he could love you is arrogance of the highest order
>You don't deserve it, and he shouldn't give it to you
>He clings to you in fear if what you've brought on him
>A fear of being alone
>But it's better he shake in fear than shake in fury
>That would ruin the purity
>Anger is ugly, terrible, not worthy of tainting his face

>Be humie in anthro dom city
>Hard to get clean work outside the skin clubs and grooming spa's

>Get up close to all different kinds of anthro gals
>Not a fan of the rough clients but they seem to get off on your reluctance to let them tighten chokers on you
>Let them anyway. Think of the money.

>Plan to attend protests against the way Female Anthro Law Enforcement treats human males
>Your Anthro Wolf Cop friend says to be safe, there are “bad apples” and she’ll keep her eye on you
>Part way during the protest as things are getting heated you get pinned and cuffed
>It’s your friend who drags you away, to her patrol car
>Before you can ask what she’s doing she slides off her panties, and puts them over your face
>Their smell is overwhelming and intoxicating, you can’t think straight
>At the station she drags you right to an interrogation room, where she immediately sits on your face telling you the only thing she wants out of your mouth is your tongue
>Between her scent, warmth, and the way she used her panties to gag you you can’t help yourself
>You eat her out until she climaxes, soaking you with her jucies
>She pulls you onto a chair, shreds you clothing, then starts riding your cock
>All the while telling you cute humies should know their place
>After you cum inside her while your brains are post-orgasm mush she makes you sign some papers
>The statement confessed you got violent at the protest, your friend had to take you down, and the only way to avoid jail time is to be released into her custody for “rehabilitation.”
>She slaps a collar and leash on you, taking you to your apartment
>She orders you to pack just the essentials, as she called the movers yesterday to come take the rest
>Inadvertently admitting she planned to do this as soon as you told her about going to the protests
>When you get to her house, as soon as she leads you inside she pins you to the ground to ride your cock again, telling you it’s for you own good, belonging to her
>After sex, it’s dinner, followed by more sex, each time she makes sure you cum inside her
>After all you are hers now, and that’s where your cum belongs
>You fall asleep in her arms, surprisingly comfortable and safe
>Given the fact she kidnapped you and practically raped you

>Be the wolf cop.
>Your head is a mess after all that's happened, and you can't think straight.
>With your human friend - YOUR HUMAN - lying asleep in your arms, you struggle to process.
>After hearing him say that he was going to that awful protest, you'd panicked.
>People died all the time at those things - trampled, crushed, shot, burned, and so many other terrible things.
>And humans were so fragile, so small and soft and weak.
>Seeing him get that fire in his eyes had terrified you more than staring down the barrel of a gun.
>You'd never shared your political views with him, and now you were more than thankful that you hadn't.
>The laws are the way they are for a reason, and you and your fellow officers do the things you do for the greater good.
>That might just be you trying to cope with the fact that you've effectively kidnapped and raped your dearest friend.
>It's hard to reconcile feelings of deep affection, intense possessiveness, and maternal protectiveness all at once.
>All you know is that when you'd quickly and messily made your plan, you'd felt that you were doing the right thing.
>Under your care - which should last as long as you need until he's suitably "rehabilitated" - he'll be safe.
>No more seething masses of angry people, no more guns pointed at him, no more uncertainty, and no more loneliness.
>You reach down to squeeze his smooth, soft backside, and your tongue slides over your teeth.
>As you begin to doze, your last thoughts before sleep takes you are short, simple, dismissive and comforting.

>all the anthros in the ship you're stuck on are predator species
>so when it comes time to eat majority of the food is meat
>they're worried they may not have food for you thinking humans aren't predator species too with no claws and small jaws and haven't really seen your teeth yet
>you try to to get the chef to give you a smaller portion, but when she sees you're ordering meat she then makes sure you get a good portion since you're so small
>the anthros are watching you intently now curious about you/humans
>annoying there's no forks or knives to use since the anthros have claws and big fangs
>so fuck it, you pick a piece of meat and take a human sized(small) bite out of the meat and tear off the chunk which shows a little of your side teeth which have some point to them
>next thing you know you're being surrounded by anthro women cooing and awwing at you eating like pup
>and you have to try and eat while they gush about your small fangs and them asking if you need help tearing up your meat
>haven't even finished eating and they're already fussing with trying to clean you since eat with no utensils is messy

I'm reminded of this HFY thread about the veil of madness.
Except a modified scenario where, without power armor, we are much smaller than the anthro aliens. And as time goes on eventually the secret breaks, that humans aren't terrifying at all. They are actually cute, soft, and smaller than most of the aliens.
It would be sort of an interesting juxtaposition. We're still a terrifying technological force who live in a place that no one can invade or strike back at. But we're just so darn cute that it makes diplomacy take a distinct turn. Like if an evil alien empire turned out to be all hobbits or something, and they actually weren't evil at all, they were just assigned a role against their will at their introduction to the greater galaxy.
Eventually humans drop the power armor facade for comfort but get into increasingly awkward scenarios as their trade partners tower over them while still having to respect the human empire. Rather than being feared they now have to deal with being babied by doting females who are vastly physically superior.

>the ayynthros find out the truth they're not mad, rather they feel pity for the poor little things
>forced to survive in an inhospitable and dangerous sector of space, all alone, with no one to protect them
>then they meet the galactic community, and everyone is bigger and stronger than they are
>and then everyone starts treating them like they're the monsters
>and they feel they must play the role given to them, or risk being seen as weak and become targets
>the galaxy must feel so frightening and isolating for them
>overnight humanity goes from galactic boogeymen to precious cinnamon rolls

Imagine an anthro ship captain offering herself up as a sex slave to avoid annihilation only for humanity to finally break the facade because this shit is going too far.
A week later the captain gets the same request again with a much flirtier tone, and also from the anthro captains sisters and entire crew

The mascaraed had fallen and humans were now better understood by the other races of the galaxy. Human military was still feared but individual humans much less so. It did make trade negotiations much easier with some of the more cautious species. The expanded trade and lack of security concerns now meant that most humans went without power armor unless dealing with particularly aggressive species, or if they were on explicitly military or diplomatic missions.
Mark was one such human going all natural to visit a distant trade partner. The Slynn were in control of a few systems rich in some rare elements and it was Marks job to negotiate a purchase for his company. The only hiccup was that humans didn't have much knowledge about the Slynn other than the fact that their biology seemed to be a blend of amphibian and mollusk characteristics.
The Slynn were also one of the larger species around with the males being a head taller than a human even in power armor. The females were rumored to be even larger, but as a matriarchal society they were rarely seen. They mostly conducted business through the lower ranking males. This was the real source of Marks anxiety as he would have to meet with a female given the size of the purchase being negotiated. He had also heard from other negotiators that matriarchal species like the Slynn had changed their attitude towards humanity considerably since the humans now opted out of power armor. He didn't believe half the rumors he heard, but was nervous none the less.
Mark exited his transport as soon as it docked at the largest asteroid processing station in the system. He started to sweat almost immediately given the high humidity and temperature preferred by the Slynn. Dealing with such local preferences was one disadvantage to loosing the power armor his predecessors relied upon.
A few males greeted him with a cordial and respectful tone despite towering over him. The Slynn had smooth grey skin with a shark like head. Their torsos were humanoid like except for having four arms, with webbing between their four fingered hands. They had no legs, but instead a mass of strong tentacles supported them. They had two longer tentacles going down their back that were more delicate and used as manipulators rather than for walking.
His hosts carried his luggage to his room as they informed him of the amenities available at the station. Mark was impressed at the amount of effort that had gone into accommodating a human, even his room had a more comfortable temperature and humidity level, as well as a nice bed instead of whatever the Slynn slept on. It was good to see that being a human still carried some weight even though much of their intimidation factor had been lost in recent years. Mark had been informed that he would be meeting with Herata, the owner of the station, for dinner. Going over the details of the deal allowed Mark to kill time until then.
Sooner than he anticipated his escorts arrived for dinner. They led him to a large door and let him in but didn't follow. A wide table was spread in front of a huge window that allowed Mark to see the gas giant of the system that the station orbited. A few chandelier like structures hung from the ceiling giving the room a soft blue green glow. Mark was so busy taking in the view he didn't notice the door behind him open.
"Lovely view isn't it" came a feminine voice from behind him.
Mark turned around and was stunned. Herata was twice his height, with his head barely coming up to her generous "hips". Rather than the plain grey of the males her skin was covered in luminescent rings, but the most striking feature was what appeared to be some of the largest breasts Mark had ever seen. We'll maybe the organs weren't breasts per se, but given their position on her chest and lack of clothing suddenly made Mark blush. Her green eyes glowed slightly as she smiled and placed one of her lower hands on marks shoulder.
"Ye..Yes" Mark stammered "It's an amazing view... that your station has"
"I'm glad to share it with you for the evening" Herata said as she pressed on Mark's back slightly to lead him to the table. The rhythmic movement of her many tentacles gave Mark the impression that she was gliding next to him. There was a pad in front of the table that she moved onto. Her strong hands pulled mark into sitting amongst her tentacles a bit more forcefully than he would have liked.
The pad turned out to be more of a water bed of some kind. Her manipulator tentacles wrapped around him and he was pulled snugly against her soft stomach. He was surprised to find her skin neither slimy nor scaly, but rather smooth as fine silk. From his low vantage point Mark got the distinct feeling of being a child at a grown up table. He began to ask Herata about the mining operation.
"Oh, we needn't talk about that now. It's Slynnian custom to never discuss business upon the first meeting. We'll have plenty of time to go over such details in the coming days."
Her hands gripped his shoulders more tightly "We believe for ongoing business such as this, it's important that a relationship be established first."
Mark felt uncomfortable about the tone with which she said that and asked her about dinner to change the subject. She explained that a variety of seafood delicacies would be prepared in the traditional Slynnian fashion. Soon a male brought a plate in each hand and tentacle to the table. Mark reached for a utensil only to watch Herata's hand grab them first. With her four limbs she effortless fed herself and Mark at the same time, describing each dish as they progressed through the courses.
Being doted upon and fed by his host left him feeling even smaller and he wasn't sure if this was Slynnian hospitality or some kind of negotiating tactic that only matriarchal societies used. As the meal wrapped up the empty plates disappeared and they were left alone again. Herata reached for a spot on the table that lit up to her touch and the table descended into the floor and the lighting of the room changed to more pinkish hue. She lounged back on her water bed seat.
"I must confess something Mark" she said "I've been absolutely fascinated with humans since I found out that they were all so cute. But one thing I haven't found an answer for is why you all cover yourselves. Our people only wear armor to war, but even without your armor and during peace humans are covering themselves in some material or another, why is that?"
"I guess that's just our way" Mark said "Our home world has very diverse environments and many of them are not ideal for us to be naked in."
"Are you uncomfortable now, here?" she asked stroking Mark with her tentacles.
"Well it's not just a matter of comfort, modesty plays a certain role. My people would view it as unprofessional if I were to disrobe in a business meeting."
"We're not discussing business now are we?" Herata said leaning forward bringing her face close to Marks. Her eyes now concentrated and reflected the pink light of the room. "But if possibly souring your trade deal is making you hesitant, I assure you that there is nothing much to discuss. The terms are acceptable as drafted."
Mark was momentarily confused, if the terms weren't in need of negotiation then why not approve them via the traditional channels? Why drag a negotiator all the way out to the Sylnnian system... unless the only point was to get a human out to the system. He realized that his entire journey was to slake Herata's curiosity and nothing more.
It was often a mistake to make assumptions about alien body language. But Mark was having trouble not interpreting the dazzling eyes, sultry pose, and cleavage display of his host as something other than mere curiosity.
"Was there anything else you were curious about, regarding humans?" he asked to test the waters.
A smile crossed her face "There is one thing but I'm embarrassed to ask..." Her luminescent rings grew brighter in what Mark assumed was a kind of blush. "Can I... smell you?" she asked.
That wasn't exactly the request Mark was expecting but he agreed. Herata leaned forward and before he could respond a broad forked blue tongue darted out of her mouth and licked the side of his face. Surprised at first he remembered that the translation distinction between smell and taste were often garbled for some species. She made an amused noise and her tongue darted out twice more.
"Interesting" she said "Not like anything on my world"
Mark wiped his face without trying to be rude. Herata slid her hands under his arms and brought him closer to herself. Her tongue quickly explored his face once again while a free hand twirled his hair. Another hand began to grope him under his shirt. Her tentacles were wrapping around his legs and clearly attempting to pull his pants away.
"Are. you. opposed. to. attempting. to. mate. with. one. such as myself?" she asked punctuating her words with her kisses pulling Mark away to look him in the eyes as she finally asked her question.
"Are you sure we are compatible?" Mark asked.
"I'll be the judge of that" she said as her hands and tentacles nimbly removed his clothes. Marks erection stood at attention as he waited for the much larger female to express her opinion. "Your proboscis.." she said staring "It's huge..."
Mark silently thanked the unpredictability of alien biology. Before he could verbally express anything that tongue of hers busily began to taste him. Satisfied moans, more like croaks, were coming from her as she tasted him. Her tentacles were writhing against each other on the seat bellow.
She leaned back dropping Mark to her chest. His hands sunk into the breast like organs, they were softer than he expected given their firm gravity defying shape. Before he could ask what they were really for he was pushed down to her tentacles. They peeled back revealing an orifice that Mark could guess the purpose of.
"I should warn you" Harata began "Sylnn mating can last for several minutes, let me know if you..." Mark didn't wait for her to finish before plunging himself in. Her tentacles completely engulfed his legs and torso as he pumped into his alien lover over and over. He couldn't recognize the noises Harata was making anymore but he heard no complaints and given the pulsation of her tentacles she wanted more of what he was giving her.
It didn't take long for Harata to climax with a light show erupting from her rings, but Mark continued pleasing her. If she had any discontent at him not stopping she didn't say so. After several more orgasms from her Mark came as well and collapsed onto her soft belly.
After several minutes of lying together Harata finally said "I had no idea humans could be so wonderful." As she playfully twirled Marks hair he was already mentally composing the message he was going to send to his boss about negotiations running long and needing a few more days to finalize them.

>then later an angry mob tried to attack your embassy because your nation had sent a “Man-Whore with loose morals” to them as a representative and in the resulting chaos you allowed your stomach to be seen.
Thankfully the situation was resolved and cooler heads prevailed, and the incident is largely seen as a humorous oddity in the convoluted mess of geopolitics.
That hasn’t stopped a certain princess from eyeing you and every now and then she sends you little notes about how you need someone to save you from the corruption of the world and make you into a Good House-Husband and that “If God wills it you shall be the father of my pups.”

>mfw all it took to get a mommy waifur was just to literally phone it in

>The anthros faith is complicated and nuanced, but one thing is simple.
>The humans were not created by The Anthro God, The Omnifur, and as a result they are viewed as beings that are born from the chaos and corruption of the world.
>Humanity’s Hubris commanded them to wander the world and seek a way to bring about their ideal of a “Perfect” world.
>Thus they went out, trying to uncover knowledge they were not meant to know, twisting it and creating all manners of aberrations and vile blasphemies unto the Omnifur.
>Historically speaking the interactions between the two populations were scarce, as neither wanted anything to do with the other.
>But as time went on, the perception of humanity began to change.
>They may have discovered and “explained”many of the mysteries in the world, and created all manners of wonders and miracles. They even landed upon the moon, an object many Canids hold sacred, But just look at where they are now.
>Mans eternal pursuit of knowledge and his indomitable pride led him to the sadness and sorrows of modernity, a slave to the monsters of his own making. For all of his machines and devices, man is in pain.
>Many anthros came to view mankind as a victim of his own circumstance, the holy books only ever speak of their own creation and do not tell of a Human God.
>But one day, they came to a realization. Man must be their charge, they must be the ones to save humanity from themselves, they must be the ones who will show mankind that humility, and devotion to the Omnifur are what bring happiness.
>Slowly Human Men are viewed as a challenge for the faithful, a being of chaos that must be conquered and made docile.
>This is not without controversy, the idea of bringing in such sinful beings into their communities is naturally repugnant to many, some even doomsay about humans luring them into a false sense of security but as time goes on, and more and more anthros take a human husband, the notion that they are truly irredeemable slowly faded away.
>This is the Mission all true followers of the Omnifur face, to tame the dynamic spirit of a human and bring him to the Omnifur as a devoted husband, loving father, and a pious adherent to her will.

Anthro women with immense influence turns me one/scares me
Like Imagine the genuine horror of stealing the heart of an anthro billionaire multinational industrialist/tech giant/mega-banker or some shit.
She could own your house and your job, and the houses and jobs of anyone you know with a single phone call to her accountants, or utilize the entire brunt of her companies and gather all the data she could ever want from you. She would know where you bought lunch before the bank could even process your card. Or know how many times you toss and turn at night.
God save you if she ever decides to make a move on you. You’ll be lucky if you’re not plucked from your home by mercenaries, and taken to one of her finest mansions, far out in the mountains, far away from anything or anyone aside from her.
Our you could be threatened with a total lockout from the worlds financial and communications infrastructure. Imagine it, in an instant your cards, bank accounts, phone, and computer all cease to function.
Or maybe you will be arrested on charges you didn’t commit. Charges that her lawyers are conveniently willing to assist you with, provided you agree to some…conditions.
What could you ever hope to do? She would own the banks, the ISPs, the tech companies, the media, politicians, and anything else worth a damn. And anyone who could help you would already be in her pocket, or be afraid of the people who were.
But that wouldn’t need to happen would it anon?
Surely you would not need to be…convinced to do anything. You wouldn’t deny her the one thing money can’t buy, you couldn’t be so narrow minded, could you anon?

How would herd/pack species deal with human monogamy.
Would your waifur hide you away for herself or would she share with her pack/herd?
Also how would this affect marriage. Corporations can be considered as a person, would a herd of sheep/pack of wolves be the same?

Not all pack/herd species mate the same way
>spotted hyenas are pretty much a free for all with the female picking a male of any rank
>lions have multiple females
>in wolves only the alpha male and female are allowed to mate
>cuttlefish are super kinky in the big strong males form harems while the smaller males pretend to be females and join those harems to mate with the females too
>etc

>humans are real, I know they're real
>I can hear mine, calling ou to me
>they keep trying to give me the meds
>'to make me better' they say
>liars
>it's the dragons, they're hoarding all the humans for themselves
>greedy bitches
>they stuck me in here cuz I know the truth
>don't worry anon, I can still hear you, I've been hiding the pills under my tongue and spitting them out when the nurses don't see
>I'll get out of here and then I'll come find you
>and then we can be together
>I'm not crazy

Humans as a mythological species appeals to me so much, I don’t think we’ve seen any stories like that except 1

>humans are mythological creatures in anthro world
>they're like elves or fey, cute, mischievous little creatures
>there is a kid's cartoon based on human folklore that is massively popular with grown women, of all demographics
>millions of anthro women are obsessed with this show, and primarily with its cast of cute human characters, which they have dubbed 'humandos'
>the fandom produces an ocean of content, most of it porn
>fans flock to forums to share fan art and fanfic (again, most of it being erotic) discuss lore and theories (most of it about human sexuality) and virulently argue with each other about which human is 'best boy'

>Your waifur gets hurt pretty bad while fighting off a gang of horny anthros out for your dick
>You half carry half drag her back home and do your best to apply first aid
>She laments that she couldn't protect you properly, asks why you're even bothering with her after her "failure" as a mate
>You tell her that's bullshit, you wouldn't leave her for anything
>"Not yet maybe, but what if this happens again? What if it's worse? You'll change your mind"
>You try to think of some way to get her to understand you aren't like that
>"Remember that night you joked about marking me so the other girls would know I'm yours?"
>She nods
>You take off your shirt and present your neck to her
>"Do it"
>She hesitates, then slowly opens her jaws and places them between your neck and shoulder, pressing just enough to draw blood
>That's not how it's done, and you both know it. You put a hand on her top and bottom jaw and suddenly press them together as hard as you can
>Hurts much more than you bargained for, but you grit your teeth and bear it
>Suddenly unbothered by her own wounds, she grabs your hands and holds them down, admonishing you for hurting yourself
>You also notice she starts to tear up some, touched that you would do this to yourself for her sake
>She licks the blood from your bite and uses some of the bandages meant for her to stop it from bleeding too much
>It takes a little convincing, but you eventually get her to let you finish checking her over and making sure she doesn't need to go to a hospital
>By the time you're done she's in higher spirits than you've possibly ever seen her, tail wagging and a bright smile on her face despite the pain she's in
>She doesn't let you leave her sight for the rest of the day, and refers to you as "my mate" at least a hundred times
>That night you're subjected to the worlds most gentle mating press, but she promises that as soon as she's feeling better she'll "do to your dick with my crotch what you did to your neck with my mouth"

>No one's sure how long she'd been around
>Some speculate she was there before the town’s settling but there was no way to confirm it
>Some say she's older than the swamp she resides in going off her size
>Either way, two things were know
>she was massive, and she was territorial
>Many wanted to expand further into the swamps, an area she guarded viciously
>Rather than try to negotiate with her they simply decided that trying to get rid of her was the easier option
>They hired mercenaries to try and deal with the barbarian gator
>She'd been shot, stabbed, and even at one point blown up with TNT
>Yet every time she survived and butchered her would be assassins by either her axes or teeth
>All attempts to remove her failed
>Then one day you arrived at this town one day
>by way of casual conversation, the ravenous gator came up
>There was definitely an air of desperation in the man’s voice
>Though it also sounded like he didn’t want to let on exactly how dangerous this thing was
>Lot of gold was on the table if you could do SOMETHING about her
>Might as well take a look...

>Be orphaned noble

>Unfortunately for her, her territory had very few humans, so she had to take anthro tutors and advisors
>If your father didn't talk her into it, she probably wouldn't have any at all
>They were treated badly, insulted regularly, and often ignored
>When your parents died most of them celebrated in secret
>But you were still there, and you were inexperienced in ruling
>They still were not satisfied with the death of your mother and her weak husband
>The economics advisor, a cat, refused to help you, saying that if you are so great you could handle it yourself
>You were frightened when she mentioned that your people might revolt if you handled things improperly and end you
>You begged and she finally agreed to give you her services if you serviced her underneath the table whenever you requested her help
>And so you did
>Tears fell from your eyes as you performed the shameful act
>That was only the first
>The dog guards started to find you alone and play with you
>Every bodyguard tried to take advantage of you, even the head of security
>The pig chef started putting special aphrodisiacs in your food, and watched as her sister, the taste tester shoved her tongue and the food in your mouth

>You tried to run, but the bat spy master kept bringing you back, but not before enjoying seeing you struggle against her body, the ropes making it impossible to fight back
>They all take advantage of you, and they all need favors before they will help you run your land, you could hardly be said to have control over it anymore
>Despite this the people in your land are apparently doing well thanks to your shame
>The peasants enjoy few taxes but still have good infrastructure
>Bandits become less of a problem with good use of soldiers
>The people are becoming increasingly educated
>Because you were willing to debase yourself to help them, because you didn't want them to have to be hurt, because you wanted them to become better
>Over time your advisors started acting differently, and sometimes forgo the usual "payment"
>The economics advisor gives you kissed before you leave
>The head of security keeps a close eye on you and stands between you and the other guards
>The chef and taste tester start making your favorite foods more often, and it's never drugged
>The spymaster sometimes goes into your bedroom and just... holds you
>They keep asking for favors, but some have a hard time looking at you while doing so
>One day the spymaster whispers before leaving your room "We're all sorry. We misjudged you, and it was wrong of us."
>You could only cry as she hugged you tighter

>I will then lure the second from the safe with a marble I threw to the floor, when she investigates I will descend from the ceiling onto the second then use the vantage point to blast the third, and finally choke out the second!
>I wait until my first victim turns her back and then… CHOP!

>still shivering and trying not to spill your cocoa you let Freda pull you through the house
>her paw was giant compared to your hand, and her fur was incredibly soft
>She pulled you upstairs, you getting a nice view of her butt
>Freda and you stopped in front of a door, the hallway you were in was lit by more candles, they must have been been prep then.
>still holding your hand Freda opened the door awkwardly with her other hand, still holding her mug
>”This is the bedroom” she said leading you inside
>however for a bedroom there was a severe lack of well… a bed
>instead a load of duvets, quilts, pillows and blankets were strewn across the floor.
>confused you asked Freda what this was
>”Oh, well bed frames that can support the weight of bears are available but they are certainly not cheap or easy to put together, so instead we throw a bunch of cushioning on the ground and sleep on that, it’s just as comfy and we sleep perfectly fine
>well you guessed that made sense
>Freda then let go of you and asked you to hold her mug, which you did
>She suddenly started undressing in front of you, and you turned around, not wanting to get caught staring
>”don’t worry Anon I’m not naked”
>turning back around you found she wasn’t lying, barely
>Freda was wearing tight fitting purple lingerie, her large boobs almost spilling out
>she took her mug back and sat down, patting the cushioned floor in front of you
>you sat down next to her, facing the same way she was
>you started looking for a blanket or something when Freda suddenly wrapped her big paws around your chest, gently picking you up and placing you in her lap, wrapping her arms around your belly
>”There we go, comfy hun?” she said
>you nodded, back of your head in between her bra covered cleavage
>you were still shivering, not from the cold but excitement and embarrassment
>you took a sip of cocoa, trying to calm yourself down
>swallowing the large sip you took you calmed down, the shivering stopping
>you leant back into Freda, sinking into her warm fur covered belly
>she chuckled, her breasts wobbling slightly
>her body heat quickly rose your own, her fur felt amazing on your back
>Elsa then appeared in the doorway, dimly lit by candlelight
>”Someones comfy” Elsa said, seeing you held in Freda’s arms on the floor
>entering the room she closed the door behind her
>Elsa put her mug down and then crossed her arms in an ‘X’ having a hand in each shoulder. She then pulled each of the sundresses shoulder straps off her shoulders
>Thinking you were about to get a strip show your eyes were frozen on Elsa
>suddenly your view was blocked by Freda, having raised a hand in front of your face
>”Ah ah ah, no peeking mister”
>disappointed but not wanting to anger them you simply sat there, taking small sips of cocoa.
>eventually she lowered her hand, revealing a now practically naked Elsa in front of you
>the only thing she was wearing were a pair of cyan panties and she was holding her massive boobs in one arm, covering her nipples
>Elsa sat down cross legged in front of Freda and you, beginning to drink her own cocoa
>”The cocoa good love?” Elsa asked
>you nodded eagerly, Elsa smiled at that
>”Freda spoke up from above you”
>”yeah it’s pretty good, did you put something in it? It tastes different than usual.”
>”oh we were out of the usual so I opened the red cap one” Elsa said
>”E-Elsa that was the aphrodisiac laced one”
>”wait what”? Elsa said, slightly concerned
>”I was saving that for your birthday, did you use it in all of the cups of cocoa?”
>”Yes”
>”So Anon just drank a big mug of large anthro strength aphrodisiac laced cocoa?”
>”yes?”
>”and we did too?”
>Elsa nodded
>they both looked at you
>’aphrodisiac’ you knew you had heard the word before but couldn’t remember what it meant off the top of your head
>”what’s an aphrodisiac?” You asked, “I can’t quite remember”
>Freda spoke up “well it’s uh..drug that makes you….horny”
>”oh” you said, looking down at the almost empty mug in your hands
>suddenly the window blew open slightly.
>Elsa jumped to her feet surprisingly fast for her size, running over to window, her ‘assets’ jiggling and pulling it shut
>”forget to lock the damn thing” she said
>you decided to ask “so what are you two anyway? Housemates?”
>”oh we’re actually dating” Freda answered
>”oh, like…lesbians?” you said
>”we’re both Bisexual to be precise”
>”Oh”
>even though the window had been open for only a few seconds the room had gotten significantly colder, and you started shivering again, even with Freda holding you close
>Your hosts both noticed this, Elsa coming back over, sitting back down and scooting closer to you and Freda
>”what are you doing?” You said confused
>”keeping you warm” Elsa chuckled
>with that she wrapped her arms and legs around the You and Freda
>you were now pressed on either side by a warm and cushiony polar bear, the only part of you not covered was your head, which was poking out their combined cleavages
>They both laughed and you also nervously laughed
>”Ha…uh so how long does this cocoa take to work?” You said
>”hmmm I think it said 20 minutes for an anthro our size and weight” Freda answered
>”but since you’re a human who probably doesn’t even weight a third what we do for you I’d say much quicker”
>thinking about it you did feel kind of, aroused
>you reached your arms around Elsa as far as they would go, hugging her back and feeling her fur
>it’s was wonderfully soft, a layer of unsulating fat hid her tense muscles yiu could feel flexing as she moved ever so slightly
>”getting a little grabby aren’t we?” Elsa laughed
>you stopped
>”I didn’t say stop mister”
>both the bears chugged down what was left of their cocoa, setting the mugs, and yours aside
>Freda took her arms away from your belly, reaching behind herself
>her breasts suddenly became loose and molded themselves around the back of your head, pressing into Elsa’s more
>”what was that?” You asked
>”I undid my bra, seeing as how there’s no need for it anymore” Freda replied
>she reached forward and pulled if completely off, you now felt her warm boob fat against your neck
>you were feeling really warm not only on the outside but inside aswell
>you relaxed into their embrace and both of them chuckled
>unbeknownst to you they had fetched an idea
>suddenly they both sat up, your head disappearing into their huge cleavages
>it was nice actually, their boobs were soft and warm, Elsa’s fur tickled your face slightly as she moved
>then you heard a loud noise what sounded like an engine idling, the rhythmic hum reverberated throughout out you
>it took a minute before you realised that the noise was actually coming from Freda and Elsa above you
>With Your head in Elsa’s tits you couldn’t help but breathe in her scent
>it was intoxicating, the faint smell of flowers, probably from a shampoo and the main smell of, Earth? That was the best way to describe it
>you felt your underwear get a little tight, clearly the aphrodisiac cocoa was starting to effect you
>almost unconsciously you hand moved back from around Elsa and just under her boobs
>You questioned whether you should do what you were about to, however hornyness over-rid any logical thinking
>you gently began kneading Elsa’s boobs from underneath, hearing a surprised “OH” from above
>her boob flesh was soft and supple in your hands, heavy too given the size of them
>Elsa’s hands moved to your legs, seeming to squeeze almost in time when your own hands do
>You kept kneading her boobs for you don’t know how long
>the feeling of her big hands squeezing your legs felt oddly nice
>Freda’s hands remained around your belly, if tighter than before
>you decided to poke your head under their busts, finding the candle light illuminated just enough for you to make out their bodies
>Elsa’s had a large belly that hang over her cyan panties, and Freda still had on the bottom of her purple lingerie
>speaking of Elsa’s panties they looked a bit, damp in the candlelight
>hands still kneading you poked your head back into their warm chests
>soon you realised that the engine like noise had stopped and their breathing had gotten a bit, raggedy
>deciding to investigate you sat up, your head emerging between the top of their busts
>looking up your jaw dropped
>Freda and Elsa were engaged in a deep and passionate kiss right above your head
>their tongues intertwined and fought for control, pushing into each other’s mouths
>you couldn’t look away, even as some of their saliva dropped onto your face
>after god knows how long they stopped, breathing heavily and looking into each other’s eyes
>then they both noticed you, looking down and grinning hungrily
>Elsa licked her jet black lips before saying “Anon are you a fuckin’ baker or something?”
>was she talking about your kneading?
>you increased the pace of your kneading, causing Elsa to groan
>”I think you’ve made the aphrodisiac kick in early” Elsa said, biting her lip
>”Lucky bitch” you heard Freda say under her breath behind you
>”Take a breath” Elsa said sultry
>before you could even ask why she lowered her head, her lips connecting with yours
>immediately her long tongue pushed its way past your lips and onto your mouth
>She easily overpowered your own tongue as she explored your mouth
>you closed your eyes and simply let her have her way with you
>just as her tongue began to work its way further into your mouth and almost down your throat she pulled away
>you gasped for air, red in the face and dick hard as diamonds
>she let her long black tongue hang in front of you, dripping with a mix of both your salivas
>”God your so fucking cute” Elsa said
>you then felt a large finger under your chin pulling your head and view upwards
>you were now facing Freda who in your current perspective was upside down
>”ready to go again?” she chuckled
>you nodded eagerly
>instead of subjecting you to a kiss like Elsa Freda simply gave you a light kiss on the lips
>you looked at her confused as she reach for something out your line of sight
>her arm came back and you saw she was holding a bottle of lube?
>where had that come from?
>Freda tried to get the lid off with the same hand she was holding it with, unsuccessfully
>”For Christ’s sake-“ she said before she straight up squeezed the thing, causing it to explode in her hand
>she dropped what was left of the bottle, seeing her hand was covered in lube
>You suddenly felt Elsa’s hands on your underwear
>you heard a *rripp* and felt your dick point straight up now that it was free
>Elsa brought your torn underwear up to her nose, taking a breath of them
>”mmm” she moaned as she passed then to Freda’s free hand
>Elsa then grabbed the back of your head and brought you back into a deep kiss, her tongue back where it left off
>you heard Freda practically inhale your underwear above you, moaning loudly
>Freda she gripped your cock tightly in her lubed hand and began stroking
>you groaned into Elsa’s mouth as Freda stoked your cock
>her lubed pads felt amazing against your sensitive skin
>this would have felt amazing in any circumstance but with the added bonus of accidentally drinking a mug of extra strength aphrodisiac it only made it better
>your toes curled and legs writhed in pleasure as they both worked you
>Elsa’s tongue was almost going down your throat, almost choking you
>Freda’s hand was expertly pumping up and down your length, pre now leaking from your tip
>Above you you still heard Freda huffing your underwear, her grip seeming to tighten momentarily whenever she did
>One of Elsa’s hand left your head, reaching below
>suddenly you felt a hand start gently caressing your balls, clearly Elsa’s
>already being horny from the aphrodisiac you felt the pleasurable pressure of a climax build in your crotch
>you tried to hold back, not wanting this to stop but the pressure quickly overwhelmed you
>you moaned into Elsa’s mouth as you came
>thick white ropes of cum now added a new shade of white to the paunch of her belly and underside of her tits
>Elsa stopped her kiss, taking a heavy and deep breath
>the hand that had been fondling your balls now drew itself across her belly, collecting your cum
>she brought the cum covered finger up to just infront of her, looking at it in the dim candlelight
>she slowly and deliberately licked her finger clean in one go
>she rolled the white glob around her mouth before gulping audibly gulping
>she simply said
>”Tasty”
>Freda’s lube free hand then ran across the underside of Elsa’s tits, coming out covered in cum also
>she stuck her tongue out, wiping her finger across it, the white contrasting against the black of it
>she held it in her mouth, tasting it
>suddenly you felt both of them start to move
>you were gently laid out on your back, the both of them laying down on your legs, their warm boobs spreading like jelly across them, you still hadn’t seen their nipples though
>Freda then licked your still sensitive dick, causing you to buck
>Elsa firmly placed a hand on your hip, keeping you from moving
>Then the two engaged in a kiss, you seeing the cum in Freda’s mouth moving into Elsa’s
>Elsa then also licked you, pleasurable tingling shooting your spine
>then they repeated the process of kissing, giving the cum glob to one another and then licking your dick before starting over again
>each time you got closer and closer to cumming again
>were they playing a form of Russian roulette with your dick?
>They continued lapping at your dick until you broke
>Freda’s tongue was halfway down your cock when you groaned;
>”oh shit”
>Freda looked up at you for a split second before opening her maw wide, her sharp teeth glinting in the candlelight
>you came again, painting the inside of her black mouth white
>suddenly Elsa shoved Freda’s head out the way with her own
>Elsa then opened her mouth wide aswell clearly not wanting to miss out on the action
>after what felt like an eternity you stopped cumming
>seeing Freda and Elsa’s mouths and faces covered in your cum you couldn’t think of anything to say
>both of them swallowed what was in their mouths before starting to affectionately lap at each other’s face, cleaning it
>you on the other hand lead back, staring at the ceiling, feeling your heart beat on your chest
>after a short while your heart rate has gone back to normal and the lapping around your waist had stopped
>you felt 2 hands gently grip each side of your torso, and then pulling you towards the polar bears
>looking down you saw that the hands belonged to both Freda and Elsa, each using one to pull you back into their embrace
>they were pulling you back in between their breasts again, this time all of you are laying down
>first your groin disappeared into the cleavage cave, then everything up to your neck
>the weight of their bodies pressing anytime was nice, they were soft and supple, their fur holding a layer of warmth just above it
>both of them kissed your cheeks at the same time
>Elsa gently trailed a claw down your face, fire enough to leave a faint welt on it, stinging slightly
>”So Big boy…what do you want to do now?”
>”uhhh,umm-kiss!” You said
>”good choice” Freda smiled
>Freda locked her lips with yours, gently biting your lip with her razor sharp teeth
>unlike Elsa she was more conservative, letting you feel her lips with your tongue
>She seemed to be slowly cuddling you
>you tried to feel her body, but she immediately stopped the cuddling and put her hands on your arms
>she pushed them outwards, pinning them to the floor at your sides
>her hands reached your wrists, and she interlocked her fingers with yours
>she let released the kiss
>”you must like being under us or something” she said
>Freda suddenly started to get up
>”seeing as you two are having all the fun I’ll go get us some refreshments” she said coldly
>as she walked to the door you got a good view of her titanic ass jiggling nicely
>soon after she left the room Freda whispered in your ear
>”she might not look it but she’s the most excited I’ve seen her in months, and not just from the cocoa”
>Freda brought your moved your hands above your head, using one hand to hold them both their
>The free hand now started caressing your face as she resumed her kissing
>Freda’s kissing went on for what felt like awhile until Elsa came back from ‘getting refreshments’
>Freda stopped kissing and you looked up at Elsa
>you finally got a view of her boobs
>each was easily bigger than your head, bobbing slightly as she walked
>she had big, jet black areolas with a thick engorged nipple in the centre
>she noticed you staring and gave her chest a little shake
>she was carrying a tray with a few bottles of water and snacks on it
>she sat down next to you and Freda, placing the tray next to herself
>you drank some water, seeing your two hosts drinking a whole bottle each
>compared to them the snacks looked pretty small but to you a single chocolate bar was a long as your wrist to the tip of your fingers
>must be anthro sized
>Freda suddenly hugged you and spun you around before turning over
>your front was now exposed to the cold while your back was kept warm by Freda’s fur
>Elsa stood in front of you
>she slipped off her panties, dropping them on your chest
>you looked at her crotch, seeing the fur around her slit was matted and wet
>she chuckled and said coyly
>”Hope you’ve got a strong pelvis”
>Elsa moved forward, her feet lined up with your waist and squatted
>she gently took hold of your dick and teased your tip against her pussy lips
>even that was enough to make you shudder and groan lightly
>”god you make cute noises” Elsa said
>she continued speaking
>”I should tease you some more, get you wor-“
>Freda bucked her hips suddenly, causing your dick to momentarily plunge inside Elsa
>you both moaned at the feeling
>”Would you shut up and fuck him already? I’m losing my patience” Freda said
>Elsa didn’t reply but instead set herself down on your crotch
>she started riding you pretty good, gyrating her hips and bouncing on your dick
>her big tits bounced as well, tantalisingly
>you couldn’t help but reach up and start groping them and her nipples
>you squeezed them, causing little gasps to come from Elsa
>Freda meanwhile looked on leisurely, enjoying the show
>”Freda-*gasp* buck your-*ahh* hips again” Elsa managed to barely cohesively say
>Freda obliged and starting bucking her hips
>the pleasure from being slammed into Elsa was frying your brain
>Being repeatedly slammed into polar bear pussy was very quickly having an effect
>your dick was being wrung out by her and you felt an orgasm start to build up
>apparently you were having an effect on Elsa also as she suddenly bent over, putting her hands (and some of her weight ) on your chest
>her breathing had turned into heavy panting
>her eyes looked glazed over from pleasure
>her claws slightly dug into your skin as she said “getting…close…Fuck”
>you were pretty close yourself
>you started twisting her nipples, loud moans now came from her
>her hips moved and you felt your cock grinding against her insides
>barely any time later you were edging and before you could say anything Elsa practically screamed
>”Fuck!”
>you were all the way inside her when you felt her orgasm
>her pussy walls clamped down tight around your dick, quivering
>the feeling of this blew you over the edge and you came
>you felt yourself unload thick loads of cum into her, the feeling euphoric
>Elsa suddenly fell forwards, trapping you between her warm and soft tits again
>you were now fully sandwiched between the bears, either side intensely warmed by polar bear fat and fur

>"Babe, I'm heading out to work, get over here." She called.
>You already knew what she wanted, your body reacting at the idea alone, cock stiffening and face flushing.
>With a predatory grin, she looked you up and down. Hands on her motherly hips, although as her wifebeater and cargo-shorts were hardly motherly.
>Licking long, pointed fangs and sauntering towards you, one hand popped open her shorts button and worked a few fingers underneath her panties, as her other hand expertly undid your belt and fished out your rapidly stiffening prick. With a contented sigh, she huffed your scent directly from your balls and shuddered, before tugging you into position directly in front of her, she directed your attention to her nethers, bright-pink panties against dark fur, and a bright-pink and puffed-up cunny slick with sweat and musk. The scent hit you immediately, an intoxicating, all-encompassing reek of female badger and sex. She swapped hands, the paw slick with her girlcum and sweat suddenly pawing at your dick and the other spreading herself for you.
>She eagerly teased herself, and pounded your cock with a tight fist and delightfully-textured pawpads. Her slick pussy visibly tensing up at the absence of your dick inside of it.
>All of this proved too much, and soon the incredible stiffness of your cock, the girlcum slicked handjob, and the sight and scent of her cock-milking pussy proved too much, and your balls tensed up and pumped shot after shot of thick, creamy cum. She aimed every shot at her own folds, shuddering with each impact as your cum painted her pussy, she looked like she might cum herself just from the contact with your baby-batter.

>"Love you babe, see you tonight~" she managed to say, visibly shaking and grinding her thighs together as she redid her shorts, before taking a deep breath and strutting out the door, her tail perked up like she was in heat and her heavy breathing still audible as she walked away.
>You sat there, legs like jelly, cock still sensitive and awash in afterglow.
>It was so much better then a kiss goodbye.

>Be you, Anon, son of a regional human lord.
Despite your station in life, you are currently hiding under some floorboards.
>Your father is not a kind ruler. In fact he’s quite the cruel man. He is not kind to the anthros in his realm and he has waged numerous wars against them.
>The end result of these conflicts is on occasion, a few assassins would come for him. Now normally the palace guards could defeat whatever came but today was different.
>This wasn’t supposed to happen, it wasn’t even a coalition of mercenaries like last time or a band of highly skilled assassins like the time before that, it was just one rabbit.
>You shudder in fear, you heard your father was especially furious in his wars against them. You suppose it’s only natural that she would reflect this in her brutality against your fathers troops.
>Before you hid, you saw her from the window. she moved like the wind, and fought like a devil. And at times it was as if she jumped THROUGH the guards.
>The worst part is that now it’s silent, no clanging steel, no orders being shouted, and no pained cries of agony, just silence.
>Your heart races in your chest, you try to calm yourself with the thought of your family’s absence from the palace. Thankfully they will be spared the horrors of this monster.
>And that’s when the sword comes down through the floorboards, barely missing your neck.
>She ripped you out from the floor, and threw you against the wall.
>You weren’t built for this, you barely managed to stand before she grabbed you and began tying you up.
>You begged her for mercy, her people’s death was not your fault after all, she only looked silently at you. Before slamming her fist into your head, knocking you out.
>You wake up some time later. You are tied to a chair, and your eyes are blindfolded.
>The sudden realization of your situation sends you in a panic, you cry out for help, desperately hoping that someone might hear your cries, But that’s when you sense someone else is in the room with you.
>Slowly you can hear their footsteps come closer and closer to you. And when you feel them standing right in front of you they take a knife to your blind fold. And When the blind fold is off, you see who your captor is, the rabbit who assaulted your fathers summer palace.
>You finally get a good look at her and you cannot lie, she’s beautiful. Soft, white fur, gorgeous pink eyes. We’re it not for the circumstances you would feel compelled to compliment her.
>You were busy admiring her beauty when you felt something sharp being put against your neck.
>”I really had hoped he would be there, I wanted to kill Him and everyone he loved, to repay him for those he took from me.
>You open your mouth to respond but she silences you by increasing the pressure of her knife.
>”Listen to me, at first I thought of killing you to avenge my family. But my anger will not be satiated with one death, even if it is his son.”
>”Your father incurred a debt to me so great that killing you won’t suffice, and I don’t think I’ll have a chance to get to him for some time.”
>She lets go of your shoulder and puts away her knife, and slowly begins to unwind the cloth wrapping she was dressed in.
>”Since I am denied my vengeance I must find other means of restitution, at least until I have another opportunity to settle your fathers debt.”
>You speak, telling her of all the wealth you and your family could offer for your safe return, but she laughs it off.
>”I do not desire riches, I simply want what was taken from me to be replaced.”
>You give her your word and all kinds of promises to her in exchange for your safe return but she gives you a look that silences you.
>”Your father took my mother, my father, my nieces and nephews, my aunts and uncles, my cousins, my grandparents, He took everyone from me. And as his designated heir and his firstborn, it is your responsibility to…compensate me for that loss.”
>It suddenly dawns on you why she has kept you alive. That’s when you also notice she walked behind you
>She unties you, and throws a sword at your feet.
>”I hope you recognize what is owed to me, and seek to uphold your word to ensure I am properly compensated.”
>You can hardly believe what is going on, you stare at the weapon for several moments before she speaks up.
>”Confused? Let me simplify. You can willingly chose to give me a family, as a way to begin paying your lines debt to me, or I will force one out of you.”

>leashed by Bea, being walked around the park

>the new situation spawns familiar thoughts, adaptive reasoning props up, nature begins to take course
>before you can adjust position, dark clouds begin to rise from the south, casting a shadow over the scene
>as these cumulonimbi drift further, they reveal themselves to be two, indistinctly masculine hands clad in elbow-length gloss gloves, notedly tipped tenfold by a silhouetted set of grim, flesh-ribboning claws, each partaking the seat of ten suitably sausage-y digits and below them, the thenars of such breadth and depth that they might be mistaken for a grown adult's cheeks
>from these deceiving clouds, black lightning strikes twice
>it's atop your own two barren, blanche cheeks that these bolts find their way, each echoing their own unnatural crack into the local atmosphere with all the comparative report of a mean slap to the rear
>how convenient
>out of the corner of your eye, a red bead glimmers within the shaded silver forest of hair atop the blue-toned grey peak of feminine supremacy, in unmistaken alignment with the sensation of your derrière being spread in the open park breeze

>unfastening two brass buckles on the side of her boot, you were under the spell of a second wind as you mistook this for some laid-back gesture
>from out under one of the buckle straps she drew a finger-length wooden pick, lacquered and carved from dark wood. her entire boot was to follow
>the aroma of something you could only construe as "corny" and "chippy" took your senses soon after
>puzzled, you had failed to capture the sight before you. the tiger was holding her bare right foot in hand
>the source of that smell as you had found, was a set of glistening pink pearls which dotted each toe, her sole being crowned by the largest of them
>the pick was aimed at one of her numerous claws
>never had you observed a catbeast this... intimately?

>Anthros don't know how to classify "human-inclusive groups."
>Obviously, any group that includes humans would be human-inclusive.
>Also, what you'd call a group of humans devoid of other species is obscure.
>Anyway, seeing as groups including humans almost inevitably experiences some broader mixing, classification is difficult.
>Typical identifiers - herd, pack, murder, flock, etc. - are too specific.

>Imagine how weird it would be for an anthro to see a human walking around with a group of canines one day and then nonchalantly walking around with a group of felines the next.
>Now imagine how much weirder it would be to watch as those two unaffiliated, vastly different groups begin to interact due to human influence.

>find the snake watching the news in on the TV
>the headline is that there was another assassination
>on the politician who hired the guy to kill you
>apparently he was found cut in half with a throwing knife in the eye
>you quickly glance at your bodyguard
>she’s missing a knife from one of her legs
>you see her smirk when she notices you looking
>you don’t know whether to be fearful or thankful
>After the whole guy getting his arm cut off and impaled incident there haven’t been any more attempts on your life
>Snake lady (you literally don’t know her name) has been a bit more chipper after (probably) killing that other politician
>well atleast as much as a stoic and dead quiet bodyguard can
>today you’re walking around town after a press conference that you felt went well
>The whole time Snake lady was scanning the audience with her hood flared for what you guessed was intimidation
>you head into a clothing store for a quick gander
>After a few minutes inside you look out the stores large display windows and see a black SUV pull up
>the tinted windows roll down and you see several guns pointed at you
>the stores windows shatter as gunfire erupteps
>Suddenly from behind you are tackled to the floor behind a counter by Snake lady who uses her own body to shield yours
>after what feels like an eternity the firing stops
>you head tyres squealing on tarmac
>Your Snake lady grabs a throwing knife and peeks over the ruined counter momentarily before launching it at something
>you hear more tyre squealing before a massive crash
>still huddled on the floor you feel your bodyguard lift up your shirt, seeing if anything hit you
>after asking if you were hit and you replying no she gets up and runs outside
>you slowly get up and walked to the door
>looking outside you see the SUV crashed a little up the road with the dead driver hanging out the window
>he had a knife through his neck
>you bodyguard was now going to each of the windows and thrusting her swords at whoever was in there
>after apparently making sure everyone was dead she came back
>looking down at you with a look of relief on her face she calmly led you to your car, driving you back home where she told you to wait in the car
>A minute after she went inside she came out carrying your shotgun and ammunition
>She got back in the car and started driving you someplace else
>you had been driving I silence for a little while and it was starting to get dark
>breaking the silence you asked her name
>”Kye” she replied
>you said her name a few times in your head
>soon you reached wherever she was driving
>it was dark now as she parked up across and up the road from a large mansion looking place
>Kye turned the car off and turned to you
>she said she was going to deal with whoever tried to kill you and that you should stay in the car with your shotgun
>you had no reason argue but asked her to be careful
>she smiled and exited the car, running towards the mansion and climbing over the tall fence that surrounded it
>a few minutes later the whole street went black as every light went out
>it seemed the power was out and you guessed it wasn’t a coincidence
>soon after a window in the mansion started flashing and you heard muffled gunfire
>the flashing and gunfire quickly stopped
>then the next room over had the same thing happen however this time the windows was splattered in blood
>this continued happening for the rest of the windows on that floor
>you saw Kye appear at one of the windows
>she looked around, found and focused on you
>you gave her a wave and she seemed at ease
>suddenly she climbed out the window and jumped up to grap a window ledge on the floor above
>she peeked her head over it and thrust a sword into in
>she claimed inside and a few seconds later someone was thrown out it, plummeting to the ground
>it stayed quiet for a bit before the whole floor lit up in an apparent explosion
>you saw that something had caught fire as smoke started billowing out the windows
>nothing else happened before you saw Kye jump back over the fence she did before
>however as she came closer yiu saw in the low light she was covered in blood
>she quietly got back into the car, asked if you were alright and started driving away from the flame engulfed building
>Kye and you made it back to your house without any problems
>both of you headed inside, however she did a full sweep of the house to be sure it was safe
>she found nothing and you finally relaxed
>you said she could take a shower to clean herself of the blood that covered her
>she thanked you and headed towards the bathroom
>you sat down on the couch, still clutching the shotgun and tried to take your mind off the fact that people wanted you dead
>you couldn’t fully get your mind off it however
>you thought about how Kye seemed to be an expert at killing men armed with guns with nothing but knives and swords
>what the hell kind of bodyguard had you hired?
>you opened your phone and found the email receipts from hiring her
>you found that on the contract it said that she was nothing more than a specially trained anthro bodyguard best suited for politicians
>either you had some kind of mix up and had hired some kind of country destabilising assassin or she was REALLY dedicated to making sure nothing wanted to harm you
>either way you were thankful she was around
>Kye reappeared surprisingly quickly
>she was clean of any blood and her scales were shiny
>she thanked you for your hospitality and you said no problem
>however then she asked something unusual
>she asked if you would like her to accompany you overnight in your bed for ‘stress related reasons’
>you didn’t know how to respond
>You thought about it for a minute before answering with a “sure”
>however for now you stayed sat on the couch
>Kye stood by the door, occasionally looking out the window
>after a bit you said you were heading to take a shower
>after cleaning yourself you came out the bathroom and found Kye stood just outside the door
>she followed you into your bedroom and waited patiently as you undressed
>usually you just went to bed in some shorts but this time you wore a shirt aswell
>you climbed into bed, facing away from her however just as you were about to say she didn’t have to do this if she didn’t want to you felt your mattress depress and you slid backwards
>your back bumped into hers and you turned around to face her
>you found she had taken her uniform off and was wearing a sports bra thing and some shorts
>said bra did nothing to hide her impressive bust
>you prayed to Jesus to not get a boner
>her height made her legs very slightly hang off the bed and her long tail was on the floor out the end
>she turned your lamp off, plunging the room into darkness
>even in the dark her eyes still almost glowed orange
>you led down and closed your eyes trying to sleep when you felt her wrap her arms around you and pull you towards her
>”Your heart and respiratory rate are elevated, try taking slow and deep breaths to calm yourself and sleep easier”
>you did as she said and to your surprise it kinda worked
>you momentarily freaked out as you felt something cool wrap around your leg but quickly realised it was Kye’s tail
>somehow being held by someone who not even a few hours earlier had killed what you guessed was tens of people made you feel calm
>the last thing you felt before you fell asleep was her gently kiss your forehead
>Waking up you found yourself alone
>exiting your room you find Kye sitting on the couch once again watching the TV
>It’s the news again describing how a crime boss and like 30 guys were found dead and burnt to a crisp in a mansion
>obviously you know who did that
>you look through your schedule for today finding it to be more press conferences and boring meetings
>you begrudgingly get yourself ready for the day
>8 hours later you’re done with the day and it was just as shitty as you expected
>your just about to get into your car when a guy comes up to you
>he holds some clipboard with one hand and asks you to sign it
>you don’t know who this guy is or what’s he wants but you decide to read what’s on the clipboard because it’s not like you’ll even sign it anyway
>halfway through the second sentence you feel a sharp pain in your abdomen and then a loud crack
>looking down you see there’s a blade about a centimetre into your gut
>you quickly look at the guy, finding him with a pained look on his face
>the clipboard suddenly drops and you see that the arm holding the knife has been crushed by Kye’s tail
>you swear time is moving in slow motion as you see a sword fly past your face mere inches from it
>the sword ends its journey through the guys face
>you look down again, finding the knife gone and an ever expanding blood stain now on your shirt
>Before you can even try to think what to do Kye is infront of you and has lifted up your shirt, inspecting your wound
>”How bad is-“ you try to say but are interrupted by Kye bundling you into your car
>immediately she is in the drivers seat and is flooring it down the road
>if you had to guess you were going to a hospital
>Why the hell did so many people want you dead?
>and why did they keep trying to kill you right in front of the lethal bodyguard?
>did you need another or something?
>once in the hospital you were immediately treated for your stab wound
>along the way you were pumped full of drugs so you were kinda out of it
>eventually you got some alone time from the doctors, although Kye was stood just outside your room
>you got out your phone and opened the website you hired Kye from
>you were feeling woozy so you tried to do this as quick as possible
>you went through the process of hiring another bodyguard making sure to try and find one that had ‘intimidation’ on its resumé
>you thought you found one that fit the bill and skimmed over the documentation
>after you got the notification saying payment had been received and your new bodyguard would be dispatched soon you put your phone away
>since the knife had not done any serious damage you were sent home a few hours later
>Kye apologised the whole way home for her incompetence at protecting you but you kept telling her she did nothing wrong
>once you got back Kye’s hood wouldn’t go down and she looked stressed
>you told her to go and take a long shower, hoping it would calm her down
>reluctantly she did
>not 5 minutes after she left there was a firm knock on the door
>you slowly went up to it and looked through the peephole
>there was nothing there? Like it was just black even though the sun was still setting
>probably against your better judgment you opened the door
>stood before you was a Very fucking tall snake anthro who was built like a brick shithouse
>while Kye was taller than your 6 foot height at 6’8” this thing had to be 7 foot atleast
>it had olive coloured scales
>it, no she you now realised due to the massive breasts on its chest, was looking down at you
>she looked almost..angry? And was holding a piece of paper in her big hand
>”Are you a Mr A. N. Mous?” She said her sweet voice didn’t match her appearance
>”y-yes?” You replied
>her expression changed to be more cheerful
>she extended a hand and said “very pleased to meet you sir, My name is Claire and I am the bodyguard you requested”
>you shook her hand, it dwarfed your own
>she asked to come inside and you let her
>then you got a good look at her tail, it had to be nearly 11 foot long and was very thick
>despite its size it was very graceful as Claire moved inside your home
>she stood in the middle of the living room, her head barely not hitting the ceilings for her tail curled up by her side
>her uniform or rather armour looked like it’s was made of black Kevlar and a few ceramic pieces spread throughout
>then you heard Kye coming back down the hallway
>when she first entered the room her hood was retracted but upon seeing Claire it was back at full spread
>They locked eyes with each other and looked to be having a staring contest
>eventually Kye asked what Claire was doing here
>you explained that you felt another bodyguard was prevent any further attempts on your life
>however Kye’s hood remained out
>you said you were going to bed and walked away from them
>you left them to do whatever it was they are going to as they seemed to already know each other
>you were pretty tired from the day and felt there was nothing else to do but head to bed a little early
>however once in bed you started hearing them quietly throwing insults at each other
>you hoped they had calmed down by the morning
>The next morning you found Kye and Claire sitting opposite each other
>Kye was on the couch and Claire was sat on her coiled tail, which looked funny
>you looked at your schedule for the day and to your surprise it was empty, meaning you could do whatever you wanted
>you would think about that after breakfast however
>opening the fridge you remembered your guests
>you asked them if they’d like anything to eat
>Both replied with “Meat”
>obliging you pulled out some packages of sausages and Bacon
>whatever you could buy some more
>you put a couple pans on the stove to heat up
>you turned to look at Claire
>whereas Kye had lean muscle Claire had more ‘practical’ muscle meaning her arms, legs and pretty much everything was huge
>you turned your attention back to the stove, finding the pans adequately heated up
>you threw the bacon and sausages in the pans, then immediately sizzling
>after a minute of cooking you had a quick look behind you, finding both Kye and Claire were looking at you
>both their tongues were flickering out their mouths at the smell cutely
>you turned back to cooking and soon enough all the food was done
>you put aside a couple sausages and bacon strips for yourself, the rest being divided between two plates for your guests
>you gave them their food and sat down to eat
>you had only taken a single bite when you saw Claire open her jaw wide enough to look like she had dislocated it
>Her long and sharp fangs also extended outwards
>she shovelled the whole plate of food into her mouth and then swallowed it without even looking fazed or anything
>you looked at Kye, finding her doing the same thing, however it looked like it took a bit of effort for her to swallow it unlike Claire
>”Anthros have funny quirks” you thought to yourself
>after eating your food you though again about what you wanted to do today
>well since your fridge was now lacking meat and you also needed a few other things you decided to go grocery shopping
>you told your bodyguards what you wanted to do and told them to wait outside for you
>both headed outside, Claire stooping slightly to avoid hitting her head on the door frame
>you put on some shoes and a jacket, grabbed your wallet and keys and headed outside
>The Snakes were stood next to the house door and when you came out had a sort of race to your car via speed walking
>Kye won however and opened the backseat door for you
>you sat down and waited for them to get in the car
>you briefly wondered if Claire would fit in the car but this was soon answered when the backseat door opposite you opened and Claire squeezed herself in
>Her tail was so long that she had to drape it over itself to fit it in, with the end on your lap
>Kye got into the drivers seat in front of you and looked behind her,
>seeing Claire’s tail in your lap Kye slightly tail moved behind the seat and wrapped around your leg
>the car set off towards the grocery store
>along the way Kye seemed to hit a lot of potholes and speed bumps which caused Claire to hit her head in the car roof
>Soon you reached the store and the car parked was parked up
>before you could open the door yourself however Claire used her tail pull the door handle for you
>you got out and walked towards the stores entrance
>While inside the store Claire and Kye were like shadows to you
>they both kept trying to be closer to you than the other with it culminating in them bumping into you several times
>you reached the butchers section, the woman behind the counter looked like she was terrified
>you guessed it was because she had two big snakes staring at her with their tongues flickering wildly
>you practically bought everything that was on display just to be sure you had enough
>you quickly skimmed the rest of the store grabbing anything else you needed before heading to the checkout
>you could hear your two guards arguing quietly behind you as your items were scanned
>just as you payed for your stuff there was a massive crash outside the store, but since your back was to the windows you didn’t see
>before you could turn around however you were thrown to the floor
>almost immediately you realised that Claire And Kye were on top of you
>after what felt like an eternity you politely asked them to get off of you
>They did however both tried pulling you to your feet at the same same which was jarring
>you looked outside, seeing a plume of smoke coming from somewhere in the parking lot
>you already guessed where it was coming from
>You wanted to head outside and take a look but your two bodyguards refused to let you go
>both had their tails wrapped around one of your legs each
>hey al least they weren’t arguing over it
>eventually firefighters and the police showed up and then you were allowed out
>As you expected your car was now a smouldering wreck
>The firefighters and police told you it was probably a car bomb and was meant to kill you (obviously)
>then some news reporter and a camera guy asked if you would take an interview
>since you didn’t have anything else to do you accepted
>It consisted of mostly questions about what happened and some about your political career
>then they asked questions related to Kye and Claire, about what they did and what their relationship with you was
>you did they made sure you were safe after your car exploded and that your relationship with them was strictly professional
>eventually and to your relief the interview seemed to be winding down
>however out of the corner of your eye you saw someone carrying something coming your way
>you looked at them and they looked at you, they man froze as if he didn’t know what to do
>suddenly he threw whatever was in his hands at you and turned to run
>the object was heading straight for you before Kye suddenly jumped up in front of you and caught it mid air
>you looked at it and immediately knew what it was
>a jar of nails and other loose bits of metal strapped to some explosives- a nail bomb
>and it’s was flashing
>Claire suddenly lunged forwards and snatched it from Kye’s grasp before throwing it at the guy who threw it at yiu
>by some kind of miracle he was no where near anyone else as he ran away
>the bomb landed directly in front of him and exploded, shredding the fucker to bits
>apparently the camera person caught it all and was celebrating it
>who the fuck was sending these assholes?
>not wanting to hang around any longer you called a cab, putting everything you bought in the trunk and getting into the backseat
>it just have looked a site watching Kye and Claire squeeze in the backseat with you
>despite the fact you now had most of Claire’s tail on your lap and Kye’s around your legs you were in
>you told the driver to take you straight back to your house
>once back home you the everything you bought in the fridge and sat down, trying to calm yourself
>it wasn’t even lunchtime and you’d already tried to be killed and had your car blown up
>your phone chimed in your pocket
>pulling it out you saw it was a text from one of your coworkers telling you to turn on the news
>you turned the tv on and flicked to the news, and found it broadcasting the interview you had done earlier
>it had been trimmed very slightly but still kept all the questions and answers
>and to your surprise it even kept Kye catching the nail bomb and Claire throwing it, but the video stopped before the guy blew up
>Kye and Claire seemed to like seeing themselves on the tv as their attention was fully on it
>then your phone chimed again
>apparently you being seen in an interview with Kye and Claire had made your approval ratings with reptiles shoot you in barely a couple hours
>Then you got another text that surprised you
>apparently some car dealer that specialised in cars for VIPs had seen the news your car blew up and was offering to give you a new one with a very heavy discount
>as long as you endorsed them in your next press conference however
>seeing as well you needed a car and were being offered one specialised for someone like you you text back saying you’d think about it
>Before it became scrap metal your car was just a small sedan however it had trouble fitting Claire
>You thought about what car you could get that would let her sit comfortably
>a little while later you text your coworker that you’d take up the offer for the car, getting a reply sooner than you thought that had the address of the dealership and said to head on down
>you told Kye and Claire to get ready to go out again and called another cab
>When it arrived Kye first went out to make sure the car was safe, the driver looking confused as to why he had a snake with swords peering in through his car windows
>once you had been given the all clear you headed out, all three of you once again bundling into the cramped back of the taxi
>you gave the driver the address and he set off
>on the way there he hit a pothole and Claire hit her head on the roof which Kye chuckled at
>After an agonising journey that consisted of death glares between your bodyguards you arrived
>The dealership looked like any other, with lots of cars out front and the newer, more expensive ones inside being shown off
>you headed inside and explained to the receptionist who you were, the man calling someone on the landline
>a minute later the doors to what you assumed was staff only areas flew open
>and out walked a lizard anthro
>huh, it made sense that the guy offing you a discount after this morning was a reptile
>he was wearing a suit with an ivory coloured ten gallon hat
>’Jesus Christ’ you thought to yourself
>he shook your hand and gave you the whole “I’m very honoured to have you here” speech
>he had a thick southern accent which was slightly irritating
>then he looked past you and saw your bodyguards
>he whistled and complimented them which seemed strange
>eventually he started on the topic of buying a new car, throwing an arm around your shoulder and leading you towards where he came from
>in your peripheral vision you could see Kye and Claire tense up as they followed you
>He walked you into some kind of workshop that was not meant to be seen by the public obviously
>he noticed you looking around and explained this was merely to stop any ‘undesirables’ seeing how the cars were put together
>along the workshop is different bays there were a selection of cars and other vehicles
>the dealer walked you towards them and started showing them off with their enhancements
>first up was a massive armoured truck looking thing called ‘The Marauder’
>you politely explained you wanted something a bit more subtle
>he laughed and moved on to another vehicle
>now you were looking at Mercedes Maybach, it looked good but was still a little small for Claire you thought
>you asked him if there was anything that would fit Claire
>he had a quick look towards her, smiling creepily and pulling you towards another bay
>in front of you now was a humvee
>well yeah it was humvee so it was big enough for Claire
>but one; you didn’t want to spend a good part of your pay-check filling the thing with gas constantly
>and two: it probably wouldn’t look good for your environmental campaign
>you explained, again what was wrong
>The dealer seemed a bit irritated but less you on towards another car
>A Lincoln Navigator this time, an suv that was big enough to fit Claire you reckoned
>you asked Claire if she could try and get in the car and she did so
>you asked her if she was comfortable and she gave a thumbs up before climbing back out the car
>you asked the dealer to give you a run down of its ‘VIP’ features
>Bullet proof windows, tyres and headlights
>reinforced chassis to prevent injury to occupants in case of a crash
>a hidden weapons compartment that doubled as a drinks cabinet
>was water and air tight
>four wheel drive that was connected to a supercharged engine
>the list was impressive sure but you wanted to get a close up look of the thing yourself
>you got yourself out the dealers grip and walked closer to the car
>the dealer meanwhile started walking behind the Snakes
>it was a nice car and you asked the dealer what the price was
>he laughed and began told you
>you almost had a heart attack hearing the price but before you did he said he would give you a discount if you have him some Things in return
>some things?
>You turned to look at him and asked him what
>”oh just two things actually. Just two well trained, tall and ‘strictly professional’ things to spend the night with”
>was- was he asking to sleep with Kye and Claire?!
>as if to confirm your question he slapped both their asses from behind
>The Dealer immediately had an olive coloured tail around his neck
>he started choking before he was thrown to the ground and Claire’s tail wrapped itself around him
>Then he had a sword against his throat
>”Listen up you asshole, we would kill you here and now but your not worth our time, so how about we give you another offer huh?” Kye spat at him, her hood fully flared
>he didn’t say anything, probably because the air in his lungs was being squeezed out by Claire
>”here’s the deal: We don’t kill you but instead take the car free of charge” Kye said
>Claire eased up on the squeezing to let him talk
>he said something about how you couldn’t do this to him and how he knew people
>”We kill people” Claire said angrily as she tightened her coils again
>The dealer winced but didn’t say anything
>Kye asked where the keys to the car were but didn’t get a response
>So she moved her Sword to the base of his tail and applied enough pressure to cut and draw blood
>He finally gave in and said in one of the drawers
>you went over to it and sure enough the car keys were in there
>you threw them to Kye and she asked another question about if the car had any tracking beacons on it
>The dealer only replied after she applied more pressure with her sword, the answer being yes, one under the front left wheel arch
>Kye went over and looked in the wheel arch, pulling out a little black thing
>Then she got into the car and started it, the engine roaring to life
>you walked over the workshop door leaving Claire to hold the dealer
>you opened it, the light from outside pouring in as you went to get in the car
>After you got in Claire released him and he grabbed his tail where Kye had cut it
>however as she walked over herself to get in the car she grabbed his hat off his head with her tail, carrying it behind her
>Claire got in the car and put the hat on your head with her tail
>Kye drove out the workshop, leaving the dealer in pain on the floor
>once out on the open road she put the pedal down and you soared past many a corn field
>After getting back home with your new car (and hat you) realised you hadn’t really eaten anything all day since breakfast
>You decided to cook some of the meat you bought earlier, mainly some steaks, for your snakes
>you asked them how they liked their steaks and they both replied “rare”
>you started to heat up some pans like before and waited
>you looked at Kye and Claire, finding them sat next to each other on the couch, they weren’t talking to one another but hey they weren’t fighting either
>Hell it seemed they got along best when threatening the dealer together
>soon the pans were hot enough and you threw the steaks on to cook
>you weren’t a chef but you knew how to cook a steak
>since they wanted them rare the steaks were soon done
>you plated them up and one for yourself
>you gave them a plate each and like before they both opened their mouths scarily wide and ate everything at once no problem
>you dug into your own steak just as eagerly
>halfway through you thought about the day, the car bomb, the interview and the new car ordeal
>thinking about the new car you remembered what the dealer had said about how he ‘Knew people’
>what did that mean? What people? Who even was he?
>you started to feel off
>why were so many people trying to kill you?
>at this point you felt really weird and got up to go to the bathroom
>you only made it a few steps before feeling really tired all of a sudden
>like your legs were made of lead
>what was happening?
>that was your last thought before you collapsed and fell unconscious
>you slowly came back to consciousness
>where were you? What happened?
>”Stay calm, you’re ok” someone said beside you
>you turned, realising your were in your bed
>Then you saw you were being held by Kye
>the room was dark and her eyes glowed in the low light
>you asked her what happened and she explained that you had collapsed
>Her and Claire had immediately called 911 and when an ambulance arrived they explained to the paramedics what had happened
>the paramedics had managed to wake you up but you didn’t remember that
>apparently you had collapsed due to an anxiety attack which was a first for you
>after making sure you were ok the paramedics left you with your bodyguards, advising you got some proper rest
>that explained why you were in your bed
>but where was Claire?
>you asked Kye and she said Claire was just outside the bedroom door keeping watch
>Kye asked if you wanted Claire to join the two of you
>wait did she actually want Claire join her?
>you thought about it for a second
>”Yeah, if she wants to I guess” you said
>”also why are you in the bed anyway?
>Kye looked away and blushed which you didn’t know snakes could do
>it was cute
>she stammered out something about making sure you were ok and how you were fidgeting in your sleep or something
>then she hissed at the door and it opened, Claire stooping under the doorway
>she looked at you and Kye in the bed and squinted suspiciously
>Kye explained to Claire that you had invited her to join the two of you
>she immediately replied with a yes and quickly began stripping off her armoured uniform
>the last thing to go was her ceramic chest piece which hit the floor with a heavy thud
>Claire approached the bed and pulled back the covers
>she climbed in, the bed frame creaking and groaning in protest
>her height put her head above yours meaning you were eye level with her large breasts which were thankfully in a sports bra
>her long and thick tail started to coil around you
>it was concerning at first as you knew she could crush you to death with ease but you also knew she wouldn’t do that.
>she tightened her coils, not enough to hurt but enough to constrict your movement
>it felt oddly relaxing
>you now had two sets of faintly glowing eyes on you
>you closed your eyes and tried to get some sleep
>however after a minute of silence you started to hear faint hissing from either side of you
>both Kye and Claire were quietly hissing in turns with one another, it must be a snake thing you think
>however unbeknownst to you your body guards were actually having a conversation in snake tongue
>”(why’s he so damn cute?)” Claire hissed gently
>”(probably because next to you he’s tiny and can’t really defend himself from whatever wants to kill him)” Kye replied
>Clairs coils tightened slightly around you
>”(Why does he smell and feel so… delightful?)” Kye asked, her tongue flickering
>”(because he’s a human who sweats duh, and his sweat is full of shit that makes him reek like that, not that he can smell it though)” Claire said, her tongue now flickering aswell
>”(as for why he feels so good probably because he’s warm blooded)
>After saying that Claire started to run her hands over your skin which felt bizarrely nice to you
>Kye joined in as well, her hands roaming your body
>having multiple hands running themselves along your body was almost therapeutic combined with the coils
>you tried to stay awake to savour the feeling but it became too much, you fell asleep to the sound of gentle hissing and what you thought were two kisses to either side of your head

>anthro painter who uses you as her model for her artwork
>every piece is a nude piece
>her work becomes popular and paintings of you in the buff starts selling for big bucks in the art world
>it started out as more 'tasteful' nudity, but she's been getting progressively racier as of late
>her newest fixation is painting you while you jack off in front of her

>"Now humans are naturally social creatures, so when possible single one out of the herd before you close in"
>"They have surprisingly good peripheral vision, so approach from somewhere behind them to minimize the chances of you spooking them"
>"When you're within grabbing distance is when you need to assert dominance, so stand straight up, look them right in the eye, firmly place a paw on their shoulder, then make sure they get a good view of you licking your lips"
>"They should be frozen in fear at this point, so you may now gently lead them to the place of your choosing"
>"They may attempt to verbally resist by yelling things like "You can't do this it's illegal", "Am I being detained?!", or "I know my rights buttfucker!", you can put a stop these pointless acts of rebellion by smothering them with your breasts, engaging in an extended french kiss, or offering them free beer, I've found that last one works in 99% of cases"

>The ancient goddess gazed over the burning landscape before her
>The earth had been consumed in hellfire as the gods claimed back their creations
>She returned a handful of years ago in preparation for the return of others
>To find an apostle to spread her word with her blessing throughout the ruined land
>Instead she found him
>Her human
>To him she was nothing more than a normal woman who he had fallen in love with, had a relationship ship with, wanted a family with
>Atleast she was until this
>She wanted to tell him everyday what she was and what was coming, but she couldn’t bring herself to and it was too late now
>When the other gods first returned she played her part, claiming land, building things in her image
>The most important was the Obelisk she now resided in
>She had brought him here to keep him safe, explaining what she was and had done was the hardest conversation she had had in any of her lives
>She hadn’t just destroyed the earth, she had destroyed his hopes, dreams and world
>But not his heart, for he still loved her
>She sensed him behind her
>”Go to bed” she muttered, not wanting him to see outside
>Instead she felt him draw closer, gripping her hand
>He wanted her to come to bed also
>While they could never have a normal life by his standards they could still have a child, a demigod
>And she would keep them safe
>No matter the cost

>"that's it, I'm buying a security system. This is the third time this month a horny anthro broke into my house to sniff the bedsheets"

>the system is installed by an anthro woman
>seems to be worth the price as no one has broken in since
>you get home from work a few days later to find the security system has been disabled
>hear noises from your bedroom
>open the door and find the anthro who installed it on your bed

>on the couch you fell into an uncomfortable sleep
>then you were nowhere
>you were floating?
>suddenly you feel yourself falling
>you’re approaching what looks like the ground at terminal velocity
>you hit the ground…softly? Bouncing
>you realised you bounced because you landed on your bed. what?
>confused you looked up, seeing her
>the anthro lady from before
>she was just led there, waiting
>waiting for what?
>she spread her legs, your nose suddenly hit with a pungent but not bad smell
>there’s a tightness in your crotch
>wake up suddenly with a cold sweat
>you had been dreaming then.
>about that anthro?
>did some part of your brain want to sleep with her?
>the tightness in your crotch is still there
>you can see your pants being tented in the low light
>was she still there in your bedroom, waiting for you?
>did you even want to go and look?
>you got up off the couch and slowly bade your way up the stairs towards your bedroom
>for some reason you were sneaking your way towards it
>each creak of the floorboards was agonisingly loud
>eventually you reached the door to your bedroom finding it had been closed
>your hand hovered over the handle
>were you really doing this?
>what if she wasn’t even there?
>you held your breath and slowly opened the door
>you found her still there in your bed
>She was sat up with her legs bent so that her knees tented the covers
>your lamp was on and she was reading a book
>had she brought it with her?
>she looked up from her book and smiled at you coyly
>she slowly closed the book and set it aside
>she placed a hand on one of her large breasts and gently began kneading
>you stood and watched from the door
>after a minute her other hand snaked it’s way beneath the covers out of sight, towards her groin
>you saw her arm start rhythmically moving
>she bit her lip
>you wanted to put your dick between her large and heavy breasts, to feel them mold around it
>but at the same time her snatch would be ready and waiting
>No
>you wouldn’t just give in like that
>you slowly approached the bed, standing next to it
>you asked her what she was doing in your house and what she wanted
>she stopped groping her breast and her hands stopped moving beneath the covers as she spoke up
>”Darling don’t look so scared if I had any malicious intents don’t you think I would have fulfilled them by now?”
>she was right you guessed
>”As for what I’m doing here and what I want with you that’s easy”
>easy?
>”When I installed your security system I could tell you were lonely”
>what?
>”The decent sized empty house, the cupboards full of ready made meals”
>when had she looked through your cupboards?
>”I’m here to give you some company, as were the other anthros you’ve found here I imagine”
>you were intrigued, surprisingly, so you sat on the edge of the bed next to her
>you asked what she was reading
>she held up the closed book but her hand obscured the title
>”This? It’s just a nice erotic novel I bought, want to know what it’s about?”
>you nodded
>”A human falls in love with an anthro after they talk him out of suicide”
>suicide? You weren’t suicidal. Wait why were you interpreting the human as yourself?
>she placed a hand on your thigh, squeezing gently
>your pulse quickened and you held your breath
>you had to think of something quick before you succumbed to her
>”You may not be here to harm me but what’s stopping me from calling the police and charging you with breaking and entering” you said defiantly
>she laughed before pulling open your beside drawer and pulling out a copy of the manual for the security system she installed
>”take a look on page 8 paragraph 3 for me love” she said handing it to you
>you suspiciously opened it and read what it had to say
>‘Security contractors may at any time enter the premises of which they installed the security system to ensure proper functionality of said system is ensured’
>what?! Was that even legal? Whatever, she had shut you down badly
>”don’t feel bad honey lots of people don’t read the contract”
>you had to try and salvage the situation, fast
>”well, uhh, speaking of reading mind if I have a look at that book you were reading”
>she smiled and shifted to the side slightly
>she patted the bed next to her and you scooted over to sit on it
>you were now right next to her
>below her navel was still covered by the bedsheets however
>she opened the book again and explained what had happened so far in it
>apparently she was about to read the first sex scene
>oh god
>You let her read on, reading the pages aswell
>the sex scene was mostly vivid descriptions of what the anthro was doing to the human and vice versa with a lot of foreplay
>the descriptions were bizarrely effective in getting you to imagine them
>trying to take your mind off them you asked the lady
>”So how did these two meet anyway? During the humans suicide attempt I presume?”
>she stopped reading, lowering the book and speaking
>“Yes, he tried to jump off a building but was pulled from the edge by her”
>you tried to ruin her obviously aroused mood with some serious questions and such
>”why would she grab him? what if he pulled her over the edge as he jumped? How did she stop him from trying again?”
>annoyingly she calmly answered all the questions
>you tried some more questions
>”why did he even want to kill himself, don’t tell me it’s some soppy thing about how he was having a bad week or something? Since suicide is no joking matter”
>her expression was still a stupid sultry one as she put a hand on your thigh
>again, higher up your leg this time
>oh no
>she said how the human had been lonely for some time, not having anyone to talk to had almost driven him stir crazy and several awful things had happened to him over a little while
>her hand moved higher up your thigh, the feeling of her hand made your leg tingle for some godforsaken reason
>you looked away from her for a second, keeping your composure
>turning back you looked at her face
>those kind, loving eyes
>those thick and juicy lips
>What was happening to you?
>She smiled and you averted your eyes
>just let her read her book and she’ll probably leave, right?
>just have to keep your cool
>”could you continue reading now?” You asked
>”Sure thing honey, oh do you remember the page number?” She replied
>page number? Why would you remember that?
>”I have no idea what-“
>your sentence was abruptly cut short as she ran her hand over your crotch
>you whimpered pathetically, the feeling ruined your act
>her hand let go of you and went back to the book
>”Oh I remember, never mind” she said as if nothing happened
>you meanwhile had to deal with the growing bulge in your pants
>what if she saw it?
>had she already seen it?
>maybe you could slip into the bathroom and deal with it?
>or just stay where you were and pretend it wasn’t there?
>you could just start jerking yourself off right there couldn’t you?
>No, what were you thinking?
>you had to not let her get to you
>but had she already?
>fuckfuckfuck
>your chaotic thoughts were interrupted by an arm around your shoulder
>”you ok there? You look a little funny.” She said
>you spaghettied out a yes
>getting up now would be impossible
>she resumed her reading
>your eyes found themselves attracted to her massive mammaries
>each breath made them bob up and down slightly
>you couldn’t help yourself and shuffled closer to them and her
>you were close enough to her now your arm was pressing into her breast
>she didn’t care to do anything about it though
>the reading went on for a bit before you suddenly felt something
>glancing down you saw her hand was slowly snaking it’s way into your pants
>ohfuckohfuckohfuck
>this was it wasn’t it?
>the point of no return
>No, she wouldn’t win you wouldn’t let her
>You shuffled yourself away from her so her hand left your pants
>she was looked at you puzzled
>you had to come up with something quick
>”could I sit on your lap for a better view?”
>great going genius
>she smiled widely and without saying a word gently lifted you into her lap
>she was bigger than you so she had no trouble picking you up
>her gigantic boobs were now acting as a neck pillow behind you, her flesh molding itself to snuggly fit you
>she rested her chin on top of your head
>this stupid book had to end at some point right?
>a while later you were wondering if the book had an ending
>to try and take your mind off your almost painful boner you tried to guilt trip her
>”you know disabling the security system was a stupid idea right?”
>”hmm?” She mumbled
>”what if someone has broken in and taken my stuff?”
>immediately she had a reply
>”it was only disabled until you went to sleep on the couch”
>how did she know that? She had been up here since you came home, hadn’t she?
>whatever the case she went back to reading the book, which was coming up to what you hoped was the last sex scene
>her voice went seductive as she described it
>the anthro in the book was taking off their shirt, exposing her breasts to the human
>then the human went over and started kissing the anthro before moving downward, kissing the anthros neck before starting to suck on her breasts
>The anthro who’s lap you were in took great notice of what she was reading
>as she was slowly using her arms to push her boobs up so that they were now hanging on your shoulders
>then a hand left her book and teased one of her nipples
>you heard a faint moan from above your head and she whispered:
>”help a gal out, won’t you honey?”
>you turned yourself so you were now sat sideways in her lap looking up at her
>”Wh-what about the boo-“ you squeaked out, your voice fading
>”I-I don’t think I can. You said
>She squeezed her nipple again “well lots of things happen that people think can’t”
>you leant towards her nipple and looked up at her eyes wide and voice shaking
>”C-can I?” You said moving your eyes between her face and nipple
>her response was to put an arm behind you and push you forwards
>”go on” was all she said
>you closed your eyes and parted your lips
>you sealed them around her thick nipple and began sucking
>immediately she groaned and cooed
>you felt her nipple with your tongue it’s bumped surface felt nice against it
>then you tasted something and your mouth felt wet
>yeah of course your mouth would be wet but it was wet like you had drank something
>the taste was exquisite, rich and creamy like the finest…milk?
>was she?
>you unlatched from her and opened your eyes looking at her nipple
>it was wet from your mouth but also little white streaks emanating from it
>the white streaks were running down and off her breast, soaking into the bed sheets
>you felt her hand at your waistband again
>”what can I do for you?” She said
>you didn’t say anything but resealed your lips around her nipple and began sucking again
>your mouth was again filled with her milk
>her hand slowly went into your pants, slowly gripping your dick
>she slowly began groping your stiffening cock
>this continued until she moaned loudly
>she used her free hand to take hold of yours, pulling it downwards
>your hand went lower and lower until it you felt it brush something warm and moist
>you knew what it was of course
>you teased her entrance with a finger, causing her to shudder
>you teased her for a bit until she groaned and spoke up
>”think you can help me down there too?”
>you nodded your head and resumed nursing on her breast
>you carefully pushed your middle finger and ring finger inside her
>you began curling your fingers and rubbing them against her inside
>her pussy squirmed against your fingers, leaking her liquids onto your bed
>after a minute her hand that was groping your now erect dick stopped and opened your pants
>the same hand then went down to her snatch you were ever so vigorously fingering
>she coated the hand in her excitement and brought it make up to your cock
>she had coated her hand in a lubricant and was now giving you a nursing handjob
>your efforts on her snatch were doubled, trying to find her g spot
>you must have found it when she took a sharp breath all of a sudden
>your dick already sensitive from her groping you were close to cumming in no time
>you tried to tell her but when you stopped suckling she put a hand on the back of your head and pushed you back down
>you moaned into her tit and managed to turn your head slightly so your mouth was free
>”I’m gonna-“ was all you managed to say before another moan slipped out
>”I’m gonna cum too if you keep working me like this hun” she said with a groan
>not wanting to disappoint you fingered her harder
>you rubbed her g spot with greater force, feeling her pussy walls move around your fingers
>you sucked her nipple again, drawing more of her milk from it
>soon her handjob did its job and you felt yourself release over her hand
>an orgasm tore through you and you bit down on her nipple
>that also brought her to climax as you felt her snatch grip down hard on you as she cried out in pleasure
>white ropes of cum coated her hand and she brought it up to her mouth
>you watched as she licked her hand clean, savouring the taste
>she finished with a smack and lick of her lips
>”you want something to eat after your drink honey?” She said winking
>you brought your hand up from her snatch, covered in her juices
>you licked your hand clean and answered “yes”
>she smirked and put her hand on your chin
>she poked a thumb into your mouth
>then she gently pushed you downwards
>you were pushed all the way down to just above her waist, where her still covered pussy was
>you could smell her musk even through the covers
>you pulled the covers back revealing her snatch
>she had thick lips that were swollen and puffy
>above and around there was fur that was longer and more unkempt that the rest of her fur
>around her pussy there was a large wet spot
>you lowered yourself closer to her snatch, it smelt pungent, not unpleasant but arousing
>”I thought you were giving me something to eat not drink?” You said jokingly referring to the amount of femcum that had soaked your bed
>while you were chuckling to yourself she put her hand on the back of your head and pushed your face into her muff gently
>clearly your humour didn’t stick with her
>with a face full of horse muff you got to work using your tongue
>you pushed into each and every fold or flap you could find
>while your humour wasn’t appreciated your tongue clearly was as you heard her moan above you
>her legs suddenly squeezed around your head
>her thighs pressed against your face while her shins and feet crossed over your back
>you weren’t leaving until she was satisfied
>she tasted metallic, sharp and almost sweet
>your tongue pressed against a spot harder than the rest and she cried out in pleasure
>”DON’T FUCKING STOP” she screamed
>you had no intention of doing so as you pressed on the spot again, another pleasured cry from above came out
>you must have found her clit and focused your attention on it
>you efforts on her clit were definitely working judging by the sounds coming from her
>but you felt you could do better
>you reached around her best you could given the size difference and used the leverage to push face a little deeper into her crotch, allowing you to put more pressure on her clit
>”What are you-AAHH” she moaned
>her legs tighter and her hand pushed your head as her pussy spasm led and squirmed
>she came, coating your already soaking wet face with even more of her juices
>after a minute of grinding against your face she released you and you breathed some fresh air
>you felt her pulling you upwards towards her
>she was breathing heavily as she looked at your soaked face
>”oops” she said giggling
>pulling your face close she licked your face clean of her own femcum, before settling you down on one of her huge breasts
>you felt yourself raising up and down as she breathed
>you kissed her massive breast, the flesh soft and giving
>”kiss me some more won’t you honey?” She said
>you did just that, kissing her breast again, a little higher this time
>she rubbed your back with her large hand encouragingly
>you kissed her body again, once again higher, making your way up to her neck
>you kissed her neck, nibbling on gently
>she cooed above you
>you finally made your way up to her lips
>you kissed her, her tongue pushing it’s way into your mouth
>it was large and strong, easily overpowering your own
>you moaned into her mouth
>after a while she broke the kiss, a saliva string hung from your lips
>you couldn’t wait any longer and tried to mount her like the horse she was
>when she suddenly flip herself and you, so now you were below her
>she sat up and squatted over you, her dripping pussy lips rubbed against your aching dick purposely as she teased you
>”trying to mount the dear mare are we?” She said sultry like
>you nodded, groaning as she rubbed her lips against you again
>”Well my little stallion I hope you’re ready, because I’m not stopping ‘till you put a foal in me”
>you tried pushing her, hoping to knock her off balance and onto her back so you would be in top
>she barely moved before she pressed you into the mattress with a hand
>”still think your the one in charge do you?” She said smirking
>she lined her cunt up with your erection
>you grabbed her hips, knowing you were about to be slammed into her, and braced yourself
>she dropped her weight onto you, your dick being slammed into her
>you cried out, both in pleasure and mild pain
>she started bouncing on your dick, her pussy squeezing you inside her
>you heard your bed frame groan in protest every time she bounced
>her tits slapped against her chest enticingly, milk still leaking from her nipple
>you were a mess at this point and your thoughts were getting muddled from the fucking she was giving you
>she however showed no signs that the sex was getting to her
>her face was stern and concentrated as she simply reduced you to her plaything
>you had break her, or at least cum trying
>no fuck her, you weren’t going to cum like this beneath her
>you reached your arms out, managing to get a good grip on her tits
>you started squeezing them and pinching her nipples
>her milk poured from her stiffened nipples, dribbling down her front
>she groaned and moaned but her pounding of your pelvis continued regardless
>fuck, you had to do more than that
>you moved your legs into a position that you could use them to help yourself thrust against her
>you were going to try and throw her off balance, hoping to have her fall backwards and off you
>when she went back up to prepare to thrust back downwards onto you you thrust your hips upwards
>you stopped her coming down half way, hilting yourself
>it almost made you cum but you resisted
>apparently it worked as she started toppling over backwards
>”Oh shit!-“ she said, losing her balance and falling onto her back
>you slid out of her and she bounced on the mattress
>you sat up and looked over her body
>now she was down you could be the one on top
>you thought about it for a second
>you could climb over her and try to get her to suck your dick
>maybe try and bring her tits together to get an impromptu boobjob that would end with a load on her face
>or simply finish in her pussy
>Fuck it, you would get her pregnant and give her a foal like she wanted
>you thrust into her again and she groaned
>you pulled her legs around your waist, putting her into a mating press
>you started pounding her snatch, loud slaps filling the room
>her eyes had glazed over in pleasure and her hands were gripping at the bedding
>her pussy was wringing your dick now, almost as if it was desperately trying to get you to cum before she did
>you would let her
>she was close and you both knew it so you grabbed her boobs and squeezed as hard as you could, milk flowing from them
>suddenly she let go of the bedding and grabbed your shoulders
>before you could react she pulled you down and your face hit her belly
>she rolled herself and you, returning you to the starting position you had been in
>she started bouncing on your dick again, this time however you could stop it
>she slammed herself against your crotch and you both came, her pussy spasmed and your dick spurted long white ropes of baby batter into her oven
>”Fuck” you said aloud, your soon to be baby momma chuckling
>she led down again and pulled you out of her and your head up to her chest
>you could reach up and kiss her now it was over
>or suckle on her tits again
>you looked up at her and she looked at you
>she craned her neck down and the two of you kissed
>this kiss was more intimate than ravenous, simply lips connecting
>after the kiss you led back down next to her boobs, licking a nipple
>milk trickled out and you latched on, gently sucking and tasting her milk
>she gently caressed the back of your head
>”you better get some rest little stallion, because I don’t think either of us are quite done with each other yet” she said quietly
>she was right, you still wanted to fuck her with yourself being the one on top
>that could wait however as you felt the feeling of exhaustion overtake you
>you fell asleep in the arms of your new lover, still suckling her breast

>(You) recently starting seeing this cute lamb girl
>super sweet, though seems to be oddly into the occult, specifically Satanism
>beyond "Satanic Temple" tier shit, clothing and overall style to match
>can't lie, it's pretty fucking hot
>tend to wake up next her with small pricks all over your forearms, chest, legs
>"Don't worry, Anon! I'd never abuse your virgin blood..."
>laugh it off
>normally she'd give off a vibe that was attractive to you (for some warped reason), and uncomforting to most
>would make it so most people left you two alone in peace when out in public
>now, even while going about your day without her, it seems people tend to steer clear from you
>all except other people who remind you of her
>"Well, of course I've gotta have some...'spirits' looking after you when you're not near me!"
>"Did I mention how potent your blood is, Anon? It's intoxicating..."

>stuck with the stuff they get you now
>and they all seem rather lewd and immodest

>Be me
>Decide to buy a taser for when im going on a night walk to warn off any anthros
>Go on a walk after it came in the mail
>Hyena girl starts harassing me and puts her paw on my shoulder
>I use it
>It hits her chest and it doesn't seem to work
>She starts to laugh hysterically and says “WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE A TASER? HOLY SHIT THATS CUTE”

>"Gods, you must be so scared" she coos as she pulls you into the fuzz of her chest
>you struggle weakly but go limp in just a few seconds
>the smell alone is overwhelming
>"My mom says humans aren't safe being alone at night, like you can't see or something" she continued, unaware of you of your now exclusively internal struggle
>sloppy hyena kisses dampen your hair and shirt collar as she somehow draws you in even tighter than before
>"I'm going to take you home and make you some tea, would you like cookies too? I heard that humans love sweets, us that right?" she went on
>there really was no escaping this nightmare
>you mewled pathetically into her chest fluff and her heart rate audibly quickened
>yet without skipping a verbal beat she goes on, "My mom is going to be home soon, she knows lots about humans. You're never going to have to worry about being alone at night again!"
>you want to cry, but you're just too tired now
>the tea was bitter and the cookies stale
>nonetheless, it calmed your nerves and helped you focus
>you needed to plan your escape, or any effort would be wasted
>the yeen was enraptured by the television across the room
>some goat bleating nonsense about human singleness statistics, and the possibility that some might die as virgins
>why would that even be a problem? you didn't owe anyone children
>she lifted her paw off you to cover her maw, gasping in response to particularly movint testimony
>you used the opportunity to scooch further to the edge of the couch
>the death reeking hellbeast covered the distance almost as soon as you made it
>you groaned in frustration and she responded in kind, falling atop you and smothering you with her awful sandpaper tongue
>you both jolt awake as the front door slams open
>in walks a creature out of your worst nightmares
>over 9 feet tall, draped in thick muscle and fat, musk seeming to visibly waft off it's dense frame
>all but naked save for a decorated loincloth barely covering whatever eldritch inversion of feminity lied beneath
>the floor groaned in protest as it calmly walked over, exuding menace with no apparent effort
>"What is this?" she asked the nervous yeen sitting beside you
>"I just found him, alone!" she blurted out
>"It's a fucking disgrace!" the mother roared back
>"Yesterday's cookies?! Unsweetened tea? You're not even trying." She lectured
>"And look at him! He's still terrified! Did you just grab him off the street?" She went on, seemingly already knowing the answers to these questions
>"Give him to me, right now." The mother barked to her child
>she snivelled and whined, but finally released you from her grasp
>only to deliver you into the paws of a greater monster
>the monster took several moments to appraise you olfactorily, worryingly lingering over your crotch
>"He smells pent up." She spoke flatly, dissappointment oozing from her tone
>"Mom please! They think it's gross, and the news says you don't have to do that anymore!" the daughter of the beast pleaded
>"The news says bullshit!" the beast spat back
>"Get out of my sight, womanchild." She growled with particular menace
>with tail tucked firmly between her legs, and grotesque female erection on display, your original captor slunk out of the living room
>"Finally..." the beastmother grumbled
>"You're in good hands now" she whispered, daring to compare her ungainly rough padded extremeties to your own
>moving with quickness uncharacteristic of her size, she deftly hooked a claw into your pant's waist and tore the front off all the way down to the cuffs
>"I can hardly imagine what it must be like, being in heat all year round" she cooed familiarly
>ignoring your obvious confusion, she continued "How can you even think straight like that?"
>as she peeled your boxerbriefs away rendering ultimately vulnerable, you cried out in vain
>slipping a padded thumb into your mouth, she silenced you instantly
>you were barely able to start squirming before her maw was on your exposed crotch
>it was immediately obvious to you that she was an expert in this field, and you were doomed
>her rough tongue, far from abrading away flesh and pleasure alike, instead was deftly operated to give your needy cock the cleaning of lifetime
>illusory hours turned back into seconds and you went off as though hair triggered
>color seeped back into your vision, and the world suddenly seemed less scary
>you were cradled in the capable arms of somebody who really cared
>you could finally sleep well
>you hope that she'll make good with her daughter
>she cared too

>I'd just been walking home. I was making my way quickly since it was especially dark and I was feeling haunted. I casually glanced to the side, as one does because I'd gotten the sensation that you get when you're being watched. The feeling of being watched raised my hackles & the fight or flight urge was strong I stopped there rooted to the spot. I could feel it, and even before I'd registered what I was seeing, I was transfixed by those eyes. Golden eyes looked gigantic, they seemed luminescent the way that spotlights glow for that moment after they've been shut off for that matter they looked like two spotlights how incredibly large they looked. I could feel myself shivering in place, though the air was warm and the wind had suddenly stopped. Those eyes looked so intent, I had nearly broken my state of involuntary stasis when my eyes shifted down. Only a tiny distance from those eyes were enormous teeth. Canines as large as my forearm and front teeth bigger than my fingers shimmered in the faint light coming through the window. I suddenly felt much smaller than my 6-3 body and just as suddenly felt a bit how prey must feel. I waited and watched and I could see the mouth moving with intent, opening and closing the street light reflecting on those yellow-white surfaces, it's eyes working above them with equal intent. Then I realized (to my abject horror), that it was speaking, I couldn't hear a word, but the movements were clear; it was speaking to me. The movements kept repeating, and as it dawned on me what words were being said; "I'm coming to get you, tonight you'll be mine."
>I stood there terrified, my jaw slowly falling open in a silent scream. My knees felt so very weak that I took a step backwards and I nearly tripped over myself. My mouth trying to work out the word "No!" and through the window I saw that horrible mouth widen, those impossibly large teeth glinting; exposing a large and cruel grin.

i thought about a situation where in a modern realistic setting (except only female anthros exist with a few hundred million human males. also magic stuff is somewhat real but no one real but it is treated like how it is in our world where no one actually believes in it.) an anthro has an obsession with occult/ mysticism/ cryptid stuff. So she finds ways to wrap up her human friend into her bullshit like her using him to try to summon demons or using his hair to try to curse people. The magic stuff would be based partially around human men due to weird horny anthro history. She could be really awkward and might not even believe in half the stuff more just using it as an excuse to fuck with anon and he can be scared to help her while also just wanting to hang out with his cool friend. Then every time shit gets real and they get way in over their head.

>Anon felt a twinge of fear when 3 alligator women who were twice his height and many times heavier than him scooted into the elevator around him
>they all looked a bit unhappy
>Anon pressed for the 52nd floor again and almost jumped when one of the women behind him said
>”You’re going to the 52nd floor too?”
>”Y-Yeah.” He replied gripping his briefcase a little too hard
>after a few seconds of silence the gator women behind him started a conversation with each other about how overworked they were

>at least they fired him it seems

>Anon told them about his interview and they seemed to kind of examine him

>one of the gators pulled out her phone and typed on it for a bit before she said
>”Powers out for the whole block”
>Which for Anon meant he was now stuck in a metal cage with 3 big and irritated alligators
>Not knowing what to do Anon simply kept looking forwards, tryptophan avoid drawing the attention of the gators
>unfortunately for him he could see the gators were slowly inching their way closer to him
>eventually he was basically being huddled around by them
>A bead of sweat ran down his forehead before he turned and asked:
>”C-could you take a step back please?”
>”What? Oh, sorry.” The white one said and continued:
>”since the powers out the heating is too and it’s getting pretty cool already I guess we gravitated towards the hottest thing around here”
>”Oh ok” Anon replied, turning back around
>was it getting colder? Anon couldn’t tell as he was sweating from a combination of nervousness about missing his interview and slight fear of the giant alligator ladies around him
>he also noticed the women hadn’t moved away from him at all
>Anon then gripped his suitcase handle so hard he had white knuckles as he felt a pair of large hands lay on his shoulders
>Anon was spun around to face the women by the hands, and he found one belonged to the white gator and the other to the darkest one
>Anon panicked and shakily said “how long do you think we’ll be in here?”
>the white gator said “don’t know, probably a while”, squeezing his shoulder
>Anon gulped and tried to defuse what he thought was an awkward situation
>”If we’re gonna bee here a while we may aswell know each other’s names right?”
>The gator with the lighter front compared to her back spoke up first
>”I’m Ashley, the white one is Jen and she’s Sadie”, pointing towards the dark gator as she said the last name
>”Anon” Anon said, pointing to himself with his thumb
>”Well Anon” Ashley said as Jen and Sadie pulled him towards them
>”since the heat you’re giving off feels like you’re running a fever think you could help us warm up?”
>Anon tried to back up but was firmly held in place by Sadie and Jen
>”I-I don’t want any trouble-what if they find us in here? Surely they’ll fix the power soon?” Anon desperately said
>the gators didn’t say anything but instead huddled around him
>Anons briefcase was taken from his hands and his tie was pulled undone, his blazer pulled open as well
>”Well are you gonna help us warmup nor not?” Jen said
>Anon tried to say something but all that came out was sputtering and mumbles
>suddenly Sadie gripped Anons crotch and he blushed as he was lifted off the floor, now level with the gators busts
>”Well since you haven’t refused how about you warm up Here first?” Ashley said coyly as she pulled her shirt apart, revealing a pair of huge alligator tits with dark nipples to Anon
>”Y-y’know humans get cold too right?” Anon said in a last attempt to dissuade them
>”All the more reason to huddle together then. Isn’t it the best way to conserve body heat?” Ashley said, gently putting a hand on the back of his head
>Anon looked down for a second thinking about this
>there was clearly now way of getting out of this and anyway he was being offered a chance to have a face full of alligator tits
>Anon looked Ashley in the eyes and then nodded slowly, her face turned into a smirk
>Anons face was suddenly pulled downwards straight into Ashley’s cleavage
>her scales were cool and soft on his face and he felt them absorbing the heat from it
>he felt her boobs jiggle around as Ashley chuckled, saying something he couldn’t understand as his ears were muffled by boobs
>he felt Sadie grope his dick that had gotten hard without him noticing properly, stifling a moan into Ashley’s bust
>Anon was kept with his face in Ashley’s tits for a small while, his dick being groped by Sadie the whole time
>he suddenly felt Ashley’s breasts vibrate heavily for a second, then they vi rated again and he heard her… bellowing?
>just when he thought he was about to pass out he was let up, breathing hard.
>he looked up at Ashley who had a smug look on her face
>”What was.. that noise you were making?” Anon asked but she didn’t answer only putting a finger to his lips and telling him:

>decades pass, and the 70's become the 90's
>a dark image macro in the early days of the anthronet was of a human skull bowl that apparently came from the island, and often spread in anthro forums to root out lurking human users
>despite the island never again being visited, only a handful of truly craven minds could've predicted the fate that befell those poor journalists
>that those tribal furs were in fact mortally infatuated with their quarry
>obsessed with their being, finding them alien and irresistible, the blistering sun filtered all but light beneath the frond canopy of the spiky, armored trees
>their bodies were huffed so deeply, chest, arms and crotch especially amid all that sweat and musk
>the men would be bred for years, and produce a stock of men and anthros from them, some who would venture off the island, embrace society and education and go on to publish award-winning scholarly works on the mysterious island tribe and their traditions

>Get an dusty sheet out of the closet, along with an old jack-o-lantern candy bucket
>With a snip here, and a clip there, boom, ghost costume
>Can't beat the classics
>Costume made and bucket in hand, you leave to score some candy
>Whole neighborhood is decked out for the occasion, some more than others, but almost everyone is handing out candy or left a dish on the front porch
>Over the next hour or two, you follow several groups of both humans and anthros

>Instead of buying candy though, they make their own
>Heard its supposed to be one of the most delicious things a person could taste, made using a special kind of honey or something that melts in your mouth
>Problem is, they only make it for Halloween, and most arent willing to venture into the woods in the dead of night to find and ask for some

>Be living in a heavily anthro area with your anthro tiger GF, Astra
>You work some basic office job, but she's relatively high up on a corporate ladder of a multinational bank
>Comes home from time to time saddened/frustrated that all the men at the top don't take her seriously, and she's the only woman there
>She explains further that it has to do with some dumb tradition, that you really only get respect in these positions once you appear at an office party with your wife by your side, with something signifying absolute dominance by the husband.
>A collar, most often, but occasionally going as far as some soft bite marks on the neck and shoulder
>It more or less meant, "If a man is unable to take control of his home life, then what hope does he have in the professional world?"
>While day to day life for the average male and female anthro is pretty gender neutral, the reality at these top tier corporate jobs might as well be 100 years old
>This shit doesn't phase you, and if it's for her job (and to a degree, her happiness) you'd be more than happy to participate, with her "dominating" you in front of her superiors
>She herself is surprised, being that traditionally this has only ever been done by men dominating women, and that she never asked you earlier out fear of offending you
>But if you're up for it, she's up for it
>To prepare, you started hitting the gym a little more often, so she can be seen dominating a strong male, instead of the lanklet you were, and in a few weeks you had a nice, toned body
>Go out with her more on dates, with her taking the lead
>You can feel some angry eyes burning into you at some of the fancier 'upper crust' places, with some stuck up types absolutely incensed that a woman was leading a man
>And you love every second of it
>After you do some number crunching, you both decide that when factoring in things like a second car payment, clothing expenses, gas, eating out, that you could switch to a job that allowed you to work from home for less money, in exchange for being a house husband and saving money on those items
>She would be the main breadwinner, and you would contribute by cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, and meeting her at the door when she got home
>In doing so, you found out how much you loved cooking, homemaking, and how much you loved pampering her after she got home from dealing with those assholes in the office
>Giving her a massage on the shoulders while she relaxed in the bathtub
>Absolute bliss
>She'd even purr most days
>She even began taking control in the bedroom, being more dominating, getting what she wanted, when she wanted it
>Tying you to the bed
>Ramming your face into her crotch
>Giving you some love bites here and there
>Some scratches on your back
>Absolutely riding your hips into the mattress
>And calling you a good boy after
>She thinks this is all work, but to you, it's all pleasure
>You absolutely love giving yourself up to her
>After a few months of "training", the holidays came around, and the yearly office party would be happening soon
>You were both excited, partially because of this chance to raise her standing in the company, and, while you wouldn't admit it, because you both felt a desire to show your devotion to one another publicly.
>You WANTED people to know you belonged to her
>The night of the event, you had to pick your jaw up off of the floor when she came out of the bedroom
>As opposed to the tight bun she kept it in for work, her long black hair flowed over her shoulders
>And the dress
>My god the dress
>It was a black, strapless dress, with a leg slit that went aaaaalllll the way up.
>You wanted her to take you, right there, and throw you on the couch, fucking you senseless until sunrise
>But tonight, you had more important matters to attend to
>Speaking of, she presented you with a box
>"I hope you like it."
>Gingerly opening it, you were met with a beautiful black leather collar, with her name written on a silver nameplate in a black serif font.
>ASTRA
>It was so you
>And so her
>Putting it on, it clicked in place perfectly
>Snug, without being tight
>It screamed "look at me" without being gaudy
>And you couldn't wait for people to see it
>She drove you both over to the tower downtown her company was located in
>Stopping the car out front near the valet, she got out, came around, and opened the door for you, taking your hand as you stepped out
>This earned quite a few gasps from onlookers who had not yet entered the tower, noticing the collar on your neck instead of hers
>As you stepped into the elevator and heard the ding as the doors closed for the long ride up, she unexpectedly pulled you close for a hug
>"Thank you so much, for all of this, for all your work and sacrifices for me. I love you."
>That's all you ever needed to hear.
>Stepping out at the top, she gingerly pulled you along as you made your way across the office floor
>This place was super fancy
>Like the offices you'd see in old movies
>Wood paneling, tasteful wood and black leather furniture, marble columns, and even the 'cubicles' here were made of wood and glass, with doors and custom lettering on the windows
>It really got across to you just how high up you were if you had an office up here
>Astra even had her own private office with a few of the city, on the outer ring of the floor
>She hated however, that it was next to Caspian's office
>Or as you knew him, "That fucking asshole Caspian."
>He was a lion, and probably the one who demeaned her the most, and took credit for the ideas she put forward
>She was going to absolutely make sure he of all people saw this tonight
>There was one exceptional office that overlooked the rest, she pointed out, it belonged to the CEO
>You were pretty sure it probably smelled like cigars
>She told you he never really attends these parties, and that no one sees him too often
>He shows up to important meetings and makes important decisions, but other than that, he was a ghost for 29 days out of 30
>So all you and her had planned would have to just be flaunted in front of her coworkers and those 1 or 2 levels up
>Speaking of, she explained how this worked
>The couples would come in, the men would kiss their wives, and then separate to different sides of the office floor
>The women would gather on one side and talk about kids, cooking, shopping, etc
>And the men would gather on the other and talk about business, golf, which secretary had the nicest ass, etc
>Except you both would shake it up, each going to the "wrong" side, because that's where you both belonged
>As you stopped in the center of the office floor, the crowd around you quieted down a bit, with all eyes now focused on you two
>There were easily 150 various anthros staring at you, gazes piercing you like knives
>You were a little nervous, but if she was, she wasn't showing it
>"Let's give 'em a show to remember, alright?"
>Without warning, she grabbed your collar and pulled you in for what was possibly the deepest kiss you had had in a while
>It was a solid 10 seconds of her forcing her tongue into your mouth
>Anyone who was watching had to know who was in charge here
>She finally let go, putting a final peck on your cheek and letting go of your collar
>With that, everything felt right in the world, and everything was going to work out
>The nervousness left your body, and giving her a wink, you strutted over where all the wives were, while Astra did the same with the businessmen
>Time to work your charm
>Wiping the lipstick off your face, you asked the awestruck women what they had been talking about
>A middle aged German Shepherd woman replied, stammering a bit, "Oh, uh, well, Nina had been talking about an amazing pancetta casserole she made last week, but, I'm not sure how much you really have to discuss with us."
>Oh, this would be a piece of cake
>Specifically, the wonderful red velvet and vanilla marble cake you made last week to celebrate Astra's birthday, with buttercream icing
>30 minutes later...
>"Really? You whipped up an entire 3 course dinner with only a few hours notice? AND you baked a soufflé for dessert?"
>You explained that it hadn't been too hard, and that you would have had more time if you hadn't stopped to exercise earlier in the day.
>You felt a hand squeezing your arm, you flexed a little so they could really see the hard work you put into it
>That got an "ooooooo" in response from the women
>You weren't an Adonis, but you were proud when you looked in the mirror
>"So, let me get this absolutely clear. You cook, clean, maintain a great body, and wait for your girlfriend to come home every day, bottle of wine in hand?"
>You nodded, and added that you did it all for her.
>That she was the reason you got up in the morning, that her smile could lift you when you were at your lowest, that if you slaved away all day to make her day even the tiniest bit better, than it was worth it
>A silence came over the women once again, before one spoke up
>"Hell, let ME take you home!"
>"Yeah, I don't think my husband's done any exercise in the past 15 years other than walk from the golf cart to the tee!"
>"At least your husband leaves the house on weekends!"
>"Mine does, if only to meet with that mistress of his!"
>At this rate, Astra would have to come fetch you before the rest of these women started fighting over you
>Speaking of, how was it going for her?
>You turned your attention just in time to see her arguing with who you assumed was Caspian.
>"Look, all I'm saying is that it's sketchy as fuck that I never hear about you having a boyfriend before, then you show up with this human out of nowhere."
>"Well you'd have the first idea of who I was if you didn't talk over me every time I opened my mouth, but no, you're just more than happy to take my reports and plans and put your own name on them."
>Caspian scoffed
>"Look, it's clear you hired that humie for one night to pretend to be your lover as some sort of power bid. It's not gonna work, and frankly, it's quite sad. That kiss was some great acting though, but I doubt you have a strong bone in your body."
>Oh no
>Oh no no no

>it's getting colder
>and anthros are getting fluffier
>also means the anthros are gonna freak out more about humans
>god help you if you shiver or sneeze from the cold with anthros around
>getting stuffed into a pouch
>sat on by birds wanting to brood on you to keep you warm
>pack species trapping you in group cuddles
>shoved under shirts and into deep cleavages of bears
>forced cuddles, forced cuddles as far as you can see

>human roasties eliminated
>1 man 1 anthro female monogamous units
>unions are to serve the state and guarantee the purity of said unions and genetic lineages
>human males and anthro females created in the union are to be kept while male anthros and female humans are to be disposed of or aborted
>crush communism
>acquire lebensraum from weaker states in order to perpetuate the health and happiness of anthro x human relations
>the female anthros are technically running the show and are in a higher position than human males but a high amount of respect if given to the role that human males play in breeding and raising the next generations

Imagine an ADHG isekai.
>The most diehard of wagies
>Been working for so long, he can't even remember how it felt to do anything for himself
>Gets isekaied (Run over, fall in a well or portal, how it happens doesn't matter)
>Now in a world of anthros, our protag doesn't really care.
>Loss of all his meager assets means he has to start all over
>Get a new job and get back to paying bills
>All the while, anthros set their sights on him, this guy who can't be seduced
>No time to be horny, need to rebuild credit to get a good mortgage
>And so the wagie becomes the ultimate humie fatale by doing nothing (and no one)

Not usually a fan of video game logic isekai, but I can see a lot shenanigans from it
>get isekaid into fantasy world with monster/anthro species around
>be some poor level 1 bastard lost in the world
>try your hand at earning some skills/levels so you don't have a bullshit death
>run into a high level area or run afoul of some low level trash monsters and get beat
>don't want to die so submit or try to use weird skills like [appeal] or [charm] on them
>end up being fucked by some female beast/monster/anthros
>earn some questionable able skills and the ability to go into some less flattering class trees
>also earn some titles you don't want other people to see
>it snowballs until you don't really have any fighting skills or they stay low, but you have really high skills of like [charm beast/monster/beastkin], [cross-breeding compatible], [beast pheromones], [grooming], [monster languages], etc
>also a lot of titles revolving around being a certain species/monster's bitch, breeding with nonhumans, beast lover, father of monsters, etc
>worse is all the equipment you can get for your class or ones that help your stats are rather lewd
>and the most embarrassing part is when others inspect you and can see all your titles, your class, and the skills you leveled

>Be anon
>Hear about this gameshow that's popular with anthros
>It's called 'Predatory Dating'
>In it, a human guy gets flown into an environment suited for a particular anthro, and gets one day to prepare
>After that day is up, the anthro contestant hunts after the human contestant
>You evade capture for three days, you get one million dollars
>You get caught, the anthro gets to do whatever they want with you for the remaining time
>You are legally married afterwards, and a quarter of the million you would have gotten is used to fund your wedding.
>This makes more sense once you realize there hasn't been a single human winner since the show started 2 seasons ago.
>But boy, one million dollarydoos just up for grabs.
>So you resolve to be the first man to beat the game and get that sweet sweet dosh.
>You look over all the episodes and look for bits of knowledge where you can
>Though every different species of anthro had their own strengths and weaknesses, you notice a few patterns
>1: Though not disclosed on the show, they all seem to be given the initial coordinates of the men since they tend to go there first
>2: Visibility isn't the only factor in anthro tracking. Snakes and wolves being obvious examples, but all of them seem to have an extrasensory advantage of some sort
>3: Even very strong men hold little chance of beating an anthro in a straight fight. At best, you end up against a rat or a mouse, and even then the odds are still stacked against you
>4: Biome matters sure, but folliage density, the overall size of the area, elevation, many of these factors can help you narrow down what you are up against. You noted the correlation of the areas to the anthros of each episode and made a cheat sheet to study
>With these things in mind, you start training accordingly
>If muscle wasn't going to help, you decided to get some endurance on your side, one of the few things you might have over the majority of your potential adversaries
>You hit the books on modern anthro biology, adding your finds to the enviro-cheat-sheet
>Last but not least, you spent a large amount of time learning how to make useful tools from your surroundings, and how to conceal yourself in multiple ways
>All that was left was to get in the show
>5 minutes after applying, you were given an interview with the producer, 30 minutes after that, you got the role
>Apparently they were desperate since the loss streak was dissuading men from signing up
>Something you were intent on fixing
Out of the wheel picker, Boar, Bear, and Snake were chosen.
>The time after the interview was short, because after only two days, you were on the studio floor to do the 'Dating' portion of the episode
>You were given a fine suit to wear and some touch ups during this, to help pretty you up for the audience and your soon to be predators
>The host of the show, a fox anthro whom you didn't really care to learn the name of during your viewings, took the spotlight
>She does the intro to the show while the stagehands get you and the two other guys they managed to get ready to be presented
>You hadn't really considered this part of the show to really matter, so you found yourself a bit unready for the shear excitement of the crowd
>A crowd that seemed to be almost all anthro
>You were asked some surface level questions by the host when she got to you, some with some sultry intonation which elicited giggles from the audience
>You cringed internally every time this happened, but it went by fast enough
>Just like in the episodes you saw, you and the other men were led out while the predators choose who they would be hunting
>You could only hope your average looks helped you a bit here, the last thing you need is a large target on your back before anything even begins
It was a tie between Boar and Snake. I'll do snake /friend for now, but stay tuned for some developments.
>Soon the lots are drawn, and you are officially locked in
>All three of you are ushered your separate ways to be flown to your respective arenas
>They take the suit back from you and allow you to change into some more appropriate attire as you fly
>From what you are given the choice of wearing, you know you aren't going anywhere really cold at least
>You pick out a long sleeve shirt and some thick pants
>For the rest of the flight, you review the strategies you devised and try your best to keep your nerve
>You didn't really allow yourself to think about it before, but were you ready to very possibly get married?
>No no, leave those thoughts behind, right now you needed to focus
>Your eta from drop was 10 minutes, and you were finally able to get an idea of where you would be for the next 4 days
>A lush rainforest, filled with many small rivers and huge leafy trees
>Your flight instructor, an eagle, equips you with a parachute and guides you as you gently glide to the moist ground below
>When you have safely made it down, she tells you where the pick up zone after the 4 days will be and marks it on the map
>She then gives you a wink and flies back up to the plane as you gather your bearings
>DAY 1
>You spend a few minutes thinking of the many possible species a rainforest could mean
>Jaguars, Crocodiles, Ocelots, Reticulated Pythons...
>Wait, you actually know a Python. Shit, you could have asked her for what she might know about the place
>Oh well, a missed opportunity
>Something you did manage to pick up is that a majority of predators in the rainforest tend towards ambush tactics
>So you had your objectives
>1. Get enough water and food for the next day days (You can skip on the third and fourth to eliminate risk)
>2. Get far enough away from the start without leaving a trail
>3. Find a spot to chill in and lame it out
>It wouldn't get you any fans, but you had a much better chance doing it like this
>So you got down to business as soon as your mind was made up
>First things first, you ripped some cloth from your shirt and covered the tread of the boots you had
>That would help you reduce your footprints
>Then you took some mud and lathered yourself in it
>This would impact any smells or heat that you emitted, but would need to be reapplied every now and again
>With basic level preparations complete, you head out towards a landmark to get some supplies and prepare to camp
>You tread forth through the soft ground towards the closest landmark indicated on the map
>It is very humid out here, almost enough to make you a bit queasy
>But you carry on, minor inconveniences like this will just make the prize all the more satisfying
>After hours of trudging along, you finally come to the landmark
>A large tribal styled stone statue of an anthro, under which lays a large pedestal adorned with pre packaged food and water
>You thank your lucky stars as you load up the food and water into your small pack. If you rationed it very carefully with what you already had, you could make it last the whole trip
>Having everything you needed, you decide to forgo anymore dawdling around in the open and set out to find a secure spot to wait out the game
>You spend the rest of the day and some of the night looking for such a place, making sure you leave as few clues to find yourself as possible all the while
>It took some time and a sharp eye, but you found the perfect spot, far enough away from all the major areas on the map
>A burrow of sorts between some trees, just large enough to nestle yourself in comfortably
>And you do just that, getting yourself into position
>You cover up the entrance, and use your pack as a lumpy pillow
>Not very cozy, but it would do
>DAY 2
>Today is the day your hunter is let loose, as announced by the loud air horn from the skies above
>The horn woke you up from your slumber, but it was of no concern
>As long as you made sure to re-apply your mud religiously and avoided going outside whenever possible, you would be fine
>As you ate some jerky, you realized you would also need to bury or conceal the packaging to stop it from rating you out with its scent
>But outside of making sure your priorities were in order, all you had to do was wait
>DAY 3
>And wait
>You heard some rustling around your area at one point, but it soon leaves
>It could be a bait to see if you emerge after hearing whatever it is supposedly leave, the risk is there
>So you don't make a peep, and stay in the burrow for the rest of the day, uncomfortable though it may be
>DAY 4
>The final day
>24 hours between you and $1,000,000
>And they were the slowest 24 hours you could have ever experienced
>Paranoia wanted to creep in on you, but you held it back and settled your nerves with the last of your rations
>You lay there waiting, counting minute by minute, hour by hour, refusing to let your guard down till the air horn that announced the end of the hunt sounded off
>DAY 5
>And then it happened
>The same blaring horn you heard on day 2 came again
>You did it
>You won
>Emerging from your hidy hole like a newly born trust fund baby, you make your way to the pick up spot listed on the map
>The eagle anthro is there again, and although she gives you weird look since you are covered in mud, she soon grabs hold you you and takes you up into the plane flying overhead
>You are given a glass of champaign and an exit interview by the host of the show (Over video chat)
>Questions like 'How does it feel to be the first man to win Predatory Dating?' and 'What are you going to do with your winnings?'
>You answered them as honestly as you could
>"I actually haven thought that far!"
>Once back on solid ground, you were brought back to the studio
>You were instructed to clean yourself in one of the trailers before they would suit you up again, so you did
>Once you were camera ready again, you were brought back on the set along with the fox host
>She congratulated you, handed you a comically large check, and had confetti and streamers fall from the catwalks above the set
>After the cameras were done filming, her smile fell from her muzzle and she shot you a slightly disappointed look
>"Nice job and all that again, but that footage you got us isn't going to make any fans. Can you really be satisfied winning like that?"
>You shrug and tell her that you were in it to win it anyway you could, the method you used was just the safest
>"Fair enough I suppose. We'll deposit the money in the account you listed on your application."
>You nod and begin to walk away
>The money was in the bank by the time you got woke up in the morning, and considering what you just endured to earn it, you figured it called for a celebration
>You called up all of your friends and told them to meet you at your place
>It was a great party you had, full of fun and games, except for one part
>Caroline, your big reticulated python friend, seemed to be in a rather glum mood amidst all the revelry
>You asked her if something was the matter, to which she smiled back at you weakly
>"I'm fine Anon, I just missed a big opportunity with... someone. I would have finally gotten the chance to get closer with them."
>Okay... well, you don't know what that means completely, but you tell her that for every closed door, there's always a window, even if she would have to open it herself
>She seems to consider your words carefully, before cheering up a bit and joining the party more earnestly
>Time to live it up
>Turns out that the amount of living it up you were able of doing translated to about 10 months
>You bought a good house, and then blew the rest of the money on random things here and there
>Perhaps that intense drive to win the prize money was driven by your inner hedonist
>Or maybe you thought that you could counteract your terrible finance skills with a large enough pile of money
>But the fact of the matter is that you were broke once again, with no game show to get rich quick off of
>Or maybe there was
>You had recently been contacted once again by Predatory Dating producers
>Apparently your victory had inspired copycats who used your tactics as well, netting them victories
>This was very bad for the show because the majority of its viewer base is young and single anthros, and they absolutely hated seeing men win in such cowardly ways
>You know this bit first hand, you had the emails seeping with anger (and sometimes lust) that told you just as much
>You'd even received some particularly 'passionate' calls soon after you had won almost a year ago, but those became less frequent
>Anyway, the show was looking for a way to segue into a new show format that would make human wins more realistically possible, but also force some interaction between both parties
>And they wanted to do this by having a Champion Rematch episode using said new format, which would also placate the many viewers who thought you and the others had cheated
>You were wondering what they could possibly offer you to come back and risk insta-marriage again
>And then you saw it
>Since they were expecting huge numbers from bringing back what equated to the major villains in a reality tv show, they were willing to offer 500K win or lose, with the possibility of an additional 2 million if you win, as well as being a guest host should your popularity ratings remain high
>You thought long and hard about it, and before you could psyche yourself out of it, you decided to go for it
>Round 2
>You wrote back and forth with the show reps, making sure you knew just what you were getting into
>Just like they had said, you and the other male contestants would get 500K regardless of a win or a loss
>They would also be offering the same thing to the returning anthros, and an even more lavish wedding fund than afforded in a regular episode should they win, equal to a million
>All to be expected, high stakes for both parties are sure to increase the hype for the show
>But you soon realized the gravity of the situation after you were all signed up
>For one thing, this wouldn't be the same game you know, so you wouldn't have any premeditated ideas or advantages
>That wasn't what concerned you however
>Provided they were successful in convincing her, you would be going against the very same anthro from last time
>With the colorful reception you got for how you played, you can only imagine the grudge she is going to have for you
>And in this new format you will apparently be participating in, you are guaranteed to have interaction with her, whoever/whatever she is
>Oh god, oh fuck
>You found yourself feeling queasy as you imagined just would would happen if you lose this time, and so instead you decided to up your physical regiment and push such thoughts as far away as possible
>Even so, the dread kept creeping back as you awaited for a date to be set, doing your best to use your time wisely
>Then a few days later, your phone pops with a message that was forwarded to yourself and 9 other numbers you didn't recognize
>"Hey guys, everything is almost ready. My assistant will give each of you the individual details. See you soon!"
>A few minutes later, a different number texted you a schedule and instructions on redeeming a plane ticket
>In just a week, you would on route to the new set of the show
>Those last few days flew by, and before you knew it, you were in the limo taking you to the soundstage on the other half of the country
>You felt overwhelmingly nervous, but you tried your best not to show it
>Mostly because they decided to have cameras in the back of the limo, but still
>And then when you arrived, there was an absolute swarm of eyes and camera lenses on you as you got out
>You weren't even sure if there were this many in the entirety of the last set
>Aside from the significant extra attention, the experience was mostly the same as last time as you were directed to the green room by some burly security anthros
>There were 9 other dudes in there already, probably the other winners you had heard about
>Nothing really eyecatching about them, but you suppose the same could be said of you
>It didn't really matter who they were though, you likely wouldn't be interacting with them very much anyway
>Shortly thereafter, each of you would be called up one at a time to do your interview with the fox host, just like last time
>When it came time for you to so, you got up and followed behind the stagehand
>You came out to the stage, and it wasn't the the flashy decorations or roaring audience that got your attention
>No, you expected those
>It was the large Reticulated Python sat next to the host, giving you a sultry smile as you made your way to the seat
>That devious smile sent shivers down your spine, not because of the carnal message imbued within it, but because of who it came from
>It was Caroline
>You were sat directly across from your longest friend, in both ways that could be interpreted, with the fox host in between in a fancy throne
>The host looks to you and asks some questions for recapping the audience
>You gave your answers, but you weren't really paying much attention to the questions
>You were instead wracking your mind as to what was going on
>Surprisingly, the answer fell into your lap, or to be more precise, it slammed in your gut
>"Finally Anon, we all want to know; do you think you'll be able evade marriage with this lovely lady once again?"
>Everything clicked at that moment, and it took a couple of moments before you were able to stammer out the first thing that you could think of
>"I... don't know."
>The host nodded at you, giving a wink and sly remark to the camera, before asking many of the same questions to Caroline
>Her answers left you progressively more and more worried
>She wanted to prove the last time was a fluke
>She wanted to show how much more prepared she was, that this second chance would not be in vain
>She wanted to lay claim to you, make you hers now and forever
>And this made the audience go absolutely bananas with excitement all the while
>There wasn't much more to the interview after this, you and Caroline were soon given the go ahead to go backstage while the next couple were brought out
>You tried your best to briskly walk, but you felt a hand on your shoulder
>You know who it was immediately
>"Hey Carol Beryl..." You say without looking back
>The scaly hand semi roughly turns you around to face her
>"Hey Anon... wanna talk?" she asks in a manner much more like the friend you know
>You decided it would be nice to talk to her about this situation while there weren't any cameras around
>Apparently she had been asked to add 'spice' to her answers beforehand
>When asked if that meant she didn't mean what she said, she didn't answer
>She instead deflected, asking if you legitimately didn't know she was your hunter
>You admitted that you didn't really have any desire to even look at your episode once you had won, especially once you started getting the hate mail
>She gives you a weird look, but quickly nods back after a twinge of consideration crosses her face
>Now knowing that she would be who you are up against, you ask her if she would want to job and split the larger prize pool from you winning
>She seems to think about it for a moment, but refuses while bearing a much more stern veneer
>She explains that much like you, she was swarmed with mail as well
>But unlike yours, it was half encouragement and half deriding her ability to get a mate
>She had shame coming her way if she didn't get her man this time
>She looks you in the eyes, picking you up a bit with her great strength to make sure you are on equal height
>"You know what Anon? All that stuff I said earlier? Exaggerated to hell and back sure, but I meant it. I will hunt you down, I will. I love you, and I WILL make you mine."
>You were taken aback by her intense words
>You wanted to ask her more about this, but you two were broken up and shuffled away by the staff to your respective transports
>You were alone with your thoughts as you were taken to your next location, pondering whether she had always had feelings for you, and how you didn't see it if she did
>These thoughts soon drift towards the grim future ahead of you
>Would she be the same person you know if things went her way?
>Would your friend rape you if she wins?
>And what about the inverse?
>Would you break her heart if you won again?
>Would things between you two ever go back to normal?
>All these errant what ifs poisoned your mind, not just now, but from the moment you accepted this second episode
>Heck, tt was what got the win last time, but it wasn't helping now
>So you would let go of it
>This would all be fine, win or lose
>Just go with the flow, and all would be well
>And so you breathed out your stress and stopped overthinking about what lay ahead of you
>Just in time, because you were already on location for the first new part of the show
>"The 1st Date"
>A large platform on the outskirts of the city, overlooking the beach hundreds of feet below
>On it were tons and tons of props, and you couldn't help but wonder just what they would be having you do
>You go up the stage ramp, the props coming more into view
>It was a bunch of huge arcade machines on one side, and an equally huge bowling lane on the other
>Wtf was this?
>They direct you to stand near the middle of the stage, marked by an X in masking tape
>You notice a similar X next to it
>A much bigger X
>You could take a guess as to what, or rather, who it was for
>Sure enough, Caroline appears shortly after, also being instructed to take the spot on the large X
>You feel awkward just standing next to her while you both were waiting for what was to come
>The cameramen start their countdown once the host arrives and is in position
>"Hello everybody, and welcome back to Predatory Dating's First Dates!" the host proclaims
>She points back to you and Caroline
>"Anon and Caroline, we asked the both of you what you like to do for fun, and have taken the two most identical results to make a great First Date for you!"
>She then gestures to the set
>"In this portion of the show, you both will compete for an advantage during the finale. Just remember to have fun, and enjoy your First Date, alright?!"
>You both nod
>The host finishes the exposition for the audience, then in a less overly cheery tone of voice, tells the both of you to pick which activity you would be doing first
>"We'll be doing the video games first." Caroline pipes up enthusiastically, somewhat to your surprise
>The host looks over to you to confirm this, to which you give a shrug, not really caring which you do first
>The host nods and calls over one of the show aides to explain the rules to the both of you
>You both would get to pick one arcade cabinet to do a set of three on, with a randomly picked 3rd cabinet if you both had won one
>You walked around the area looking at what was available, before finally settling on a co op zombie rail shooter
>These were something you always loved seeing, and you always made a point of giving them a try whenever and wherever you found them
>This game would surely be one you might have a chance
>Or so you would think
>When you went back to tell the aid which one you had chosen, she told you that Caroline had already picked it
>Huh... wait, what?
>You didn't really know what to think of that, so you just continued on and picked out a random fighting game instead
>You and your big snake friend went over to the shooter cabinet
>Absentmindedly, you say out loud "I didn't know you liked these types of games."
>You look over at her, noticing that she dropped her competitive look for a brief moment
>In its place was that soft and goofy look she often had whenever you hung out with her
>But it was short lived, she looked back to the screen and picked up the peripheral assault rifle donning nothing but the steely look of someone in it to win
>"Yeah. I really like'em" she said as she gauged the reticle on the screen in comparison to the gun, "maybe I'll show you some of my favorites around town once this is all over eh?"
>You genuinely agree with her, something to look forward to
>But that would be later
>Now, you and she were both vying for the prize
>The game started soon after
>It would be a score attack of the first three stages
>It was intense, but not because of the competition
>Rail shooters just really got your blood pumping
>This seemed to be the case for Caroline as well, because even though she was trying to maintain her poker face, she couldn't help but move excitedly as you both played
>Instead of the stressful experience you were expecting, you found yourself having fun
>Time flew, and before you knew it, the three stages had passed
>You and Caroline had similar scores, but hers edged just slightly over yours
>Thus, the first round went to her
>Despite having lost the first portion of the arcade section, you didn't find yourself disappointed
>It was actually rather fun to do some rail shooting with another person, disregarding the circumstances surrounding it
>Besides, you still had a chance to win this next game
>'Time Thrashers' it was called
>Fighters weren't your forte necessarily, but you knew the basics to most of them
>And you could always fall back on some button mashing if it got bad
>You and Caroline would play to 2 wins, with the option to change character after a match
>You both picked your characters
>You decided to go with Razorfist since she seemed scrub friendly
>Caroline seemed to go with a snake character called Slipstream
>You weren't sure if this was surprising or otherwise
>The set went by quick, with you getting utterly creamed
>She even almost got a flawless on you, stopped only by a random low kick you threw out
>You turned to her and asked if she had played this before
>She shrugged and gave an innocent look that looked anything but
>"Mayyyyybe" she dragged on in a playful manner as you were booted to the character select
>You would need to win this one so you picked the most unga bunga character you could
>Grongatha the T Rex barbarian
>Caroline kept her pick, with you getting the feeling this was her main
>Fortunate for you, because it looks like you made the right matchup
>You could just barf out damage now without fear, because most of your moves had hyper armor on start
>Which meant the quick Slipstream wouldn't be able to stagger you out anymore
>Your admittedly annoying tactics seemed to be getting a rise out of your opponent, Caroline looking like she would crush the joystick with how hard she was holding it
>You actually won some rounds this time, but you ended up losing once Caroline got the download on you
>You could audibly hear her sigh in relief at the end, and could feel the daggers being stared at you
>She chilled out quickly at least, likely because she had won the arcade section 2 for 2
>Truth be told, you weren't expecting to be out-gamered by her at any point in your life, but here you were
>The host made a minor interlude to announce the current standing, but nothing past that
>Next was bowling
>Thank god for that
>You didn't practice all that much, but you were actually really fucking good at bowling for some reason
>It was fine that Caroline was acting smug as you two trotted over to the bowling lane, she would soon come to learn
>Same as the before, first to 2 wins claimed victory, with standard bowling rule applying
>"Bowling eh Anon?" the big snek said as she picked her bowling ball, "Didn't really take you as a bowling guy."
>You flex your eyebrows at her with a wily smile as you grasp a bowling ball bearing your lucky color
>"Oh trust me, I'm not THAT big on it" you say in response as you get into position by arching you back, "I just kind of like it."
>You break into a little run and release and release the ball at the perfect moment, sending it tumbling down the lane
>STRIKE cries out the scoreboard as your ball makes its way home from laying waste to the pins
>Your audience of one simply nods in a bit of astonishment
>At least, you hope it's astonishment
>She goes soon after, managing to get herself a split
>The game goes on and on, with you consistently getting 8-10 pins
>Caroline isn't so lucky, averaging 7.5
>This concludes with you taking the entirety of the game without contest
>"Holy smokes Anon" she said as you neared the end of the second match, "How are you good at this?"
>It was of course too late for her to make a comeback, so you decided to show her your little bit of technique
>You guided her stance and gave her directions
>But before she went through with it, you had her switch to a bowling ball with your favorite color
>She did so, taking it and your guidance to the lane
>She rolled the ball
>STRIKE the scoreboard cried
>Caroline hugged you with some of that terrifying constricting power she had, releasing you once she realized just how tight of a hug it was
>"Thanks Anon" she said in a pleasant way, ruffling your hair as she let you go, "That was really nice, loss and all."
>You couldn't help but agree
>To the shows credit, this all really did feel like an actual date
>Just with cameras
>You both are told to return to the center stage where you began
>The host is there waiting for you, holding something in her left hand
>"And there we have it!" the vixen says while making a fancy gesture with her free hand, "Both our contestants have a win under their belts, and thus they each get one Advantage Token!"
>She gives you both a token about the size of a 50 cent piece
>It is imprinted with the shape of a running man on one side, and the shape of a running anthro on the other
>Neat
>"We'll come back to those later, for now, we conclude the First Date! Good night everyone!"
>The camera operators give a thumbs up once they were done, garnering a nod from the host
>"Alright you two, you know the drill. Off to the next set with ya." says the host as she gets an assistant to get her a drink
>You go back the way you came, getting in the same limo from before
>You roll that token across your knuckles as you sink into the soft leather of the backseat
>This wasn't as bad as you thought it would be in all fairness
>Truth be told, it was actually something you wouldn't need to be paid for
>This obviously wouldn't last though, the stakes were still the same
>Assuming the benefits of the tokens were equivalent for each party and could therefore cancel each other out, nothing of what you just did would matter in the end
>Actually, scratch that
>It showed you a peak into the facets of Caroline you didn't know about until now
>A fellow rail shooter enthusiast
>A surprisingly good fightan game player
>And perhaps the most important and worrying to see
>A focused conqueror
>You certainly enjoyed yourself, but it gave you a taste of the raw, undiluted desire to win from your slithery friend
>She wasn't just bluffing or trying to psyche herself up earlier
>She wanted victory, she wanted to claim the prize
>Not just cash or bragging rights
>You
>You had already come to terms with this possibility, what happens happens after all
>But it still made you feel weird
>No problem though, playing around with the token allowed you to concentrate
>In no time flat, you were back in the city, this time in front of a family fun center
>'Pattie's Power Play' it was called
>An employee of the place along with a show hand direct you to the back entrance, circumventing the large line
>It did feel nice to be a VIP
>Considering what you did last time, you tried thinking what you would be doing now
>You let out a silent "Thank you" as you walked past the indoor minigolf course
>You were stopped at a large indoor arena labeled 'Laser Tag'
>Oh hell, this could be bad
>With how good Caroline was at that rail shooter she would probably destroy you since this was more physical
>They start gearing you up, handing you your gun after your harness was nice and fastened
>You see Caroline coming up to you out of the corner of your eye, so you turn to meet her
>She was equipped with the same harness color as you
>Wait, did that mea-
>A guy and a boar anthro walked up to you as well, also with the same color
>Was this a team activity?
>The host appeared on the huge overhead screen overlooking the arena
>"Hello everybody, and welcome back to Predatory Dating!" the host calls out to each corner of the arena, "It's time for the Second Date, or to be more precise, The Double Date!"
>She went on to explain the rules
>There would be 5 teams of 4, each trying to knock out the others
>The team that won would each get a bonus of $5,000
>The person with the most kills would get an advantage token
>The boar looked at you, winking
>Caroline glared at her
>The camera operators started making rounds once the PPP employees finished gearing everyone
>Along with the laser tag stuff, everyone would have a camera on their helmets
>While they are focused on your anthro teammates, the other guy slides over to you
>"Anon right?" he whispers to you, "Big fan."
>You turn to him an raise an eyebrow
>He pretends to be adjusting his uniform when it looks like someone might look his way, but keeps talking
>"That strategy of yours was what landed me my win. Wouldn't have even considered this bs if you hadn't won you know."
>While he had been smiling at you as he was talking to you, it fades away as a shadow approaches
>"Heya boys~" the big and busty boar buts in, "Talkin' 'bout somethin' intrestin'?"
>The guy leaves his face blank of expression as he replies simply, "No."
>The boar shrugs in indifference before tuskily grinning
>"Fair 'nough." she says, moving closer to the guy
>You see her hand move behind his back
>Below his waist
>You feel uncomfortable as he jumps up from having his ass grabbed
>"Just stick by me if y'all wanna win," she says, now looking at you, "I'll take goooooood care of ya~"
>The way this woman emphasized her words disgusted you immensely
>You couldn't help but sympathize with your fellow man as he tried to maintain his composure against the blatant sexual assault
>She eventually relented and left the both of you, leaving the atmosphere only partly soured
>The guy looked back to you with what could only be described as quiet fury
>"As I was saying," he said as he took a breath, shedding that underlying anger, "You were a great inspiration for me."
>He glanced back over to that very... direct boar
>"Lord knows we need more wins for the guys yeah?"
>Something you could both agree on
>Everything was almost ready to begin, so you and your team were poised to enter the arena shortly through Tunnel 3
>You almost forgot to ask the other guy something
>"By the way" you say to him before it begins, "What's your name?
>He snorts a bit, eliciting a weird and almost offended look from that boar for some reason
>"Jack." he says as he does some light stretches, "We win this bonus pot, and I'll buy you a beer after everything is over."
>You make the same promise
>Caroline also promises to do so, though in an awkwardly intrusive manner between you and your bro
>The boar scoffs and says nothing more
>"Sorry" Caroline apologizes to the both of you, "I didn't mean to insert myself. I'll leave you both alone now."
>You look to Jack, and after a bit a hesitation, he gestures for you to go ahead
>"We would be more than happy to share a beer with you too Caroline."
>She gives out a happy squeal (Though it was more akin to a hiss) and hugs the both of you
>The boar glares at her
>Mere moments later, the overhead scoreboard comes alive with a 60 second countdown
>Your little group comes together in a more organized fashion as you and Jack are released
>3
>You grip your laser gun tightly
>2
>You tense up a bit, but ease your shoulders
>1
>Time to let'er rip
>GO

Krystal is a pedowhore who needs to be locked behind bars

when krystal isn't hanging out around playgrounds and elementary schools, she's volunteering at the local orphanage. for safety reasons, the doors are locked from the outside. even during the day. this gives her all the freedom in the world to disrobe in front of all the boys and encourage them to do the same.

everything is done like this when krystal is around for the day. chores, storytime, meals and of course, bath time. she's even generous enough to give each child a big hand when washing, just to make sure they don't miss any hard spots. she just can't keep her hands off them!

The idea of being 12-14 and having an older anthro gf groom me while she lives off welfare and uses me for sex until i become unable to live without her is the most amazing fantasy ever.
Imagine being 13 and living in a shitty single apartment while your 26 year old NEET anthro wife tells you how much she loves you while she constantly bangs you. Imagine just waking up at 14, right before you go to school she reminds you to not tell anyone about the relationship and makes you promise or else she'll stop "having fun" with you.
Imagine waking up at 1am and she's still playing LoL and smoking while half naked only to crawl into bed and start feeling you up until she falls asleep.
Imagine her bragging about it on the furry equivalent of 4chan and everyone getting super asspained and calling her a sick fuck, every (you) she gets makes her only more and more smug about how she just does whatever the fuck she wants. She knows at 26 she has no education and no real ambition, all she does is drift through life and her sole pleasures are gaming and eating like shit then sexually draining someone who's in his first year of highschool.
She'll just browse /v/ endlessly and call people dumb niggers while being shit at games herself, she'll go on /adv/ and ask for advice 24/7 how to turn her life around but she knows DAMN well she's comfortable the way she is and doesn't actually want to change.
She'll just wake up one day, look in the mirror and say "i'm so fucked up" and the only way to drown away the voices telling her she's a fucking twisted bitch is to get pleasure by fucking the brains out of a boy who's still getting his first chest hair.
Imagine that.
She'll save up some neet money, buy her underage boyfriend some games or shit and tell him that he's got to keep quiet about anything they do
Furthermore she'd just lay around the house doing NEET shit like eating garbage takeout from a trashy chinese restaurant, she has her license but got it late at 23 and she bribed the instructor, so she drives like shit. To see krystal lay around on the couch watching the same 5 netflix series while wearing nothing but panties that show her camel toe and no bro but a singlet over her top that shows her nipples is normal. She'll make sure her boyfriend also gets comfortable. No long pants, only shorts. If he showers he can't lock the door because she comes in and looks. And she'll make damn sure that any time he changes clothes it's with the door open and she gets to look.
yeah, Krystal is a disgusting bitch. She'll buy that really shitty vodka that tastes like gasoline and mix it with some generic softdrink. she'd never buy brand cola but just the store variant.
She'd tell him how cool kids drink and when he's basically disoriented and unable to stand up she'll just force him down and have her way with him, she'd to do wild shit to him while he's drunk to disorient him more; there'd be instances where he can barley stand up so she just throws him on the bed and starts agressivley riding him, thats when he really cant figure out what the fuck is going on, if he feels sick and wants to get up or if he struggles thats when she makes sure to hold him down as hard as she can and really put him in his place, this will be done as her brain screams at her how bad of a person she is, but she doesn't want to listen so she gets angry and the more it screams the worse she gets, to the point she's scowling as she rides him
krystal wouldn't say that, she'd tell him how much she does for him, how bad the world is outside and how only SHE makes him feel really good.
Krystal is fucked up, she only deals with her worsening life with alcohol, vidya and grooming.
It's a good type of pain, because behind all of krystal's terrible abuse is a type of love and want that she has, she just doesn't know what to do with herself at this point and she's just spiraling down further and further. It's going to get to the point she can't look in the mirror, the voice in her head telling her she can't live like this anymore just keeps getting louder so she does more to silence it, last week she made him cry because she was just angry, she told him how he's annoying and he doesn't care about her; but deep down he does care because he doesn't know any better, she just crushed him and she knows it. She knows when they fuck tonight he's going to be reluctant but she'll just drink before hand to make it easier to do things to him. He's starting to have trouble with his erections, puberty is finally kicking in and he can't stop getting hardons, he wants to fuck her on a physical level but she keeps abusing him on an emotional level. Soon he'll cry when he fucks her, she's going to have to drink extra hard and play some LoL until 4am to deal with that
nah, it's just going to perpetuate. They'll probably end up living together and working shit jobs. The kids future is ruined, he can't be fixed now, and in 2 years when he's railing her in a fit of puberty and rage, when she's 28 and nearly 30 without a fucking thing to her name; who even gives enough of a fuck to deal with this? You think anyone in this situation has enough will to kill or be killed your wrong. This kid is going to be broken by krystal. He's going to drop out at 15 and go get some stupid fucking job that pays shit, he'll continue living with her, by the point she's at 28 and he's 16 it's over.
You can't do anything else, he'll live with her for the forseeable future, he's fucked her atleast 200 times, he's going to enjoy this relationship because anything else will make him fucking miserable. He'll lie to himself and they'll pretend what they have with eachother is going to work. It's not, it's going to continue, but this will never work. She's imprinted herself on him, he can't get an erection any other woman, he just can't. He'll try to date or get away from her but after a week or so he'll be back. She won't even care, at 28 she's fucking ruined.
Thats how it'll be, by 18 she'll be 30 and he's going to be stronger than her, but he's fucked in the head; he'll start fucking her willingly, knowing full well he's feeding her desires but he's at the point he can't find pleasure elsewhere. Krystal will be playing CSGO and he'll pull her off the chair, wishing she'd protest and just rail her as hard as he can. But she's fucking done, he's an angry teen who can't put it together and this is how he'll cope. When he's 23 and she's 35 or something he's just going to accept this situation, she doesn't care, at 35 a woman is fucked, at 23 it's all he's got. Oh well, they'll both cum though, the sex will alternate between actual misery, hate, disgust and sadness to enjoyment, happiness and actual desire. He'll have to stay with her. No choice.
To imply that it's impossible to break out of an abusive relationship like that is ridiculous. Plenty of people have had abusive parents their whole lives yet find the will to break off contact and live on their own by the time they turn 18, no reason to assume the kid won't recognize the emotional and verbal abuse he gets and get fed up with it at some point, after all people can change a lot during their formative years. The puberty hormones fade, the sex becomes dull, the alcohol can only dull so much of the mental anguish. All it takes is a realization that a better life can be lived elsewhere with different people and that kid is gone. Even if he does drop out due to Krystal's influence there's no reason he can't get a GED down the line, or work a trade, or just fuck off to another state and work a mcjob.
Now the sad part is what happens to Krystal if he does gain a backbone and leave her. No longer getting the physical stimulation or twisted emotional "love" she received from the kid she's left alone in a dingy apartment with nothing but her own all encompassing self hatred and plenty of alcohol. I only see one outcome from that.
Now the really sad part is that if he somehow impregnates her I could totally see what you said happening to the both of them. Krystal would have even more leverage over him while pregnant and additional ammunition for emotional abuse. With no experience on how a successful family relationship is supposed to work and fear of what will happen to their child if he leaves her Krystal can basically brainfuck him however she sees fit without fear of any repercussions until he enters full acceptance. Worst end.
But the most important part is that the kid getting away from Krystal doesn't make our dicks hard, does it?
the fact is his first orgasm was to her, his moaning of pleasure, his loud "oh my god, oh wow" as he didn't even properly know what sex is are all the product of her, he won't get that out of his head, especially when his entire sexual awakening is to this. He can't forget, no matter how fucked up, how GOOD it felt. Her larger, fluffy, furry body just ontop of him. Her touch, as twisted as it was; it's the touch of a woman.
How can he forget? He imagines being 14 and repeatedly ejaculating inside her vagina, no condom, no bullshit, a straight up orgasm of mind blowing proportion. His member, without even hair on it, was fully enveloped within her hot warm slit, as he trembled under her leverage, at that moment, her soft, furry, careful, delicate hand would hold his and she'd lean in and shove her long fox tounge down his throat. His mind would blank, in that moment all the hate, all the rage, all the confusion would go and be replaced by our primal response to sex; he'd just forget the pain and feel nothing but bliss. What else can he do? She's good looking, fluffy, soft, bigger than him, she'd just go ontop of him and envelop his body in her female pleasure; a pleasure so sweet and so strong that you'd salivate just thinking about it. His entire being would be brought to repeated, mind blowing, body shaking, head spinning and brain melting orgasms. Thats it, she just leveraged her absurd sex power over him.
He's too young to know better, and when he learns better he'll just resign himself to it, worse relationships are out there and deep down they feel some sort of connection. He'll learn to just live with it, the sex will still be the best thing ever, no matter how old she gets; he'll always remember his sexual awaking, his virginity being taken, his manhood being made, his mindblowing orgasms were all to her. No other woman can do it to him. She's etched into his mind. Oh well. Best to throat fuck her to make himself feel better.
I mean look at her.
Even in her dilapidated NEET state she's a fucking stunner. Krystal is a goddamn 10/10 on a bad day. That cloudy white fur, that ocean blue fur, those big sexy eyes. Her huge fluffy tail, her massive breasts that a young boy would have trouble even fitting his hands half around and of course, the greatest of all, her most amazing feature, her true beautify, her vagina. Her slit. Her sex. Her tight, warm, inviting, enveloping, soft, wet pussy.
She knew how to have sex, you know that right? You know what a girl who knows how to fuck will do to you? A porn star would fucking fall apart under her force. A fucking chad would fall apart and simp for him like the saddest beta male. Yet here she is, with a young boy completely under her thumb. You know she loved to straddle? You know that right? Krystal isn't stupid, just lazy, she'd go ontop, he'd already be hard and thats when it happens. What is "it"? What do you fucking think? She'd clench that pussy, that amazing, already tight pussy and completely cover his member. He didn't even know what the fuck to do. He'd bust in a fucking stroke and be rendered immobile for the next hour. Thats what Krystal would do, she'd fucking do that. Yeah - theres a reason he didn't leave. Thats the fucking reason, yeah she'd a manipulative bitch, yeah it's fucked up, but when you see the most drop dead gorgeous vixen and you KNOW she's going to fuck you, she WILL fuck YOU. Thats whats going to happen, he stayed there, with her, through all this, because she's going to fucking break you with that body, that pussy, that sweet touch. So criticize him all you want - but she gave him pleasure we'll never know of. Life isn't fair, his isn't fair, but the sex was beyond anything we'll ever know and thats why he put up with that hell, because in that hell? There was heaven too.
So yeah. They end up living together. By 16 he's just fucking over it. He doesn't want to think about the pain. Krystal is a fucked up bitch, a really twisted bitch. But he can love her, even hitler had a fucking wife. He's going to turn to her one day and realize "there has to be love here". They'll have a conversation about what she did to him and he's going to rationalize it somehow, no matter what, the sex, the intimacy, it was just too fucking good. She just fucks too well, she's just too damn sexy and he's a man and us men have gone to fucking great lengths to get a woman, let alone fucking Krystal.
By 17, he's at work, making some sort of a living and when he gets home she's made him a home cooked meal of ramen; which she made wrong. He's going to get over it, too bad, people get worse cards dealt in life. He'll forgive her and she'll eventually pull her shit a bit together, get a part time job. He's going to turn to her, see her amazing looks, insanely well crafted body and of course; above all else; her amazing fur - that soft, fluffy fur. He'll finally say, "I love you" and mean it. He'll actually love her and he's going to go to work, put money in the bank and they'll make a living, a lower-middle class living, but fuck, she's Krystal. She's fucking Krystal.
He's going to come to work, look in her eyes and feel love, that heart pounding love, her giant blue eyes will light up when he sees her. They'll really glow. She's just put all the abuse she gave him to the back of her mind. She'll think he actually is loved, and so he will think the same to him.
tl;dr she fucks too good.
The fact is that women, especially large fluffy women will always have power over us, power that they can use and will abuse. Our lonely male brains just can't stand up to the sexual desire built into them and the defininitive need for mateship.
Thats something that krystal always knew, even as a young teen her boyfriend acted just as she wanted. It must be terrible to be dominated by an anthro girl; having them completely control every aspect of your life that they want, what else do you do? she's literally a loser, a NEET who crashed out of society with no actual skills and yet she towers over this young boy like a skyscraper over a bungalow. I can only imagine how helpless he'd feel, waking up everyday and having no idea what a normal healthy relationship is like, constantly falling between extreme pleasure and extreme guilt. She'd wreck his nerves with anticipation on both sides, she'd make him tremble awaiting the mind breaking pleasure that is sexual intercourse with such a luscious beast; only to contrast it with the literal mental hell that is emotional abuse.
Krystal should be proud of herself in a way, to exert such force over a boy, make him completely helpless, turn his sexual desires into a leverage so strong it breaks him, thats an achievment. When she's not wasting her fucking stupid life playing games or browsing /v/, krystal will just be idly looking at porn; seeing for anything interesting to try out on her pet. There are times where she'll look at the most hardcore shit, the most weird fantasy garbage the internet has to offer and then, on a whim, start doing it to him; lets not go down that rabbit hole though. Nobody wants to discuss when she went through her breastfeeding phase, where she'd shove her gigantic tits in his mouth during sex and force him to suck on them and call her 'mommy' over and over, really good way to fuck up a kid. well fuck him up even more.
I don't want you all to feel endless sympathy over this young boy that krystal puts under her control. Firstly, he's a guy, a young guy, but a guy and he knows what guys want, don't think he's staying with her for the free accommodation. We can cry about mental trauma and emotional abuse and all this new age buzzword crybaby shit but the fact is she fucks him atleast three times a week, even more when she's in heat. I'd love to hear the endless stream of criticism of how evil she is and how she doesn't care about him and yadda yadda yadda, doesn't she care about him when she sticks her long wen fox tongue all the way in his adolescent mouth? She basically chokes him what that thing, it's absurd, the damn kid can hardly breathe!
Oh, I'm sure thats a form of abuse, yeah, young boys don't want sex, they want to go to school 8 hours a day and learn algebra for some reason. Yeah the mental abuse of being bullied and hating school and being rejected by girls is so rare isn't it? Perhaps thats why he stayed with Krystal, he knows her and he always will, she's an open and shut case, stay with me and you get sex; endless sex with a deranged yet beautiful fox, but still sex that compares to no other. I can't wait for the endless line of complaints about how Krystal treats this boy from the range of asshats who think he'd be better off with divorced parents or in a foster home; that'll do wonders for a kid, they'd probably abuse him too except this time he cant get his cock shoved inside fox pussy every other day.
So please spare the endless criticism of Krystal, she's a lazy NEET bitch whos grooming a child, okay, thanks for the update, but it's an anthro dominated world and she's just doing what anthro girls do - let human men know the place they hold - a place directly under the thumb of completely deranged blue fox.
To see Krystal's fattened cow tits in action; sodomizing a small child's mouth and welling up his throat with hot, wicked milk. Her other breast, at constant odds with its twin for seeing which can be drained first, hangs lowly atop the boy's bare stomach and chest, the stiff pink gem atop its peak brushing his smooth skin to developing goosebumps. This wasn't her child, yet this blue fox's inner whore hungered for the passion of motherhood, as if such a sick, broken soul deserved the honor of begetting life itself, rather than the stimuli of lubricating her soft hand in cheap, expired lubricant and gliding its clenched form upon an unwashed, underage penis; oh how she loved that smell, when his pants were removed for another exchange between lovers, the scent of dirty shota spunk-stench assaulted the room, accumulated from years of unwashed clothes and no functioning shower. That odor brought drool to Krystal's mouth, without fail. Her nipples would stand at fierce attention, her devilish pussy would drip and pulse. She needed it. He needed it, he needed his "blockages" removed. Daily. Hourly. Krystal knew it was the only way he could hope to grow up strong, and many of her waking hours were thoughtfully spent devising new ways to alleviate her wonderful little roommate.
So much sucking, rubbing, slicking, drinking. Krystal's favorite activities. Spent in wet, hazy filth.
this is what nobody wants to talk about, she's already imprinted on him, her moans, smells, touch, feeling, everything is burned into his brain.
Do tell me how we can now 'save' this boy? She lives in his head rent free. He can't just 'stop' thinking about her, thats not how this works. Thats not how men work, even if we magically 'remove' him from her apartment and take him elsewhere; tell me how he gets fixed?
Shes had her way with him for atleast a year now, she has violated him in every manner. Who did he lose his virginity to? His first blowjob? His first orgasm? His first kiss? His first "I love you"? Who did this all occur with?
Oh and we'll just pretend she wont live in his brain, his heart, his loins 24/7 once he's away from her. What a joke. You can't do this, lets be honest with ourself; it just doesn't "happen". People can't just wake up one day and deprogram a large portion of the life they lived because they want to. She is literally a part of his life and who he is, the part that moans as he ejaculates, the part that laid in bed cuddling post orgasm; yeah that part.
Do we know what wet dreams are? Those things teenagers have constantly, we know about precum and ejaculation as one sleeps? You know she makes him sleep naked right? He's woken up to her lapping up his ejaculate that occured during his hazy teen dreams of pleasure, he's woken up to her long, wet, warm fox tongue running up and down his hairless crotch, a tongue that reaches from penis to belly. That is an actual event that has occurred more times than anyone here can count.
So lets be honest, we aren't going to "fix" this scenario by pulling these two apart. We get this kid away and he'll lose his mind, because he falls asleep hugging a wonderful fluffy woman that pleasured endlessly. The world isn't perfect and we can't right every wrong - so lets really fix this scenario by accepting it as it is. Krystal now has a husband and he's 14. That's it, he's hers now.
So there we have it, he's 14 and he belongs to her. If we really want to fix this whole scenario we can take them to couples therapy, not some bullshit moralistic legal intervention where we send her to rot in jail and send him into our broken childcare system which will probably ruin him more.
We're going to sit them both down and accept the reality of the situation, Krystal needs to get a job doing something, anything, bag groceries, mop floors, just get a job you bitch. "For god sakes Krystal clean up the fucking apartment, it's a pigsty; fucking mouldy food is in the fridge 3 months later." See? These are actual solutions to this problem. Next we take her husband and teach him how to take care of himself, how to properly cook and clean for himself, how to communicate, how to express himself - you know things you have to do growing up.
We're not going to talk about the fact his voice hasn't broken, we won't talk about the fact his balls haven't dropped (although they routinely drop into Krystal's mouth when she blows him] and we sure as hell won't talk about the fact he's been getting chronically molested since he was 13, we can't change that. This has happened, we know it's happened, we can sit here and talk over and over and over in detail about has happened. Okay? We can get as graphic as we want and bother people with all the twisted details of a 26 year old fox that has chronically and habitually touched and molested a 14 year old boy, these things happen. If I could turn back time and change what happened to this boy I would - but it's not that simple, so we have to sit here and face what's happened. We need to sit here and discuss whats happened and work through it; reality has set in that we need to keep these two together and try to salvage some form of a relationship because if we don't it's going to get worse, you know it and I know it.

In the future anthrostate, all human males aged 5-15 are to be assigned specialty care anthros as per selections made during their youth to fulfill the roles of parent, sibling and mate. In the future anthrostate, all human births shall be regulated and no stray male ejaculation shall go uncounted. Underage boys will be the breeders of tomorrow; their pure, young seed being regarded as precious, definitively fecund and worth its weight in gold. They will then be retired to the mass internal workforce at 16, not retiring until 66. Kid and teen cocks are to be milked by their government guardians no less than 5 times daily and their semen is to then be packeted and sent off to one of the many breeding and maternal sanctuaries, where a select portion of the anthro female population are employed for their mass insemination of child cum and eventual deliverance of many strong, fertile and resourceful human males.
Human females and anthro male infants are euthanized on the spot. Obviously.
Such old words like molestation, rape and abuse were naturally retired to better suit this beautiful new world, where engaging in sudden public coitus with human boys is encouraged and lonely wombs are to be put to quick use, and rewarded with good marks on that anthro's social credit. No adult anthro shall leave the Earth without at least ten hot, thick kiddie loads basting her velvet walls. Without fondly and directly recalling the smell of unwashed little dicklets and the sweetness of swashing one complementary load between their pearly whites as a refresher. Before he shall turn ten, each walking sperm reservoir shall sire ten times as many offspring, all for the better of the anthrostate.
And then one day the entire planet was destroyed by aliens. Nobody was ever quite sure why.

had some ideas and figure people would get a kick out of
>magical human boys fighting villains/monsters
>same basic idea as the magical girl anime/manga, but with human boys and anthro women
>pervy mascot/sidekick creatures that are female and mess with their magical boy
>transformation scenes into cutesy and lewd outfits they have to fight in
>villains and monsters of the week are anthro women and more monstrous anthro beast women
>kicker is the human boys need to be virgins to be able to become/be selected to be magical boys
>they lose their powers with their virginities
>also the villainesses and monster beast women gain power from taking magical boy's virginities
>so throw in shenanigans of magical boys being beaten and snu snud and also situations of them in normal modes trying not to lose their v-cards to regular anthro girls/women too
>maybe some fun of some of the villains/monsters being the boy's teachers, anthro step siblings, friends, etc as their alter egos they turn into
>fantasy setting similar to monster girl quest world
>all monsters are anthro beastkin
>they're all only female and need human males to breed
>this causes the male population to be keep on strict watch and locked from becoming certain jobs due to risk of being snatched by beast women
>of course some men/boys can't resist the beastly temptation and freedom from their society
>sneaking off to into furry/scaly/feathery/etc arms to be fucked and loved into a stupor
>also cause the local beastkin population to take a sudden spike
>leaving their windows open and unlocked for some nocturnal predators to prey on them
>sneaking off to the "dangerous" parts of a forest
>strolling near ponds/rivers/streams where some lustful eyes can be scene spying from the water
>leaving treats in the basement to encourage burrowing species to open a tunnel there
>skinny dipping in the ocean hoping for swimming partner
>etc

Imagine working at place with a bunch on anthro women and hearing them talking about wanting a stay at home human husband/boytoy. About how he should be at the den safe and cozy keeping it warm for when she comes home. How she would fuck him into the ground after coming home from work and such. Pretty sure they're playing up more since they know you're around and some other human guys in earshot.
Course I can some jobs where the anthro women want to get the human guys working there with them since it opens opportunities to molest and/or ogle at them.

is there a green or a story of an anthro cult leader?
would be a pretty interesting concept.
like a religion where they are obsessed and love humies and regularly kidnap them in mass to be married off to the other cultists.
getting a subservient humie husband could be some sort of reward for being obedient and faithful.
the cult consists of a variety of different anthros.
but sadly the leader of the cult herself has not yet found her destined husband.
not until now...

It must be so hard, being a bear in heat. Your breasts are painful and heavy, your womanhood permanently quivering in unfulfilled warmth. Your brain is a sea of sick cravings. And as the ache for dick creeps further over you, taking men in the night ceases to to fill the void. The prey must be easier.
You need weaker, younger meat.
You need boys.
First it was *just* one, then three. Five. Who was counting after twenty, really. So much young seed, easy lays, so many undropped little orbs drained. Such precocious little boys with ravenous appetites, appeased by the silk flowing from the onyx buds atop your chest and signing off on another evening spent in illegal satisfaction, as your paws made sweet love to the precious three inch cock of a child driven to stay your milky tides for good, the squelching of his thrice-ejaculate smeared pecker breaking the silence of the spectating forest night.

>FROM; DR. [REDACTED]
>TO: [REDACTED]
>SUBJECT: STATUS REPORT, PROJECT TESTRUS, CLINICAL TRIAL 69
>I am pleased to report that this has been our most successful trial yet. TESTRUS-69B has surpassed all our expectations, including a few we didn't even have.
>All 30 test subjects have taken to the serum with no complications, and the first benefits started appearing no less than 24 hours after ingestion, among them being:
>Enhancement of olfactory receptors, leading to test subjects becoming sensitive to female anthro pheormones, leading to:
>Changes in behavior. Subjects become far more docile and obedient upon sensing a female anthro's musk. (even our most rebellious test subject became as needy and eager to please as a pup)
>Increased sensitivity to touch by anthro females (a simple pat on the head is enough to make their knees shake and induce erections, leading to my next finding)
>Increase in libido and complete elimination of refractory period. Not only did test subjects display no signs of weakening, in either erections or energy levels after 5 rounds, but many in fact begged to continue. After the 15th consecutive round, we had to call in a few girls from the security teams to help out.
>500% increase in ejaculatory output and what I can only describe as "hyper virility".
>5.0ml alone contained a sperm cell count reaching into the tens of billions. And these boys are each shooting enough to fill a milk jug. Suffice to say, every woman who partook in the breeding trials is now very much pregnant.
>In addition to this report I have included video files from our trial recordings. Up to 15 hours of footage. I'm sure will find their contents very enlightening.
>In conclusion, clinical trial 69 has been a resounding success. TESTRUS-69B is perfect. No side effects. No mutations. Just happy, horny, obedient little humans, each with enough seed to knock up every woman on the planet a hundred times over. All that is needed now is your approval and we can begin mass production as soon as we can.
>On a more personal note, I would like to say that it has been an honor and a privilege to work on this groundbreaking project. The boys you've provided for my team have been a delight to work with, and tasting the fruits of our labors is the greatest joy I will ever know.

>gesturing you to look at something outside you moved closer
>down in the dimly lit street you could just make out a pair of scruffy uniformed officers moving shiftily towards the apartment complex
>one of them adjusted her undersized jacket, flashing some stripped fur as her tits popped out. the other laughed. the very distinctive whooping laugh of a hyena, before getting a swift clip on the ear.
>"i don't think those yeens are with witness protection, grab what you need and i'll get you someplace safer stud"
>the door buzzer went off, someone wanted into the complex
>it buzzed again and again

>Have cute little hummingbird friend
>You feed her a thimbleful of sweet water every day and in return she gives you neat stuff she finds around the forest, loose coins, buttons, shiny rocks, etc.
>One night you forget to close your window and she flutters in
>Sneaks up on you sleeping on your back
>Takes her sword made out of a pin and lightly scrapes your neck causing you to wake up
>"Listen here humie, y-your mine now. If you resist I'm gonna poke my sword through your spine. Now get up and get dressed, we're going into town in the morning a-and you're going to show all those big anthros that I claimed you!"
>By big anthros she means practically any anthro that isn't her own species
>The nervousness in her voice indicates her threats are hollow, but damn if you're going to deny her an opportunity to feel big for once

the gun was too big, and the orange jumpsuit he wore was too small, but at least the shock collar was a good fit on him
>the lithe boy was obviously intimidated by the weapon and the cold atmosphere of the room, and seemed dismayed that he couldn't hit a single target
>All those credits installing a laser proof firing range on the ship, and the little shit manages to shot the ceiling above him
>"You said you were strong, boy. You'll never be a man, let alone one of us, at this rate if you can't even hold a gun."
>The boy stiffened, on the verge of tears but the vixen behind him kept her cold, stern composure as she glared at him with foreign green eyes
>"I scouted a fluke that burnt another cartridge. Fara's bitching will be endless. Put the gun down, pup. You don't break team property and get away with it."
>Slowly, he put the gun on the shelf and glanced at the blue fox, face streaming with tears and eyes wide and red. His legs were frozen, like a deer in headlights.
>"Move! We're going back into the interrogation room. Fucking males..."
>The boy began to shiver, still unmoving as his breathing grew rapid
>Krystal then began to stomp towards him, scowling in frustration
>He flinched and turned his gaze down
>"Idiot boy. At least you're fun."
>Tightly gripping his arm, digging her claws into him with one paw and with the other pressed down on an earpiece
>"Fay, prep the theater's camer- oh! You've set them all up! And youve already set my toys, too? The electric ones! You know me too well. Love you sweetie."
>Krystal's sweet additude faded as soon as she glanced down at her little failure
>The boy sobbed as she gripped harder, but she smirked as she felt his warm blood running down her paw

>Be in the park
>Catch a female wolf traficking a underage male in public without anyone seeing
>Tell the local police about it

>Your anthro mother is a bitter alcoholic.
>She's drunk, all day every day.
>During your early youth she neglected you but still kept you fed and housed.
>But as the years pass and you grow, she's becoming increasingly unstable.
>She has a horrible reputation, she’s quick to anger and overall incredibly unpleasant, people generally avoid her.
>It doesn’t help that she hasn’t gotten any since your dad left years ago.
>As you approach your teenage years, she starts sexually abusing you.

>cat girl wants to claim me

>”It has very specific instructions to make sure its delivered directly into your hands.”
>”Naked? Haha, You’ll never guess how hot it gets in those trucks…”

>be human resources bitch (literally)
>anon only shows up to half the team meetings and none of the company social events you plan
>can't do shit because he's one of the few people who actually gets any work done

>Go to new job at a Human Protection Agency
>All your coworkers just look at cute videos of humans, awwing at them all day
>Feel like they just took the job so they can "save" a poor humie and claim him
>They are great when there are signs of abuse, but they don't seem to care at all about the paperwork or the day to day maintenance, only doing these things when their boss starts breathing down their necks
>You know, doing anything that is actually considered work
>Now that you work here, the anthros seem to have added sexual harassing you to their schedule
>Boss isn't happy

>anthros giving little human boys stuffed animals based on their species
>make cute and soft so they want to keep hold of it and think of anthros of the same species the same way
>they also rub the stuffed animals over their naked bodies so it smells like them too
>that way the human boys they give them to also get the scent on them and associate it with nice things too

>Be anthro wolf mother
>Have a human child in elementary school
>He has a birthday party, friends come over and give him presents, all goes well
>The next day when you greet him after a day of school you realize he smells like tiger, in fact he smells a lot like tiger, like one of those felines bitches has marked him or something
>Tell him to take a shower while you contemplate who could have done this
>Couldn't have been any of his friends since they're too young to be doing that sort of thing, his teacher is a doe so that rules her out, none of his babysitters have been felines, hmmm
>As you're pacing around the house you notice the smell again, it's coming from his room
>You enter and begin snooping around
>As you approach his bed the smell gets stronger, there's a bump under the covers, you quickly pull them off
>It's just a little stuffed tiger he received at his birthday party but it's definitely the source of the smell
>You bring it to your nose and inhale deeply, identifying the traits of whoever marked it
>Tiger, female, middle aged, healthy, and......in heat
>Oh. My. God. It's your fucking tigress neighbor, she marked the goddamn toy and gave it to your son as a birthday present!
>And your son, oblivious to the scent marking, has been sleeping with the fucking thing!
>You snatch the toy and stomp over to your neighbors house, claws out and fangs bare
>That orange and black hussy is going to have a few more stripes on her by the time the day is over

>Be anthro wolf stepmother
>Give your human husbands son a big, cute wolf plushie to help him warm up to you
>Some time goes by, it's time to give it a wash
>Go to put it in the machine, stop yourself
>It smells like him
>Holy shit it smells good
>Why is it making you so horny
>Wrestle with your conscience
>You'd never touch him, but... It's just a plushie, right? What's the harm?
>But it'd feel like you were betraying his trust...
>But it's so soft!
>And it smells sooo good!
>End up cracking and humping the shit out of it on the washroom floor
>Finally put it in the machine, wracked by post-orgasm guilt
>Even after the wash, it still smells faintly of your sex
>Have to give it back to him though, he'd be inconsolable
>He loves it even more now, can't be separated from it as long as he's at home
>His scent on it gets even thicker
>Thus begins a vicious cycle
>It's okay though, he'll grow out of plushies way before he's old enough to make the connection
>R-right?

imagine all the ways you can accidentally proposition an anthro
>using your shirt to wipe your face and exposing your stomach only for a pred anthro to jump you because you showed your hairless soft underbelly which is the ultimate form of submission
>acting nervous around a spotted hyena and end up avoiding eye contact and grabbing at one of your arms which is how male hyenas flirt at female hyenas
>letting a rat comb your hair/groom you
>whistling or dancing around bird anthros and more so if you're wearing bright colors
>sharing food with honey or fish in it with a bear
>living in an apartment where the landlord is a vixen
>etc

Be supervillain anon in anthro setting, nobody takes you seriously, super hero anthros don't even try to arrest you they just show up to catcall you.

>create a big suit of power armor designed like an anthro to hide your identity
>everybody thinks you're some badass 10ft tall lion dude, with super strength and energy blasts
>meanwhile date this one dorky chick you met at work
>except she's also the flying brick superheroine you frequently clash with
>neither of you know this

>be human prince
>be beloved by all, a true prince charming
>nobody realizes that you regularly spread your legs for your lowborn anthro bodyguard
>noblewomen and princesses from foreign kingdoms flirt with you, not realizing that underneath your silks you have hickeys and bite marks where your 'sworn shield' has staked her claim
>she's getting more and more possessive, especially now that your parents have begun talking about setting you up for marriage
>little do they know that their 'perfect prince' is in fact, a dirty boy, who loves nothing more than being pinned down and pounded into oblivion by a brutish peasant of a beast-woman

60's-70's Middle American human father of a plus-sized anthro daughter, and she's been coming home later than usual for the past week. You've had enough, but your hard-boiled nature has its limits with your *little* girl as well, who instead concocts a different scheme. A scheme to help you "remember" your own rambunctious days. She pushes you into your recliner, and crawls over you, claws ripping apart the top two buttons of your dress shirt, and raking her delicate paws through your ample chest hair.
Your daughter always was a bit of an animal.

Imagine if teenage anthros were as crass and sex obsessed as teenage boys are in our world
>accusations of being a lesbian/dyke/muff muncher are regularly thrown around
>countless variations of "I fucked your dad" type jokes
>breastsize is a frequent target, as breasts are seen as the primary sign of female fertility, insults like chestlet and microtitties are very popular
>hips are also fair game as well, if you want to make another girl insecure accuse her of having 'boyhips' and that she's ngmi with hips so narrow
>online game lobbies are a circus, accusations of homosexuality and speciest slurs abound
>preds and herbs constantly dunk on one another
>both dunk on human girls
>"he looks like he sucks yeenis :^)"

>That would suck, imagine walking home from work and a gang of anthros start catcalling you
>the worst part is none of them seem to be out of high school yet
>”Hey big boy! Why don’t you c’mere?”
>”Yeah, come sit with us, we wanna hang out.”
>”I wanna know what his dick taste like.”

Construction workers are probably even worse
>pass by an anthro construction team on their lunch break
>first a portly boar calls out
>"Ey baby! Ya like pork? Cuz I got a side o' bacon just for you! Hehehe!" she slaps her rather generous ass for emphasis
>"Nah, that boy looks like he prefers beef." says the brawny cowgirl
>Ya look mighty thirsty honey! Why don't ya mosey down over here, let mama give ya some nice, sweet milk!" she fondles her own massive bosom through her sweatsoaked shirt
>the stocky badger woman finishes guzzling down her coke and lets out a loud, wet belch
>'Aaah both o' yous dykes shaddup! Nice piece of boymeat like dats needs a real womans!" she shoves her paw down her trousers and begins playing with herself
>"What d'ya say, sugardick, I can show yous a reeeeaaal good time!"
>"Pfft as if! An old hag like you? You're old enough to be his mother!"
>"Hey I'll be his mommy!"
>you do your best to ignore them and keep moving, they continue to call after you
>"Aw, don't walk away baby, don't be like that!"
>"I hate to see you leave, but I love to watch you go. Hehe..."
>"I'll be thinkin' of you tonight, handsome!"

another funny way you could take that
>he starts walking over towards them
>they either get excited or nervous since they didn't expect him to walk over
>he simply asks how his GF or wife is
>turns out she's the boss and the meanest biggest bitch around
>they all immediately scatter from him for fear of even get a hint of their scent on the boss's boytoy
and for extra hilarity
>she actually passes by and spots him
>rushes over to pick him up and hug and kiss him
>starts talking real sweat with goofy lovey dovey pet names
>all the other anthro girls are horrified at her acting that way

VRchat could lead to some funny situations too
>obvious anthro girls that make their avatars as impress and imposing as they can
>anthro girls that talk all sort of big shit, but probably would drop spaghetti if they tried in real life
>slutty boy avatars all over too
>accidentally revealing you're a human guy by stuff you say or don't know
>or making the mistake of having your avatar match your real height

>dog gf has a petplay kink
>likes to put a collar on you treat you like a dog
> calls you good boy, puppy, makes you do treats for your 'cookie'
>"Does Puppy want his cookie? Well, come get it Puppy." is what she always says before she lets you eat her out
>it's the irony that really gets her off, the whole master becomes the pet bit makes her wetter than Niagra Falls

>Novelty fortune cookies sold in adult stores
>Instead of a fortune inside it's a raunchy pun or sex joke
>"A sexy bitch may be in your life soon."
>"Eat this cookie and another may present itself."
>"Be generous, give someone you love a bone."
>"An unexpected heat may be in the forecast."
>Some are cannabis edibles or laced with aphrodisiacs
>A popular tactic is to sneak one into a humans clothes, pretend to sniff it out, then coerce them into eating your "cookie" before claiming them

Tender praise is the surest way to render a boy helpless
>anthro sit you on her lap
>you get all indignant and demand she put you down
>she just starts kissing your neck rubbing her paws over your body
>whispers sweet nothings in your ear while her paws wander over your flesh
>"good boy" "sweet boy" "so cute" "so beautiful"
>one paw slides down your pants, the other up your shirt
>your protests falter and degrade into moans and whimpers
>she fishes out your hardened cock, already leaking pre, and begins to stroke
>you squirm and groan, you beg her to stop, you tell her about to blow, she just pumps faster
>"Cum for Mommy, my good boy."
>you blow fast and hard, eyes rolling back, toes curling, back arched and mouth hanging open wordless cry
>she goes back to kissing your neck and whispering how much a good little human you are, as you drift into a post-orgasm coma

>Injured Waifurs
>Wolf GF
>She may be evolved, but she still retains some animal instinct.
>Wolves become stressed and worried when they are injured, although it is natural for the pack to share food with the sick and wounded, they will eventually abandon the weak if times are tough.
>Your Wolf GF does all sorts of stunts to prove she can still pull her own weight, usually resulting in her becoming more injured and thus delaying her own recovery.
>God forbid she watches the news, and a economic meltdown/flash crash occurs, sending her into hysterics as she believes you will leave her behind due to the impending economic hardship.
>Horse GF
>She’s confident and incredibly strong, she can easily lift you above her head.
>She goes from being a tough and domineering Amazon, to scared and whimpering foal.
>A broken leg is pretty much a death sentence to a species that relies on movement to survive. It's a part of their old prey animal instinct, the slowest/weakest are the first to be caught after all.
>You do your best to stay with her at all times, because she fears at any moment a predator could come and finish her off.
>"Ok babe, listen, I'm not going anywhere, I'm just going to the pharmacy to pick up your medication ok? It's 3 blocks away, i won't be gone for more than 5 minutes."
>"No! Please my love don't go, don't leave me alone, I'm so much easier to catch and eat!"
>This conversation goes on for a several minutes until she allows you to go and get her medicine.
>Later as you're feeding your girlfriend soup on the couch, you hear her whimper anxiously while she clings onto you.
>It must be difficult for her, she is instinctively terrified of predators in this state, and you are (technically) a predator.
>She looks at you mournfully, "Please, don't let your predator urges overcome your love, I don't want to die on this couch."
>Honestly, your considering going fucking vegetarian, if only for her nerves.

>Your anthro gf noticed you blush and quietly pant every time she touches your tummy
>She decides to ask you if you'd like her to give you a tummy rub
>You stutter and try to change the subject because you're kinda embarassed by the fact you totally love having your tummy rubbed/touched
>She just smiles and pins you down on your bed
>You see her paw slowly finding it's way under your shirt
>She looks into your eyes as her paw touches your tummy and begins to rub it gently
>You try your best to hold your moans but looks like she already knows you're into it
>"Aww, does my little humie love having his tummy rubbed?~"
>Hearing that line and feeling her paw on your weak spot was simply too much for you
>You let out a long whimper before she kissed you deeply enjoying the taste of your lips and lovely moans

different sort of dom, but imagine being the only human in a family of anthros
>they're over protective since the no fur, no claws, and tiny fangs makes them see you as vulnerable
>piss poor night vision means you're pretty much not allowed away from them when it gets dark
>pretty much drowned in their scent so if you're lost other anthros can know where to return you
>constant worry if you're too cold since no fur
>if they're a pred species they find you eating meat adorable with your little bites and trying to tear meat with your baby fangs
>water species would extra freak out with how bad humans are at swimming
>grooming would be dragged out since they try to get the most out of only having just your hair to groom
>adding onto that if they find out about skin lotions/oils and wanting to keep you well groomed/healthy
>them freaking out when you eat something that's poisonous to their species, but perfectly safe for humans
>funny looks you get if the anthro family are large species like bears and even if you're in your 30s they'd still tower over you
>lots of teasing and jokes based around jungle book, tarzan, and similar media
>shenanigans from interacting with anthros of the same species as your family and throwing them off when a humans perfectly understands their species tells, cultural/species ticks, postures, etc

>One human in a family of tall anthros
>They get a family photo taken every few years
>First several have the mom holding the son as a baby/toddler/child
>When he gets to be a teenager all of the photos are now only taken from the waist up
>Because to get anything more than anons head into the photo the rest of the family has to be on their knees

disabled human guys and their anthros
wheelchair bound
>can't run away
>lots of excuses to carry him around and pick him up
>get to push him around
blind
>can walk around naked without him noticing
>won't see you coming after him
>lots of hand holding
>he's more likely to touch you since he can use his hands to feel visuals
mute
>can't yell for help
>cutely get notes from him to communicate
>has to use a lot more physical interaction since he can't talk which means more hugging/touching
>still can make cute noises

>Tfw your university is majority anthro
>Tfw you can't go five minutes without getting cat called, stared at, or "bumped" into and being felt up
>Tfw you decide to go hyper-autistic and just wear only military surplus
>Tfw some of them are repelled by the musty smell of decades old uniforms
>Then they get used to it
>Tfw they can smell it minutes before you actually arrive in your classroom
>Tfw the form-hiding nature of military gear seems to do nothing to dissuade them
>Tfw it seems to make them more bold in trying to get handsy with you
>Tfw no matter how loud you play the shitty Yugo-synth music in your earbuds, they always seem to be just loud enough to hear their attempts at flirting
>Tfw you probably would have just fucked one of them if they asked but now you can't out of spite
>Tfw when this has become an arms race of trying to ignore them

Accidents seem fun, although I prefer blind.
>Anthro girl bullies you regularly
>One day it goes too far and he lands face first in a box of pencils and stabs his eyes out
>It breaks her heart seeing him return to school, bumping into walls, etc
>Decides as an apology to become his seeing eye dog
>Has to disguise her voice, because whenever she tries to interact with him normally after that he just yelled at her to leave
>She gradually gets feelings for him, or maybe she already had feelings for him and that was why she bullied him
>Can't tell him how she feels because she feels that she doesn't deserve him, seeing how much suffering she caused him both before and after the accident

>Be Anon
>Be running for your life (Your Pelvis's Life)
>Hear loud pounding paw steps echoing off the aged concrete of the prison maintenance tunnel you are attempting to flee out of
>You pick up your pace in futile desperation
>Yet the paw steps grow louder each second
>She's close enough now that you can hear her drool dripping and smacking the concrete mere meters behind you
>As all hope begins to fail you sunlight begins to seep in through some short of entrance
>Your second wind kicks in and you use the rest of your body's energy to launch yourself towards the light
>You attempt to hug the sunlight as it reaches your body but instead you crash straight into a furred chest
>Momentary dazing you, you can only step a few paces back in shock
>Standing before you is a devilishly grinning and giggling female hyena holding a flashlight that fooled you of your freedom
>As the puzzle pieces begin clicking into place you can only spin around just to once again smack into a larger furred chest
>Not bothering to even pull back this time you can only look up to witness a even sinister grin plastered upon the stocky yet feminine face of the head Hyena warden of UnhornyHumieJail, Lyrise
>Giving a similar cackle, Lyrise lowers her towering figure down to your ear as you begin to shiver
>"If you have run time, we can have fun time."
>The last thing that your ape mind can process is the swooshing of a baton smacking the side of your head as you go down cold

>cleaning out the house, nothing better to do, just passing time til you gotta get to the bar to watch the game with the bros
>go to the attic
>some nice stuff from you and your family's past, other things not worth keeping anymore and could pawn off for some extra cash
>see something you can only vaguely recognized
>as you move closer, you begin to realize it's the giant sized luxray plush from your childhood
>your face brightens up; you use to love this thing to bits; early on you would have in the same vicinity nearly all the time
>but you’re a grown up now. “You’re far too old for this kind of stuff” you initially thought
>but selling it off or worse yet discarding it felt all so wrong; you couldn’t just abandon what was once your dearest friend, real or not
>you press your palm against its soft, squishy body
>but your hand slides across with there being no adhesion, what with the thick layer of dust and grime that has accumulated after God knows how long
>”Well, there’s no way I can appreciate you in this state”
>you check the time; still some hours before you need to leave
>”You know what? Let’s get you a proper wash”
>carry it down to the laundry room
>it towered over you as a kid, but it still has some height on you yet
>bust out the wash tub, add water and detergent, grab a brush and get to work
>a lot of scrubbing later, you finally finish washing all the muck
>towel it down and let it air out a bit as you put everything away
>carry and put it in the corner of your room to admire your handiwork
>still a bit damp, but you can tell that the coat is in pristine quality; feels fantastic to run your fingers through
>run up all the way up to a lumpy breast; you don’t quite remember it having more well defined feminine details, but who does remember every last detail of things from more than a decade ago?
>your adoration is cut short as your eyes catch with the clock; you were planning on leaving 5 minutes ago
>”Oh shit!” you begin to get everything together and hurry your way out the door; don’t want to miss the game
>hours later, you pull into your drive way well after dark
>normally the night would have been nice, but the mood was soured by your team being absolutely dominated, knocking them out of playoff contention
>just wanted to get home and get to bed and sleep off your disappointment
>as you were taking off your gloves, you hear something get knocked over
>”The hell? Burglars?” you thought to yourself
>perfect time to pull out your new Glock-
>fuck where did you put it
>there’s no time to rummage around for it; you grab a bat you brought down from the attic earlier
>you creep up to your room where you think you hear some shuffling
>you burst in, but find no one, just your empty room lit by an active computer
>wait, the computer’s on?
>you feel a hand grab your shoulder from behind, accompanied by a chuckle
>instinctively swivel around and swing the bat
>the bat sinks into the target; the resulting recoil causes the bat to slip out of your hand
>your eyes look up, locking with a pair of hotly colored eyes radiating as brightly as the monitor that lit the room
>the large, commanding figure had a paw to her chest
>breaking the silence, she spoke in a deep but distinctly feminine tone, “Well, that’s no way to greet an old best friend”
>you opened your mouth to speak, only to muster a few stutters
>”But how could I be mad at you after how you’ve treated me today, let alone pulling me out of that stuffy, filthy attic? I feel brand new again.”
>her paw rapidly stretches out towards you
>”We’ve got a lot of playtime to make up for~”

America hadn’t come into the 21st century a very stable nation. With the Soviets somehow finding themselves back from the brink, and the Chinese attempting an invasion of Taiwan in ‘91, the United States was beaten to hell and back. In 2008, the recession nearly crippled the nation and caused widespread civil unrest. The second Sino-Soviet conflict kicked off in ‘10, seeing both nations dragged into a half-decade long stalemate before the Vladivostok accords put an end to that. The two communist powers being preoccupied with one another gave the US the few years of relief it needed to start coming back to it’s pre-90’s status as global superpower. US-USSR relations were stronger than ever, the economy took an uptick for the first time in a decade, and by early 2016, things were looking well. Then the election papers were released.
The democrats had won the last presidential elections, sure, but with documents from anonymous sources proving definitively that they were rigged with the help of the Chinese. Overnight, the country dissolved into a civil war with dozens of factions; each convinced they were the ones who were going to bring the country back to stability. By mid-2020, the Chinese had prepared an “intervention force” to be sent into the US, but the Soviets had similar ideas with much less ulterior motives. And so, that’s where the life of one Anon Anonson picks up.
--------------------------------------------------
Anon woke up to the sound of thunder outside his tent. The weather being shitty was the understatement of the millenia. With Tropical Storm Ida slamming into the East Coast, a good number of people were calling it Sandy 2. Anon remembered “Superstorm” Sandy from when he was in middle school. His house had been out of power for two days, and without a wireless connection for the next week. He didn’t even want to know what the hell it was like for the civilians on the coast. Glancing to his cellphone, the bright light hitting his eyes and causing him to wince, he sees the time is only 6:45 in the morning. As much as he’d want to, Anon is fully aware that he’s not getting any sort of sleep anymore.
Almost as if to prove a point, another resounding roll of thunder peels out of the clouds and into Anon’s eardrums. At the very least the floor of the tent was made of buried wood pallets and a few layered tarps. No mud nor water would make it’s way inside the rather spacious interior unless he opened the door flap, which was not going to happen. So, while the rain made a very pleasing sound as it hammered into the thick, waterproof material of the tent; Anon began to get dressed.
First came his underwear. A plain white t-shirt and underwear with padded socks ensured he wasn’t prone to overheating in the middle of a firefight. After all that came his actual equipment; a Gorka suit and boots. The boots had stains of dirt and mud all over the bottoms, but for the most part were clean enough to be usable. After the weatherproof uniform came a 6b3 vest, it’s overlapping titanium body armor plates making muffled noises as they brushed up against one another in their kevlar pouches. The USSR practically gave this stuff away like candy on halloween to anyone who wanted it, given they weren’t affiliated with the former chinese backed government.
It’s also how he managed to get his hands on an AK-101. The black polymer furniture of the modernized and converted AK platform greeted his eyes as he turned towards the folding table he had the weapon resting on from last night. It’s 5.56x45 magazines could tuck quite nicely into the four magazine pockets in his armor, and he’d modified said pockets to hold double the amount. All he really needed to do was find more magazines and he would be all set. It was about that time when the radio next to the rifle crackled to life. It had automatically been cycling through frequencies until it got some sort of ping, and when it did, the distorted and garbled words of someone were emitted.
This piqued Anon’s curiosity, and he grabbed the small radio, bringing it closer to him so that he could actually try and make out what was being said, and by who. At the moment, the storm was distorting the signal far too much to get anything more than snippets of a voice. It was female, but that could mean one of two things really; a lost civilian, or an anthro. The latter meant that he could be in for at the least some annoying, smelly and soaking wet company. At worst, a firefight he really didn’t feel like getting into. Deciding that it would be better to just take his chances and not get someone frozen to death, he talks into the radio.
“Hello? Hello? Anyone there? This is Anonson, National Salvation Front Irregular forces. Do you copy? Over.”
There was a solid few seconds of silence before he heard anything in response. When he did hear something, it was still more of that garbled nonsense the storm was making. This wasn’t going to go anywhere soon, he could feel it. Sitting back onto his cot with a groan, he debated why the hell he had volunteered for forward recon. No one else had come with him, so what was he thinking? This could easily become suicide mission and he knew it.
The radio again began to spit out a mess of static and mixed feminine voice, but over all that and the rain, he can swear he hears something else. The voice was getting clearer; no, someone was coming closer. The person on the other side of the radio. The voice was a lot deeper than he had assumed from the brief glimpses he’d been able to hear. Figuring this was as good a time as any, he yells out in the direction the person was seemingly coming from.
“HEY! I’m over here! You better not be a fucking chink or I swear to fucking God…”
And then he got a response.
“"No, I ain't a damn gook" you the other guy on the radio?”
Gook was the wrong term, but at this point arguing the semantics of racist words for the bugmen was a stupid idea.
“Yeah, that’s me. Come on over, it’s pretty dry in here.”
With the yelling going down to muttering he could still hear, sooner or later a large shadow made its way to the front of the tent, before the zipper began to move and open the flap. The first thing I noticed of the anthro stepping into the tent was the striking orange fur. Then the stripes. A tigress, she seemed to be. Didn’t see those every day. She was dressed in...God, they gave her the Russian tiger stripe? They had to be laughing their asses off the second she left the meeting point.
In her arms was a slick AKS-74, sure it was older but hot damn was it a beauty. Even with the wood obviously aged from decades, Anon could tell it was a veteran of at least one war; maybe Afghanistan, maybe Chechnya. Who knew? Aside from her rifle, the uniform which normally were the bane of anyone trying to show off any part of their body did her no favors in concealing anything. It was just big enough to fit her comfortably, but her bust was trying to poke out over the 6b43 vest they had given her.
Anon tried not to stare at all, better not to give her any ideas about nonexistent interest in her. Anthros hopped on any inkling of a chance they had, and he wasn’t keen on getting his cot snapped in half by a 6’5” tiger in tiger stripe. She seemed fairly tired out, which might be to his own advantage should she try anything, but instead of making a move, she just walked over to one of the folding chairs and took a seat. Anon was surprised the thing even held up under her weight. Not saying she was fat, but she was easily 200+ pounds and all of it went to her tits, ass, thighs, or muscle. That, and the chairs were shit in general.
“So, uh, what outfit are you with?”
Seeming to only just now acknowledge his existence, she looks over to him and mutters something, too quiet for Anon to hear. Standing there with a confused look on his face, the tigress realizes he didn’t hear a thing she said, and sighs before repeating herself.
“Adirondack Mountaineers.”
The Adirondacks were a few hundred miles to their north, how the fuck did she end up here? As the thought crosses Anon’s mind, he voices it to her obvious displeasure. She didn’t seem to be making things up, she just looked pissed.
“Don’t fucking remind me. I’m not going into it.”
And that was likely the best answer Anon was going to get for the moment, and feeling content to let sleeping dogs lie, he sat back on his cot. Another peel of thunder rings out, causing the anthro to wince hard. For him as a human it was pretty loud. He didn’t want to know how bad it was for her. In an attempt to make his only company for who knows how long comfortable, Anon gets up and digs around in a duffle bag, before tossing a towel over to her. It hits the back of her head, draping over her shoulder. The impact made her jump, and she opened her mouth to yell at him, before noticing what had been thrown at her.
Now looking a bit ashamed at what her reaction was going to be, the verbal silence continues on as she starts to dry herself off. That was one towel he wasn’t going to be using for a while, not until he could get the smell and hairs out at least. Maybe it would be worth it to just burn the thing and get another. Maybe. Anon’s relationship with anthro americans was a bit strained, and had been for quite some time. He’d never liked them as a kid, and as he grew older that only grew to a disgust with the whole lot of them.
However with times like they were at the moment, they were both fighting on the same side. That was enough to keep any overtly speciest remarks to himself, and any subtle ones to be muttered under his breath. That, and the fact she looked like she could punch a hole in his chest like it was paper. It was kind of like knowing not to scream racial slurs at the top of your lungs in the middle of Harlem, it was retarded and asking for trouble.
“Thanks. Really, you don’t want to know how cold it is with soaked fur.”
Hearing her speak snaps Anon out of his mindless pondering of benign things, and has him look back towards her. With her having dried herself off as best she could, the tiger anthro looked a fuckload fluffier than she had when she entered. That, and she had seen fit to remove most of her gear, even her uniform jacket. That uniform really was doing its best to constrain her chest, with her breasts practically spilling out of the sports bra she had on. Unfortunately, she had caught him taking a peek at her. Anon’s heart sank a bit as a smile crept over her face.
“What? Like what you see, little guy?”
Anon just turned his head, then shook it. He didn’t want to get involved with anyone, especially not an anthro. Anon wasn’t in a minority of people, but at the same time the majority didn’t hold his apprehension and distrust of anthros. It had all stemmed from when he was young, and had almost been whisked away by an older anthro woman for God knows what. He’d managed to get away that time, but being as young as he was, it had formed a sort of anxious paranoia every time one got close to him. This was no different.
Having her impromptu advance on him be rebuffed annoyed the tiger, however she’d get what she wanted eventually. After all, could he really stop her? She was sitting right next to his rifle, and he didn’t seem to have anything else on him to attempt to halt her if she did decide to forgo any sort of consent. Anon knew it too, and it was starting to eat at him.
“You sure? I may be a big girl, but I promise I’ll take it easy on you. Ok?”
An awkward pause lingered in the tent as the rain continued to pour all around them outside. There was a bright flash outside, one which caused the both of them to have their hearts skip a beat fearing an imminent attack, but with the only roar following the flash being one of thunder; they both relaxed. The verbal silence was broken as the two began to laugh off the tension that had spiked with the lightning, before Anon finally spoke up.
“Alright, fine. You win. Lemme get this shit off…”
Smiling a lecherous grin, the tigress allows him to slip off his armored vest and jacket top before she finally saunters over towards him. She pauses as she glances at the only thing printed on his plain black shirt. A US Army symbol. She cocks her eyebrow before allowing Anon to explain as he removes his pants, sliding them down past his knees.
“No, I’m not army. Wasn’t ever either. Just got the shirt from some recruiters at my old High School.”
It made sense enough for her to not question it any further, as she sat on the cot next to him, slipping the sports bra over her head and letting her bust free completely. Each breast was easily bigger than Anon’s head, but instead of sagging down like one might think, they both rested in almost a perfect shape. Blew any porn actress Anon had seen right out of the water, anthro or human. He was so transfixed on them he barely noticed her hand, er, paw sliding down his underwear.
“How the actual fuck do you get those to be that big and not sag down to your kne-Oh! Fuck...fuck…”
Feeling her even just brush up against his hardening prick was enough to get a reaction out of Anon, so having her start to stroke him off was nothing he’d ever experienced before. Anon hadn’t even touched an onahole before, let alone been with any girl. She could tell too, Anon wasn’t her first...well, maybe if she actually screwed him he would be, but she still knew a virgin when she saw one; or smelt one for that matter. Anon hadn’t been able to properly wash himself with anything other than moist towels for days and the scent wafting off his crotch was utterly arousing for his new partner.
“You know, I don’t think I ever told you my name. Callie.”
Anon leaned back, embracing the fact he was soon to be her fucktoy for the day; but hearing her actually make the effort to tell him what her name was somehow made him feel better about the whole thing.
“A-anon. Nice to meet you.”
Callie smiles, and puts an arm around his shoulders; pulling him in close while she kisses him on the head. She’d wanted a nice little human all to herself for a while now, but with how hectic the war made things, she hadn’t found the right time, or right man for that matter. Everyone in the Mountaineers were too serious, too focused on whatever their objective was to worry about little creature comforts like sex. Anon, meanwhile, was an irregular. Neither of them were technically enlisted, but Anon’s group were far more lax when it came to times when they weren’t in combat.
Slowly, she’d push Anon down to the thin mattress of the cot, before straddling him with his cock right in front of her own nethers. Leaning down, Callie would plant a nice, soft, and long kiss on Anon’s lips; as she moved her hips up and forwards to gently guide his member into her waiting depths. The moment he entered her, Anon let out a soft, short moan into his partner’s mouth as he wrapped his arms around her waist.
Callie began to roll her hips slowly, getting him nice and comfortable inside of her before she sat up on him, and properly started riding him. All the while, she lays a gentle, but firm hand on his chest. Had he not seemed to have some kind of attachment to the shirt, she’d have whipped out a claw and slowly torn it in half to expose his chest. She may have had total control over him at the moment, but she wasn’t going to abuse the trust he’d apparently placed in her.
For what seemed like hours, she’d alternate between riding him and leaning down to press her bust up against his chest. As she did so, she’d whisper all sorts of things into his ear, planting kisses on his shaven cheek, and nuzzling against his head with her own. She had promised to be gentle, and by God she’d keep to it. Meanwhile, on Anon’s end this was just about the best thing that's ever happened to him.
Shortly after they got started, he’d begin to move his own hips in time with hers, thrusting himself a little deeper into her every time. As he’d grow closer to his own orgasm, his thrusts would at first go deeper into her; though eventually they became short and shallow. She could tell he was getting close from the little twitches she could feel his dick making inside of her, and he began to grip her waist a bit tighter with each passing second. Before long, she knew he was about to bust.
Anon was about to warn her that he was about to climax, but instead he found his mouth once more locked with her lips; and he could only groan as he thrust one more time into her. That final bit of effort surprises Callie, seeing as it just barely managed to get past her cervix which had until this point eluded him. She lets out her own moans as she can feel his white hot seed pumping into her womb over and over again.
And so the two; having their climaxes ended, lay atop the cot. While not the most rigorous sex, it was enough to emotionally tire the both of them out, which lead to a nice session of post-coitus cuddling. However, even with all of that, there was one thing that still was stuck in Anon’s head.
“Heh, tiger in tiger stripe.”
Immediately he feels Callie tense up, raise up off of him slightly and look him dead in the eyes.
“What did you just say?”
Chapter 2: Getting to know your fuckbuddy
Anon visibly stiffened as the half-question/half-demand left Callie’s mouth. Oh boy this was going to be an awkward bit of explaining to do. The more he seemed to stall, the more the tiger’s eyes squinted down at him, boring into his very soul. It was not the most comfortable feeling in the world, unlike her embrace. Tiger fur was so soft and warm, especially on a cold and wet day like it was today.
“W-well...you see, uh, the camo they gave you...the type of pattern is called tiger stripe...so…”
While Anon tried to find the right words to continue, Callie rolled her eyes, and slumped back down onto her partner. Once again Anon was enveloped between the shitty mattress of the cot, and the warm softness of Callies body. Then he felt something touching his hair...no, no she was patting his head. Running her paws through his short cut hair and humming to herself. Obviously it didn’t seem to have really bothered her that much.
“Well~ If that’s the kind of joke the ruskies want to pull on me, then that’s fine. It’s been working well enough.”
Feeling Callie pat his head was a feeling Anon never thought he’d enjoy, but here he was, feeling like he could fall asleep again with her right on top of him. It’s only when she shifts her weight around on the cot does Anon realize that she’s still got his dick buried inside of her, so the small jolt of pleasure he gets from her movement comes as a bit of a surprise. She must have felt it too, seeing as she tensed up a bit.
“Probably...should...Ah!~ There we go.”
She winces slightly as she feels the human’s prick slide out of her; her friends before the war really weren’t kidding about humans being fantastic lays. Lasted longer, felt better, etc. He was just lucky Callie wasn’t in her heat cycle, or else Anon might have to really worry about dehydration and exhaustion.



Anon blinked, desperately trying to keep himself awake. The tedious calculus lecture, coupled with the soft spring warmth, end of the day sleepiness and monotone teacher were getting to him. His mind wandered a bit, then his eyes. Amidst the generic inspiring and mathematical posters, he began to observe his classmates. Rather, a particular classmate. Not only was she only two desks in front of him, but she eclipsed the student between them despite slouching, a weary arm barely propping her lazy head up. She was about as bored as the rest of them were. Her pitch black fur vibrated gently as her breaths became more shallow, a quiet, repetitive sound that began to drown out the lecture. Eventually it stopped, her ears twitched and her entire body lurched back, her arms raised nearly to the ceiling and her head tossed to the side. Her muzzle opened wide, allowing her pink tongue to retreat far between her canine teeth before her entire mouth snapped shut, her bright blue eyes lit back up and she quickly licked her nose.
The bell finally rang. Anon wasn't sure how long he had been staring or how much of the class he missed, but he was certain he finally had the courage to approach her. As the cacophony of shuffling papers and zipped bags ensued, he abandoned his desk to lean on the one next to her. He looked around the room, as more of a formality than anything else, before finally psyching himself up to make the first move.
>"HEy Katrina!"
He immediately went beet red. Not only did he greet her way too loudly, his voice cracked at the first syllable. Thank God nobody else could hear him over the sound of everyone leaving. Katrina did her best to hide her snicker, shoving her paw in front of her muzzle instinctively before trying to pass it off as swatting at something on her nose.
>"Anon, need something?"
Anon took a deep breath and tried again.
>"Just wanted to see if you were busy today. I know you're new to town, so I'm not sure if you've been to-"
Katrina cut him off, narrowing her eyes and rearing to her full height.
>"Been to what? There's nothing to do in town and you know it. I looked around before my family moved here, at best we have a few good restaurants. Thank fuck this is my last year of school, I couldn't take another year of being cooped up readi-never mind. If you wanted to hang out, you could've just said so! How about we head to your place, didn't I overhear you mention your parents installed a pool?"
>"I-I don't think that's a very good idea. My parents hate being out of the loop, I'd need to give them a week's notice in advance to clean the house or do whatever they do. How about we just go get ice cream or something?"
Katrina narrowed her eyes. Anon shifted his. Despite being here for almost a year, she was still the only anthro in the school, maybe even in the county. They didn't really get many moving this far West, which was fine by Anon's parents. Katrina sighed, losing the harsh glint in her eyes.
>"Fine, I could use something sweet. Isn't there one right across the road?"
>"Wait, you actually ate it?"
Katrina was nearing hysterics, her half melted cherry vanilla spewing droplets on her fur, the table and even on anon as her uproar continued.
>"Hey, at least I got fifty bucks. And a trip to the hospital. Best. Campout. Ever."
Anon, on the other hand, played it cool. He was still beet red, and his heavily licked double scoop of pistachio vibrated enough to shatter glass. His voice was hoarse, and his cheeks were strained. He had never felt better.
Katrina licked her muzzle and wherever the ice cream landed on her fur, smacking her lips in satisfaction.
>"Whoops, sorry about that. Let me get that off you-"
Before Anon could even react, Katrina leaned in close, lapped at each droplet on his shirt, arm and cheek, then leaned back in her chair with a smirk, and possibly even a wink. Anon hid behind his rapidly disappearing cone.
>"Say, I think it's date night for my parents. I was going to order in, but do you think your family would mind if I spent the evening with you instead?"
Anon froze. His eyes went wide. Katrina cocked her head, trying to come up with an apology before Anon spoke up.
>"Fuck it, let's try it."
Katrina gave a worried look but said nothing.
Anon took a deep breath before fishing his key out and unlocking his front door. He hoped his dad was still at work, and his mom was out getting groceries or something. Either or would be infinitely better than the likely reality that both of them were home. He opened the door wide, poking his head into the kitchen. Good news, no mom. Bad news, the oven was on, meaning mom was home, somewhere. Remembering his manners, he quickly turned around and held the door open for Katrina, who beamed at him and did a faux curtsy.
>"Your house is beautiful, Anon! How fitting."
>"I'm glad you like it, how would you like a tour? You've already seen the kitchen. . ."
Anon gestured to the room around them. Their proper dining room was behind an unassuming swinging door, but Anon's family almost never used it, instead opting to eat at the small table in the kitchen that could comfortably seat three and barely seat four. Anon continued the tour, showing Katrina every room on the first floor while trying his best to look inconspicuous as he checked the ones nearby for any sign of his parents. Finding nothing, he concluded that they had to be on the second floor, guiding Katrina to their living room right next to the kitchen and sitting down on the couch.
>"Interesting first floor, what about the second? I'd certainly like to see your room."
>"I'd love to show you, but you should know-"
Anon's phone buzzed. Katrina nodded as he took it out, sheepishly sending her an apologetic look which quickly turned to terror as he realized his mother was calling him. He answered as quickly as he could.
>"Hey mom!"
>"Anon, where are you? Dinner is nearly ready and your father and I haven't seen you all afternoon!"
>"About that, I was hanging out with a friend. She's over here now, I was going to ask if she could stay for dinner earlier but-"
>"OH! Say no more! Your father and I will be down in a second!"
Anon hung up and gulped. His eyes met Katrina's, and he finally came clean about his parents.
>"Tch. So what, they're specieist? You're clearly not."
>"You're not worried about how they'll react?"
>"Why should I be? They're your parents."
Anon let out a dry chuckle. At least that was one party taken care of.
>"You should've told me you were having a lady friend over, I would've tidied up!"
His mom, cheerily rounded the corner and entered the living room. Joy turned to shock as she was met with the first living anthro she had ever seen. She barely composed herself as she absconded to the kitchen to prepare dinner.
>"I guess that could've gone worse?"
>"My dad's the one we really have to worry about. When he finds out I brought an anthro home-"
The living room door flung open. Anon's dad stood in the doorway, arms crossed, eyes on fire.
>"Son, why is there a dog on my couch?"
Anon broke into a series of stutters and half finished excuses. Katrina didn't.
>"Anon, why is there a monkey in the doorway?"
Anon's dad let out a dry chuckle, before closing the distance between him and his son at an inhuman speed.
>"Get that fucking mutt out of my house before I-"
Anon's dad was interrupted by a low growl and a paw on his chest. Katrina beared her teeth, standing tall to the point of looking terrifying as her back bristled to skate the ceiling. Her claws, hidden away until now, tugged at his shirt. He looked bewildered.
>"Either I eat with you or I eat you."
Katrina, in a guttural voice befitting an apex predator, gave Anon's dad an ultimatum. Anon's dad said nothing. He did, however, back out of the room and close the door.
Katrina blinked and Anon took several deep breaths. The hair on both of their necks stopped standing upright, and Katrina let slip a small giggle that turned into full blown laughter.
>"I finally got to show someone up! And a specieist, no less! I feel so alive!"
Katrina lunged at Anon, who was stupefied by the whole event. She buried his head into the fluff of her chest, hugging him tightly. Neither of them dared mention the reason she stood up to his father.
The meal was silent. Anon's father was fuming, and his mother looked paranoid, glancing back and forth constantly between her husband and her son. Anon tried to eat as quietly and unassumingly as possible to avoid provoking anything else. Katrina was the only jovial one at the table, her bushy tail wagging at the delicious meal and her legs constantly caressing Anon's under the tablecloth to get as much of her scent on him as possible.
>"Your father and I are going, out. I would strongly suggest bringing your 'friend' home as soon as possible."
Anon had to physically restrain Katrina from giddily waving at his parents as they left the driveway. As soon as they were gone, however, she turned his attention to him. With a swift motion, she scooped him up and carried him upstairs.

>in the distant past, prehistoric anthros met prehistoric man
>annthros were bigger, stronger, faster, and harder to kill, while humans were smarter
>it is theorized that the first anthros to mate with humans were all female wolfpacks who had lost their males, either to disease or stolen from larger packs
>desperate nd horny, they bred with captured human males rather than eat them
>not only was it discovered that humans and anthros could breed viable offspring, female anthros and male humans, but that humans were more pleasurable to breed with, knot having knots and possessing greater stamina
>from there wolves began capturing and breeding exclusively with human males
>since humans were now considered to be part of the pack, they were protected and fed by their new mates
>other males began to notice that their captured brethren were not only alive, but being fed and taken care of
>at some point, human men began presenting themselves willingly to shewolves, offering sex and sperm in return for food, shelter, and warmth
>to further strengthen this bond, humans began to use their innate ingenuity and curiosity to improve life within the now mixed packs, developing tools, early medicine, and better forms of shelter, and then sharing this knowledge with their new mate
>it is said that civilization was born of anthro brawn and human brains
>wolves (and their humans) quickly began to outpace other species in numbers and dominate the prehistoric world
>other species of anthros took notice of this and began taking human males of their own to breed with, to even the numbers
>since the first human males to be captured and bred by anthros were the smaller, weaker, and more docile men of their tribes, anthros began to select their human mates based on features that today would be categorized as 'submissive and breedable'
>humans wishing to become part of anthro communities began to mimic these traits to better their chances of being selected
>anthro females, in turn, developed courting behaviors to showcase their strength and fertility, through displays of dominance and sexual aggression
>eveidnce of the early days of human/anthro pair bonding can be found in the form of cave paintings, showing human hand prints within much larger pawprints, as well as ancient burial sites containing human and anthro remains interred side by side, dating as far back as 40,000 years ago

>which means a human could more or less safely walk through a horde of anthro zombies
>but what if we also add in zombies having a sort of small hint of memory or compulsion based on when they were alive like a mechanic who became a zombie carrying around a wrench and hitting stuff with it

Anon confuses a group of hyena girls, as humans and hyenas have different ways of showing affection. Basically, the Hyena gang keeps accidentally making anon sad, and they keep trying to find ways to make it up to him.

>(Scene slowly zooms in closer to stereotypically white collared owned two story house in the early 2000s)
>(Scene changes to a angle of one of the windows of the suburban home where a trio of three, seven foot, High School Senor, female yeens can be seen lounging on a comically large and long couch)
>(Zooms in closer so the window basically takes up the entire frame)
>(The yeens are seemly pondering)
>(The tank top and khaki wearing yeen on the left end of the couch suddenly peaks up)
>"Maybe we should say sorry again?"
>(There were a few glaces at this particular sick looking yeen before a mummer of agreement arose from the yeen on the far end of the couch)
>"Why didn't I think of that"
>(The slightly larger yeen donning simple greaser attire on the middle of the couch growls before speaking up)
>"God dammit Patty, We've already done that a hundred times and this fuck up won't go away from just a few sorrys and whines"
>(The sick looking yeen slumps back down before letting out a sad whine)
>(They once more continue to ponder on for another stretch of time)
>"OUHHH OUHHHHH"
>(The preppy yeen on the left side of the couch blurts out)
>"What if we invite Anon out to theater?"
>(The sick looking yeen once again perks up and begins to vigorously nod her head)
>"YA YA, Just like that one time when we took him after nearing taking his head off with that baseball!"
>(The middle yeen grins while patting the preppy yeen on the shoulder)
>"Not the worst idea Lily"
>(Then the greaser yeen's grin turns in a scowl)
>"We can't sneak into the theater anymore, they blocked the side exits"
>"And I'm guessing either of you girls have the money to get us all in..."
>(Both ends of the couch erupt into a choir of whines)
>(The largest yeen droops and sighs before perking up herself)
>"Wait!"
>(She slams a arm down on each of the yeens on her side before pulling them into a group huddle)
>(She lets out a sinister grin)
>"What is the one thing we haven't given Anon that teenage gals like us can potentially provide"
>(The preppy yeen looks obvious while the sick yeen's eyes widen before donning a grin similar to the greaser's)
>(Sensing that she would never guess the answer, the greaser slaps the preppy yeen on the back of the head)
>"Ow! Ok... What can we get Anon that we haven't already given, or cannot give..."
>(The large yeen lets out harty chuckle before leaning into the preppy one's ear and whispers)
>"S.E.X"
>(The preppy yeen recoils in shock while unintentionally launching herself off the big guy 4 u couch, all the while the two yeens remaining on the couch let out booming giggles)
>"W-What? Don't you r-remember Anon is C-Catholic?"
>"And do either of y-you even know how to p-perform S.E.X?!?
>(The two couch remaining yeens once again scrunch back down to their pondering poses before simultaneously letting their answer out)
>"No"
>(They all return to pondering, even the preppy one who was now pondering in a standing position)
>(Then a grin begins to reform on the face of the biggest yeen)
>"What if we just rape him?"
>(No objections were made)

>boars and pigs are the same animal
>boars are just what pigs turn into when left out in the wild
>imagine getting stranded in the wild or on an island with a pig anthro woman
>and you're there long enough she starts changing into a boar and getting wild
>her fur growing out more and becoming darker
>her tusks growing out
>her becoming more aggressive and assertive
>her no longer caring and just going around naked
>eventually her going full hog wild and fucking you into the ground while she drools in pleasure

>You and pig woman get stranded on a remote island from a plane crash
>Pig woman starts off incredibly mild mannered and meek, a typical domesticated resident of the suburbs
>Discover there's a tribe of hostile monkey anthros on the island
>You two fight them off but you get injured, have to teach pig woman what little you know about fighting
>She takes to it like a moth to a flame, gradually becoming a one woman wrecking crew as her bestial instincts take over
>She's almost singlehandedly subjugated the monkey tribe and gone into full on boar mode by the time you get better
>By the end she's changed her name to Susan the Boarbarian and enjoys sitting upon a throne made of leather and bone, her belly eternally round and filled with your children as you serve as her bodyguard

>be sort of sheltered human with little to no experience with other races
>join adventurer party has a squishy caster
>it's an all female beastkin party
>completely naive and ignorant of any beastkin culture/traditions
>they abuse this by making up a bunch shit so they can take advantage of you in various ways
>since you're the only human and you're physically reliant on them you don't want to cause any strife so go along with their "culture"
>beastkin sleep in a pile naked together
>have to groom each other everyday
>which usually results them getting to lick you all over
>you need to be scent marked by them regularly
>you have to greet them by licking their lips/teeth (kissing)
>they convince you to wear more or less lewd/fetish clothing/trinkets that they bullshit or good luck/protection charms or such
>and other such molestation
>the real hilarity will come when you end up interacting wit other beastkin and do the "cultural greetings" they taught

>be you, hard working employee at quality eating establishment AnonBurger
>except you don't work very hard, and the quality is "barely better than garbage"
>at least it pays for community college and steam games you never play
>just another boring shift, serving food to a crowd of faces, some human some anthro
>here comes the next customer
>oh no
>you recognize her, a hyena from one of your classes
>she had immediately attached herself to you on the first day, and kept going on about how she wasn't like other hyenas
>short for a hyena, but still big enough to dwarf you, clad in a "pop-culture reference" brand t-shirt and torn up jeans
>she stops when she reaches the counter, and gives a short cackle
"Oh wow! I didn't know you worked at AnonBurger! I think it's really cool when a human can support himself."
>you try to be polite and take her order
>"Haha, I wish you'd take my orders!"
>more nervous cackling
>she's holding up the line
>"I mean, not like I'd actually make you serve me or anything. I mean, you can serve me lunch but..."
>the pain, make it stop
>after another attempt, you manage to pry an order out of her
>two Anon Burgers, extra Anon sauce
>and a Kid-E-Meal
>"For my little sister, of course!"
>you punch in the order and accept her money
>thank god that's over with
>"Haha, so hey, I think I ordered an extra Anon burger, maybe you'd wanna ha..have lunch with me?"
>people are grumbling as she stumbles through an attempt at asking you out
>it's only too bad you just got off your lunch break
>at least that's what you tell her to get out of this
>her ears droop, and she hangs her head
>"Oh yeah, sorry. I just thought since you're so cool and everything you'd wanna hang out with me a little. See you later."
>you feel a little bad, seeing her so crushed
>so when she picks up her order, you lean over from the register and tell her that maybe you could hang out after next class
>"Really?! You mean it?"
>she's so elated, looking back at you as she heads toward a seat in the back of the restaurant, she plows right into the soda machine
>the tray flips in her hand, smashing up against her chest, before she drops it on the ground, sending the contents scattering
>"Oh no!"
>the hyena tries to start cleaning it up, but slips on a fallen burger and ends up falling flat on her face
>it's funny, but you manage to stifle your laughter as you walk over to help her up
>she doesn't seem to hurt, but that shirt is definitely ruined, and tears streak down through her fur
>"Oh my god. I'm such a loser."
>she sobs and throws her arms around you unprompted
>"Bwaah! I'm so sorry!"
>not only is she making a scene, she's gotten Anon sauce all over your uniform
>your attempts to squirm free are futile, as she squeezes you like a stuffed animal
>you give her a few pats on the back, trying to assure her that it's okay
>finally you offer to get her another meal for free
>"You'd do that! For me? Really?"
>not for her, just company policy
>but she won't have it, squeezing you even tighter in her joy, pressing your face into her chest
>"Ohmigosh this is the best day ever! My own little human bringing me free food!"
>she releases the hug, and realizes she's smeared Anon sauce over your face now
>"Oh! Let me get that for you!"
>please anything but that
>too late
>her heavy tongue splats against your face as she licks from your chin to your scalp
>she keeps going long after the sauce has been washed clean
>the only thing that frees you is your manager suddenly calling from behind the counter
>"Damn it! Stop making out with your girlfriend and get back to work!"
>the hyena gasps
>"Girlfriend?!"
>suffering
>the hyena gives another of her jittery cackles before sighing
>"I know I'm not really your girlfriend. You probably already have a great human girl, hah?"
>well no, you don't, but you just tell her that you need to get back to work
>she relents, and finally leaves you be once she's gotten a replacement meal to go
>with the horror show over for now you can get back to the much more existential horror of the service industry
>thankfully she didn't wait outside the restaurant to stalk you
>next day in class, she's glued to you even more
>that's what you get for being nice
>class is dull, as the wizened elephant drones on about the history of pre-historic basket weaving subcultures
>not made any easier by the stifled giggles of the hyena at your side
>every time you sniff, stretch, move, or speak up, she seems overcome by those characteristic cackles
>it's amazing how slow a two-hour lecture can be
>but it eventually draws to a close
>you scoop up your stuff and make for the door, knowing exactly who would be following you
>"Hey, wait up Anon!"
>she jogs up behind you as you get out into the hallway, and then breaks into a laugh
>more genuine, less nervous
>"It's funny, you work at AnonBurger, and your name is Anon! Like it was destiny, huh?"
>it's just a common human name is all
>"Yeah, there are a lot of Anons, but you..."
>more giggling
>"You're an Anon Burger!"
>groan
>just have to suffer through this for the one day you promised and then never again
>ask her if she wants to actually grab lunch at the on-campus cafeteria
>"Oh good idea! I owe you for yesterday!"
>you insist that she doesn't, but she shakes her head
>"The least I can do for my Anon Burger! Haha, I could eat you up!"
>she just keeps coming with the jokes
>"Haha, I mean just cause you're so nice. I don't want to really bite you."
>you dunno about that one, you've heard stories about yeens
>"Like this one time my sister brought a boy home and she kept chewing on his hears and he..."
>you tune out as she rambles on about family and boys and other stuff that doesn't really concern you
>you don't need to get your ears chewed
>the two of you finally make it to the cafeteria
>she bounces from one choice to another
>"Ooh! Do I want burritos? Maybe burgers again? Oh! Anon they still have some donuts left! Do you want one?"
>you really don't care what you get
>whatever's cheapest, you tell her
>"Come on Anon, a human like you needs to grow big and strong! You're so small!"
>cackling with glee, she hefts you up from under your arms to test your weight
>"So small! Guess you're an extra small burger!"
>this is too far
>you shove against her arms and harshly demand to be put down
>she gasps and drops you
>her lip quivers, her eyes go wide, and her ears roll back in disappointment
>"Sorry! Sorry Anon. I didn't--I mean I'm not--"
>people are staring again, snickering and whispering about the poor little humie getting manhandled
>her ears swivel, and she looks around at the people staring
>she whines out one last "sorry" before fleeing in tears
>she doesn't need to cry so often
>you still feel a little bad, even if she did manhandle you
>so of course you have to go do the right thing like a fucking chump
>start off toward where you saw the hyena running, toward the back of the campus
>you dredge up memories to recall her name from when she introduced herself
>Lena
>thank god "Lena the Hyena" rhymes or you would never have remembered
>you call out down a hallway then the next
>nothing but a couple stares from other students
>one bull snorts
>"Lose your girlfriend humie?"
>prick
>keep searching until you finally spot her
>outside, at the edge of the open field behind the main campus you see the hunched over figure of the hyena slumped against the low wall leading toward another building
>students would usually hang out around the open field
>though not in the middle of November when it's 30 degrees outside
>with a sigh, you zip up your hoodie and push out into the chill breeze of the field to cross the field and join her
>she spots you as you approach, and stands up off the wall
>she averts her gaze and it looks like she's about to take off again when you call her name
>Lena
>"Go away Anon. I said I was sorry, I won't bother you again."
>you sigh and lean against the wall
>now that she says it, that is what you wanted all along
>but as you consider it, she was the only person who really reached out to you
>even if it was painful attempts at flirting and weird hyena cackles when it backfired
>you guess it's complicated
>you decide to start by just saying that it's okay
>"No it's not okay. I said I wasn't like other hyenas but I am. I kept bugging you and teasing you and yesterday I made a mess and then I picked you up and..."
>she gives you a mournful look
>"I'm such a loser, Anon. You're so cute and cool I just couldn't help myself. Haha, I guess it's pretty obvious I really like you."
>yeah it is
>not like you made it easy on her with how hard you worked to dodge her
>come to think of it, you may have been kind of a jerk to her
>maybe you could hang out again, for real this time
>just have to set some ground rules first
>Lena gives you a small smile, rubbing the tears from her eyes
>"You're too nice, Anon. We should find somewhere more quiet next time."
>and hopefully somewhere indoors, you're starting to shiver out here
>Lena notices, and reaches out to hug you again
>she stops just before reaching you and huffs
>"There I go again. Didn't even ask..."
>with a roll of your eyes, you throw your arms open and hug her
>"Eep!"
>she gives a few cackles, but you're too busy sinking into the warmth of her body
>she's surprisingly soft when she isn't covered in Anon sauce.


>FemWolf presses Anon into service aboard vessle.
>Has no idea what she's in for.
>Anon tries to explain it would be a really bad idea, but stutters too much to get it out and is simply drug aboard ship and thrown into service.
>Starts with Anon doing laundry.
>Anon is a bad luck vortex the likes of which are rarely seen in the galaxy.
>Maybe it's because the space washer hasn't been properly serviced in years, maybe there was something in a pocket that Anon missed, maybe it was a stray static discharge or a tin whisker.
>Whatever the reason, when Anon hits the "start cycle" button the machine makes an awful grinding noise.
>Something shorts out and discharges a nasty arc back along the power lines.
>For some goddamn reason the washer shares power with the artificial gravity system
>"Who could know?" says the engineer when everything on board ship starts floating.
>Engineer gets the artificial gravity back on.
>But it's a kludge, an important part is burnt out and that means the gravity field is not going to properly regulate until they can get a replacement part.
>Areas of the ship are closer to 1.7g while other parts are closer to 0.3g.
>Maybe more importantly the space washer is a total loss, along with all the clothes that were in it.
>FemWolf's clothes
>All she has now are two outfits. One pair of underwear.
>No wash can get done until the unit is replaced.
>An entire crew of dirty sailor anthros without access to clean clothes in close quarters.
>The smell is going to overwhelm the filters pretty quick.
>Oh, and it turns out their space washer wasn't just an old model. It was ancient.
>New models use different hook ups to the power system. So those parts are needed too.
>First day and Anon has cost FemWolf thousands in money and god knows how much time in inconvenience.
>Fucker is gonna stay until she's ground that debt out of him.

>Finally manages to say to FemWolf "I t.. t.. tried to te... tell you. I'm bad l.. luck."
>FemWolf just sneers malevolently. "You don't know what bad luck is you little shit. Throw him in the brig until I figure out what we're going to do with him."
>She already knows she just wants a body to clean the place up because the rest of the crew is incompetent at keeping anything clean; but she isn't going to let that on.

>Until the yeen is crossing the threshold and Anon is cowering in the back of the tiny space.
>Security door closes, or tries to close, with bone crushing force.

Dammit, now this shit's ruined.
Here's your plot summary faggots.
- Anon tries hiding somewhere else on board ship.
- Gets caught just as he's making it into a supply closet.
- Gets pulled out, but knocks over a bunch of old cleaning chemicals and god knows what else a forgetful crew of space pirates put in there, apparently a smoke grenade or two.
- Cleaning chemicals turn into what is a mild airborne irritant to Anon, but is massively debilitating to the anthros with their keener senses.
- Smoke from grenades carry irritant thoughout ship.
- Anon makes his way to the bridge where the worse pirates had FemWolf's crew tied up.
- Worse pirates leader (a fox) was humiliating FemWolf by wearing her clothes and claiming to look better in them, leaving FemWolf naked in front of everyone.
- Anon quietly unties the big lizard, who also isn't badly affected by the irritant, just the mammals.
- Lizard saves the day while Anon just hides behind a console hoping nobody else dies.
- Other pirates die immediately or are thrown out an airlock later
- Lizard gets engineer a gas mask, engineer manages to clear the air on the ship after a while.
- FemWolf and crew recovering.
- Anon covers FemWolf in an emergency blanket, hoping it doesn't somehow strangle her or something.
- Anon is shocked and horrified and teary eyed. All he can say is "Bad luck. Told you. Bad luck."
- FemWolf is turned into a believer, maybe she should help this human before his luck destroys them all. She'd throw him out the airlock but that would probably backfire and blow the whole ship up.
- Big lizard knows a planet of magic cats, never believed in it until now, but figures it is their best bet.
- Engineer takes parts from worse pirates ship to fix their ship. The space washer is brought over too.
- In 24 hours FemWolf's ship is up and running again like is should be.
- Anon is in a comfy room by himself when FemWolf comes in and sits next to him.
- She's wearing worse pirates leader's clothes as a post humus "fuck you"
- Tells a still traumatized Anon that she's grateful for his small act of kindness and that they're going to try and help him.
- oh, worse pirates ship is put on autopilot to follow FemWolf's ship. It'll be sold later for profit. In all, Anon's luck may be bad, but she'll be turning a very neat profit so long as nothing else goes catasrtrophically wrong.
- Later: crew and Anon are on Chz'br'gr, home planet of the magical anthro black cats.
- Pirates explain to magic cats what the problem with their new "crew member" is.
- Cats take Anon and perform ceremony, stealing his power and adding it to their own; leaving Anon a normal luck having human.
- Anon goes away with FemWolf because Stockholm syndrome and also feeling powerless to do anything else.
- Anon ends up cleaning the ship as his job, but nobody gives him shit for it.
- Eventually becomes a real member of the crew, with a gun and everything.
- Teases FemWolf about her choice in underwear given that he's the only other crewmember to always see it.
- Ends up getting fucked into silence.
- Screen goes black.
- The end.

>Try to summon sex demon, suppose to be busty human demon
>Draw the arcane runes, pretty sure they are right
>Instead get some goat demon lady?
>Whatever, she’s clearly here for sex the way she is teasing your dick
>Command her to put it in
“No.”
>You try and push her off but her grip is like steel
>She proceeds to dom the hell out of you
>Teasing and edging you with her hands, mouth, and tits
>When she is riding you she always pulls away right before you cum only to stick her pussy or ass right into your face
>You obediantly pleasure them with your tongue and lips
>She should be obeying your every order but you can’t help but take her every lead
>An hour later she finally lets you cum while she’s riding you
>You mind blanks at its intensity
>She climaxes at the same time
>You feel the flames of hell licking your flesh as she does
>You both lay there, panting, holding each other
>She finally pulls away and stands up, walking over to inspect your summoning circle
“Wow, you are the luckiest idiot ever. You fucked up like 12 runes. Had you gotten this right you’d owe your soul to a literal fucking succubus. But instead you got me.”
>She walks back over, standing over you
>Her eyes burn bright red then she pushes a deep kiss onto you
>You can’t help but submit to it
>She burns something on your soul, a ring of runes
>It should hurt, it should make you scream, but somehow it’s just the warm embrace of a lover
“There’s my summoning circle, it’s part of you now.”
>And you know that no matter what happens to you that you will never be able to forget it
“Next time you want some fun though, the price is dinner first. I like Italian and Thai. See you soon, dumbass.”
>The way she says “dumbass” isn’t derisive but almost affectionate
>She steps back onto your botched circle and disappears with a puff of flame and sulfur
>You know you won’t be able to stop yourself from summoning her again
>You google for a good Thai place

I can see the appeal. If I continue the story (doubtful) here’s some concepts
>Dommy Goat Demon is actually fairly magically powerful
>Her kind are typically summoned to tutor mortals in magic
>But most of the mortals interested in magic aren’t worthy of powerful magic
>In addition most mortals who summons demons are just interested in sex
>Summoning circles are composed of runes and each one is basically a magically binding contract
>The meaning of those runes and how to compose new circles has been lost to humanity
>Everything left is just empirical knowledge “Use this circle to summon this demon for this purpose”
>Your typical sex demon circle is pretty open ended “I summon a sex demon to obey me in bed and in return I will give her what she wants”
>Mostly succubus answer those contracts, and they will always take a promise of a soul because that’s what they do
>Anon’s fucked up summoning circle basically said “I summon a magic tutoring goat demon for sex” then a bunch of nonsense that can’t be considered legally binding
>While all the Magic Tutor Goat demons debated who should go, Dommy Demon saw her chance and went for it
>And found a cute Human who was still down to fuck despite her not being a red skinned bimbo
>And who responded very well to being dommed with only a little magic assistance
>So she burned a summoning circle into his soul that says “Hey Dommy Demon, let’s hang out.”

>human chick has a fetish for watching human guys get fucked by beast women
>finds ways to set it up
>take a guy out into the wilds and tie him up and get him aroused
>then leave him there all vulnerable and blasting out sex pheromones
>and just waiting for a some big nasty beast female to come and take advantage of him

>be teenager
>parents drag you along on their safari trip to Africa
>something happens and you end up separated from the group and lost out in the wild
>your new scent and different looks causes you to be targeted, molested, and sexually assaulted by all sorts of tribal/savage big African anthros
>at least some are kind enough to share food and water and care for you
>big bootied zebras getting the most out of your stamina
>huge elephant matriarch manhandling you
>being ambushed and fucked by leopard/jaguar at night
>croc girls dragging you into a river for some water fun
>hippos using their titanic asses to fuck you into the mud
>getting coiled up by huge African pythons looking for some warmblooded fun
>pride of lionesses taking a turn being the dominant one for a change
>getting femdommed by a clan of spotted hyenas
>having your throat completely invaded by purple foot long giraffe tongue
>etc

>beastkin female adventurers commonly taking new human boy adventures under their wing
>teaching them the rules of the guild and how to survive
>also keeping them safe and close
>and unlimted access to a cute human boy they can defile and corrupt to their heart's content
>having them wear more and more lewd equipment
>covering the boys in their scent

This is probably what it's like being the only human guy in research/work base full of anthros
>minor injuries or cuts has them rush into protective mode
>constantly being check on to make sure you're safe
>dirty clothes going missing
>the anthro girls getting excited when you walk around in boxers and a sleep shirt so more of your skin and scent is exposed

>anon gets put in cryosleep
>wakes up centuries later
>mankind created anthros to serve them but was instead cast down and enslaved by their own creations
>though not in the way one would think, there aren't any humans toiling in the mines under the whips of cruel anthro women
>no, they've more or less made man into a combination of pampered pet and sex toy
>after they won the war, anthros used genetic modification and selective breeding to mold humanity into the perfect race of pleasure slaves, using the same science that had created them against their makers
>softer skin, younger and more boyish features, larger cocks and balls, huge increase in seminal output, better stamina
>senses have been modified to be very susceptible anthros, smell, taste, touch, all are ensured to make human men horny
>their behavior has also been conditioned, partly through genetic tampering and partly through generations of propaganda and mental training, to make them more docile and obedient
>they are not only loyal, but deathly afraid of being abandoned, they've been raised with stories of the before times, when their forefathers toiled and slaved under cruel powers that sapped them of all happiness, that hurt, and maimed, and killed them in pointless wars
>then the overladies came and made everything better, now they are all safe and loved and happy, the fact that they are all slaves doesn't seem to register with them
>anon asks them why they don't rebel they will become confused and ask why they would even do such a thing
>they think anon is weird for wanting to be 'free' and don't understand why he doesn't just let the overladies take care of him

>be you, browsing generic social media platform one day when you see a post from your long time friend Ellie and her probably more than friend Rhianna
>turns out they, for whatever reason got evicted and needed a place to stay ASAP
>probably against your better judgment and without really thinking it through you messaged Ellie about staying at your place for a few days as she got herself sorted out
>pretty soon she replied and you talked things through and Ellie said her and Rhianna would be at yours in a couple hours
>during the couple hours you cleaned up the spare bedroom, as well as the rest of the house
>you didn’t want to see your friend after a while and have her think you lived like a slob
>*Ding*
>oh shit that was the door
>you walked to and opened the door
>and were immediately faced with 2 things
>1: somehow you’d forgotten she was a horse, and horses were Big
>2 her huge pair of tits
>you also realised you were staring
>’Quit staring retard!’ Your conscious told you as you averted your gaze
>”Hey Ellie, how’ve yo-mphh!” Was all you managed to say before Ellie wrapped you in a hug
>you were once again staring straight at her tits
>”Anon! It’s so good to see you!” She practically squealed before saying “Oh” and releasing you
>she apologised and you told her not to worry about it before resuming the usual greetings
>then she introduced you to Rhianna, who was about the same height and size as Ellie but had darker hair
>it also looked like she was wearing gloves with the way her hair was brown from her biceps to her fingertips
>Rhianna held out a hand and you shook it, finding she had a firm grip
>You invited them inside and their height (about 6’9”) caused them to have to stoop under the doorway
>just as you were about to close the door behind them you noticed your human neighbour, Michelle, staring at you, jaw agape
>the fuck was her problem?
>you shut the door and told them to leave their bags by the door for now
>you asked if they wanted a tea or coffee to drink, with milk or cream
>you got a tandem “Cream” from them and went into the kitchen to make them some
>you returned with their drinks and found them sat on the couch in the living room, it looked kinda undersized for them
>you started talking about stuff, mainly the house and where you’d got it from
>it used to be one of the property’s your great aunt owned before she died and since in her will it stated the property’s that weren’t specifically given to people could be picked by her surviving relatives you managed to grab it before anyone else did luckily
>since you didn’t need to pay a mortgage you could safely afford to live there
>you pretty much spent the rest of the day catching up with Ellie and getting to know Rhianna
>you eventually showed them where they’d be sleeping, the bed thankfully just about being big enough
>it had been a few days since the mares arrived
>I’d had been smooth sailing so far, they’d been great houseguests abd hadn’t caused any trouble, although the shower drain needed unclogging fairly often now
>today you’d been at work, leaving the horses alone all day
>you’d worked late so by the time you’d finished it was dark outside
>you were tired as you arrived home
>when you entered the house it you heard noises upstairs
>Oh, did they get an early night? You thought to yourself
>however as you listened to the noises they sounded, unusual
>creeping upstairs you realised the sounds were emanating from…your own bedroom?
>What were they doing in there?
>You slowly and silently crept towards your bedroom door, the noises growing louder as you did so
>you were now standing right outside the door and you put your ear to it
>you quickly quickly realised the sounds were in fact…moaning?
>they were moaning, mixed with some sort of wet sound and metallic creaking
>were they?
>you ever so slowly opened the door had an inch and peeked inside
>Holy Fuck
>they were on your bed with Ellie almost knuckle deep fingering Rhianna while also fingering herself
>Ellie was also sucking on Rhiannas tit while the darker horse held onto your bed frame
>you should have stopped looking but you couldn’t
>you were mesmerised by it
>Rhianna suddenly started to turn her head and you ducked back away from the crack in the doorway
>oh shit-had she seen you?
>You slowly and quietly moved away from the door, back towards downstairs
>once their you started to pace in the living room, trying to rationalise what you saw
>maybe they had something to drink and mistook your room for theirs?
>surely not? Since your room was down the hall and on the other side of the house to theirs
>you could still here then upstairs, which didn’t help the stiffy in your pants
>you had to get rid of it somehow, thoughts of masturbating crossed your mind
>No, no this wasn’t the time for that
>cool something, you would cook something
>you had all the ingredients you needed to make a stir fry in the kitchen
>you got to work setting everything up but stilll couldn’t distract yourself from thinking about their huge breasts and dark equine pussies
>goddamn it
>you started to gather all the ingredients
>but somehow everything reminded you of them
>black beans? Beans like their black clitorises
>brown sugar? Same colour as their hair
>onions? Chopped in half they looked like-FUCK
>Fuck it, you had to just force yourself to stop thinking about them and get on with the cooking
>Soon enough you were done, the stir fry sat steaming on the pan as you reached for a bowl
>sitting down at the table you dug in, you hadn’t eaten anything since lunch at work and were famished
>halfway through though you heard the noises upstairs stop
>and were replaced by footsteps, coming towards the stairs
>oh god
>someone was coming downstairs, her heavy footsteps pounding against the wooden steps
>around the corner came Ellie
>she was wearing a bathrobe of yours except it was very undersized for her
>which meant her boobs were on the verge of spilling out, her crotch area was barely covered by it and one of the shoulders had torn slight as you could see her light hair, clearly her arms had been to big for it
>she took a deep breathe and exhaled
>”mmm Anon, what did you make, it smells good” She asked
>”oh just a stir fry” you answered
>did she know you know what they were doing?
>”think me and Rhi’ could have some?” Ellie asked, slowly walking closer
>”S-sure”
>you got up and headed into the kitchen, grabbing two bowls
>just play it cool, hopefully she didn’t know and you could just pretend it never happened
>two bowlfuls of stir fry in hand you walked back out to Ellie who was looking out the window
>”your neighbour was staring in again, don’t worry though I gave her a ‘show’”
>Christ
>you handed her the bowls and she turned to leave, but just before she went back up the stairs she said
>”You can see the ‘show’ too ya know, don’t worry though, it’ll be much better than the sneak leak you got earlier”
>with a wink and a flare of her tail that exposed her huge ass from under the bathrobe she went back upstairs
>She knew
>goddamn it they knew
>you sat there, slowly eating what was left of your meal
>you needed a drink
>you searched the cupboards for your prize: the unopened bottle of scotch you found when you moved in
>you broke the caps seal and poured yourself a shot
>as soon as it hit your tongue you knew this stuff was strong
>strong like Ellie and Rhianna if their abs had been any indicator
>why couldn’t you get them out your head
>you grabbed the scotch bottle and drank straight from it, not caring anymore
>you begrudgingly walked towards the stairs
>each step upwards seemed to get harder and harder, but you knew it was in your mind
>finally you reached the second floor, seeing your bedroom door was closed again.
>the mares were clearly in there as your bathrobe Ellie was wearing had been discarded just outside the door.
>you walked up to the bathrobe and picked it up
>this was your house goddamn it, they couldn’t just do whatever they wanted
>you took a swig of scotch and pressed your ear to the door, trying to listen for anything
>it was quiet, too quiet
>just as you were about to move away from the door it opened
>since nothing was supporting your weight anymore you fell straight over onto your face into the bedroom
>Ow
>you held your nose, still lying on the floor
>you think you might have broken it
>your hands felt wet and your mouth had a metallic taste in it
>looking at your hands you saw they had blood on them
>add a nose bleed to the list of problems you had
>you started to get up but were suddenly swept off your feet
>half a second later you realised you were being held in a bridal carry by Ellie
>”I don’t…carrying…bottle…door…fuck
>you tried saying something but between the alcohol, confusion and embarrassment all that came out was a random string of words
>”shush babe your spitting blood everywhere”
>babe?
>She gently set you down on your bed and you realised Rhianna was led in it
>although she was under the covers you were pretty sure you saw the edge of her areolas poking out
>you felt your pants get tight and curled your legs so they wouldn’t see your boner
>your nose was still bleeding so you asked Ellie to get you the box of tissues you kept in the drawer
>thankfully she was wearing a towel around herself but it was about as successful as covering herself as the bathrobe
>you kept your eyes facing downwards as she handed them to you
>you got to work cleaning yourself up, the bed soon covered in bloodied tissues
>Rhianna was watching you and you asked her if something was wrong
>”Anon is that alcohol I smell on you?” She asked in a stern voice
>before you could reply Ellie spoke up from behind you
>”Yep, look what he dropped on his way in”
>Ellie was holding and studying the scotch
>”tsk tsk tsk, were you gonna keep this to yourself babe?” She asked
>you didn’t answer, wiping your face again
>again you found yourself moving as Ellie slightly lifted you and put you even closer to Rhianna
>you were now barely a couple inches away from a heavily well endowed mare
>Who’s eyes suddenly snapped from below your waist to your own eyes
>Rhianna snorted, causing her bust to jiggle
>your eyes snapped to them for a split second and Rhianna giggled
>There was a *click* from behind you and you turned your neck to see what it was
>Ellie had locked the door and was taking a swig of the scotch
>you were now locked in the room with 2 very large and imposing mares
>you looked back towards Rhianna, who had hooked a finger on the blanket that covered her
>”I think it’s time we got the formalities out the way don’t you?” She whispered
>slowly she pulled the blanket down, just enough to reveal her nipples
>they were thick, puffy and rock hard
>don’tgetanothernosebleed
>”Like whatcha see?”
>”Y-Yeah” you answered, voice cracking
>Rhianna smirked so you worked up the courage to ask
>”Why were you in here earlier?”
>she cleared her throat
>”Come on, you know the answer so just say it.”
>your heart was racing in you chest as you spoke
>”You wanted to have sex with me?”
>”No. We wanted to FUCK you”
>with that Rhianna grabbed the back of your head and thrust you into a kiss
>to say it was sloppy was an understatement, clearly this had been building for sometime
>at the same time she used her other hand to drag yours onto her breast, which you squeezed
>she moaned into your mouth and almost started throat fucking you with her tongue
>Then you heard Ellie say “HEY, QUIT HOGGIN HIM” louder than she probably meant to
>Rhianna let up the kiss and you faced Ellie
>who had ditched the towel, huge tits and leaking horse pussy on show
>she was still holding the scotch in her hand but quite a lot of it had clearly been drank by her
>before you could even think Ellie had already moved over to you
>she grabbed your necktie and pulled you to her
>she didn’t say a thing but instead kissed you
>if you thought Rhiannas kiss was intense then this was something else entirely
>while Rhianna had seemed to hold back from shoving her tongue down your throat Ellie had no such reservations
>she throat fucked you with her tongue which was even meatier than Rhiannas
>you could still taste the scotch on it
>just as you became desperate for air she broke her kiss with a loud, wet and resounding *pop*
>She tore your shirt off and ran her hands over your chest down towards your boner
>she seemed to fiddle with your belt for a few seconds but couldn’t get it undone
>maybe her hands were too big or the alcohol paired with her clear horniness impeded her fine muscle movement
>she snorted in frustration
>you couldn’t help but laugh at the big horny horse who couldn’t undo your belt
>she gave you a pissed lol and grabbed your wrists, drawing your hands to the belt
>you obliged and started undoing it while asking her
>”So have you always had a thing for me or is this just a spur of the moment type deal?”
>she hesitated for a moment before replying
>”Eh, probably a bit of both, I always found you attractive but never really acted on it, but then you invited me to stay with you and I couldn’t just let that go unthanked could I?”
>”Ok, what about…her” you said, looking to see where Rhianna was, finding her swallowing a mouthful of scotch
>”Rhi’s kinda in the same boat, but obviously she hasn’t known you as long. She still wants to thank you all the same, isn’t that right Rhi?”
>”Mmm?” Rhi hummed, clearly not listening to the conversation
>you’d finally undone the belt and Ellie yanked your pants off, the other only thing between her and your Funtime stick now being your underwear
>she took a long and exaggerated breath just above them, moaning gently under her breath
>”So Anon, want can I do for you?”
>”B-boobs” you sputtered out
>Ellie raised an eyebrow and said “Oh, these?”
>she moved herself and hefted her huge tits onto your lap, the pendulous globes slapping against your skin
>she grabbed your underwear and tore them in half as taking them off was blocked by her chest
>you were already hard but got even harder when she took your dick into her mouth, lubricating it
>her tongue lathered you inside her mouth for a second before she released you and squeezed her tits together around your cock
>her boobs were so big your dick disappeared between them
>she started pumping her tits up and down with her hands and you groaned
>it felt amazing as you balled your hands into fists on the bedding
>after a minute you closed your eyes and led back, trying to resist cumming
>but when you opened them a few seconds later Rhianna was kneeling over you
>having to crane her neck to see you over her equally massive mammaries
>she was still holding the scotch bottle, a decent amount of the liquid was left
>you tried to reach up and touch her kiddy but before you could she simply fell forward
>resulting in you getting hit in the face with her tits
>thank god they were soft
>the moved a bit until you felt something firm pressing against your lips
>you dragged your tongue over it and heard Rhianna whinny and moan
>oh it was her nipple
>you started sucking on it abs heard more whinnies
>at the same time Ellie was upping her game on your cock
>you even felt her tongue snake it’s way between her boobs to your dick
>just how long was that thing?
>soon it became too much and you knew what was about to happen
>you tried tapping or even slapping one of the equines to warn them but to no avail
>you blew your load, biting Rhiannas nipple
>a few seconds later Rhi’s boobs removed themselves from your face and you looked at Ellie
>not only were her tits plastered with cum her face was also dripping with it
>you saw Rhianna lick her lips out the corner of your eye
>you let back down and basked in the post-orgasmic bliss, savouring the feeling
>suddenly your face was once again covered in horse titty as Rhianna leant forwards
>you felt two tongues start to wipe your dick clean
>you also felt Rhiannas still stiff nipple poking your lips again so you resumed sucking on it
>more whinnies came from above
>after who knows how long the licking sensation on your cock stopped but the motions that Rhianna made while licking didn’t as you still felt her moving through her boob
>then a short time later Rhianna finally sat upright again
>your dick might as well have been sparkling and Ellie’s tits and face were clean too
>it didn’t take a genius to figure out where the cum had gone
>however they had turned their attention to you
>your dick started getting hard again
>you squirmed in place as Rhianna gently took your cock in her huge hand, pumping it a bit
>”Someone’s ready to go again I shee” she said, slurring her words slightly
>Ellie moved closer to you but Rhianna pushed her away saying
>”you already had a turn now it’s mine”
>she crawled over the bed and squatted in front of your dick
>her horse pussy was a fountain at this point and her engorged lips were moving
>guess they really do wink
>she used two fingers two spread her pussy slightly and used another two two rub your head against them, the stimulation making you moan
>”What’s am I supposed to do?” Ellie suddenly chimes in, also slurring her speech
>Your mouth spoke before you could think
>”My face”
>realising what you just said you blushed as Ellie smirked and said sultry
>”Ok Anon, if you say so”
>she moved and knelt with her knees on either side of your chest
>her horse cunt was inches away with you, the black outer lips with their pink interior made you even more horny as they dripped with excitement
>Rhianna suddenly set down on your hips and you moaned
>”Ahh-mmmph?!”
>Ellie took advantage of your state and set herself down on your face
>her pussy squirmed as you felt it with your tongue
>”You can-nng- do better than that boy” she grunted
>you fully pushed your tongue inside and licked every fold and crease you felt
>at the same time Rhianna was almost violently bouncing on your hips
>you heard the bedframe groaning in protest
>you tried to move your hands up and grab Ellie’s swinging tits but her thighs were so big you couldn’t reach over them
>Ellie’s snatch was so wet you thought you might drown
>heh, that’d be a funny tombstone
>’died drowning from horse pussy’
>you heard something in the bedframe snap
>Ellie’s squeezed her thighs around your head and groaned
>”you’re not coming up until I cum, got it?”
>you moaned into Ellie’s pussy “Yes ma’am” and she ruffled your hair
>good boy
>you thought you had found her clit with your tongue so you played with it a little, Ellie responding with little moans and groans
>at the same time you were desperate for air so you tried prying Ellie’s legs apart
>they didn’t move at all and only got tighter as she said
>”Need a breathe?”
>”mhm”
>”mmm since you’ve been doing good I’ll give you a break
>she loosened her legs a bit and you took a breathe
>”Ok break time over” Ellie said as quickly as possible, squeezing her legs back together
>Rhiannas dick pounding was still happening and soon you felt a climax building
>however before you could do anything your face was suddenly flooded with horse juices as Ellie came
>she moaned loudly and fell to the side of you
>immediately afterwards you also came, shooting rope after rope of baby batter into Rhiannas cunt
>you led there catching your breath, knowing your hips were going to be bruised tomorrow
>you felt 2 hands suddenly but gently grab you and pull you out of Rhianna
>you were Ellie dragged you over and onto herself and you sat up kneeling on her belly
>”Don’t think your done yet babe” she said in between ragged breaths as she continued:
>”but since you did such a good job with your mouth I think you’ve earned being the one on top this time”
>she pushed your hips down until you were past her crotch, her wet and puffy horse pussy awaiting the main course
>just before you started thrusting Ellie put your hands on her tits stating
>”why don’t you use these for leverage?”
>you squeezed them and Ellie bit her lip
>you thrust yourself into her and she gasped
>her snatch squeezed around your dick as her tits jiggled in your hands
>clearly both of you were already sensitive as pretty soon you both came
>Ellie looked you in the eyes and said
>”I think we both know we aren’t done yet are we?”


>princess gets excited she's getting married to a fair prince
>decides to take a peek in his room before the ceremony
>her eyes go wide as his beast knights go to town on him and make him say horrible things
"Human women are the worst!"
"I love animal pussy!"
"I love you aaallll-mmmmffff!"
>some bitch, literally, cut him off by making him eat her.
>princess steps back from the keyhole, already wet from the scene and heads to the chapel
>princess licks her lips as her husband walks down the aisle
>as the priest gives permission to kiss the princess throws herself at her husband kissing and licking every inch of his mouth trying to get a taste of bitch.

>get a seasonal job at a mall has one of Santa's elves
>like usual they got a polar bear anthro to be Santa
>except this time it's a female polar bear
>she's still a massive white bear and has that jolly paternal/Santa spirit going
>still a hit with the kids and by the look of it her lap is nicer to sit in with the womanly padding from her thighs
>she comes off as an older woman, but it's hard to tell with her fur color and how some species don't show age too much
>still has a rocking body doubled with her massive polar bear proportions
>think she might be showing too much cleavage and leg for someone playing a Santa or Mrs. Claus in this case
>between kids she talks with you and some of it kind of sounds like flirting, you think
>need to go fix some of the decor some of the more rowdier kids knocked over near her Santa throne
>really feel those gay elf tights dig into your ass as you bend over and then suddenly feel a pinch/grab on your ass and you shoot back up
>turn to see "Mrs. Claus" lightly biting one of her fingers and eye fucking you from her seat
>she has the glint of an apex predator that's locked onto prey now
>and she's definitely flirting with you now since her comments are much lewder and direct now
>stuff like sitting in her lap, licking candy canes, milk and cookies innuendos, mistletoes, going down chimneys, packages/presents, eggnog, sleigh rides, come to mama Claus/claws, naughty list, etc
>she's definitely older since only a horny older woman could be this thirsty, aggressive, and lewd
>takes all your will to not pop a boner the rest of the night
>finally your shift is over, but you get cornered by a huge shadow in the employee changing rooms
>Mrs. Claus cornered you and wants you to join her at a bar
>she was imposing enough sitting down, but you get the full effect of her 9-10 foot frame now
>and what's worse she keeps the Mrs. Claus outfit on as she drags you along
>it's only been the one day and you may need to use sick days already

>holy shit it's cold
>below freezing cold
>why the fuck did you agree to go camping
>your old high school friend had invited you out to catch up, and the forecast called for unseasonable warmth for this time of year
>Kayla hummed to herself as she tossed as she dropped another couple logs onto the smoldering fire in the fire pit she had dug
>"There you go Anon! That should help you warm up."
>your teeth are chattering too hard for you to respond, so you just nod your thanks and try to shuffle closer to the fire
>"Honestly Anon, you should be more prepared! Didn't even bring a full jacket."
>easy for her to say when her fur is enough insulation for a trip to antarctica
>she laughs
>"Aw, poor Anon, you wish you had fur, don't you? Don't worry, I can share."
>Kayla sits down and puts an arm around you to pull you into her side
>normally you'd be freaking out over close contact with the opposite sex, but after a moment pressed against Kayla you're far too warm to care
>she giggles as you practically melt into the embrace
>"I never got why you were so afraid of getting close to anthros, Anon. You seem to like it now."
>your face burns a little, and your mumble out that you were just cold
>"Sure thing Anon. Just sit close and let me take care of you."
>you spend the rest of the evening wrapped up with Kayla, reminiscing about times in your old hometown, and catching up with each others lives
>but soon the night grows deep, and the fire gutters once again
>"Mmh, I don't think I wanna get up, Anon, but you'll start to freeze again without that fire."
>you agree, it was getting pretty late anyways and surely you'd be warm enough in your sleeping bag
>"I dunno Anon, I think it's just gonna get colder in the night. Maybe you should just sleep with me tonight. To be safe."
>whoa
>now is the time for freaking out
>you mean, you don't want to be trouble
>she doesn't have to share with a chilly human
>"Oh it's no trouble, Anon. Come on!"
>Kayla grabs you from under your arms and pulls you up to your feet as she stands
>before you can escape her, the tall wolfess's arms go around you, and she rests her head on top of yours
>from that position she marches you to her tent and ushers you inside
>you turn back to make one last excuse
>and she's taking her shirt off
>it must be a miracle your jaw didn't fall off your face
>it takes you several seconds to stop staring at her bare chest, her nipples standing out from her fur in the cold--
>stop! staring!
>you manage to look to the ground, apologizing for staring
>Kayla laughs at you again
>"You too dummy! Down to your skins, or you'll roast in the sleeping bag."
>you hesitate
>"Trust me Anon. It's for your own good."
>you nod and start to undress, doing your best not to ogle Kayla while she finishes throwing aside her pants
>she was going commando today
>once you're undressed, you feel her arms go around you again, and her warm breath tickles your ear
>"Good boy~"
>you're so dumb
>this was her plan all along
>and you fell for it
>thank god you fell for it
>Kayla drags you down onto her sleeping bag, before drawing it over the two of you and zipping it closed
>you're almost completely covered now, only a little bit of your head exposed, tucked into the crook of her neck
>her hands go to your hips and draw you back
>you feel her breasts pressing against your back, and her leg wrapping over you so you can't escape
>once you're wholly trapped in the wolfess's snare, her hands start to wander, the soft pads teasing your chest, rolling over your stomach, and tracing inside your thighs
>"I've got you now, Anon. You're all mine~"

>Working as a groomer in a town with a larger than normal anthro population isn't an easy job, but damn does it pay the bills with all the tips you get from happy clients
>You never even anticipated working this gig for longer than a few months, you sent a bunch of applications out to random places after getting your, in retrospect, completely worthless degree and this place just so happened to be the first one to give you an interview
>Yet here you are, two years later cutting fur like no ones business and taking fat wads of shampoo scented cash home everyday
>Sure all your friends thought you were gay for working at a salon, but hey, fuck em!
>You finish up the styling on one of your regular clients, wishing her a safe trip home before staring at the clock
>04:51, just a few minutes before closing time
>You begin disinfecting and putting your instruments away but the door chime at the entrance rings
>In walks a 7 foot tall middle aged brown bear woman wearing a thin sun dress, fur long and slightly unkempt
>You gulp as you view the thick coffee colored coat on this woman and walk up to the entrance, wishing the entire time all she wants is a quick trim job
>"Welcome, what can we do for you today?"
>please just be a quick trim please just be a quick trim please just be a quick trim
>"Oh I was hoping to get the full treatment, the one advertised on the sign out there? I'm not too late am I?"
>You know the sign she's talking about, it was put up for the salon's summer special, a fur trim and styling, wash, and full nail trim and coloring
>All for a price you aren't sure how the business made any money on.
>Well she did technically enter the store within business hours and according to company policy you are required to fulfill her request, looks like you aren't going home at a decent hour tonight
>"No, we can still do it, why don't you take a seat over there?" You point to your empty station
>"Oh excellent, I hope I'm not too much of a bother coming in so late." She states with what could only be described as subtly hidden glee, odd
>Your only other coworker finishes up cleaning up her station and passes you on the way out, the young human giving you a mischievous smile before opening her mouth
>”Good luck anon, be safe on the drive on the drive home since it’ll be midnight before you get out of here.”
>”Tell me about it, I’ll be more coffee than man tomorrow morning.”
>You exchange goodbyes before walking back to your station, the bear woman sitting patiently in the padded seat, hands on her lap
>You retrieve your grooming instruments and decide to make some idle conversation while getting your things ready
>”So, you ever been here before?”
>“Oh yes, plenty of times, though I don’t seem to recall seeing a handsome young man like you working here before.”
>You smile, the polite compliments from older women usually came after they saw what you did to their coats, but you don’t mind if she’s a little early on the trigger
>”I only work Sunday through Thursday, you probably come in some other time.”
>”That explains it, I usually drop by Friday after work but with work being so hectic recently I can’t do that anymore.”
>“Well Sunday is a good time to drop by, we aren’t that busy.”
>She looks around the empty salon, eyes taking in all the empty chairs
>”You don’t say, but to be honest I like this one salon in particular for it’s employees.”
>”Oh thanks, we do have the best service around if our customer reviews are to be believed.”
>”Yes you do have good service, but what I like the most is that they employee so many humans here.”
>You pause for a brief moment at the strangeness of her statement
>”Oh, uhh, ya, I guess there are a lot of us here. Some anthros say we have a better eye for color than most species.”
>”I don’t know about that, what I like the most are your soft fingers, so supple and agile, It’s incredibly relaxing when a human runs their fingers through thick fur like mine.”
>You chuckle nervously, what game was she playing here?
>”Well ma’am I’m sure by the end of today your coat will be softer than my fingers could ever hope to be.”
>She turns her head to look at you, a devious look in her dark eyes
>”I guess we’ll just have to see about that when you’re done, now won’t we?”
>”I uhh, guess we will.” You stammer out.
>Staying silent to prevent any more awkward conversation, you get your scissors ready but notice her earrings
>”Oh, sorry ma’am but could you remove your earrings for me? I don’t want them getting in the way of the scissors.”
>”You can call me Charlotte sweetie, enough of this ma’am business. And unfortunately I can’t because, well…”
>She raises her hand to you, her claws clearly being a little too overgrown for her fingers to make the fine movements to remove them
>”I see, guess that’s why you wanted the full treatment huh? I can remove them for you if you wish.”
>”Nothing would make me happier.”
>You put your scissors down and place a couple fingers on the back of the earring, you’re about to pull the backing off when her ear suddenly flicks forward
>”Sorry about that, my ears tend to flick when something touches them, involuntary reflexes. You can just grab them to keep them still.”
>Odd, most anthros seemed perfectly capable of stopping their ears from flicking when you were around them
>You place two fingers on her fuzzy ear and remove the earring’s backing, you can’t help but notice her eyes slowly close and a dreamy look appear on her face the second your digits touch her fur
>You repeat the process for the other ear and pick up your scissors, silently getting to work on trimming her while trying to ignore her odd behavior
>You’re just about done turning her furry face into a masterpiece when she suddenly lowers the shoulders of her sundress, her cleavage now plainly visible
>”Sweetie, when you get my arms done do you think you could get my lower neck too?”
>Something of an odd request, most anthros would prefer to trim fur that low themselves but fine, you were probably going to get a bigger tip for doing it anyway
>”It would be my pleasure.”
>You didn’t mean for your response to sound so suggestive, it just kind of came out that way.
>Her arms trimmed you now move to her shoulders and neck, taking incredible care not to stare down her cleavage or at her plump breasts, god damn they look so soft though
>Out of the corner of your eye you spot a sly grin appear on Charlotte’s face when you gradually work lower and lower on her chest, you’re almost sure she’s pulling her dress lower every time you look away to clean your scissors
>Trimming complete, it was now time to wash her fur
>You recline her chair and turn it so her head was now above your station’s sink
>You deposit a sizable dollop of hair product onto your hand and suddenly remember what she said about supple human hands, oh god, here we go, no stopping now
>You place yourself beside her head and wet her hair before beginning, the irony that you were literally making her wet was not lost on you
>Her fur sufficiently moist, you slowly move your hand over to her head and begin lathering, her eyes closing again and a soft smile appearing on her dark droopy lips
>The process is thankfully quick and straightforward, as long as you ignore the pleasured moans coming from her large diaphragm and smile gradually growing larger as your hands move through her silky coat
>With her head, arms, and neck covered in bubbly suds you slowly rinse her off, renewed fur now gaining a healthy shine and more vibrant color
>You get the towel out to dry her off but her hand shoots up and grabs your wrist
>”Honey, you think you could give me another pass with the shampoo? An older woman like me needs as much volume as she can get.”
>If the amount of fluff she had when she walked in was any indication she most definitely didn’t need the extra volume, but then again maybe she was just being self-conscious
>”Sure, but it’ll be an extra charge.”
>”You can charge me as much as you want. As. Much. As. You. Want.” She says, a seductive tone in her voice and sultry look in her eyes
>Her paw tightens against your wrist as she waits for you to respond, in fact you’re worried if you don’t say something she may just jump up and have her way with you right here and now
>”Tell you what, for you? It’s on the house.”
>Her paw releases your wrist
>”Thanks sweetie.”
>You wash her fur once more, the moans becoming less subtle with every movement of your hands
>Once again you get the towel out and this time she refrains from requesting another wash, you wipe down her soft fur and then blow dry it to finish, noticing a sizable increase in it’s softness and volume, good lord she must have felt better than the teddy bear you had as a child
>”Okay Charlotte, the nail trimming and coloring is next, what color of nail polish do you want?”
>She places a hand on the bottom of her muzzle as she thinks, after several seconds she finally comes up with a response
>”I want something erotic”
>”…Excuse me?”
>She stares deeply into your eyes
>”I said, something erotic. Something that elevates a woman to the point that any young bachelor simply can’t resist her. Something that lights the fire in both their hearts, ending with the kind of love that has to be cleaned up with a mop and bucket.”
>She moves her head closer to your own and puts a clawed hand on your shoulder, you can feel every exhale from her shiny black nose
>”You know what kind of color that is, don’t you?”
>Your heart races, you blink nervously, your brain comes up with a default response
>”R-red?” The word barely exits your mouth
>She gives a devilish grin before responding
>”Red should be nice, but what shade of red are you going to use?”
>Fuck, you barely know the names of any of those esoteric shades that all look too similar to one another, but you do know one that seems to be a favorite among clients
>”Scarlet red?”
>”Do you like scarlet red?”
>You shake your head in an affirmative
>”Then scarlet red it is.”
>She finally moves her head away form yours, placing it back onto the padded headrest of the chair, a satisfied smile on her maw
>Deep breaths anon, you’ll get through tonight with most of your limbs intact if you’re lucky
>You both move to a nail station and you sit down across from her, she presents a clawed hand and you receive it, your palm behind her fingers and thumb in front
>First things first, you really need to file down those massive curved claws of hers
>Yet when it comes to anthros they tend to be pretty touchy about their own sharpness and length, mothers may want short and dull to prevent errant scratches on their babes while a soldier may want long and sharp for obvious reasons
>”Length and sharpness Charlotte?”
>”Moderate length, but sharp as you can make them”
>Not the most common combo but okay
>You get the roughest file you have on hand and get to work, eventually turning her finger mounted spears into moderately sized claws, sharp as what your tools will allow and ending in a deadly looking point
>You then get the nail polish out and coat all 10 of her newly sharpened claws in a bright red scarlet shining brilliantly against the overhead lights
>”Okay Charlotte, we’re all done here. You can walk up with me to the front and we can-“
>”Not so fast! Do you have a full body mirror around here? I want to survey your work before we discuss payment.”
>Discuss payment? Now what could she possibly mean by that?
>”Sure, uhh, there’s one right over here.”
>The two of you walk over to a mirror on the side of the room
>She strikes a few poses while looking herself over and running her fingers through her fur, her face staying in a neutral expression the whole time, eventually she presents her palm to you and speaks
>”Hand”
>”What?”
>”You said my fur would be softer than your hand by the time you were done. Now give me your hand” She commands
>You place your hand on hers and she grabs it, rubbing it on the side of her muzzle
>”I don’t know anon, I think your hand is softer than the fur up here, but what about…”
>She drags your hand lower on her body, across her cheek, down the neck, stopping right on the cusp of one of her breasts
>”You’re still softer, it’s not looking good for you anon, but maybe a little lower…”
>Your hand is dragged under her dress and onto her breast, your pants now struggling to contain the erection growing in your pants
>You take the initiative and squeeze her breast with your hand, a moan equal parts surprise and pleasure escaping her lips
>”Charlotte, I think you got me beat there”
>She removes your hand from under her dress and releases it before grabbing your shoulders
>”Well then anon, guess that you deserve a pretty big tip…”
>She slowly moves her head closer to yours as she speaks
>”I don’t have much money, but maybe, I coul-“
>The military would call your next move a preemptive strike
>Your head shoots up to meet hers as you plant a sloppy kiss on her lips, when her surprise wears off she returns the act with twice the ferocity
>Now covered in each other’s saliva, you break off the kiss and look her in the eye
>”Charlotte, forget about tips, I’ll give you the whole thing”
>The look in her eye tells you there’s no way in hell you would be going home at a decent hour tonight, and that she wasn’t lying about the mop and bucket

>Start dating alligator woman
>you know she's an alligator and not a crocodile because her snout is on the short end
>still too long for kisses to be easy, but then again love never is
>the two of you find a way
>at one point she leans forward to kiss you and misses
>her slightly open maw ends up colliding with your neck
>sharp teeth faintly graze several vital arteries
>your entire body locks up by instinct, every part of you is stiff as a board
>EVERY part of you
>she pulls back to apologize, but trails off when she notices your blush
>among other things
>you both laugh it off, think that's the end of it
>the next time you meet she does it again, this time fitting your shoulder between the first few pairs of teeth
>your heart stops beating for a moment
>blood rushes to your head, start to feel absurdly dizzy as her breath washes over sensitive muscle
>her eyes are firmly locked onto yours when she leans away, brows slightly raised
>you try to laugh it off again, maybe a little louder than you meant to
>she doesn't join in until a few seconds later
>hoping and praying this is the last time it ever happens
>spoiler alert: it isn't
>about a week later, the two of you are watching a movie together on her couch
>she steals glances at you whenever there's nothing interesting on screen
>whatever, that's normal couple stuff right?
>after the 6th or so time you return the gesture because you think it's cute
>she immediately looks at you when you do
>you freeze, unable to shake the feeling that you've just been caught doing something you shouldn't have
>the feeling that you've somehow made a horrible mistake
>without breaking eye contact, she presses the pause button and scoots toward you
>you have no idea what you're supposed to say or do in this situation, and settle on smiling awkwardly
>she puts her knees on the couch once she's close, practically crawling the last few inches
>fear begins to grip your heart like a vice, but you do your best not to lean back anyway
>your efforts prove to be in vain when she presses a hand into your shoulder, pinning you to the couch with her sheer weight
>her muscle doesn't come into play until you try to move, and her arm shoves you even further into the plush cushions
>you're not going anywhere
>she looms over you like a scaly storm cloud, blocking out the already dim lights overhead
>her reptilian eyes narrow, slitted pupils boring holes into your own with predatory focus
>slowly, her jaws spread apart, plentiful rows of ivory on display
>they're too thick to be called needles. From here, they look more like steak knives
>a low, rumbling noise spills from her lips, like the revving engine of a pickup truck
>she lowers herself, making it all the louder as her prey draws near
>and then, without warning, it swells to a bestial staccato as her jaws clap down on your jugular
>teeth are driven into your veins, arresting the flow of blood
>your arteries squished like water balloons, their contents threatening to spill at any moment
>tendons are stretched to their breaking point, straining to accommodate the pikes digging into them
>each individual tooth is a sensation of its own, a different part of your body that could be torn apart like string cheese at any possible moment
>you can feel all the little things you never could before, every drop of blood struggling to squeeze past the grisly spikes invading your throat
>it would only take one of them to pierce you, and your life would be over in seconds
>you are intimately aware of each and every one as your life rests trapped between them
>but then she pulls away
>the imprints of her maw remain long after she leaves, a reminder of her dominion over your body
>at some point her bellowing must have stopped, but you couldn't hear it over the drumming in your ears
>you feel dizzy as she takes hold of your arms, reeling you into a waiting embrace
>it's so soft, gentle, and yet not unlike the way her jaws caressed your flesh moments ago
>clawtips dance along your back, tracing a path down your spine as she rests her snout against your ear
>"If I was a crocodile, you'd be dead."
>you're both fully aware that the difference was trivial
>you've seen the way she eats, snapping bones like pretzel sticks and tearing through meat like paper
>it would have been so easy, so very easy for her to ruin you with a mere fraction of her strength
>and yet she didn't
>there isn't a single scratch on you. Not a cut, scrape or bruise.
>for all her strength, she touches you so gently, like a precious fabric that might be shredded with the slightest error
>because she loves you
>and you love her
>...
>"Of course, that doesn't mean I won't draw blood from time to time."
>uh oh

>anthros have big paw-like hands
>good for fighting and survival
>but not so good for things that need a lot of dexterity
>stuff that requires a lot of writing, fine stitch work in sewing, clock making, metal work with small objects or small detailing, surgery, etc
>humans on the other hand have very dexterous hands, but lack in survival abilities with no claws, small fangs, poor night vision, no fur/feathers/scales, and weak sense of smell
>so humans get protection by working for anthros and the anthros get to reap the benefits of human hands

>Humans are the only ones that can play instruments like the guitar or violin
>A human composing a song for an anthro is considered one of the most romantic gestures possible no matter how good the music actually is
>Cut to a disgruntled bard getting harassed by beast women to make music for them for the 10th time today, constantly having to refuse their suggestions on how to "improve" the lyrics by replacing prose with tons of crude sexual innuendos and incessantly asking him if he knows any songs with lyrics about anthros sexually assaulting prudish human bards

>human bards operating in anthro territory have to quickly learn songs popular among anthros
>the usual stuff of old wars, myths, heroic deeds, and such
>and of course drinking songs and dirty limericks that taverns and bars love
>they also quickly learn how humans are viewed among anthros mostly from the lewd bar songs
>pretty much all of them are about how easy human boys are beast women, how much they like fur, seducing them from human women, etc

>tragidy strikes the human kingdom and pretty much destroys/ruins it
>maybe a massive war, plague, famine, magical disaster, etc
>surviving humans flee the land and into the various anthro territories/kingdoms seeking refuge
>the various anthros now have a bunch of desperate humans in their kingdoms/territories
>which means they get to take advantage of that desperation
>obviously the ones with useful skills like smithing, sewing, medical, etc get grabbed up fast
>but not every human will have a valuable skill to bargain with
>which means they'll be more desperate to find work/money
>signing away their life to be servants and such
>and the more unsavory types swoop in
>brothels convincing boys to work for them or human guys being forced into brothel work by crooks
>speaking of, the various criminal anthro groups get in on taking advantage and get new smuggling runners, poor indebted bastards, etc
>imagine a human family living in some ghetto in an anthro kingdom that's more or less support by their son working at brothel and having beast women wreak him everyday

>Being adopted by lesbian Vixen wives in a time where humans are often discriminated
>You were only adopted by them because Mom 2 felt pity for you and deserve more love as much as any anthro kid
>But Mom 1 never liked this scenario
>She wanted to adopt a pure bread Vixen like herself
>Mom 1 is always having a hard time having family dinner outings considering humans aren’t allowed in anthro restaurants and better off going to human-owned restaurants, where it’s given a lower cheaper budget
>Anthros always looking at you that it makes you uncomfortable so you had to bring your hyena gf to comfort you
>She’s the only one that actually likes you
>You hear your vixen moms arguing each other at night
>Mom 1 rants about how their marriage and life would be simpler if she adopted an anthro instead of a “creature that makes it harder for us to co-exist with”
>Mom 2 argues that you’re not a burden to this family and it’s “society that makes it harder for this family to try to enjoy”
>Mom 1 complains how “humans live in poorly built, ghetto-like neighborhood and how cheap their business is compared to anthros”
>Your gf and mom 2 are the only ones that actually care for your mental health
>So why can’t Mom 1 do the same?
