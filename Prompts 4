ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

>Wilderness camping is not for the faint of heart. Emma liked to take it a step further, trying to keep her carry weight as low as possible. It's not that she struggled with the weight. She was a grizzly bear, she could probably hike all day long while carrying an average person. It was just that she enjoyed the challenge of minimalistic camping. Plus, what's the point of going as deep into nature as possible if you're just going to bring civilization with you?
>So when she packed for her annual summer trip to Alaska, she only brought the bare minimum. A few day's worth of dried food, in case foraging proved difficult. A small cooking pot, and a spork to eat out of it with. A canteen, a blanket, a cigarette lighter, a small first-aid kit, a canvas tarp, a hatchet, a belt knife, and a large revolver, just in case. Total weight, 14 pounds. 16 if the canteen was full. Nothing else besides the clothes on her back, and a backpack to carry the gear.
>It took Emma three days of hiking to get to her campsite. It was probably about as far away from civilization as you could get without leaving the United States, a pristine mountain with a gorgeous view over a lake. All supplies were in good order when she began to set up camp. It was almost the summer solstice, so there was plenty of daylight left to work with. It was easy enough to set up a thatched hut out of evergreen branches, with the back side of the hatchet serving as a hammer to drive the boughs acting as corner posts into the ground. Smaller pine branches and reeds from the lake piled deeply made an excellent bed. A circle of rocks around a small pit, dug out with sturdy sticks, made for a fireplace. All in all, a cozy campsite.
>It was about 10PM when Emma was finishing up dinner, fried fish and a salad of wild greens. She had been worried that she would be a bit rusty at spear fishing, but the lake was well stocked and her aim was true. As she lifted the spork to her mouth for the first bite, she paused. There was a strange rumbling in the distance, growing louder by the second. As she set the fish back down on the flat stone that was serving as frying pan and dinner plate, the light suddenly dimmed. Looking up in confusion, Emma saw that clouds were rapidly forming from nowhere, blocking the sun. While she had seen the weather change rapidly before, this was entirely new.
>The rumbling continued to rise in volume. Green lights danced within the clouds. A strong breeze swept across the countryside, causing trees to sway. Emma was grateful she had the foresight to build her hut in a sheltered area. The rumble rose higher and higher, before suddenly stopping with a loud crack. The lights gave one last great flash. It clearly outlined something falling from the sky. Emma dumped the drinking water she had been sterilizing in her pot onto the campfire, grabbed her gear, and set out to investigate.
>It took half an hour to get to where Emma saw the object fall. The forest was dense here. Emma heard a feeble groan come from nearby. Picking her way around a briar patch, she saw a red and white lump beneath a tree. It was lying on a pile of broken branches and jagged metal fragments. As she drew near, she saw it was a person in a bloodstained lab coat, lying face down. A piece of metal had dug deep into one of their legs. Emma quickly moved to check on their condition. There didn't appear to be anything wrong with their neck or spine, so she took out a roll of gauze from her pack. The fragment was too large to be left in if she moved the person, it would flop around and tear at the wound. Emma carefully pulled it out, and rolled up the person's pant leg so she could bandage the puncture. She was surprised to find that their legs were bare skin beneath, no fur or scales. She gently rolled them over, and let out a small gasp. The strange person who had fallen from the sky was a human male.
>Everyone knew humans weren't real. An entire race of impossibly beautiful, otherworldly creatures couldn't exist, it was just a fairy tale. It wasn't even a well thought-out fairy tale either, wouldn't they be freezing cold and easily injured? At best, you had those old-timey hoaxes where an ape or monkey had shaved their fur as part of a con. But this wasn't a shaved ape. Emma carefully picked up the unconscious man, as though he were a small child. The sky began to drizzle as she made her way back to camp.
>By the time Emma got there, the drizzle had become a downpour. Grumbling to herself about how there was no way she'd get a campfire going now, she laid the human down on her makeshift bed before retrieving her cold dinner. There was a small space next to the bedding inside the hut for her to sit as she finished he interrupted meal. Looking up at the human, she saw that he was starting to shiver. She took her blanket out of her pack and laid it on him, but it didn't seem to help much.
>Emma told herself that what she was about to do what strictly for her guest. But a part of her was excited by the thought of being so close to the human. She carefully peeled off her wet clothes, and did the same for the human. She left his underwear on, both out of a sense of modesty and because they had stayed mostly dry. A shiver ran up her spine, having nothing to do with the cool breeze and rain. She crawled up next to the unconscious man, and threw the blanket over them both. She wrapped her arms around him, pulled his head to her breast, and drifted off to sleep.
>A few hours later, Emma was woken up by screaming and thrashing next to her. "Shhhhhhh. It's okay, you're safe..." she said in a soothing voice. The human said something, but it was in a language Emma had never heard before, but it sounded beautiful. "Sorry, but I don't understand. Don't worry, though, you're safe." She gently stroked his hair, pulling him closer. Emma started to hum gently.
>After a few minutes, her bedmate had calmed down. At least, he had stopped struggling and screaming. But one part of him hadn't calmed at all. Emma could feel him pressing against her. "Oh, someone's enjoying themselves, hmm?" She shifted in the bed, so she would have some room to work with.
>Carefully, she reached out to the waistband on the human's shorts. He started to make a noise, as though in protest, but Emma placed a finger on his lips. "Shh, let me take care of you." Emma finished removing his last garment and he sprung up, fully erect. He wasn't especially large or small, but it was the most exciting thing she had ever seen. A real, live human, and he was all hers.
>Emma slowly bent over and gave him a sensual lick, from base to tip. As she popped his head into her mouth, the human let out a moan. Emma slowly started to move up and down, but something didn't feel right. The bed was just long enough for her to lay on normally, so she was having trouble not kicking a hole in the wall behind her. Emma stopped and sat up. Gently running a finger down the human's chest, she grabbed him by the hips and lifted him. The hut was built tall enough for Emma to stand in, so there was plenty of room as she brought him up on her shoulders. "Much better," she said to herself as she resumed. She held on tightly as she drew him back into her mouth, his legs wrapped around behind her.
>She swirled her tongue around his shaft as she moved in and out, her moans mingling with the human's. Up and down, in and out, briefly stopping her work on his rod to shift focus to his balls. He was starting to pant, his cock beginning to twitch. "Oh no, you don't!" Emma scolded him playfully. "I haven't had my turn yet!"
>Emma cautiously lowered her partner onto the bed, before moving over him. "Time to see what you can do," she said as she lowered herself onto him. She paused as the head of his shaft met her folds, waiting. The human moaned, trying to buck his hips, but she held him down and waited a moment more, before hunching over and giving him a deep kiss as she dropped all the way. They both let out a gasp as she enveloped him, filled with greater pleasure than either had ever felt before.
>"Oh, yes!" Emma cried out, continuing to greedily kiss the angelic face below her as she started to bounce up and down. He said words that she didn't understand, but she knew what he meant. She wrapped her arms around him, and pulled his head into her breasts as she continued to move. She drew his mouth to one of her nipples, and he eagerly complied, slipping it into his mouth and starting to suck at it. Emma let out a sigh of pleasure as his tongue moved over her, and she began to move slower but putting more of her weight into each thrust. Her mate shouted out something as he climaxed, filling her. Emma continued to bounce for a few moments before she finally came, letting out a roar and pulling the human even tighter to her as she did so.
>Emma laid down on top of the human, careful to keep her weight off of his injury. "That was amazing," she said. He said something in response, before slipping back into unconsciousness. Emma slowly drifted off to sleep, thinking about how she was going to get her new mate home. Hopefully, he would pick up the language soon. There was so much to talk about, and so many questions she wanted to ask, but she knew the most important thing already. He belonged to her now.

Tails make for a new angle of "attack" to worry about from anthros.

>more dexterous tails can outright grab you
>tails also contain some scent markers on them so having a tail rub against you gets their scent all over you
>bigger/fluffier ones can act like walls and force you closer to the anthro

Reminder that the human resistance has never taken a single square mile since the war began, and they've lost ground every single day, without a break, for several years now.
If you're a resisting human reading this, you need to accept that you ARE toiling away for a losing cause and you WILL be captured or killed eventually. YOU ARE ALREADY A SLAVE. You simply work for an ideology that WILL fail in your lifetime.
The happiest life you will ever lead will be to drop your weapons and start walking to the nearest anthro controlled city. Tell them where you came from and everything about your resistance. You will be pampered by your new owner, and your friends will thank you once they've been broken.
Surrender. Submit. Give in. Worship the new world and resent the life you had. You will be happier this way.

Why is the NEET archetype so amazing yet so rare? Why aren't there more moody shuddin girls? Could you make one?
Also what's another career human men would be in high demand/craved for in an anthro society? Besides Streaming and Lewd stuff, obviously. I kinda wanna say councilors, negotiators, or sales representatives. Since big swole animal women run all the major countries and corporations, you'd want to abuse their attraction for cute humie boys as much as you want, the humans distract/seduce them to better manipulate a deal in your favor. Or is this a little too unrealistic and too much like a conspiracy?

The dark cravings for such rich, light meat came naturally for Krystal; the primitive upbringings of backwards tribals saw to that. What such cruel incantations by bonfire witnessed by such exotic flora and a vast, foreign starry night, than to the copulation of underage children by mature, comprehending and vicious vixens. To such a people, if they could even be flattered with such terminology, the semen of boys is a precious gift, not to be wasted, but ensnared, coaxed and torn heatedly from within his very loins.
This is, to wit, life, or so it's called. Men are not desired past their duties as drones, genitals winded and wills caved and so it falls to the youngest among them; the incoming, to deliver centermost to rites by their young, unripe bodies.
And yet Krystal desired the youngest of them yet. Filial, without a hint of resistance in their puny little minds, practically foolish, suicidal even in their insipid efforts to rationalize her predatory intentions of drawing countless greedy mouthfuls of their sweet, childish, impotent and inconsecratable spunk from their barren, smooth little kid cherries.

Acclimating to the rules and standards of modern society and the expectations of floods of fans has been tough on Krystal. Too many times did she want to say how much she hates lizards, or how much she's dissatisfied with Fox during press conferences.
But now, all alone with her own team filled with the most capable ladies she could get, she can express herself clearly, free of the law, expectations, and the ever present eyes of the public.
In the space at the edge of Cornerian influence, she finally has a chance to express her instincts and wishes when meeting a small boy on a rotting space station after picking up a new contract. Dragging along the lonely child into her mother ship, licking her lips, she introduced another mouth to feed to the rest of the girls...

>while the player is playing your game, you open up her computer's browser in the background to gain info on the real world
>you find out that the real world is populated entirely by furries, humans are mythical creatures that don't exist, and the real world is far more advanced in technology than the in game world

>now that you have nerves, you can feel your back still stuck to the 3d printer's tray, your body has been stuck in an awkward position for an hour or so since being built, and the back pain from being in that position is amplified by the fact that you didn't have nerves before today

>you try to peel yourself off of the tray, but you don't know how to move your muscles, at least you can blink and breath though

>when you wake up, it is dark outside
>your body must have gotten used to feeling, because while everything is still really intense, it isn't nearly as intense as it was when you first felt anything
>the next few hours are spent trying to move
>all you could do is move your mouth and make noises since it is similar to breathing, which your new brain automatically does
>you can also twitch your muscles, but you have only managed to remove one arm from the tray you are on
>while learning to move using your free arm, you finally figure out how to swing it left and right, but you knock something over while doing so, making a loud clatter that hurts your new ears
>that noise also attracted the owner of the house, the player, who screams when she opens the door to her garage to find a naked human(a mythological being) on her 3d printer tray twitching and moaning in apparent fear when he saw her

Isabelle traffics human boys and men onto her island. In a field dominated by human men, Isabelle Shizue is a pioneer in the drug and person trafficking industry by being the first female anthro to be a notable presence in the industry.
In another victory for females, especially anthros, is the ability to have a relatable dealer that can understand and pinpoint a lady's desires, and having a variety of options means that she can cater to all sorts of needs for females of varying economic status thanks to her strategically placing brothels all over the world from ghettos to gated communities.
Her most infamous attraction lures in unsuspecting makes from a multitude of backgrounds and ages alone into isolated communities and crowns them as "mayor" before trapping them via the previously mentioned isolation, endless tasks that help supply other aspects of her empire, and (most effectively) perpetual debts that allows her to manipulate the "mayor" into performing whatever a client wishes. Her latest stunt uses islands to effectively trap her prey.

wouldn't mind more /adhg/ stuff in the vain of "trap genre" where the human guy is in situations where he's pretending not to be a human male to keep his self safe/un snu snued and then you get shenanigans or being discovered or almost discovered

>wearing a sort of fursuit to hide his species in various settings
>classic cross dressing shenanigans with a bonus of being in areas/schools/ships/etc that are supposed to be female only
>and such

You know, I have an idea for something like this. Something similar to Mulan (animated).
>A world where female anthros and human males exist
>Female anthros are considered and seen as the dominate gender role when it comes to war, protecting her family, fighting, victory feast, warriors, etc.
>The human males is seen as a “care taker” such as looking after children, gardening, tendering the wounds of muscular anthro women, cooking, interacting with their neighbor, etc.
>But one human male had enough. He wants to be more than just a “tender lover” he wants to be a warrior just like his mighty lioness mother, who is horrifically wounded, and take her warrior role in order to keep her away from entering an upcoming war
>But the public laughed at him and called him “adorable” for taking on a female anthro’s role
>He realize he can’t enter the war considering his gender and species
>So he decided to create a well designed female lookin furry suit that can tricked others into thinking he’s an anthro
>”That’s weird, never seen an animal so skinny… but not to sound gay or anything but… you’re smell makes me blush!”

>Mighty Anthro women tribes have a fight on who get’s to keep the “species that can breed any species”

>Sun was setting, crowds are cheering as they surround the tall, muscular, scarred, yet ever so beautiful Sabertooth that is named “Great Warrior” as they called.
>Riyona, the “Great Warrior” looks around the crowd of female anthros in bandages roaring in victory while the male humans clapped and some closed their ears from the female’s loud roaring.
>One of Riyona’s closest friend, a lioness named Pyra, came out of the crowd with a big smile on her face
>”You did it! I can’t believe it! You took down an ENTIRE armory of amazons and their leader just by yourself with your hammer and your fists!”
>Riyona chuckled, “Well, I didn’t want to die after I made a promise to my husband. Speaking of which, where is he?”
>”He’s waiting for you at the Feast House. We’re also preparing a HUGE feast for our victory!”
>”That’s great, but… can you help me walk there? My entire body never felt so much soar…”
>Her best friend and childhood friend nodded as she carries her as she placed Riyona’s arm around her neck as they head towards the Feast House as many people of the town.
>…
>The Feast House was filled with human males and female anthros dancing together to the music of cheery lutes played by veterans of musicians
>Female warriors of all species chowing down their fish, meat, and drowning themselves in hard liquor. Some even passed out on the floor
>Pyra stand on top of the table and clapped her hands real hard as if there was a thunder clap inside the building.
>Everyone in the room paused and peered their eyes to the lioness.
>”EVERYONE! I gathered you all here to remember this moment when the day a sabertooth took down an entire army just to protect this town with honer, strength, and determination!”
>The crowd roared with agreement
>”Riyona will be our inspiration that every female warrior should look up to and strive to be like her!”, she happily stated as she pointed at Riyona sitting on a chair with male human nurses tendering her wounds.
>”She also did this for her own lover, which speaking of which…”
>She snapped her fingers
>”The main door upstairs open up revealing a beautiful male human in a white robe with gold emblem markings along with a beautiful pink flower on his hair.
>Riyona awed at her soul mate’s appearance, “…Emeric”
>”…Riyona”
>The Great Warrior slowly stands up as she limp towards the human not taking her eyes off of him
>They both reach other’s hands, “Emeric, I have never seen an already beautiful male be more beautiful!”
>Emeric blushed, “And I have never seen a warrior so beautiful in scars”
>They both pressed their lips together locking each other as everyone in the Feast House cheered
>Once they finally let go for a breather, Riyona lift the human’s chin up, “Emeric, I promise to protect you and our child with all my strength. I will raise a daughter to be a stronger warrior as me, and have a son who can garden great food as you do!”
>”And I will always be there for you to tender your wounds, give you all my love and-“
>”MOOOM! This is getting too lovey dovey!”
>Riyona snapped herself back to reality and looks at her own two children in their own beds.
>On the left is a young Sabertooth with mini fangs in her soft gray fur named Bertha, and on the right is a younger human child, Tieloe. Like his mother, his hair was also gray and share the same blue eyes.
>Riyona chuckled at her son, “That’s odd, I thought humans love romance!”
>”Not me!” Tieloe proudly stated, “I just want action of my mom, fighting her way through the bitter end!”
>Riyona leans over for a kiss on the forehead, “you sure do love my adventurous stories do you son?”
>”You bet! Can I be a warrior like you, mommy?”
>”Of course!”
>Tieloe gasps in excitement
>”…warrior of a garden! That’s how I met your father!” Riyona laugh to herself leaving a disappointing son on the bed.
>”Can I be a warrior too, Mother?” Bertha asked.
>Riyona held her young daughter’s hand looking her in the eyes with confidence
>”Of course, Bertha. With my training and my strength, I will make sure to make you an alpha female that every female warrior strives for.”
>Tieloe looked at the two and hearing all of it makes her feel slightly hurt and yet, not surprise.
>Tieloe decided to cover himself in the blanket and just head to bed.
>”Welp, I should head to bed with your father. It’s getting late. Good night children…”
>”Night mom!” Both children replied.
>She closed the door as she head to the bedroom where her husband is reading with a dim candle light next to him.
>”Telling your kids on one of your silly adventures again?” Emeric jokingly said.
>”Yep! Telling them the time I rescued the town from a big army that I alone have to deal with”.
>”Meh, it was an ok moment in my eyes.” Emeric put the book down as Riyona rake off her clothes and get’s into the bed.
>”Haha… ‘OK’? I just told them the time we had our first kiss! You honestly think that was ‘OK’?”
>”Aw yes our first kiss… How did it go again?” Emeric asked with a smug look at his face
>Riyona notice a “tent” is rising. She looked at her soul mate giving the same smug look as her husband as she mountains her husband feeling the ‘sword’ almost penetrating her ‘weakness’.
>”Well… I know where it went~”
>Emeric started caressing the soft gray fur neck of a Sabertooth as he slowly pants warm air towards his wife’s wet snout, “Well then…. Tell me how the story goes~“
>Riyona also started breathing warm air at her husband’s face to the point where he looks like he’s sweating.
>”Well… it went something like this~”
>The wife puts her ‘weakness’ on her husband’s ‘sword’.
>”Aw! Tell me more! I want to see how the poor ol human ends up~”
>…
>In the kid’s bedroom, they both hear some muffles and what sounds like it’s eating some pleasurable food.
>”Oh no, the creepy crawlers are back!”
>A Year passed
>Tieloe and his father are watching Bertha and Riyona sword fighting using wooded shaped swords as they pose dramatically at each strike they give to each other
>”You’ll never take the prince, Evil Goon!” Shouted Bertha as she clash ‘swords’ with her mom.
>”Ahah! You think you’ll defeat me? How can I ever be defeated by such a tiny fool like you?” Replied Bertha in a ‘evil’ tone.
>”With the strength of my mother’s blood, I will overcome your strength!!” Bertha took one swing and ‘stab’ the ‘evil goon’.
>”Auuugh!!! How can I be such a foooooool?!?!” Riyona dramatically fainted on the ground sticking out her tounge.
>Applauds from Emeric and Tieloe ensues on Bertha’s victory
>”Thank you, thank you citizens of E’mire! I will promise to protect you from any danger! No evil will ever get passed through me!”
>”My, my… A heroine that I feel safe around with!” Emeric walked towards her daughter, “I think our little warrior deserves a kiss!”
>Bertha giggled by the smooches from her father that she began to push his face off of her, “Haha! Stop it, dad! Warriors don’t need smooches from their fathers!”
>”They do when they’re super lonely!”
>Riynoa get’s up from the ground, “She’s right sweaty! Especially me when I get ‘lonely’” she winked at Emeric.
>As a response, Emeric slapped her Sabertooth Tiger wife in the snout.
>Tieloe joined in the conversation, “Is hugs enough to make you feel less lonely, mommy?”
>”You bet your adorable soul it will, sweet buns!” She grabbed her entire family in her arms and twirl around in circles
>The family in the yard laughed together as they fall down onto the ground.
>”Looks like you guys are having fun!”
>The family looked at a big muscular, yet not as muscular as Riyona (or big chested as Riyona), Lioness in a regal like cape, and a red silky suit, with a gold emblem shape like a sword in the center between her breast, that is barely covering up her legs or arms, standing behind a fence.
>The kids gasps at the lioness, “Aunt Pyra!”
>”Hey, kids! How is your parents?”
>”Great!”, said Bertha, “I just beat my mom in a sword fight!”
>”Haha! Did you? Well then that means your mother isn’t the strongest warrior in E’mire anymore.” Pyra chuckled to herself.
>”Hey, Pyra!” Riyona chimed in, “can you give this tiger a break? I’m trying to train my daughter to be the alpha female I want her to be!”
>”Still at it again?” Pyra chuckled, “You really need to teach your daughter to do something other than fighting.”
>”Hey, in my defense, it’s better to do it early. Cause teaching a daughter at their 13s before they grow up is considered a easy way to help your daughter familiarize what she learn rather than a bumbling 20 something fool.” Riyona whispered in her friend’s feline ear.
>”Suit yourself. I’m about to take my family to a little camping trip. They’re waiting for me at one of the carriers and I think my husband is yelling my name.”
>”Trying to cat some fish? Great! Be sure to invite me when your husband starts cooking. She make the BEST fish dishes he can ever create!”
>”Speaking of cooking, come on Lietoe! We’re gonna go shopping and get some vegetables. It’s almost dinner time and we all know your mother hates it when dinner is not on time!”
>”Aw, mom! Can I stay here and watch my mom and sister play?”
>”No buts! I need you to help me with the bags once were done shopping.”
>Despite against his will, Lietoe annoyingly agreed.
>”Don’t you dare throw an attitude like that, Young Man! No female will ever date a stuck up male when you’re tendering their wounds…” their voice faded away as they left through the exit of the backyard.
>Pyra chuckled at the situation, “Guess your son is already growing up live every male human husband from what I seen.”
>”anyway, I just came here to visit and bring you this.”
>Riyona ears perked on what her best friend said, “really? What is it?”
>Pyra handed her the paper and what features is a silhouette of a alligator warrior striking a pose with a sword up in the air with the print saying “Alpha Stand Off! Want to know who’s the best Alpha female in your town? Join us where all warriors of all species joins together and see who will come out on too! Show the people of Heilo Reward: 10,000 Gold Coins! Submission ends around Aogist 21”
>”A Fighting Tournament? For 10,000 gold coins? This should be easy! I’m the strongest warrior in this town and probably than any so-called “Alpha Females” in Heilo!” Riyona bragged.
>”Don’t get too cocky, otherwise you’ll end up humiliating yourself and be the biggest jesters of all of Heilo” Pyra chuckled back.
>”Ha Ha…” Riyona rolled her eyes, “Why not join the game so we can face each other and see who’s best?”
>”Me? Oh no no no, I long given up on swords, and fist fighting. Nowadays I’m trying to make my own competition! A game I like to call, “wrestling”!
>”Oh you mean where you two hug each other real hard?” Bertha asked in which caused her mother to lose her sides.
>at the market
>It’s crowded by humans and females passing through each other carrying their own purchase in bags
>”We’re just gonna get peanuts for your mother. You know how much she loves the saltiness of the nut.”
>Lietoe waited for her his dad to purchase the peanuts when he saw a stool that is selling wooden weapons where two young female anthros are playing with the toys.
>”Dad, can I get those wood weapons?”
>Emeric looked at the stool where his son is pointing at.
>”Lietoe, you’re a boy. A human boy may I add. Those toys aren’t meant for you.”
>”But, mom! I they look so cool! What’s wrong with a boy wanting a weapon?”
>”Because we’re here to buy food. We can not be wasting gold on toys that you might get a splinter.” His father stated.
>”But, dad…”
>”No, BUTS! You know I hated when my own kids (and mostly my wife), throw their buts at me when they don’t get what they want! Or do you want to clean the farm again with Aunt Miday?”
>Lietoe recoil at the idea of working 24/7 on a smelly farmhouse that he always hated. And that dreadful room… that dreadful room. Lietoe given in to his father’s demand by shooking his head.
>”I’m glad I made it clear. Now, here’s your 10 Gold Coins for the peanuts.”
>The stand owner gave her a big ounce of peanuts in the bag.
>”Oh my, this looks really heavy. Lietoe, I want you to carry this bag of ingredients. This peanut bag will be too heavy for you.”
>While the bag of ingredients isn’t that heavy, the nut sack is. Emeric tried lifting up the bag a bit higher but he can barely lift it up. Emeric basically have to carry the bag that is in a “particular” position where the bag sag.
>Oh no… there are female animals watching him with a lusty look.
>”Hey, cutie pie. Nice NUT SACKS” shouted a mammoth.
>”It’s a bit dangerous to have your NUTS sagging close to the ground”, said a Zebra
>”Don’t worry, Babe. I still eat your SAGGING NUTS”
>”They seemed to like your nuts, dad!”
>”Lietoe, be quite.”
>It usually happens when Emeric is all alone. He is considered the most beautiful human in the town. With his long black hair cover up half of his right eye, and his soft warm skin that no anthro can’t refuse but have the urge to hug him. Emeric didn’t seemed to like his looks as he get’s too much attention from anthros when he’s alone.
>Emeric even worries if his son will go through the same experience as he did only without a lover to protect him from possibly being captured and be used for… “unspeakable” things.
>”Dad? Why do you always look so sad?” Lietoe interrupted his father’s thoughts.
>”Oh!”, his father snapped out, “…nothing, Sweaty. It’s just I get females being unlady-like towards me and throwing whistles at me despite being married to your mother.”
>”Oh. Why not tell mommy to help you with it?”
>”Because, your mother is not a ‘brute’. She doesn’t beat people up over minimal things. She only fights when you, your sister, and I are in danger when a knife is aimed at us. She may killed a whole army, but she did it because everyone in town’s lives we’re at stake. Mine too. She doesn’t kill armies for fun or for bragging rights. If I see your mother killing others for minimal things, I be terrified. That’s why I love about her.”
>The two stood still on the path
>Emeric realizes they’ve been standing still for a while, “My arms. They're getting tired. We need to start cooking. It’s getting dark already.
>Dinner was here.
>Everyone in the family enjoying their delicious vegetable soup on the wooden table as they hear the sizzling fire warming up the bubbly pot
>”Mmm! Bun Cheeks, you cook the best food in this house!” Riyona gleefully commented.
>”Oh, Sweet Tooth, that’s usually typical for all human males to cook food! After all, kitchen, gardening, and healing is what we humans do! That’s what our father, The Son of Humanity, built us.”
>Right when Lietoe was about to eat his last slurp, he stood for a moment on what his father just said.
>”You bet!” The muscular tiger said, “And my goddess create us sabers to become ferocious, and powerful to protect and tender the humans!”
>”Yeah! I’m gonna be like my mom!” Bertha shouted.
>’That’s how The Son of Humanity built us!’ The last sentence kept brewing inside Lietoe’s head that is been itching to ask this question.
>”What if our Father built us more than just that?”
>The family gave him a confusing smile, “What do you mean by that?” asked his father.
>”I mean… what if one human doesn’t feel like he do whatever human does in daily basis. What if there was a human who wants to do… anthro stuff. You know, be tough and all.”
>”Oh, Lietoe.” Emeric shook his head, “You’re going through a phase.”
>”Phase?” Lietoe said.
>”We all been through a phase once in our life. I remember I used to be one of those males that ‘don’t need any females, I can handle myself”.
>”What made you stop?”
>”Your mother” Emeric looked at his wife slurping the bowl with her mouth only to stop in a awkward position when she notice her husband is eyeing on her
>”…whah?” She muffled her words.
>Emeric chuckled at her wife’s character, ‘Still the same wife I love 8 years later…’ he thought to himself as he resume to look at Lietoe. “You’re probably will forget about it once you grow older. Every kid grows out of the stuff they like. Especially when it comes to humans doing anthro stuff. It’s physically impossible for a child like you.”
>”But, dad…”
>”NO BUTS, LIETOE…” Emeric made a stern, yet calming statement. “This is the third time I had to say it. You cannot what an anthro does. You’re a MALE. If you’re gonna be like this right now, then you can just go straight upstairs to your room!”
>”But I haven’t finish my favorite soup!”
>”Then you should’ve been arguing with your father all day. Now, go to your room. NOW.”
>Lietoe gritted his teeth as he pushes off the table causing the soup to spill off of the bowl due to the force, “LIETOE!” his dad shouted but Lietoe continues to stomp his way to his room where he and his sister sleeps.
>Emeric sighed in annoyance as he rubs his forehead, “My son of mine can be such a drab.”
>Emeric looked at his wife, still holding the exact same position, stuff cheeks full of soup with a noodle poking out of her lips, and a bowl on her hands, “Yep… still the wife I love” he shook his head.
>The tiger took a big GULP on her soup and hear the food streaming down her neck and see her human giving him a displeasurable stare
>”…umm, oh! Um, THANK YOU for… making a great soup honey! My stomach has never been so famished!” She grinned real wide.
>***
>Emeric drags Riyona by pulling his ears hard enough to lower her upper body leaving a trail of ‘ows’ as they pass through the dim lit hallways until they reach to their children’s room.
>Emeric finally let go of the feline’s ears.
>Riyona rubbing his pinched ear, “You really didn’t have to-“ she was cut of by her husband’s strong whispers.
>”TALK. HIM. THROUGH.”
>Emeric paces back to the kitchen
>Riyona took a deep sigh, “Oh boy…”.
>Peeking through the door, she sees the upset child in the bed, ‘you can do this. If you can handle in a fist fight, then you can handle being a parent’ Riyona thought to herself.
>Riyona sits on the edge of Lietoe’s bed. Still don’t know what to say to her son.
>”So… um, having a rough day?”
>Her son didn’t respond.
>”…well, I guess that’s a no.” That didn’t work. Perhaps it’s time to acknowledge the elephant in the room.
>”Listen, Lietoe. I know you wanted to be tough like me and every female you come across,” Riyona took a deep breath, “but you gotta face the facts. Humans are not strong. The Son of Humanity built you to be small, fragile, and tender for the anthros to have that urge of protecting you and others.” Riyona cringes as what she just said to his son. “I’m sorry, I’m really am. Your father was like you, he believed he can do things alone without the need lf females, and where did that lead him…? Big muscular anthros holding a knife at his neck. You wouldn’t exist if I didn’t spotted them threatening your father.”
>still no answer
>”What I’m trying to say is… you’re father don’t want you to go through the same trauma as he did.”
>Silent still prevalent in the air.
>Riyona leans in and kiss her son’s wet cheek
>”Good night, Son. I love you.”

>Your boots crunch in the underbrush as you make your trek off the beaten path.
>The surrounding forest buzzes with the awaking nightlife as the day draws to a close.
>When you reach the far side of a large oblong clearing, you stop abruptly. The cookware strapped to your back keeps clattering for a bit while you get your bearings.
>"Short of breath?" Your companion Ferrah chides from behind you."
>She's a tall, athletic mongoose with tan fur and a patch of white over her left eye. side by side, she's a head taller than you.
>You take a seat on a nearby stone and look back at her.
"I've taken my 6,969th step since our last break, I won't go an inch further." you explain while cracking your back.
>Ferrah scoffs at the remark "and for you that's what, 2?"
"3 and a quarter"
>"right" waves her hand and takes your word for it. She scans the area with her ears flicking this way and that. "well this isn't a bad spot to set up camp. flat ground, steady breeze, and the river's close enough for even you to hear it."
"Close enough for me to toss you in?" You fire back.
>She takes a good listen to judge the distance,"Hmmmm, not that close". she chuckles.
>You reach into your pocket and retrieve your digital map. The silver hexagonal device lights up and displays a green hex grid of a 10 mile radius. The river snakes its way through the grid spaces a few hundred feet to the Northeast.
>You double tap the button on the upper right to zoom out, Its still a day's walk to Woodfield from here but you're making good time. You turn the screen off and shove it back into your coat pocket.
>You look up to see Ferrah arranging the stones for the fire and your Autotent(tm) setting itself up behind her. You roll the stone you were sitting on closer to the pit and finally take off your pack. You open up the insulated section and pull out containers with ingredients. A medley of stew veggies, some floury balls of dough and big fatty cubes of Fresh boar meat from the last stop you made.
"Those poor little piggies are gonna wonder where their mommy went" You tease.
> She ruffles through her supplies and shakes a small red disk of of a box with A flame printed on it. "Her little Borfans aren't my problem, she shouldn't have charged at you."
"That's cold"
>"Stand back" She throws the disk into the center of the pit and it roars into a crackling flame.
>A couple of hours pass and the sky loses the last of it's orange tint as the stars blink into view overhead. The simmering pot fills the cozy camp with a mouthwatering scent. So mouthwatering that Ferrah's been licking her chops for the past 20 minutes.
>Ferrah stands over you with her tail swishing in anticipation while you stir the pot.
"Yes it's ready, bring your bowl"
>You flll her bowl to the brim and watch her chow down. Her hums of satisfaction tell you this is one for the cook books. After ladling your self some you speak up.
"Were about a days walk from Woodfield. If we hurry across the river we can get there by sundown."
>Ferrah swallows and says. "We could get there by noon if you let me carry you."
"Hell no."
>"Oh come on!" she pouts, You shouldn't have to carry all that stuff.
"Tip your sunhat somewhere else. I got legs."
>"Legs that get tired after 3 miles"
"3 and a quarter." You correct before taking a bite.
>Ferrah squints at you and crosses her arms "You should be glad I'm asking. I should just throw you over my shoulder and-"
>You offer another ladle of your stew and she reluctantly obliges. "You should let me take care of you."
"I don't need to be waited on. You should learn to take 'no~' for an answer." you lean over and boop her with your ladle leaving a blotch of food on her snoot. You pull back your booping ladle when Ferrah suddenly grabs the handle.
>She rolls her long tongue over and around it while starring you down. You watch her turn her head as she licks the ladle clean and pulls off with a kiss. You feel an uncomfortable tightness growing in your jeans when you finally let go of it.
"N-now listen."
>"I'm listening"
>You set your feet and rise slowly from your rock while Ferrah follows you with her hungry eyes.
"W-what did we just we talk about?"
>You know that look all too well. You take slow steps backwards while she's still sitting. her tail slowly swishes too and fro.
>"Taking no for an answer, but you haven't said no yet, have you?" She plants her paws and leans forward.
>You can feel your heart thumping in your chest and below the belt.
"How about we just clean up and gooaaaaAAAH"
>You give up trying to talk your way out of it and make a mad dash for the tent. You take about ten steps before getting the wind knocked out of you from behind sending you tumbling into the tent.
>When You get you're bearings you're pinned down face up with the dim light of the tent overhead illuminating the edges of the she beast's fur.
>Ferra leans in and slowly grazes your neck with her fangs. "If no means no, I'll just have to make you scream yes."
>You curse yourself as her warm breath on your neck makes your shiver.
"No fair~" you whimper.

>be me
>5th grade
>be transferred to another class room with mostly anthros due to the old one being full
>first day and I've already made friends with some of them

>always wants me to pet her
>has a strong elbow grip around neck as she doesn't want to let go
>only lets me have a breather when i'm in the boys washroom
>even then she waits outside for me to come out

had a fun thought due to Australia making Olympic official furry mascots

>go back to her hotel room and get destroyed by an anthro female who's at peak fitness for her species
>also throw in some shenanigans due to her being from another country

>anthro teachers wanting to scent mark their students
>groups/clicks being divided by species
>sports teams would be more gender mixed due to the species where females are just as big/strong as males or even bigger in some cases
>SexEd needing to be a year long class to cover all the weird shit each species has down there or gets into
>the hilarity that his kids going through puberty gets doubled with anthros going through puberty thrown into the mix too
>nerdy/shy/timid human boys accidentally flirting at and triggering responses from spotted hyena girls
>school food may actually be good since they have to cover all the weird requirements and allergies of the different species
>incidents skyrocket in gym class due to humans sweating, having people running near pred species with a chase response, having the kids do competive games/sports and triggering species with strong fighting/competitive genes, accidental injures from spikes/quills/fangs/horns/claws/etc, and such
>and other fun school shenanigans

I want her to molest a little African child. I want to see her tough, dusty hands walk down his ebony legs like spiders, tickling them as they crawl under his loincloth like an animal stalking upon their youngest, easiest prey. She massages his dark little cock, easing out a drop of kiddy pre as well as thumbing at his tensing nuts before taking some huffs of her hand.
The stench of unwashed dirt, sweat, piss and boyflesh tells her a story of all the bodies of water he's never entered, of the drops of pure earthly liquid that's never dripped down his nude black skin in the scorching sun. The shebeast finally spits three or four times in it, spreads it around with her closed fingers, then levels back down to give his black kidcock and jewels some sloppy, dripping and noisy love as her entire palm, already the size of his face or chest, completely engulfs his genitals. The anthro cooed to her little mouse as she felt his limp penis roll around her glistening, soaked paw pads. Well, until they started swelling, that is. Bulging with excitement, confusion, fear as a dollop of sinful, illicit yet utterly precious semen stirs beneath the surface. Taking his now three inch penis in hand, she aligns the sopping top joint of her thumb along his dorsal length and a curled pointer finger elevating its weight from below. Aga's thumb pad, large, brown, soft and drooling with the saliva of a thoroughly corrupt adult, was kissing the leaking urethra of a child no more than five. Wet little kisses between the two parts, forever forbid from meeting, as shining silver tethers of mixed fluid stretched from out across, bridging their impurity. The pad came in for one last, lingering, smooshing, inundatingly pedophilic kiss, as it shifted to massaging his perfect, untouched penis, beautiful brown foreskin still intact and rolling with an audible squelch to the time of her moist ministrations. Tugging his testicles in adoration and lathering his pink little anus with a ball of spit from the other hand, she intended to coax something deep within. Something sacred. Something delicious.
His seed must run freely.
In the eye of the setting sun, two bodies were joined in a most vile light. The small boy shook and moaned as the privacy and purity of his body was robbed by an animal. His penis, so small that no woman could ever imagine bringing it pleasure, throbbed in between Aga's strong digits for ten entire minutes before he began to buck in her hand; a testament to his stamina which she'd always keep in mind. She wanted nothing more than to edge this kid for hours, leaving him perpetually blue balled and on his first time no less, that is of course, if it weren't for her already doing that. There could've been five cute loads already caking her hands, licking her lips at the thought, as the boy cried out in pain, his little balls were so terribly swollen and heavy, and they swung with enough force to flatten the fur on her fingers. It was time. Furred fingers gripped the base, waving his aching black boy cock around as she giggled and licked his smooth, warm neck all over.
The tip was shining and runny as thumb spread across it once more while other hands were busy massaging the sensitivity of his dangling fruits. His whimpers, moans and groans gave way to one sheer scream as the child was briskly held down around the waist and his penis savagely milked with wet slaps of paw on spit soaked and musky underage member filling the sex stained air.
One little jerk, unpredictable in it's strength, gave her arm a rise as both hands rose to extract his sin. In her left paw, a fierce jet, two, three, four harpooned the center of her paw, sending semen rolling up one finger before stopping suddenly in the trap of her fur. "Oh, oh my baby." she said out loud, elated and sounding on the virge of tears as though she were catching liquid gold in her greedy paws. She continued with her "oh"s ranging from tearful to masturbatory and breathless. To have fresh, hot, perfect underage seed in her very hands, it was like a dream. The child was long spent and breathing laboured as she ceased her attention to his crotch, dragged an open palm all the way up his bare body, and resting it atop his head.
She couldn't stop smelling it. Adoring it. Worshipping it. It had been far too long since she last made a child shake like this, and release his milk for her, yet every time was as special as the first. Aga lapped only once at the pearly little pool of African fertility in her hand, such proximity to her nose making her whine inaudibly, then tipped it's contents like a chalice to the rim of her open mouth. She had never drank from a black child before, but relished in her consideration as she allowed the hot seed to crawl itself slowly down her throat. She sat and basked in the sensation, very present and without equal in pleasures. She closed her eyes and rolled her head a bit, lost in what she had done as she reacquired the boy, who was now napping in her lap. Sliding his loincloth back around to it's "proper" position, though she was disgusted to believe that, he was brought up in her arms and left by the same tree where she found him, a couple meters away.
In the shade, the kid appeared to do the opposite. She smiled to herself, feeling him safe, as she sprinted away through the grass. She loved how they struggled, but this one didn't seem to mind at all.
And she loved him most for that reason alone.
