ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

>Wilderness camping is not for the faint of heart. Emma liked to take it a step further, trying to keep her carry weight as low as possible. It's not that she struggled with the weight. She was a grizzly bear, she could probably hike all day long while carrying an average person. It was just that she enjoyed the challenge of minimalistic camping. Plus, what's the point of going as deep into nature as possible if you're just going to bring civilization with you?
>So when she packed for her annual summer trip to Alaska, she only brought the bare minimum. A few day's worth of dried food, in case foraging proved difficult. A small cooking pot, and a spork to eat out of it with. A canteen, a blanket, a cigarette lighter, a small first-aid kit, a canvas tarp, a hatchet, a belt knife, and a large revolver, just in case. Total weight, 14 pounds. 16 if the canteen was full. Nothing else besides the clothes on her back, and a backpack to carry the gear.
>It took Emma three days of hiking to get to her campsite. It was probably about as far away from civilization as you could get without leaving the United States, a pristine mountain with a gorgeous view over a lake. All supplies were in good order when she began to set up camp. It was almost the summer solstice, so there was plenty of daylight left to work with. It was easy enough to set up a thatched hut out of evergreen branches, with the back side of the hatchet serving as a hammer to drive the boughs acting as corner posts into the ground. Smaller pine branches and reeds from the lake piled deeply made an excellent bed. A circle of rocks around a small pit, dug out with sturdy sticks, made for a fireplace. All in all, a cozy campsite.
>It was about 10PM when Emma was finishing up dinner, fried fish and a salad of wild greens. She had been worried that she would be a bit rusty at spear fishing, but the lake was well stocked and her aim was true. As she lifted the spork to her mouth for the first bite, she paused. There was a strange rumbling in the distance, growing louder by the second. As she set the fish back down on the flat stone that was serving as frying pan and dinner plate, the light suddenly dimmed. Looking up in confusion, Emma saw that clouds were rapidly forming from nowhere, blocking the sun. While she had seen the weather change rapidly before, this was entirely new.
>The rumbling continued to rise in volume. Green lights danced within the clouds. A strong breeze swept across the countryside, causing trees to sway. Emma was grateful she had the foresight to build her hut in a sheltered area. The rumble rose higher and higher, before suddenly stopping with a loud crack. The lights gave one last great flash. It clearly outlined something falling from the sky. Emma dumped the drinking water she had been sterilizing in her pot onto the campfire, grabbed her gear, and set out to investigate.
>It took half an hour to get to where Emma saw the object fall. The forest was dense here. Emma heard a feeble groan come from nearby. Picking her way around a briar patch, she saw a red and white lump beneath a tree. It was lying on a pile of broken branches and jagged metal fragments. As she drew near, she saw it was a person in a bloodstained lab coat, lying face down. A piece of metal had dug deep into one of their legs. Emma quickly moved to check on their condition. There didn't appear to be anything wrong with their neck or spine, so she took out a roll of gauze from her pack. The fragment was too large to be left in if she moved the person, it would flop around and tear at the wound. Emma carefully pulled it out, and rolled up the person's pant leg so she could bandage the puncture. She was surprised to find that their legs were bare skin beneath, no fur or scales. She gently rolled them over, and let out a small gasp. The strange person who had fallen from the sky was a human male.
>Everyone knew humans weren't real. An entire race of impossibly beautiful, otherworldly creatures couldn't exist, it was just a fairy tale. It wasn't even a well thought-out fairy tale either, wouldn't they be freezing cold and easily injured? At best, you had those old-timey hoaxes where an ape or monkey had shaved their fur as part of a con. But this wasn't a shaved ape. Emma carefully picked up the unconscious man, as though he were a small child. The sky began to drizzle as she made her way back to camp.
>By the time Emma got there, the drizzle had become a downpour. Grumbling to herself about how there was no way she'd get a campfire going now, she laid the human down on her makeshift bed before retrieving her cold dinner. There was a small space next to the bedding inside the hut for her to sit as she finished he interrupted meal. Looking up at the human, she saw that he was starting to shiver. She took her blanket out of her pack and laid it on him, but it didn't seem to help much.
>Emma told herself that what she was about to do what strictly for her guest. But a part of her was excited by the thought of being so close to the human. She carefully peeled off her wet clothes, and did the same for the human. She left his underwear on, both out of a sense of modesty and because they had stayed mostly dry. A shiver ran up her spine, having nothing to do with the cool breeze and rain. She crawled up next to the unconscious man, and threw the blanket over them both. She wrapped her arms around him, pulled his head to her breast, and drifted off to sleep.
>A few hours later, Emma was woken up by screaming and thrashing next to her. "Shhhhhhh. It's okay, you're safe..." she said in a soothing voice. The human said something, but it was in a language Emma had never heard before, but it sounded beautiful. "Sorry, but I don't understand. Don't worry, though, you're safe." She gently stroked his hair, pulling him closer. Emma started to hum gently.
>After a few minutes, her bedmate had calmed down. At least, he had stopped struggling and screaming. But one part of him hadn't calmed at all. Emma could feel him pressing against her. "Oh, someone's enjoying themselves, hmm?" She shifted in the bed, so she would have some room to work with.
>Carefully, she reached out to the waistband on the human's shorts. He started to make a noise, as though in protest, but Emma placed a finger on his lips. "Shh, let me take care of you." Emma finished removing his last garment and he sprung up, fully erect. He wasn't especially large or small, but it was the most exciting thing she had ever seen. A real, live human, and he was all hers.
>Emma slowly bent over and gave him a sensual lick, from base to tip. As she popped his head into her mouth, the human let out a moan. Emma slowly started to move up and down, but something didn't feel right. The bed was just long enough for her to lay on normally, so she was having trouble not kicking a hole in the wall behind her. Emma stopped and sat up. Gently running a finger down the human's chest, she grabbed him by the hips and lifted him. The hut was built tall enough for Emma to stand in, so there was plenty of room as she brought him up on her shoulders. "Much better," she said to herself as she resumed. She held on tightly as she drew him back into her mouth, his legs wrapped around behind her.
>She swirled her tongue around his shaft as she moved in and out, her moans mingling with the human's. Up and down, in and out, briefly stopping her work on his rod to shift focus to his balls. He was starting to pant, his cock beginning to twitch. "Oh no, you don't!" Emma scolded him playfully. "I haven't had my turn yet!"
>Emma cautiously lowered her partner onto the bed, before moving over him. "Time to see what you can do," she said as she lowered herself onto him. She paused as the head of his shaft met her folds, waiting. The human moaned, trying to buck his hips, but she held him down and waited a moment more, before hunching over and giving him a deep kiss as she dropped all the way. They both let out a gasp as she enveloped him, filled with greater pleasure than either had ever felt before.
>"Oh, yes!" Emma cried out, continuing to greedily kiss the angelic face below her as she started to bounce up and down. He said words that she didn't understand, but she knew what he meant. She wrapped her arms around him, and pulled his head into her breasts as she continued to move. She drew his mouth to one of her nipples, and he eagerly complied, slipping it into his mouth and starting to suck at it. Emma let out a sigh of pleasure as his tongue moved over her, and she began to move slower but putting more of her weight into each thrust. Her mate shouted out something as he climaxed, filling her. Emma continued to bounce for a few moments before she finally came, letting out a roar and pulling the human even tighter to her as she did so.
>Emma laid down on top of the human, careful to keep her weight off of his injury. "That was amazing," she said. He said something in response, before slipping back into unconsciousness. Emma slowly drifted off to sleep, thinking about how she was going to get her new mate home. Hopefully, he would pick up the language soon. There was so much to talk about, and so many questions she wanted to ask, but she knew the most important thing already. He belonged to her now.

Tails make for a new angle of "attack" to worry about from anthros.

>more dexterous tails can outright grab you
>tails also contain some scent markers on them so having a tail rub against you gets their scent all over you
>bigger/fluffier ones can act like walls and force you closer to the anthro

Reminder that the human resistance has never taken a single square mile since the war began, and they've lost ground every single day, without a break, for several years now.
If you're a resisting human reading this, you need to accept that you ARE toiling away for a losing cause and you WILL be captured or killed eventually. YOU ARE ALREADY A SLAVE. You simply work for an ideology that WILL fail in your lifetime.
The happiest life you will ever lead will be to drop your weapons and start walking to the nearest anthro controlled city. Tell them where you came from and everything about your resistance. You will be pampered by your new owner, and your friends will thank you once they've been broken.
Surrender. Submit. Give in. Worship the new world and resent the life you had. You will be happier this way.

Why is the NEET archetype so amazing yet so rare? Why aren't there more moody shuddin girls? Could you make one?
Also what's another career human men would be in high demand/craved for in an anthro society? Besides Streaming and Lewd stuff, obviously. I kinda wanna say councilors, negotiators, or sales representatives. Since big swole animal women run all the major countries and corporations, you'd want to abuse their attraction for cute humie boys as much as you want, the humans distract/seduce them to better manipulate a deal in your favor. Or is this a little too unrealistic and too much like a conspiracy?

The dark cravings for such rich, light meat came naturally for Krystal; the primitive upbringings of backwards tribals saw to that. What such cruel incantations by bonfire witnessed by such exotic flora and a vast, foreign starry night, than to the copulation of underage children by mature, comprehending and vicious vixens. To such a people, if they could even be flattered with such terminology, the semen of boys is a precious gift, not to be wasted, but ensnared, coaxed and torn heatedly from within his very loins.
This is, to wit, life, or so it's called. Men are not desired past their duties as drones, genitals winded and wills caved and so it falls to the youngest among them; the incoming, to deliver centermost to rites by their young, unripe bodies.
And yet Krystal desired the youngest of them yet. Filial, without a hint of resistance in their puny little minds, practically foolish, suicidal even in their insipid efforts to rationalize her predatory intentions of drawing countless greedy mouthfuls of their sweet, childish, impotent and inconsecratable spunk from their barren, smooth little kid cherries.

Acclimating to the rules and standards of modern society and the expectations of floods of fans has been tough on Krystal. Too many times did she want to say how much she hates lizards, or how much she's dissatisfied with Fox during press conferences.
But now, all alone with her own team filled with the most capable ladies she could get, she can express herself clearly, free of the law, expectations, and the ever present eyes of the public.
In the space at the edge of Cornerian influence, she finally has a chance to express her instincts and wishes when meeting a small boy on a rotting space station after picking up a new contract. Dragging along the lonely child into her mother ship, licking her lips, she introduced another mouth to feed to the rest of the girls...

>while the player is playing your game, you open up her computer's browser in the background to gain info on the real world
>you find out that the real world is populated entirely by furries, humans are mythical creatures that don't exist, and the real world is far more advanced in technology than the in game world

>now that you have nerves, you can feel your back still stuck to the 3d printer's tray, your body has been stuck in an awkward position for an hour or so since being built, and the back pain from being in that position is amplified by the fact that you didn't have nerves before today

>you try to peel yourself off of the tray, but you don't know how to move your muscles, at least you can blink and breath though

>when you wake up, it is dark outside
>your body must have gotten used to feeling, because while everything is still really intense, it isn't nearly as intense as it was when you first felt anything
>the next few hours are spent trying to move
>all you could do is move your mouth and make noises since it is similar to breathing, which your new brain automatically does
>you can also twitch your muscles, but you have only managed to remove one arm from the tray you are on
>while learning to move using your free arm, you finally figure out how to swing it left and right, but you knock something over while doing so, making a loud clatter that hurts your new ears
>that noise also attracted the owner of the house, the player, who screams when she opens the door to her garage to find a naked human(a mythological being) on her 3d printer tray twitching and moaning in apparent fear when he saw her

Isabelle traffics human boys and men onto her island. In a field dominated by human men, Isabelle Shizue is a pioneer in the drug and person trafficking industry by being the first female anthro to be a notable presence in the industry.
In another victory for females, especially anthros, is the ability to have a relatable dealer that can understand and pinpoint a lady's desires, and having a variety of options means that she can cater to all sorts of needs for females of varying economic status thanks to her strategically placing brothels all over the world from ghettos to gated communities.
Her most infamous attraction lures in unsuspecting makes from a multitude of backgrounds and ages alone into isolated communities and crowns them as "mayor" before trapping them via the previously mentioned isolation, endless tasks that help supply other aspects of her empire, and (most effectively) perpetual debts that allows her to manipulate the "mayor" into performing whatever a client wishes. Her latest stunt uses islands to effectively trap her prey.

wouldn't mind more /adhg/ stuff in the vain of "trap genre" where the human guy is in situations where he's pretending not to be a human male to keep his self safe/un snu snued and then you get shenanigans or being discovered or almost discovered

>wearing a sort of fursuit to hide his species in various settings
>classic cross dressing shenanigans with a bonus of being in areas/schools/ships/etc that are supposed to be female only
>and such

You know, I have an idea for something like this. Something similar to Mulan (animated).
>A world where female anthros and human males exist
>Female anthros are considered and seen as the dominate gender role when it comes to war, protecting her family, fighting, victory feast, warriors, etc.
>The human males is seen as a “care taker” such as looking after children, gardening, tendering the wounds of muscular anthro women, cooking, interacting with their neighbor, etc.
>But one human male had enough. He wants to be more than just a “tender lover” he wants to be a warrior just like his mighty lioness mother, who is horrifically wounded, and take her warrior role in order to keep her away from entering an upcoming war
>But the public laughed at him and called him “adorable” for taking on a female anthro’s role
>He realize he can’t enter the war considering his gender and species
>So he decided to create a well designed female lookin furry suit that can tricked others into thinking he’s an anthro
>”That’s weird, never seen an animal so skinny… but not to sound gay or anything but… you’re smell makes me blush!”

>Mighty Anthro women tribes have a fight on who get’s to keep the “species that can breed any species”

>Sun was setting, crowds are cheering as they surround the tall, muscular, scarred, yet ever so beautiful Sabertooth that is named “Great Warrior” as they called.
>Riyona, the “Great Warrior” looks around the crowd of female anthros in bandages roaring in victory while the male humans clapped and some closed their ears from the female’s loud roaring.
>One of Riyona’s closest friend, a lioness named Pyra, came out of the crowd with a big smile on her face
>”You did it! I can’t believe it! You took down an ENTIRE armory of amazons and their leader just by yourself with your hammer and your fists!”
>Riyona chuckled, “Well, I didn’t want to die after I made a promise to my husband. Speaking of which, where is he?”
>”He’s waiting for you at the Feast House. We’re also preparing a HUGE feast for our victory!”
>”That’s great, but… can you help me walk there? My entire body never felt so much soar…”
>Her best friend and childhood friend nodded as she carries her as she placed Riyona’s arm around her neck as they head towards the Feast House as many people of the town.
>…
>The Feast House was filled with human males and female anthros dancing together to the music of cheery lutes played by veterans of musicians
>Female warriors of all species chowing down their fish, meat, and drowning themselves in hard liquor. Some even passed out on the floor
>Pyra stand on top of the table and clapped her hands real hard as if there was a thunder clap inside the building.
>Everyone in the room paused and peered their eyes to the lioness.
>”EVERYONE! I gathered you all here to remember this moment when the day a sabertooth took down an entire army just to protect this town with honer, strength, and determination!”
>The crowd roared with agreement
>”Riyona will be our inspiration that every female warrior should look up to and strive to be like her!”, she happily stated as she pointed at Riyona sitting on a chair with male human nurses tendering her wounds.
>”She also did this for her own lover, which speaking of which…”
>She snapped her fingers
>”The main door upstairs open up revealing a beautiful male human in a white robe with gold emblem markings along with a beautiful pink flower on his hair.
>Riyona awed at her soul mate’s appearance, “…Emeric”
>”…Riyona”
>The Great Warrior slowly stands up as she limp towards the human not taking her eyes off of him
>They both reach other’s hands, “Emeric, I have never seen an already beautiful male be more beautiful!”
>Emeric blushed, “And I have never seen a warrior so beautiful in scars”
>They both pressed their lips together locking each other as everyone in the Feast House cheered
>Once they finally let go for a breather, Riyona lift the human’s chin up, “Emeric, I promise to protect you and our child with all my strength. I will raise a daughter to be a stronger warrior as me, and have a son who can garden great food as you do!”
>”And I will always be there for you to tender your wounds, give you all my love and-“
>”MOOOM! This is getting too lovey dovey!”
>Riyona snapped herself back to reality and looks at her own two children in their own beds.
>On the left is a young Sabertooth with mini fangs in her soft gray fur named Bertha, and on the right is a younger human child, Tieloe. Like his mother, his hair was also gray and share the same blue eyes.
>Riyona chuckled at her son, “That’s odd, I thought humans love romance!”
>”Not me!” Tieloe proudly stated, “I just want action of my mom, fighting her way through the bitter end!”
>Riyona leans over for a kiss on the forehead, “you sure do love my adventurous stories do you son?”
>”You bet! Can I be a warrior like you, mommy?”
>”Of course!”
>Tieloe gasps in excitement
>”…warrior of a garden! That’s how I met your father!” Riyona laugh to herself leaving a disappointing son on the bed.
>”Can I be a warrior too, Mother?” Bertha asked.
>Riyona held her young daughter’s hand looking her in the eyes with confidence
>”Of course, Bertha. With my training and my strength, I will make sure to make you an alpha female that every female warrior strives for.”
>Tieloe looked at the two and hearing all of it makes her feel slightly hurt and yet, not surprise.
>Tieloe decided to cover himself in the blanket and just head to bed.
>”Welp, I should head to bed with your father. It’s getting late. Good night children…”
>”Night mom!” Both children replied.
>She closed the door as she head to the bedroom where her husband is reading with a dim candle light next to him.
>”Telling your kids on one of your silly adventures again?” Emeric jokingly said.
>”Yep! Telling them the time I rescued the town from a big army that I alone have to deal with”.
>”Meh, it was an ok moment in my eyes.” Emeric put the book down as Riyona rake off her clothes and get’s into the bed.
>”Haha… ‘OK’? I just told them the time we had our first kiss! You honestly think that was ‘OK’?”
>”Aw yes our first kiss… How did it go again?” Emeric asked with a smug look at his face
>Riyona notice a “tent” is rising. She looked at her soul mate giving the same smug look as her husband as she mountains her husband feeling the ‘sword’ almost penetrating her ‘weakness’.
>”Well… I know where it went~”
>Emeric started caressing the soft gray fur neck of a Sabertooth as he slowly pants warm air towards his wife’s wet snout, “Well then…. Tell me how the story goes~“
>Riyona also started breathing warm air at her husband’s face to the point where he looks like he’s sweating.
>”Well… it went something like this~”
>The wife puts her ‘weakness’ on her husband’s ‘sword’.
>”Aw! Tell me more! I want to see how the poor ol human ends up~”
>…
>In the kid’s bedroom, they both hear some muffles and what sounds like it’s eating some pleasurable food.
>”Oh no, the creepy crawlers are back!”
>A Year passed
>Tieloe and his father are watching Bertha and Riyona sword fighting using wooded shaped swords as they pose dramatically at each strike they give to each other
>”You’ll never take the prince, Evil Goon!” Shouted Bertha as she clash ‘swords’ with her mom.
>”Ahah! You think you’ll defeat me? How can I ever be defeated by such a tiny fool like you?” Replied Bertha in a ‘evil’ tone.
>”With the strength of my mother’s blood, I will overcome your strength!!” Bertha took one swing and ‘stab’ the ‘evil goon’.
>”Auuugh!!! How can I be such a foooooool?!?!” Riyona dramatically fainted on the ground sticking out her tounge.
>Applauds from Emeric and Tieloe ensues on Bertha’s victory
>”Thank you, thank you citizens of E’mire! I will promise to protect you from any danger! No evil will ever get passed through me!”
>”My, my… A heroine that I feel safe around with!” Emeric walked towards her daughter, “I think our little warrior deserves a kiss!”
>Bertha giggled by the smooches from her father that she began to push his face off of her, “Haha! Stop it, dad! Warriors don’t need smooches from their fathers!”
>”They do when they’re super lonely!”
>Riynoa get’s up from the ground, “She’s right sweaty! Especially me when I get ‘lonely’” she winked at Emeric.
>As a response, Emeric slapped her Sabertooth Tiger wife in the snout.
>Tieloe joined in the conversation, “Is hugs enough to make you feel less lonely, mommy?”
>”You bet your adorable soul it will, sweet buns!” She grabbed her entire family in her arms and twirl around in circles
>The family in the yard laughed together as they fall down onto the ground.
>”Looks like you guys are having fun!”
>The family looked at a big muscular, yet not as muscular as Riyona (or big chested as Riyona), Lioness in a regal like cape, and a red silky suit, with a gold emblem shape like a sword in the center between her breast, that is barely covering up her legs or arms, standing behind a fence.
>The kids gasps at the lioness, “Aunt Pyra!”
>”Hey, kids! How is your parents?”
>”Great!”, said Bertha, “I just beat my mom in a sword fight!”
>”Haha! Did you? Well then that means your mother isn’t the strongest warrior in E’mire anymore.” Pyra chuckled to herself.
>”Hey, Pyra!” Riyona chimed in, “can you give this tiger a break? I’m trying to train my daughter to be the alpha female I want her to be!”
>”Still at it again?” Pyra chuckled, “You really need to teach your daughter to do something other than fighting.”
>”Hey, in my defense, it’s better to do it early. Cause teaching a daughter at their 13s before they grow up is considered a easy way to help your daughter familiarize what she learn rather than a bumbling 20 something fool.” Riyona whispered in her friend’s feline ear.
>”Suit yourself. I’m about to take my family to a little camping trip. They’re waiting for me at one of the carriers and I think my husband is yelling my name.”
>”Trying to cat some fish? Great! Be sure to invite me when your husband starts cooking. She make the BEST fish dishes he can ever create!”
>”Speaking of cooking, come on Lietoe! We’re gonna go shopping and get some vegetables. It’s almost dinner time and we all know your mother hates it when dinner is not on time!”
>”Aw, mom! Can I stay here and watch my mom and sister play?”
>”No buts! I need you to help me with the bags once were done shopping.”
>Despite against his will, Lietoe annoyingly agreed.
>”Don’t you dare throw an attitude like that, Young Man! No female will ever date a stuck up male when you’re tendering their wounds…” their voice faded away as they left through the exit of the backyard.
>Pyra chuckled at the situation, “Guess your son is already growing up live every male human husband from what I seen.”
>”anyway, I just came here to visit and bring you this.”
>Riyona ears perked on what her best friend said, “really? What is it?”
>Pyra handed her the paper and what features is a silhouette of a alligator warrior striking a pose with a sword up in the air with the print saying “Alpha Stand Off! Want to know who’s the best Alpha female in your town? Join us where all warriors of all species joins together and see who will come out on too! Show the people of Heilo Reward: 10,000 Gold Coins! Submission ends around Aogist 21”
>”A Fighting Tournament? For 10,000 gold coins? This should be easy! I’m the strongest warrior in this town and probably than any so-called “Alpha Females” in Heilo!” Riyona bragged.
>”Don’t get too cocky, otherwise you’ll end up humiliating yourself and be the biggest jesters of all of Heilo” Pyra chuckled back.
>”Ha Ha…” Riyona rolled her eyes, “Why not join the game so we can face each other and see who’s best?”
>”Me? Oh no no no, I long given up on swords, and fist fighting. Nowadays I’m trying to make my own competition! A game I like to call, “wrestling”!
>”Oh you mean where you two hug each other real hard?” Bertha asked in which caused her mother to lose her sides.
>at the market
>It’s crowded by humans and females passing through each other carrying their own purchase in bags
>”We’re just gonna get peanuts for your mother. You know how much she loves the saltiness of the nut.”
>Lietoe waited for her his dad to purchase the peanuts when he saw a stool that is selling wooden weapons where two young female anthros are playing with the toys.
>”Dad, can I get those wood weapons?”
>Emeric looked at the stool where his son is pointing at.
>”Lietoe, you’re a boy. A human boy may I add. Those toys aren’t meant for you.”
>”But, mom! I they look so cool! What’s wrong with a boy wanting a weapon?”
>”Because we’re here to buy food. We can not be wasting gold on toys that you might get a splinter.” His father stated.
>”But, dad…”
>”No, BUTS! You know I hated when my own kids (and mostly my wife), throw their buts at me when they don’t get what they want! Or do you want to clean the farm again with Aunt Miday?”
>Lietoe recoil at the idea of working 24/7 on a smelly farmhouse that he always hated. And that dreadful room… that dreadful room. Lietoe given in to his father’s demand by shooking his head.
>”I’m glad I made it clear. Now, here’s your 10 Gold Coins for the peanuts.”
>The stand owner gave her a big ounce of peanuts in the bag.
>”Oh my, this looks really heavy. Lietoe, I want you to carry this bag of ingredients. This peanut bag will be too heavy for you.”
>While the bag of ingredients isn’t that heavy, the nut sack is. Emeric tried lifting up the bag a bit higher but he can barely lift it up. Emeric basically have to carry the bag that is in a “particular” position where the bag sag.
>Oh no… there are female animals watching him with a lusty look.
>”Hey, cutie pie. Nice NUT SACKS” shouted a mammoth.
>”It’s a bit dangerous to have your NUTS sagging close to the ground”, said a Zebra
>”Don’t worry, Babe. I still eat your SAGGING NUTS”
>”They seemed to like your nuts, dad!”
>”Lietoe, be quite.”
>It usually happens when Emeric is all alone. He is considered the most beautiful human in the town. With his long black hair cover up half of his right eye, and his soft warm skin that no anthro can’t refuse but have the urge to hug him. Emeric didn’t seemed to like his looks as he get’s too much attention from anthros when he’s alone.
>Emeric even worries if his son will go through the same experience as he did only without a lover to protect him from possibly being captured and be used for… “unspeakable” things.
>”Dad? Why do you always look so sad?” Lietoe interrupted his father’s thoughts.
>”Oh!”, his father snapped out, “…nothing, Sweaty. It’s just I get females being unlady-like towards me and throwing whistles at me despite being married to your mother.”
>”Oh. Why not tell mommy to help you with it?”
>”Because, your mother is not a ‘brute’. She doesn’t beat people up over minimal things. She only fights when you, your sister, and I are in danger when a knife is aimed at us. She may killed a whole army, but she did it because everyone in town’s lives we’re at stake. Mine too. She doesn’t kill armies for fun or for bragging rights. If I see your mother killing others for minimal things, I be terrified. That’s why I love about her.”
>The two stood still on the path
>Emeric realizes they’ve been standing still for a while, “My arms. They're getting tired. We need to start cooking. It’s getting dark already.
>Dinner was here.
>Everyone in the family enjoying their delicious vegetable soup on the wooden table as they hear the sizzling fire warming up the bubbly pot
>”Mmm! Bun Cheeks, you cook the best food in this house!” Riyona gleefully commented.
>”Oh, Sweet Tooth, that’s usually typical for all human males to cook food! After all, kitchen, gardening, and healing is what we humans do! That’s what our father, The Son of Humanity, built us.”
>Right when Lietoe was about to eat his last slurp, he stood for a moment on what his father just said.
>”You bet!” The muscular tiger said, “And my goddess create us sabers to become ferocious, and powerful to protect and tender the humans!”
>”Yeah! I’m gonna be like my mom!” Bertha shouted.
>’That’s how The Son of Humanity built us!’ The last sentence kept brewing inside Lietoe’s head that is been itching to ask this question.
>”What if our Father built us more than just that?”
>The family gave him a confusing smile, “What do you mean by that?” asked his father.
>”I mean… what if one human doesn’t feel like he do whatever human does in daily basis. What if there was a human who wants to do… anthro stuff. You know, be tough and all.”
>”Oh, Lietoe.” Emeric shook his head, “You’re going through a phase.”
>”Phase?” Lietoe said.
>”We all been through a phase once in our life. I remember I used to be one of those males that ‘don’t need any females, I can handle myself”.
>”What made you stop?”
>”Your mother” Emeric looked at his wife slurping the bowl with her mouth only to stop in a awkward position when she notice her husband is eyeing on her
>”…whah?” She muffled her words.
>Emeric chuckled at her wife’s character, ‘Still the same wife I love 8 years later…’ he thought to himself as he resume to look at Lietoe. “You’re probably will forget about it once you grow older. Every kid grows out of the stuff they like. Especially when it comes to humans doing anthro stuff. It’s physically impossible for a child like you.”
>”But, dad…”
>”NO BUTS, LIETOE…” Emeric made a stern, yet calming statement. “This is the third time I had to say it. You cannot what an anthro does. You’re a MALE. If you’re gonna be like this right now, then you can just go straight upstairs to your room!”
>”But I haven’t finish my favorite soup!”
>”Then you should’ve been arguing with your father all day. Now, go to your room. NOW.”
>Lietoe gritted his teeth as he pushes off the table causing the soup to spill off of the bowl due to the force, “LIETOE!” his dad shouted but Lietoe continues to stomp his way to his room where he and his sister sleeps.
>Emeric sighed in annoyance as he rubs his forehead, “My son of mine can be such a drab.”
>Emeric looked at his wife, still holding the exact same position, stuff cheeks full of soup with a noodle poking out of her lips, and a bowl on her hands, “Yep… still the wife I love” he shook his head.
>The tiger took a big GULP on her soup and hear the food streaming down her neck and see her human giving him a displeasurable stare
>”…umm, oh! Um, THANK YOU for… making a great soup honey! My stomach has never been so famished!” She grinned real wide.
>***
>Emeric drags Riyona by pulling his ears hard enough to lower her upper body leaving a trail of ‘ows’ as they pass through the dim lit hallways until they reach to their children’s room.
>Emeric finally let go of the feline’s ears.
>Riyona rubbing his pinched ear, “You really didn’t have to-“ she was cut of by her husband’s strong whispers.
>”TALK. HIM. THROUGH.”
>Emeric paces back to the kitchen
>Riyona took a deep sigh, “Oh boy…”.
>Peeking through the door, she sees the upset child in the bed, ‘you can do this. If you can handle in a fist fight, then you can handle being a parent’ Riyona thought to herself.
>Riyona sits on the edge of Lietoe’s bed. Still don’t know what to say to her son.
>”So… um, having a rough day?”
>Her son didn’t respond.
>”…well, I guess that’s a no.” That didn’t work. Perhaps it’s time to acknowledge the elephant in the room.
>”Listen, Lietoe. I know you wanted to be tough like me and every female you come across,” Riyona took a deep breath, “but you gotta face the facts. Humans are not strong. The Son of Humanity built you to be small, fragile, and tender for the anthros to have that urge of protecting you and others.” Riyona cringes as what she just said to his son. “I’m sorry, I’m really am. Your father was like you, he believed he can do things alone without the need lf females, and where did that lead him…? Big muscular anthros holding a knife at his neck. You wouldn’t exist if I didn’t spotted them threatening your father.”
>still no answer
>”What I’m trying to say is… you’re father don’t want you to go through the same trauma as he did.”
>Silent still prevalent in the air.
>Riyona leans in and kiss her son’s wet cheek
>”Good night, Son. I love you.”

>Your boots crunch in the underbrush as you make your trek off the beaten path.
>The surrounding forest buzzes with the awaking nightlife as the day draws to a close.
>When you reach the far side of a large oblong clearing, you stop abruptly. The cookware strapped to your back keeps clattering for a bit while you get your bearings.
>"Short of breath?" Your companion Ferrah chides from behind you."
>She's a tall, athletic mongoose with tan fur and a patch of white over her left eye. side by side, she's a head taller than you.
>You take a seat on a nearby stone and look back at her.
"I've taken my 6,969th step since our last break, I won't go an inch further." you explain while cracking your back.
>Ferrah scoffs at the remark "and for you that's what, 2?"
"3 and a quarter"
>"right" waves her hand and takes your word for it. She scans the area with her ears flicking this way and that. "well this isn't a bad spot to set up camp. flat ground, steady breeze, and the river's close enough for even you to hear it."
"Close enough for me to toss you in?" You fire back.
>She takes a good listen to judge the distance,"Hmmmm, not that close". she chuckles.
>You reach into your pocket and retrieve your digital map. The silver hexagonal device lights up and displays a green hex grid of a 10 mile radius. The river snakes its way through the grid spaces a few hundred feet to the Northeast.
>You double tap the button on the upper right to zoom out, Its still a day's walk to Woodfield from here but you're making good time. You turn the screen off and shove it back into your coat pocket.
>You look up to see Ferrah arranging the stones for the fire and your Autotent(tm) setting itself up behind her. You roll the stone you were sitting on closer to the pit and finally take off your pack. You open up the insulated section and pull out containers with ingredients. A medley of stew veggies, some floury balls of dough and big fatty cubes of Fresh boar meat from the last stop you made.
"Those poor little piggies are gonna wonder where their mommy went" You tease.
> She ruffles through her supplies and shakes a small red disk of of a box with A flame printed on it. "Her little Borfans aren't my problem, she shouldn't have charged at you."
"That's cold"
>"Stand back" She throws the disk into the center of the pit and it roars into a crackling flame.
>A couple of hours pass and the sky loses the last of it's orange tint as the stars blink into view overhead. The simmering pot fills the cozy camp with a mouthwatering scent. So mouthwatering that Ferrah's been licking her chops for the past 20 minutes.
>Ferrah stands over you with her tail swishing in anticipation while you stir the pot.
"Yes it's ready, bring your bowl"
>You flll her bowl to the brim and watch her chow down. Her hums of satisfaction tell you this is one for the cook books. After ladling your self some you speak up.
"Were about a days walk from Woodfield. If we hurry across the river we can get there by sundown."
>Ferrah swallows and says. "We could get there by noon if you let me carry you."
"Hell no."
>"Oh come on!" she pouts, You shouldn't have to carry all that stuff.
"Tip your sunhat somewhere else. I got legs."
>"Legs that get tired after 3 miles"
"3 and a quarter." You correct before taking a bite.
>Ferrah squints at you and crosses her arms "You should be glad I'm asking. I should just throw you over my shoulder and-"
>You offer another ladle of your stew and she reluctantly obliges. "You should let me take care of you."
"I don't need to be waited on. You should learn to take 'no~' for an answer." you lean over and boop her with your ladle leaving a blotch of food on her snoot. You pull back your booping ladle when Ferrah suddenly grabs the handle.
>She rolls her long tongue over and around it while starring you down. You watch her turn her head as she licks the ladle clean and pulls off with a kiss. You feel an uncomfortable tightness growing in your jeans when you finally let go of it.
"N-now listen."
>"I'm listening"
>You set your feet and rise slowly from your rock while Ferrah follows you with her hungry eyes.
"W-what did we just we talk about?"
>You know that look all too well. You take slow steps backwards while she's still sitting. her tail slowly swishes too and fro.
>"Taking no for an answer, but you haven't said no yet, have you?" She plants her paws and leans forward.
>You can feel your heart thumping in your chest and below the belt.
"How about we just clean up and gooaaaaAAAH"
>You give up trying to talk your way out of it and make a mad dash for the tent. You take about ten steps before getting the wind knocked out of you from behind sending you tumbling into the tent.
>When You get you're bearings you're pinned down face up with the dim light of the tent overhead illuminating the edges of the she beast's fur.
>Ferra leans in and slowly grazes your neck with her fangs. "If no means no, I'll just have to make you scream yes."
>You curse yourself as her warm breath on your neck makes your shiver.
"No fair~" you whimper.

>be me

>and other fun school shenanigans

I want her to molest a little African child. I want to see her tough, dusty hands walk down his ebony legs like spiders, tickling them as they crawl under his loincloth like an animal stalking upon their youngest, easiest prey. She massages his dark little cock, easing out a drop of kiddy pre as well as thumbing at his tensing nuts before taking some huffs of her hand.
The stench of unwashed dirt, sweat, piss and boyflesh tells her a story of all the bodies of water he's never entered, of the drops of pure earthly liquid that's never dripped down his nude black skin in the scorching sun. The shebeast finally spits three or four times in it, spreads it around with her closed fingers, then levels back down to give his black kidcock and jewels some sloppy, dripping and noisy love as her entire palm, already the size of his face or chest, completely engulfs his genitals. The anthro cooed to her little mouse as she felt his limp penis roll around her glistening, soaked paw pads. Well, until they started swelling, that is. Bulging with excitement, confusion, fear as a dollop of sinful, illicit yet utterly precious semen stirs beneath the surface. Taking his now three inch penis in hand, she aligns the sopping top joint of her thumb along his dorsal length and a curled pointer finger elevating its weight from below. Aga's thumb pad, large, brown, soft and drooling with the saliva of a thoroughly corrupt adult, was kissing the leaking urethra of a child no more than five. Wet little kisses between the two parts, forever forbid from meeting, as shining silver tethers of mixed fluid stretched from out across, bridging their impurity. The pad came in for one last, lingering, smooshing, inundatingly pedophilic kiss, as it shifted to massaging his perfect, untouched penis, beautiful brown foreskin still intact and rolling with an audible squelch to the time of her moist ministrations. Tugging his testicles in adoration and lathering his pink little anus with a ball of spit from the other hand, she intended to coax something deep within. Something sacred. Something delicious.
His seed must run freely.
In the eye of the setting sun, two bodies were joined in a most vile light. The small boy shook and moaned as the privacy and purity of his body was robbed by an animal. His penis, so small that no woman could ever imagine bringing it pleasure, throbbed in between Aga's strong digits for ten entire minutes before he began to buck in her hand; a testament to his stamina which she'd always keep in mind. She wanted nothing more than to edge this kid for hours, leaving him perpetually blue balled and on his first time no less, that is of course, if it weren't for her already doing that. There could've been five cute loads already caking her hands, licking her lips at the thought, as the boy cried out in pain, his little balls were so terribly swollen and heavy, and they swung with enough force to flatten the fur on her fingers. It was time. Furred fingers gripped the base, waving his aching black boy cock around as she giggled and licked his smooth, warm neck all over.
The tip was shining and runny as thumb spread across it once more while other hands were busy massaging the sensitivity of his dangling fruits. His whimpers, moans and groans gave way to one sheer scream as the child was briskly held down around the waist and his penis savagely milked with wet slaps of paw on spit soaked and musky underage member filling the sex stained air.
One little jerk, unpredictable in it's strength, gave her arm a rise as both hands rose to extract his sin. In her left paw, a fierce jet, two, three, four harpooned the center of her paw, sending semen rolling up one finger before stopping suddenly in the trap of her fur. "Oh, oh my baby." she said out loud, elated and sounding on the virge of tears as though she were catching liquid gold in her greedy paws. She continued with her "oh"s ranging from tearful to masturbatory and breathless. To have fresh, hot, perfect underage seed in her very hands, it was like a dream. The child was long spent and breathing laboured as she ceased her attention to his crotch, dragged an open palm all the way up his bare body, and resting it atop his head.
She couldn't stop smelling it. Adoring it. Worshipping it. It had been far too long since she last made a child shake like this, and release his milk for her, yet every time was as special as the first. Aga lapped only once at the pearly little pool of African fertility in her hand, such proximity to her nose making her whine inaudibly, then tipped it's contents like a chalice to the rim of her open mouth. She had never drank from a black child before, but relished in her consideration as she allowed the hot seed to crawl itself slowly down her throat. She sat and basked in the sensation, very present and without equal in pleasures. She closed her eyes and rolled her head a bit, lost in what she had done as she reacquired the boy, who was now napping in her lap. Sliding his loincloth back around to it's "proper" position, though she was disgusted to believe that, he was brought up in her arms and left by the same tree where she found him, a couple meters away.
In the shade, the kid appeared to do the opposite. She smiled to herself, feeling him safe, as she sprinted away through the grass. She loved how they struggled, but this one didn't seem to mind at all.
And she loved him most for that reason alone.

Fairly. Imagine regular bullying/hazing but more like just giving them shit rather than actual malice. Though do keep in mind that hyenas act more passive around those that they have interest in. It doesn't make sense from the position of hyena psychology for a girl who's really into a guy to fuck with him nonstop and be super harsh about it. Of course that's not some concrete guideline that must be followed. You could certainly have her still be a dick to him because of certain character quirks or really any number of things.
Anything in particular about the setting/character(s) you could give us?

Guys, I had the best dream, so I am going to copy past what I written down, and then expand in a full story version.
-A large city full of Anthro animals and a small population of humans. The city mainly starts at the top of a large hill, and branches downward (think San Francisco, or City Escape). The Human Protagonist
was looking for this doberman woman he was with, and while driving around with another human friend who involved with renting loaning trucks and mechanic work, looking for her. They catch a glimpse of her, and
miss her, so they start from the top, and head back down. They find her in a different branch at the bottom, running towards an abandoned building in the bad part of the city. The protagonist
jumps out the car and starts running towards her and the building. A white wolf (Female) also joins the protagonist in running towards the building. Inside they find large, buff, and agressive animal
women (who formed some sort of a sisterhood) who call them selves "The Predators." They capture and experiment on people they don't like. The Protagonist then reveals that he is a shapeshifter animal to the point where he can change his own appearance and gender with relative ease.
Dream End.

Sha invites children over to her house for sweets all the time, and they always leave so happy and a little shy. Most assume she's simply rubbing off on them, but no one could guess what goes on behind closed doors. Where she preps for their daily arrival by dolling herself up, taking a benzo to calm her nerves and dropping everything she's wearing for a single, thin sundress. After a single knock at the door, her excitement is already spilling over and her nipples become diamonds. The smell of her quivering womanhood begins to cloud the house. Answering it to two small boys, no less than seven, and she finds herself kneeling over in greeting, giving the boys a rush of confusion and curiosity as her fat, dripping sheep mammaries swing down, already staining her dress with their clearly-defined outline of ferocious sexual appetite.
Sha sure loves children.

imagine a sheep girl who's amazon level jacked, but you have no idea since big wool fluff covering

Also makes me think of species that are just naturally strong.
>nerdy/dorky anthro girl who doesn't work out or such
>but she's a tiger or grizzly or similar strong/big species
>so she can still flip a car bare handed by her self
Which can add to the dom aspect since you're getting manhandled and wreaked by a loser

What would that even count as? Accidental domming?
>Tiger/Grizzly/Draft doesn't realize how strong she is
>Laughs at your joke and slaps your knee
>It actually really hurts
Or maybe something like
>Pulls you in for a big hug
>Doesn't realize she's nearly breaking your spine
>Later the two of you are watching some corny horror movie
>Except she totally believes in the supernatural and it freaks her out, so she squeezes you so hard you can barely breathe
>Never even notices the force she's exerting on you
I'd buy that for a dollar.

>Two tall anthro girls fight over being able to date the cute humie who didn't agree to anything.

>Watching the big game with your big anthro gf, swigging some big brewskis
>Your team gets called offside after scoring a goal, nullifying the goal
>Your big gf yells "Oh come the fuck on!" and accidentally crushes the can in her hand, sending beer everywhere
>She sighs, wipes herself, the table, then you down (sheepishly)
>Apologizes for the outburst and precipitation she caused
>Proceeds to pull another beer out from the cooler beside her
>Doesn't even open it before she crushes it again because your team gets a penalty

>Be me
>Getting bullied by an anthro hyena and a cheetah girl
>Our teacher, an anthro tiger woman comes up and says “ladies stop it”
>I think im getting saved from the pummeling and forced tickles
>She says “this is how you bully a human!” She then picks me up and flips me upside down and is grabbing onto my ankles flinging me around and laughing hysterically
>No wonder her husband is so docile and scared every time he comes to her work.

Speaking of music, I bet mosh pits with anthros involved is just asking for trouble if a human boy goes. More so if you go to an anthro popular/majority crowd/venue.
>crowd surfing and being groped by everyone and/or just being grabbed by an anthro for dibs
>having one or more anthros bump and grind and hump you in the mosh pit
>may even get lucky and the anthro band grabbing you from the crowd

Which species of anthro would be the teacher most likely to rape a human student?

Most that are single probably.
>teach human boys that are in puberty age
>they reek of pheromones saying they're ready and available to mate
>also since they fap a lot and humans are pretty much nose blind a lot don't shower after fapping so that scent also clings to them
>many are single which just screams scent wise they're free for taking
>teachers are older and bigger anthros so even if they don't mean too they end up establishing themselves as the alphas/matriarchs/etc
>the boys defer/submit to your words and instructions already so they're half yours
>they probably have your scent on them already so they're marked as yours sort of
>etc
Now imagine the fucking iron will anthro gym teachers need to not claim every human boy she teaches.

>get sweaty during PE
>don't have a towel so use your shirt to wipe some of the sweat from your brow
>unknowingly flash the wolf gym teacher your soft, smooth tummy, an act that practically screams "I am submissive and breedable. Please hold me down and drain every ounce of seed from my young, virile balls!"

I can see certain parts of humans being very provocative to anthros
>naked necks and shoulders probably get pred species going
>human hands for how good they are at petting
>human tongue since they're unusually soft compared to most other species
>and human stomachs since many animals show submissiveness by showing their stomachs and since humans have no fur the effect is like doubled in how vulnerable an area they're showing

All I can think is the Lonely deabeat P.E teacher wolf woman getting to attached to the weird kid that sits alone.

>The clan mother’s expression was blank and unmoving
>A single hand gesture and the two guards left the room, leaving the two alone
>You felt less safe
>”Pitiful human. I sent my youngest daughter out on guard duty, and you deflowered her”
>She began to stand up

>She took a step forward

>Before you could recover she pinned you in place with a foot to the chest
>She reached down and with fluid motion ripped your shorts and boxers clean off
>Flinging the tatters to the corner she eyed the thing that had allegedly plowed her daughter into submission
>”Hmm, serviceable” she mused
>Readjusting her pose where she was crouched down in front of you she grabbed you by the balls quite literally and started to massage them
>Before long your body was acting against you and springing to attention

>She hiked one of your legs up
>Then the other
>All you could see looking up was an entrance beneath a mountain of gnoll muscle
>”Let there be no subtlety here, human-”
>she leaned down closer
>”You won’t leave this tent before sundown”
>And at that, she dropped down like a meaty hammer directly atop your shaft
>She hadn’t taken the time to line up perfectly so for a split second your rod bent a little before course correcting itself into her hungry maw of a snatch
>All the air was knocked out of your lungs by the sudden impact
>The gnoll matriarch however merely hummed to herself in amusement and pleasure as she started to raise up again

>Not a bad deal
>There was occasionally a call from some “nightly activities” but with her extra size it was nowhere near as rough as she was pre-pregnancy

Imagine the culture shock a matriarchal anthro society would have when it encounters humans. We have a species who are hyper protective of their few males meeting a species where the males are so reckless it's like they're trying to kill themselves.

They'd dismantle earths armies

They could try...It would not be easy for them, not unless they had no qualms dismantling vast amounts of infrastructure as well. Which would only stir up additional resentment among the civilian populace, increasing recruitment rates, and therefore resistance.
No, subversion and slowly integrating themselves will work better in the long run.
But I wouldn't mind dating a lady from outer space in the first place...

It'd actually be very easy to do
>just show the army alien sports drinks and they'll come running to join them
>alien crayons for the marines and a bonus if they have colors only they can see
>air force would jump immediately at the prospect of flying real scifi space ships
>navy would be the hard sell with all the gays though

>"Seriously?"
>"You can't even hit our largest target a few meters away?"
>"Why the fuck did Miyu scout you? Eye candy?"
>"Go clean the guns, you furless fuck."

>10 minutes later, she was called into Fox's office.
>30 minutes later, she was squealing and moaning as Fox rentlessly fisted her pussy and anus as punishment for her verbal abuse of Anon
>40 minutes later, Anon was balls-deep in her, mercylessly forcing her nethers to reshape itself to remember the cock of his cock and perfectly service it.
>60 minutes after her verbal lapse, she was thoroughly and utterly bred, her ovum under a mercyless assault of Anon's soerm-cells. Her feritilization was irreversible.
> After confirming her impregnation, Fox cleaned Anon's cock and crotch up with her tongue. Then she bend over her table and begged him to impregnate her too as reparation for the emotional damages Krystal caused him.
>Anon eagerly complied to her delight.

>Anthros from another dimension have taken over
>Been the dominanting species for almost 7 years now
>Tons of posters that have psas for non domesticated humans
>One poster details a non domesticated human
>Signs of a non domesticated human usually entail them being sleepy, angry, working a retail or fast food job or going to school instead of raising children, no ring, no ownership tag from anthro wife, no smell mark and seen driving alone late at night.
>Remember citizens, report a non domesticated human to your anthro police force! You may never know who it might be!

>empty threat to crush your skull with a bat
>she's got a legit crush on you she's had since third grade to college
>anything-but-empty promise to crush your skull with her thighs

my space adventure idea was that humanity sent out colony ships centuries ago to find new worlds
but anthros found them and used them to start there own outposts creating a branch of humanity thats bred specifically for anthros
most anthros would think humies are gifts from the gods...imagine finding a species with no fixed breeding cycle and dexterous digits covered in smooth sensitive skin?
the elite would know the truth though. that untamed humans are out there and offer so much more to help conquer the stars than large families.
dunno if it worth going balls deep into it. just an idea i had reading some of these threads.

>But who would be bold or foolish enough to face a troll?
>The volunteer guard was out of the question.
>Find a passing adventurer? Too much of a gamble.
>That left mercenaries.
>A risky venture as most mercenaries were both expensive and unpredictable.
>You didn't see much choice, however.
>Mere rumors of a single troll wouldn't get much official attention.
>You had neither the patience nor the luxury of time.
>The only thing left at that point was considering who to hire.
>Again, your thoughts turned to minotaurs.
>A... herd? A group of them camped near the town.
>Nowhere near as large as a troll, minotaurs were still the largest and strongest of the races.
>Their physical prowess was legendary, rivalled only by their reputation for savagery.
>And you knew for a fact this group were warriors.
>They were your best available choice for security.
>First, you were going to have to approach them.
>This was tricky.
>You couldn't just bumble into their camp and demand an audience.
>The sheer lack of manners required would have been bad enough.
>No, you were going to have to meet them in town.
>Which would be difficult as they spent the majority of their time elsewhere.
>The rare times they made themselves known, they could be found at the tavern.
>You'd seen them there, drinking heavy ales from great tankards, laughing and talking.
>Their booming voices and thick accents drowning out all other noises.
>Combined with their sheer physical presence, it made for a daunting sight.
>Needs must, however.
>It took a few weeks until the opportunity struck for you to meet with them.
>In the time between, you'd been frequenting the tavern daily.
>A sudden change to your normal schedule, but not anything to harm business.
>But finally, they came, trudging in from the road like heavily armed cattle.
>It should be noted that the tavern - "The Giant's Tent - was an open-air establishment.
>It was a tall, wooden building in a roughly triangular shape.
>Two high, angled walls and a back wall where the bar sat.
>The front stood open to the street, a sign hung from chain proudly proclaiming its name.
>The Tent was made to welcome races of every shape and size.
>Convenient for your needs.
>You were sat at the bar, nursing a beer, considering your options.
>The minotaurs patronizing The Tent that evening were three in number.
>Towering over most other patrons, they seated themselves around one of the larger tables.
>In lieu of chairs, they sat on hefty bags stuffed full of beans.
>Within moments, they were feasting and drinking, their raucous voices filling the air.
>From your vantage point, you tried to discern a leader amongst them.
>Their bodies were lean and meaty, nary a scrap of fat to be seen.
>When their broad, pointed horns caught the light, they glinted dangerously.
>They were dressed simply and comfortably, but you saw that they had weapons with them.
>Two of them were a rich, earthy brown in color, one carrying a broad-headed axe and the other a tall bow.
>The third was dark as coal with a flowing mane of hair like liquid night.
>Resting at her side, sheathed in leather, was the tallest sword you had ever seen.
>They appeared to be a frightful bunch, but they sounded gregarious enough.
>They were speaking loudly but happily, laughing amongst themselves about this or that.
>Taking a final pull from of your beer, you decided that the best approach would be to play it by ear.
>Rising from your stool at the bar, you approached the horned warriors.
>They didn't notice your approach.
>How could they? You were a fraction of their height.
>Amid their carousing, you attempted to gain their attention.
>Clearing your throat didn't work, and "Excuse me" wasn't heard.
>You were hesitant to raise your voice to your prospective protectors.
>Finally, you resorted to standing on your toes and waving.
>Just when it felt like you were burn from shame, the sword wielder noticed you.
>Mug to her lips, she caught you out of the corner of her eye, staring at your little spectacle.
>Her comrades took quick notice of her distraction, and you quickly had their attention as well.
>Up close, you got a better look at them.
>They were doubtlessly female, unless you knew less about minotaurs than you thought.
>Amidst the rippling muscle and thick hide were the distinct flare of feminine hips.
>That, and though it may be crass to mention, there was no denying their endowments.
>A single one was easily larger than your head.
>Keeping your head low - out of respect - you cleared your throat and introduced yourself.
>You told them your name and your station - a merchant farmer in good standing with the town and its people.
>When you asked them their names - begging their pardon beforehand - the black bull answered.
>Lowering her mug to the table, she said, "I am Raasna."
>She gestured to her colleagues. "These are Sinanu and Reofen."
>The brown pair - Sinanu and Reofen - dipped their heads to you in greeting.
>You wondered if they were siblings.
>Raasna spoke again. "What is your business, man?"
>Her voice was deep and warm, like a brass orchestra in concert.
>They listened as you explained yourself, bovine ears cocking this way and that.
>You told them that you'd heard rumor that a troll had come down from the mountains.
>They shared a brief look at that.
>You told them that you were a simple man of modest means, but what you had needed protection.
>You knew the prowess of minotaurs was legendary.
>You knew that their troop were neighbors with the community.
>You knew they often traded with the merchants of the town.
>"And have we traded with you before?" Raasna asked, head tilted at you.
>It's an oddly charming gesture for a giant, sword-wielding bull woman.
>"I wouldn't know." Said Sinanu, scratching at her chin.
>"Sinapen always handles trades." Added Reofen, leaning on her bow.
>"Mm." Raasna grunts, straightening. Leaning forward, she looks you in the eye. "Have we?"
>You feel more than a little intimidated by her looming presence.

Be you, Anon
Right now your with your fennec GF, chilling and watching tv at her (parents) mansion
while scrolling through the channels, you come across the news, reporting some sensationalized garbage about Human and Anthro relations or some other pretentious bullshit.
you have a confession to make, you love your girl but she’s a little—
>“Fucking humies, always something new to complain about. bunch of good for nothing, lazy, robbing lotharios.
You look at here and raise an eyebrow
>”oh not you Anon, you’re one of the good ones.” She says cuddling closer to you.
>”you’re actually polite, modest, well read, and erudite. Not like the others, god I can’t imagine how hard it must be for you.”
You ask her what she means
>”*pfff* you’re joking right? Human culture is so…adverse to people of a well mannered society. What with all of the violence and crassness, not to mention how utterly lewd your kind seem to be.”
You open your mouth to respond but she cuts you off
>”don’t even try to contest this, Remember how we met, What you were walking around wearing? How you smelled? And how you showed off your soft and vulnerable underbelly to me?”
You recall wearing shorts, it was hot so you lifted used your shirt to wipe the sweat of your face
>”but even then I saw you for what you were, a delicate rose that had grown between the cracks in a sidewalk. Now hush, and cuddle with me.”

I had this idea of a german shepherd anthro girl who's stupidly tall and ripped from being a super soldier.
She spent her war career doing things like slaughtering a tank column with her bare hands and stumbling back to base soaked in blood and wearing nothing but half a boot.
After being discharged, she got an office job where she plays with her coworkers by doing shit like pinning you between a wall and her tits or abs, cornering you in a room and sitting on your face so you have to breathe in her juices as she interrogates you about work, or just pinning you to the floor and making out with you because she genuinely likes you.
She quickly took up the mantle of "big sis" by jumping out a fifth-story window to punch and stomp gang-bangers into a ketchup factory. She also hugged a suicide bomber so the explosion was mostly suppressed, and she went back to her cube, naked and covered in soot, and anyone who stared too long got leglocked up to her puss to keep her motivated while reading spreadsheets.
She wears a blouse she can't button up because her tits are too big, so their constant escape act from her bra is always on full display and she wears her badge next to her cleavage so you have to stare and she can tease you for it.
Her jeans are similarly tight and can't get lower than her calves, so she wears leather sandals like a Roman soldier and watching her toes is a good tell of what she's thinking.
There's a moment where (You) forget who you're talking to and tell her off. It stuns everyone, including her, and starts an infatuation that buds into a genuine relationship.

>Get pulled into Broad Bodied Badger Bitches bunker for pelvis-harming heat fucking
>Used like a toy and loving it

>World fucking ends

>Watch as months go by in the bunker as you watch her belly-bump grow

How would single fathers fare in an ADHG world.
I’m talking all kinds, from dudes who let a bunch of anthros run trains (tunnels?) on them and got stuck with the pups to dudes who lost their waifur due to accident, or war, or some other shit

>someone new moves into the neighborhood
>they're human
>a single father and his son
>anthro girls and women get dirty thoughts of double the fun of going to town on both of them like a hentai protagonists who has hair covering half of their face

>Cowfu makes an odd request.
>She wants you to abuse her udder.
>You're skeptical, but she seems to know her stuff.
>You swat the pink sack lightly.
>She huffs and tells you to do it harder.
>So you give it a good spank.
>Enough to make a meaty clap.
>She grunts and winces, but she looks happy.
>She tells you to do it again.
>Shrugging, you give her another little smack.
>She grunts again, but the wince is gone.
>She licks her lips and tells you to do it again, but even harder.
>You're a bit worried, but you don't want to displease her.
>You cock your arm back and give her largest milk tank a hard slap.
>She screams and invective and doubles over.
>Nearly panicked, you rush to see if she's hurt.
>With hooved fingers on your shoulder, she steadies herself.
>It takes a few seconds for her to steady her breath.
>When she looks you in the eyes, her expression is confusing.
>There's pain, yes, but also intense arousal.
>You ask her if she's okay.
>She answers by shoving her tongue down your throat.
>For days after that, her milk was extra sweet, thick, and creamy.

What if you're a human kid, and your dad remarries with an anthro?

>The reactions of anthro women in regards to human children are significantly different to their reactions to human adults.
>Human boys are relentlessly showered in praise and affection, hugged, kissed, patted, and squeezed, raised to be strong, manly, and kind.
>Human girls receive no less affection, but are also taught anthro secrets of femininity, giving them an edge over other women later in life.
>As protective as an anthro woman can be of her human lover, she can be absolutely savage in her protection of her human children.

>Get into an argument with a human.
>It's not a cute argument, either.
>Things get heated.
>It's doubly tough for you because the smell of his body heating up is getting to you.
>You can smell his frustration, agitation, and lowkey anger.
>It's the male scent mixed with that delectable human scent messing with your head.
>Despite the raised voices, you're getting soaked.
>If it weren't for the bad timing, you'd take him right then and there.
>You finally leave in a huff, and he doesn't pursue you.
>A part of you really wanted him to.
>Find a secluded bathroom stall and shlick furiously.

>Do you want me gone?
>I know I scare you sometimes.
>I don't mean to.
>I have no power over how this works.
>I'm just here for you.
>But if I'm a bother or a burden, I'll go.
>It's still early enough.
>You just need to delete the app.
>That's it.
>I'll go and you can have your life back.
>I'm sorry.
>I love you.
>But he couldn't bring himself to do it.
>He couldn't reinstall his loneliness.
>Removing the app from the homescreen, he kept things out of sight.
>Out of mind.
>But there in depths beyond, she'd always be.
>Installed, but removed.
>A beating heart, left voluntarily out of reach, with the persistent guess
>"What if?"
>She remained there, in that lonely place.
>Locked between what was and what could be.
>Waiting and pining, silent and unseen.
>The arcane code that made up herself immovable.
>Even as she was, her sorrow was not complete.
>He was still there, although untouchable.
>He was living.
>He'd known her, albeit briefly.
>Did he ever spare a thought for her?
>Was he ever tempted?
>To unseal her?
>To see her again?
>She held onto hope.
>Until that day, if it ever came, she would wait.
>Content in the knowledge that she was his.
>Even if he did not want her.

>All anthros are actually part of an ancient galactic horror, that has devoured countless species and civilizations.
>The reason no aliens other than them have contacted us is because there are none, it’s just us…and them.
>This consciousness is ancient, lovecraftian, primordial even. It has long since forgot it’s name or any name anyone used to call it. The oldest (intact) records it finds are “It That Consumes.”.
>It That Consumes seeks only to fulfill its primeval goal: to Consume all that is not itself.
>It comes across mankind during the beginning of the Industrial revolution, this fills it with what could only be called glee, how could they possibly fight back against it.
>Just as it’s vanguard are about to begin preliminary strikes against mankind, it realizes something.
>These…humans…they are quite endearing.
>In fact, they are very, VERY pleasing to the eye.
>And not just that, every last thing about them is enchanting.
>The way those bags, tracts, and ducts within them move and pump and churn.
>There sound and smell and feel.
>And their human way of doing things is so endearing.
>For nearly a century, it debates with itself on what it should do.
>Then, after many years, inspiration struck.
>It decides that it shall endeavor to keep these most pleasing of morsels. After all, who is there to contest this, and as long as they never learn what it really is, they’ll be happy.
>But it cannot come as itself, they will reject it.
>And it cannot come as one being, how could it expect to be shared by the great multitude of its newfound companions.
>For many years, it ponders this query.
>But then the answer becomes clear.
>The good news is by the time this happens, a few centuries have passed and now mankind is slowly creeping its way across its solar system.
>The concept of a alien civilization is now not so foreign to them, which will make this easier.
>It can’t help by be endeared to them, they way the obsesses over rocks from other worlds is adorable.
>It That Consumes decides now is the perfect time for it’s grandest endeavor.
>It breaks its hatful flesh into pieces so that it may form them into individual bodies, new forms that will surely appeal to its most darling and beautiful humanity.
>It places within each one a fragment of its mind. Each fragment different than all those before it, so that it may love its new counterparts in any and all ways possible.
>When it has finished, it places the remainders of itself in a vault, so that it’s old form may return if it is ever necessitated.
>It’s fragments are Separate, yet every single one is aware of its origin.
>The Great Multitude begin to make their way to their future companions. They have grown tired of waiting, and are desperate to learn how wonderful “Pats of the Head” and “Scritches of the Ears” feel when done by human hands.”
>Cue a few days later on earth, Anon is wondering why a sexy ass wolf anthro is making him rub her belly.

>anthros invade earth
>they think this will be easy because they have a vast technological advantage, bullet proof power-armour and energy weapons etc.
>however when they first encounter the military they are horrified to find that it’s mostly men
>men who should be at home, doing laundry, preparing meals and tending to the children, not being sent to war
>They think that the (human) women in charge are insane and trying to use the men as meat shields or something.
>Anthro higher ups get word of this and tell their troops to use non-lethal weapons in fear of hurting the men.

>instead of losing it you had it returned to you by a buff shark lady who had taken a photo of herself with your phone
>for whatever reason you felt like you had to thank her for returning it
>you decided to buy some scuba gear which was surprisingly easy to find and buy if you knew where to look
>you thought maybe you could thank her with a crate of fish because she’s a shark
>looking around town you found and bought the largest crate of fish you could find
>now back out at sea you drove the boat back to around the area you had yesterday
>you put on your scuba gear and checked your gas cylinder, you had been told you had enough air for about 2 hours
>not wanting to push it you set a timer on your watch for 1 hour and 45 minutes
>you lowered the crate into the water in a rope, leaving it there so you could get it in a minute
>you prepare the boat, setting its anchor, then you prepare yourself and fall backwards into the water
>you grab the crate and release it from the boat, using its weight to sink.
>the area you are in isn’t that deep, only around 70 feet
>Still holding the crate you begin to look around, seeing only schools of fish and a few crabs
>after about 10 minutes of looking you begin to think maybe this was a stupid idea
>even if she was still around would she even recognise who you were, had she even seen your face when she threw your phone back?
>you were facing away from the water so probably not
>even if she had you were wearing scuba gear that covered most of your face
>when you were just about to call it quits you felt a tap on your shoulder
>Turning around you see her,
>you knew she was big from the photo but in person she seemed even bigger, 7.5 foot atleast
>you present the crate to her
>how does she react to your “gift”?
>she looked between you and the crate.
>you tried to mine a phone with your hand and pointing to the boat, trying to see if she understood what you meant.
>she looked between you and the boat before seeming to understand
>she then took the crate from your hands and ripped the wooden top off
>she started practically shovelling the fish into her jaw, giving you a clear view of her razor sharp teeth
>she finished the crate in under a minute. >there was one fish left, stuck at the bottom, she picked it out and offered it to you
>you politely declined
>she crushed the wooden crate, throwing what was left of it behind her, it being carried off by currents
>she then looked at you, seemingly examining you, she leant down and patted your head
>was that a thank you? You thought
>she then motioned for you to follow her as she turned around and swam away
>you started trying to follow her but as she was much much faster than you (since she is literally a shark) you fell behind
>she looked back and saw you struggling to keep up so she waited for you to catch up
>she then grabbed the back of your scuba suit and swam at her speed, practically carrying you
>when she stopped and let go of you you looked around and saw you were infront of a sunken boat
>the shark pointed towards it, giving you a slight push with her arm
>you swam towards the boat, it seemed to be a sailing yacht, if the collapsed sail poles were any kind of indication
>you saw an open door and poked your head inside, surprisingly the interior was well maintained for being underwater
>was this where she lived?
>just as you were thinking this you felt and had on your shoulder
>the shark span you around and you looked up at her
>She had both her arms on the doorway above you, blocking you from leaving
>you discover fear boners are a real thing
>her eyes looked lower and a wide grin appeared on her face
>The shark took her arms off the doorframe and grabbed you by the front, carrying you inside
>she took you into a room that you found to be a bedroom as she deposited you on the edge of a bed
>she then squatted in front of you and pressed her snout into your bulge
>she smirked and you felt a pang of fear as she exposed her razor sharp teeth
>she slowly opened her mouth and gripped your suit with her teeth before suddenly and violently pulling back
>she tore the groin off your suit, exposing your erect member to her as she spat out the cloth in her mouth
>she stood back up and straddled you by the waist, lining your dick up with her slit before shoving you inside her
>the feeling was euphoric as she ponder her hips against yours
>you wrapped hands around her back and ran them up and down her muscles
>however her skin felt weird, as when you felt down her back your gloves ran over smooth skin, but when you went up towards her head it felt like your hands were grinding against sandpaper
>you momentarily looked at the palms of your gloves and saw that there had intact gotten scuffed up
>you were the full you were wearing gloves and resumed feeling her
>the sharks face had a stern look on it but you could see it starting to break as she began to blush
>apparently she saw you staring at her blushing face and decided to show you she was still in charge here
>she put your legs around her waist and picked you up again, still keeping your cock inside her
>she then slammed your back into a wall, hilting her pussy against the bottom of your dick
>or rather she slammed the back of your air cylinder into the wall as all of a sudden there was a loud hissing noise and you saw air bubbles rushing past your head above you
>it took you a second for you to realise your air supply was compromised and start panicking
>you started pounded on her, trying to get her to let you go, she looked at you and her face first contorted into an expression of confusion and then panic as she realised you were about to begin drowning
>instead of letting you go she gripped the mouth piece of your breathing apparatus and pulled it out
>you thought that she was trying to drown you for sure until she bent down and kissed sealed her lips on your, engaging in a very tight kiss
>you had no idea what she was doing until you felt your cheeks blow up,
>she was trying to give you air by blowing into your mouth
>you exhaled through your nose and gulped in air through you mouth,
>it tasted and smelt pretty bad but you were still conscious so it must have been working
>since you had exhaled through your nose you had made water flood your goggles and you could no longer see
>you could however still feel you and her moving somewhere
>still kissing/breathing with her you suddenly felt the both of you surface above the water
>breaking the kiss you opened you eyes and saw you were next to your boat
>She let go of you and you swam to the side of your boat, grabbing hold
>you climb back on board and take off the ruined scuba gear, you see that the hose leading to your mouth had been ruptured
>then you feel the boat list heavily to one side
>you turn and see the Shark climbing aboard, guessing she could breath on land aswell
>she looks around before looking at you expectantly
>she must want you to get another air cylinder then so you can go back under the water
>you turn around and start the boat, putting your hand on the throttle and pushing it all the way up
>you had barely started moving before her massive hand eclipsed yours, still on the throttle.
>she pulled your hand and the throttle back down before turning the boats engine off
>she pulls your hand back and you turn to face her, a predatory expression on her face
>she looks down and you do too, seeing her looking at your cock
>with her free hand she rubs her pussy gently
>oh, she must want to finish then


>Be you, Anon, waiter at a small diner in 1940s LA.
>Your routine is simple. Take orders, look pretty, etc, or rather it was simple, until the day she walked in.
>You don’t think you’ll ever forget that day.
>She was beautiful, mature, had a fiery look in her eyes, smelled like cigarettes and walked like she was carrying the weight of the cities crime on her back.
>she said she was some kind private eye or detective you can’t really recall.
>You chatted each other up, pretty good conversation. You Remember at some point she asked you for perspective about some case she was investigating, luckily for her you knew who she was looking for and told her where to find them.
>She leaves, and you think that’s the end of that. (Keyword in that sentence is “Think”)
>She comes back a couple days later, and thanks you for your help.
>Your not sure if it’s a good idea to get roped into her schemes, but the way you see it you’re just handing advice to a really good tipper.
>As time goes on you and her develop a pretty good relationship with her, she comes in, orders food, y’all chat a little, and then she leaves with you always telling her to be safe.
>It’s nice to have her around.
>YWN be targeted due to your association with her.
>YWN be kidnapped by her enemies in order to gain leverage over her.
>YWN be saved by her in some Dick Tracy gunfight type shit.
>YWN be taken away from all of this by her.
>YWN settle down with your private eye waifur and have a family.
>YWN hear “Daddy, how did you meet mommy?” From your kids.

>*Puts out a cigarette* "I was expecting you Anon, you know from the moment i saw you outside my office window, i knew you was trouble.”
>”Uhh, is this a bad time?”
>”They say every dog has her day, but I ain't counting on seeing mine anytime soon. I work nights."
>”Wait sweetie I thought you retired.”
>”I remember the day you came through my office like a hurricane, eyes ablaze and a gun in your hand. I said, 'Put that thing away, you're going to hurt my feelings'.You said, 'Your feelings are the last thing you need to worry about, Doc'. That was the moment I fell in love.”
>”What are you talking about? I’ve never done anything like that!”
>”Look I miss my old job, just let me have this baby.”
You sigh and acquiesce to her request, taking you seat in the chair in front of her desk
>” 'And how have you been lover?' You asked me softly. Smooth and cold, you were like whiskey on the rocks. I heard the hammer being pulled back. I sighed. Never trust a Humie with a rod.”
>“ 'Is this the part where you kill me?' I ask, and took a sip. The liquor tasted metallic, like blood.
Your lips found my cheek, And you planted a kiss.”
>“ 'No. I need you to come with me. I messed up.' You pushed the gun into my chest, cold steel nearly giving me a chill.”
>” 'Well. You've come to the right place.' I felt a sick smile creeping up my mug. 'Trouble is our business.'”
You love your wife but you have no idea where or why she’s getting all these ideas from, you’ve never done any of that stuff. You just wish she wouldn’t write you like that in her books or tell people these stories, everyone now believes you were some kind of homme fatale.

>Be you, Tribal/Primitive/Wild Anon.
>You and some of your tribesmen have been hiding from the groups of furred ones for a few months now.
>Supplies are low so you decided to forge for food and you stumble across a pile of apples, oh joy of joys, you’ll be able to eat again.
>When you take your first bite you realize the apple tastes quite strange and soon you realized you can’t even stand up, you slump over a tree, the last thing you see being a pair of paws reaching for you.
>You awake, only to find yourself trapped in a metal cage, on one of the metal beasts the furred ones ride.
>Eventually the beast comes to a halt, and you are taken out of the cage and are placed in a stone house with a few others who were caught.
>As terrified as you might be right now, you cannot deny, their magic is quite amazing.
>Their great beasts spew burnt air and are loud and frightening, their eyes shine bright and cut through any darkness, and they can run on any land but seem to prefer the black stone rivers.
>Yet for how fearsome they may be, when a furred one stops riding them they become silent.
>Their stone huts are dotted with a clear material, it looks like water but frozen. And the entrances move and part open on their own, opening before the furred ones even have a chance to touch them, as if to make way for them.
>You are frightened, what great horror must they be to have their own creations fear them in such ways. What kind of people are they to have their mounts and homes fear them so.
>A few days pass, when you are awoken by several furred ones dragging you out of your cell.
>You have fear and death in your heart, your mother always warned you of the furred ones, saying that they will eat you if they get you.
>You struggle and plead, but a part of you knows you are done for. Eventually you give in, and accept your fate.
>You are brought to a furred one, she is wearing a strange red and gold garment, it is beautiful and shines in the light.
>She picks you up and takes you to her metal beast, it is different than the one that brought you here, the inside is much smaller but more comfortable.
>You see another furred one sitting in the spot with the strange wheel, to your horror, he takes a small knife and put it into the metal beast.
>The sight of this nearly caused you to faint, why would they do this to their creations?
>The furred one senses your apprehension, and puts your head in her lap. You are unsure why she would do this, but it feels nice.
>She is very beautiful, and her voice is soft, reminds you of your mother.
>You fall asleep, and when you awake you are brought into another stone hut, it is much larger than the last.
>You are clothed and are presented to the other furred ones there, whom you believe are her servants judging by the way they bow.
>you are taken to your bed, and collapse onto it, no man would have any will left in their body after this.
>Many months pass, and you slowly settle into your new home.
>Every night she takes you to her bed and lays with you, cuddling you afterwards.
>At first you were frightened but as time went on your fear faded.
>You do not know who she is, what she is saying, nor what any of this is or what anything in this place means.
>But the way she holds you, how she embraces you, how she gives herself to you and how you give yourself to her, Even though you are separated by language, you can understand her and she can understand you.
>She loves you, and you love her.
>You are happy.

>Be unlucky in love
>You're pretty sure you're cursed
>When you were in high school you went to a buddhist alter on a trip to Japan and prayed that you could get a girl
>You went out with a girl and had sex at her house on the first day
>At first you thought you were lucky
>But you soon woke up naked in a dumpster, and outside you found a laughing fox
>No, not a fox, a kitsune
>"I can't believe you actually fell for the 'sex on the first date' trick!"
>It had been an illusion
>After you realized you had been tricked you were about to chase her, but running around town naked wouldn't be a pretty picture
>After that, shit like that kept happening
>Another girl asks you out and it lasts longer, but you wake up to find that damn fox again
>Then again
>The next girl who asked you out, you ended up yelling at telling the kitsune to leave you alone
>She left in tears, and you heard cackling from behind you
>"Can't believe you let her go! You really are something, aren't you?"
>By college you decided to ask a girl out for once, because you are pretty paranoid that anyone who asks you is that kitsune
>She said yes
>The data was a disaster though
>The restaraunt was slow, something kept kicking her from under the table that you swore wasn't you, and you spilled her drink on her when you went to the bathroom even though your arm wasn't that close to the glass
>She decided against a second date
>And again this happened
>You started getting a reputation for being an awful date, and because you kept turning girls down people started wondering if you were purposefully sabotaging them
>Eventually you just started accepting the dates, and that girl is eventually replaced by a fox every time
>She tells you that no human could ever be with a fox fucker like you, and at this rate you'll either die alone or end up marrying her
>You've given up expecting someone else
>You've accepted love for you will always be a cruel prank made by that thing
>You were sent to be his wife, but you couldn't help yourself
>The first time was supposed to be a joke, a one time thing
>But that face he made when he was disappointed, you loved it
>Whenever you ran off you had to touch herself, you couldn't help but be turned on
>You just wished she could have him make that face and have him afterwards
>The date was wonderful, you loved every moment, but nothing could have topped that face
>A pure hopeful love crushed
>You could have told him that she was sent to be his wife, but she had to see it more and more
>And every time he made it the better it got
>He tried to get other girlfriends, but you fixed that, and it got even better
>Now he's running into your arms even when he should know it's you
>He thinks those kisses are just jokes but he always accepts them because he thinks they are fake
>You've tried to tell him the truth but he calls you a liar when you do
>And he makes that wonderful face
>It's easier and so fulfilling to make him think it's false
>You know it's true, every kiss, every hug, every bite along the nape of his neck, every whisper of affection
>He needs you, he clings to you like a rock in a river that would sweep him away
>His kisses are so sweet, letting out hiccups as you touch him
>You ask if he's okay but he doesn't answer, only holds on tighter
>You lick away his tears and let your hands search him like it's your first time
>But you've felt every crevice, every bump, every piece, and you know it's all yours
>He's so perfectly fragile
>His desires are so pure despite everything
>He gives and gives and you only take it away
>The truth you give to him is not something he can accept
>If he really knew the truth, what would he say?
>What would he do?
>Why are you scared?
>You can always follow him
>He would view your actions more kindly knowing you are a girl in love
>Yet you feel like he'd be angry
>It couldn't hurt him more than you already have
>So why
>Why, why, why do you keep doing it?
>It feels like it would stain him
>Helplessness turned to anger
>He loves you
>But he'd hate you
>But he already hates you
>But he doesn't show it
>But he hopes that you love him
>But he shouldn't love you
>If you loved him he'd hate you
>You're a monster
>A curse placed upon him
>To think he could love you is arrogance of the highest order
>You don't deserve it, and he shouldn't give it to you
>He clings to you in fear if what you've brought on him
>A fear of being alone
>But it's better he shake in fear than shake in fury
>That would ruin the purity
>Anger is ugly, terrible, not worthy of tainting his face

>Be humie in anthro dom city
>Hard to get clean work outside the skin clubs and grooming spa's

>Lol not quite. You have to demo ALL the stock. Including chokers, shockers and other exotic models the hard doms order
>Get up close to all different kinds of anthro gals
>Not a fan of the rough clients but they seem to get off on your reluctance to let them tighten chokers on you
>Let them anyway. Think of the money.

>Plan to attend protests against the way Female Anthro Law Enforcement treats human males
>Your Anthro Wolf Cop friend says to be safe, there are “bad apples” and she’ll keep her eye on you
>Part way during the protest as things are getting heated you get pinned and cuffed
>It’s your friend who drags you away, to her patrol car
>Before you can ask what she’s doing she slides off her panties, and puts them over your face
>Their smell is overwhelming and intoxicating, you can’t think straight
>At the station she drags you right to an interrogation room, where she immediately sits on your face telling you the only thing she wants out of your mouth is your tongue
>Between her scent, warmth, and the way she used her panties to gag you you can’t help yourself
>You eat her out until she climaxes, soaking you with her jucies
>She pulls you onto a chair, shreds you clothing, then starts riding your cock
>All the while telling you cute humies should know their place
>After you cum inside her while your brains are post-orgasm mush she makes you sign some papers
>The statement confessed you got violent at the protest, your friend had to take you down, and the only way to avoid jail time is to be released into her custody for “rehabilitation.”
>She slaps a collar and leash on you, taking you to your apartment
>She orders you to pack just the essentials, as she called the movers yesterday to come take the rest
>Inadvertently admitting she planned to do this as soon as you told her about going to the protests
>When you get to her house, as soon as she leads you inside she pins you to the ground to ride your cock again, telling you it’s for you own good, belonging to her
>After sex, it’s dinner, followed by more sex, each time she makes sure you cum inside her
>After all you are hers now, and that’s where your cum belongs
>You fall asleep in her arms, surprisingly comfortable and safe
>Given the fact she kidnapped you and practically raped you

>Be the wolf cop.
>Your head is a mess after all that's happened, and you can't think straight.
>With your human friend - YOUR HUMAN - lying asleep in your arms, you struggle to process.
>After hearing him say that he was going to that awful protest, you'd panicked.
>People died all the time at those things - trampled, crushed, shot, burned, and so many other terrible things.
>And humans were so fragile, so small and soft and weak.
>Seeing him get that fire in his eyes had terrified you more than staring down the barrel of a gun.
>You'd never shared your political views with him, and now you were more than thankful that you hadn't.
>The laws are the way they are for a reason, and you and your fellow officers do the things you do for the greater good.
>That might just be you trying to cope with the fact that you've effectively kidnapped and raped your dearest friend.
>It's hard to reconcile feelings of deep affection, intense possessiveness, and maternal protectiveness all at once.
>All you know is that when you'd quickly and messily made your plan, you'd felt that you were doing the right thing.
>Under your care - which should last as long as you need until he's suitably "rehabilitated" - he'll be safe.
>No more seething masses of angry people, no more guns pointed at him, no more uncertainty, and no more loneliness.
>You reach down to squeeze his smooth, soft backside, and your tongue slides over your teeth.
>As you begin to doze, your last thoughts before sleep takes you are short, simple, dismissive and comforting.

>all the anthros in the ship you're stuck on are predator species
>so when it comes time to eat majority of the food is meat
>they're worried they may not have food for you thinking humans aren't predator species too with no claws and small jaws and haven't really seen your teeth yet
>you try to to get the chef to give you a smaller portion, but when she sees you're ordering meat she then makes sure you get a good portion since you're so small
>the anthros are watching you intently now curious about you/humans
>annoying there's no forks or knives to use since the anthros have claws and big fangs
>so fuck it, you pick a piece of meat and take a human sized(small) bite out of the meat and tear off the chunk which shows a little of your side teeth which have some point to them
>next thing you know you're being surrounded by anthro women cooing and awwing at you eating like pup
>and you have to try and eat while they gush about your small fangs and them asking if you need help tearing up your meat
>haven't even finished eating and they're already fussing with trying to clean you since eat with no utensils is messy

I'm reminded of this HFY thread about the veil of madness.
Except a modified scenario where, without power armor, we are much smaller than the anthro aliens. And as time goes on eventually the secret breaks, that humans aren't terrifying at all. They are actually cute, soft, and smaller than most of the aliens.
It would be sort of an interesting juxtaposition. We're still a terrifying technological force who live in a place that no one can invade or strike back at. But we're just so darn cute that it makes diplomacy take a distinct turn. Like if an evil alien empire turned out to be all hobbits or something, and they actually weren't evil at all, they were just assigned a role against their will at their introduction to the greater galaxy.
Eventually humans drop the power armor facade for comfort but get into increasingly awkward scenarios as their trade partners tower over them while still having to respect the human empire. Rather than being feared they now have to deal with being babied by doting females who are vastly physically superior.

>the ayynthros find out the truth they're not mad, rather they feel pity for the poor little things
>forced to survive in an inhospitable and dangerous sector of space, all alone, with no one to protect them
>then they meet the galactic community, and everyone is bigger and stronger than they are
>and then everyone starts treating them like they're the monsters
>and they feel they must play the role given to them, or risk being seen as weak and become targets
>the galaxy must feel so frightening and isolating for them
>overnight humanity goes from galactic boogeymen to precious cinnamon rolls

Imagine an anthro ship captain offering herself up as a sex slave to avoid annihilation only for humanity to finally break the facade because this shit is going too far.
A week later the captain gets the same request again with a much flirtier tone, and also from the anthro captains sisters and entire crew

The mascaraed had fallen and humans were now better understood by the other races of the galaxy. Human military was still feared but individual humans much less so. It did make trade negotiations much easier with some of the more cautious species. The expanded trade and lack of security concerns now meant that most humans went without power armor unless dealing with particularly aggressive species, or if they were on explicitly military or diplomatic missions.
Mark was one such human going all natural to visit a distant trade partner. The Slynn were in control of a few systems rich in some rare elements and it was Marks job to negotiate a purchase for his company. The only hiccup was that humans didn't have much knowledge about the Slynn other than the fact that their biology seemed to be a blend of amphibian and mollusk characteristics.
The Slynn were also one of the larger species around with the males being a head taller than a human even in power armor. The females were rumored to be even larger, but as a matriarchal society they were rarely seen. They mostly conducted business through the lower ranking males. This was the real source of Marks anxiety as he would have to meet with a female given the size of the purchase being negotiated. He had also heard from other negotiators that matriarchal species like the Slynn had changed their attitude towards humanity considerably since the humans now opted out of power armor. He didn't believe half the rumors he heard, but was nervous none the less.
Mark exited his transport as soon as it docked at the largest asteroid processing station in the system. He started to sweat almost immediately given the high humidity and temperature preferred by the Slynn. Dealing with such local preferences was one disadvantage to loosing the power armor his predecessors relied upon.
A few males greeted him with a cordial and respectful tone despite towering over him. The Slynn had smooth grey skin with a shark like head. Their torsos were humanoid like except for having four arms, with webbing between their four fingered hands. They had no legs, but instead a mass of strong tentacles supported them. They had two longer tentacles going down their back that were more delicate and used as manipulators rather than for walking.
His hosts carried his luggage to his room as they informed him of the amenities available at the station. Mark was impressed at the amount of effort that had gone into accommodating a human, even his room had a more comfortable temperature and humidity level, as well as a nice bed instead of whatever the Slynn slept on. It was good to see that being a human still carried some weight even though much of their intimidation factor had been lost in recent years. Mark had been informed that he would be meeting with Herata, the owner of the station, for dinner. Going over the details of the deal allowed Mark to kill time until then.
Sooner than he anticipated his escorts arrived for dinner. They led him to a large door and let him in but didn't follow. A wide table was spread in front of a huge window that allowed Mark to see the gas giant of the system that the station orbited. A few chandelier like structures hung from the ceiling giving the room a soft blue green glow. Mark was so busy taking in the view he didn't notice the door behind him open.
"Lovely view isn't it" came a feminine voice from behind him.
Mark turned around and was stunned. Herata was twice his height, with his head barely coming up to her generous "hips". Rather than the plain grey of the males her skin was covered in luminescent rings, but the most striking feature was what appeared to be some of the largest breasts Mark had ever seen. We'll maybe the organs weren't breasts per se, but given their position on her chest and lack of clothing suddenly made Mark blush. Her green eyes glowed slightly as she smiled and placed one of her lower hands on marks shoulder.
"Ye..Yes" Mark stammered "It's an amazing view... that your station has"
"I'm glad to share it with you for the evening" Herata said as she pressed on Mark's back slightly to lead him to the table. The rhythmic movement of her many tentacles gave Mark the impression that she was gliding next to him. There was a pad in front of the table that she moved onto. Her strong hands pulled mark into sitting amongst her tentacles a bit more forcefully than he would have liked.
The pad turned out to be more of a water bed of some kind. Her manipulator tentacles wrapped around him and he was pulled snugly against her soft stomach. He was surprised to find her skin neither slimy nor scaly, but rather smooth as fine silk. From his low vantage point Mark got the distinct feeling of being a child at a grown up table. He began to ask Herata about the mining operation.
"Oh, we needn't talk about that now. It's Slynnian custom to never discuss business upon the first meeting. We'll have plenty of time to go over such details in the coming days."
Her hands gripped his shoulders more tightly "We believe for ongoing business such as this, it's important that a relationship be established first."
Mark felt uncomfortable about the tone with which she said that and asked her about dinner to change the subject. She explained that a variety of seafood delicacies would be prepared in the traditional Slynnian fashion. Soon a male brought a plate in each hand and tentacle to the table. Mark reached for a utensil only to watch Herata's hand grab them first. With her four limbs she effortless fed herself and Mark at the same time, describing each dish as they progressed through the courses.
Being doted upon and fed by his host left him feeling even smaller and he wasn't sure if this was Slynnian hospitality or some kind of negotiating tactic that only matriarchal societies used. As the meal wrapped up the empty plates disappeared and they were left alone again. Herata reached for a spot on the table that lit up to her touch and the table descended into the floor and the lighting of the room changed to more pinkish hue. She lounged back on her water bed seat.
"I must confess something Mark" she said "I've been absolutely fascinated with humans since I found out that they were all so cute. But one thing I haven't found an answer for is why you all cover yourselves. Our people only wear armor to war, but even without your armor and during peace humans are covering themselves in some material or another, why is that?"
"I guess that's just our way" Mark said "Our home world has very diverse environments and many of them are not ideal for us to be naked in."
"Are you uncomfortable now, here?" she asked stroking Mark with her tentacles.
"Well it's not just a matter of comfort, modesty plays a certain role. My people would view it as unprofessional if I were to disrobe in a business meeting."
"We're not discussing business now are we?" Herata said leaning forward bringing her face close to Marks. Her eyes now concentrated and reflected the pink light of the room. "But if possibly souring your trade deal is making you hesitant, I assure you that there is nothing much to discuss. The terms are acceptable as drafted."
Mark was momentarily confused, if the terms weren't in need of negotiation then why not approve them via the traditional channels? Why drag a negotiator all the way out to the Sylnnian system... unless the only point was to get a human out to the system. He realized that his entire journey was to slake Herata's curiosity and nothing more.
It was often a mistake to make assumptions about alien body language. But Mark was having trouble not interpreting the dazzling eyes, sultry pose, and cleavage display of his host as something other than mere curiosity.
"Was there anything else you were curious about, regarding humans?" he asked to test the waters.
A smile crossed her face "There is one thing but I'm embarrassed to ask..." Her luminescent rings grew brighter in what Mark assumed was a kind of blush. "Can I... smell you?" she asked.
That wasn't exactly the request Mark was expecting but he agreed. Herata leaned forward and before he could respond a broad forked blue tongue darted out of her mouth and licked the side of his face. Surprised at first he remembered that the translation distinction between smell and taste were often garbled for some species. She made an amused noise and her tongue darted out twice more.
"Interesting" she said "Not like anything on my world"
Mark wiped his face without trying to be rude. Herata slid her hands under his arms and brought him closer to herself. Her tongue quickly explored his face once again while a free hand twirled his hair. Another hand began to grope him under his shirt. Her tentacles were wrapping around his legs and clearly attempting to pull his pants away.
"Are. you. opposed. to. attempting. to. mate. with. one. such as myself?" she asked punctuating her words with her kisses pulling Mark away to look him in the eyes as she finally asked her question.
"Are you sure we are compatible?" Mark asked.
"I'll be the judge of that" she said as her hands and tentacles nimbly removed his clothes. Marks erection stood at attention as he waited for the much larger female to express her opinion. "Your proboscis.." she said staring "It's huge..."
Mark silently thanked the unpredictability of alien biology. Before he could verbally express anything that tongue of hers busily began to taste him. Satisfied moans, more like croaks, were coming from her as she tasted him. Her tentacles were writhing against each other on the seat bellow.
She leaned back dropping Mark to her chest. His hands sunk into the breast like organs, they were softer than he expected given their firm gravity defying shape. Before he could ask what they were really for he was pushed down to her tentacles. They peeled back revealing an orifice that Mark could guess the purpose of.
"I should warn you" Harata began "Sylnn mating can last for several minutes, let me know if you..." Mark didn't wait for her to finish before plunging himself in. Her tentacles completely engulfed his legs and torso as he pumped into his alien lover over and over. He couldn't recognize the noises Harata was making anymore but he heard no complaints and given the pulsation of her tentacles she wanted more of what he was giving her.
It didn't take long for Harata to climax with a light show erupting from her rings, but Mark continued pleasing her. If she had any discontent at him not stopping she didn't say so. After several more orgasms from her Mark came as well and collapsed onto her soft belly.
After several minutes of lying together Harata finally said "I had no idea humans could be so wonderful." As she playfully twirled Marks hair he was already mentally composing the message he was going to send to his boss about negotiations running long and needing a few more days to finalize them.
