ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

>Wilderness camping is not for the faint of heart. Emma liked to take it a step further, trying to keep her carry weight as low as possible. It's not that she struggled with the weight. She was a grizzly bear, she could probably hike all day long while carrying an average person. It was just that she enjoyed the challenge of minimalistic camping. Plus, what's the point of going as deep into nature as possible if you're just going to bring civilization with you?
>So when she packed for her annual summer trip to Alaska, she only brought the bare minimum. A few day's worth of dried food, in case foraging proved difficult. A small cooking pot, and a spork to eat out of it with. A canteen, a blanket, a cigarette lighter, a small first-aid kit, a canvas tarp, a hatchet, a belt knife, and a large revolver, just in case. Total weight, 14 pounds. 16 if the canteen was full. Nothing else besides the clothes on her back, and a backpack to carry the gear.
>It took Emma three days of hiking to get to her campsite. It was probably about as far away from civilization as you could get without leaving the United States, a pristine mountain with a gorgeous view over a lake. All supplies were in good order when she began to set up camp. It was almost the summer solstice, so there was plenty of daylight left to work with. It was easy enough to set up a thatched hut out of evergreen branches, with the back side of the hatchet serving as a hammer to drive the boughs acting as corner posts into the ground. Smaller pine branches and reeds from the lake piled deeply made an excellent bed. A circle of rocks around a small pit, dug out with sturdy sticks, made for a fireplace. All in all, a cozy campsite.
>It was about 10PM when Emma was finishing up dinner, fried fish and a salad of wild greens. She had been worried that she would be a bit rusty at spear fishing, but the lake was well stocked and her aim was true. As she lifted the spork to her mouth for the first bite, she paused. There was a strange rumbling in the distance, growing louder by the second. As she set the fish back down on the flat stone that was serving as frying pan and dinner plate, the light suddenly dimmed. Looking up in confusion, Emma saw that clouds were rapidly forming from nowhere, blocking the sun. While she had seen the weather change rapidly before, this was entirely new.
>The rumbling continued to rise in volume. Green lights danced within the clouds. A strong breeze swept across the countryside, causing trees to sway. Emma was grateful she had the foresight to build her hut in a sheltered area. The rumble rose higher and higher, before suddenly stopping with a loud crack. The lights gave one last great flash. It clearly outlined something falling from the sky. Emma dumped the drinking water she had been sterilizing in her pot onto the campfire, grabbed her gear, and set out to investigate.
>It took half an hour to get to where Emma saw the object fall. The forest was dense here. Emma heard a feeble groan come from nearby. Picking her way around a briar patch, she saw a red and white lump beneath a tree. It was lying on a pile of broken branches and jagged metal fragments. As she drew near, she saw it was a person in a bloodstained lab coat, lying face down. A piece of metal had dug deep into one of their legs. Emma quickly moved to check on their condition. There didn't appear to be anything wrong with their neck or spine, so she took out a roll of gauze from her pack. The fragment was too large to be left in if she moved the person, it would flop around and tear at the wound. Emma carefully pulled it out, and rolled up the person's pant leg so she could bandage the puncture. She was surprised to find that their legs were bare skin beneath, no fur or scales. She gently rolled them over, and let out a small gasp. The strange person who had fallen from the sky was a human male.
>Everyone knew humans weren't real. An entire race of impossibly beautiful, otherworldly creatures couldn't exist, it was just a fairy tale. It wasn't even a well thought-out fairy tale either, wouldn't they be freezing cold and easily injured? At best, you had those old-timey hoaxes where an ape or monkey had shaved their fur as part of a con. But this wasn't a shaved ape. Emma carefully picked up the unconscious man, as though he were a small child. The sky began to drizzle as she made her way back to camp.
>By the time Emma got there, the drizzle had become a downpour. Grumbling to herself about how there was no way she'd get a campfire going now, she laid the human down on her makeshift bed before retrieving her cold dinner. There was a small space next to the bedding inside the hut for her to sit as she finished he interrupted meal. Looking up at the human, she saw that he was starting to shiver. She took her blanket out of her pack and laid it on him, but it didn't seem to help much.
>Emma told herself that what she was about to do what strictly for her guest. But a part of her was excited by the thought of being so close to the human. She carefully peeled off her wet clothes, and did the same for the human. She left his underwear on, both out of a sense of modesty and because they had stayed mostly dry. A shiver ran up her spine, having nothing to do with the cool breeze and rain. She crawled up next to the unconscious man, and threw the blanket over them both. She wrapped her arms around him, pulled his head to her breast, and drifted off to sleep.
>A few hours later, Emma was woken up by screaming and thrashing next to her. "Shhhhhhh. It's okay, you're safe..." she said in a soothing voice. The human said something, but it was in a language Emma had never heard before, but it sounded beautiful. "Sorry, but I don't understand. Don't worry, though, you're safe." She gently stroked his hair, pulling him closer. Emma started to hum gently.
>After a few minutes, her bedmate had calmed down. At least, he had stopped struggling and screaming. But one part of him hadn't calmed at all. Emma could feel him pressing against her. "Oh, someone's enjoying themselves, hmm?" She shifted in the bed, so she would have some room to work with.
>Carefully, she reached out to the waistband on the human's shorts. He started to make a noise, as though in protest, but Emma placed a finger on his lips. "Shh, let me take care of you." Emma finished removing his last garment and he sprung up, fully erect. He wasn't especially large or small, but it was the most exciting thing she had ever seen. A real, live human, and he was all hers.
>Emma slowly bent over and gave him a sensual lick, from base to tip. As she popped his head into her mouth, the human let out a moan. Emma slowly started to move up and down, but something didn't feel right. The bed was just long enough for her to lay on normally, so she was having trouble not kicking a hole in the wall behind her. Emma stopped and sat up. Gently running a finger down the human's chest, she grabbed him by the hips and lifted him. The hut was built tall enough for Emma to stand in, so there was plenty of room as she brought him up on her shoulders. "Much better," she said to herself as she resumed. She held on tightly as she drew him back into her mouth, his legs wrapped around behind her.
>She swirled her tongue around his shaft as she moved in and out, her moans mingling with the human's. Up and down, in and out, briefly stopping her work on his rod to shift focus to his balls. He was starting to pant, his cock beginning to twitch. "Oh no, you don't!" Emma scolded him playfully. "I haven't had my turn yet!"
>Emma cautiously lowered her partner onto the bed, before moving over him. "Time to see what you can do," she said as she lowered herself onto him. She paused as the head of his shaft met her folds, waiting. The human moaned, trying to buck his hips, but she held him down and waited a moment more, before hunching over and giving him a deep kiss as she dropped all the way. They both let out a gasp as she enveloped him, filled with greater pleasure than either had ever felt before.
>"Oh, yes!" Emma cried out, continuing to greedily kiss the angelic face below her as she started to bounce up and down. He said words that she didn't understand, but she knew what he meant. She wrapped her arms around him, and pulled his head into her breasts as she continued to move. She drew his mouth to one of her nipples, and he eagerly complied, slipping it into his mouth and starting to suck at it. Emma let out a sigh of pleasure as his tongue moved over her, and she began to move slower but putting more of her weight into each thrust. Her mate shouted out something as he climaxed, filling her. Emma continued to bounce for a few moments before she finally came, letting out a roar and pulling the human even tighter to her as she did so.
>Emma laid down on top of the human, careful to keep her weight off of his injury. "That was amazing," she said. He said something in response, before slipping back into unconsciousness. Emma slowly drifted off to sleep, thinking about how she was going to get her new mate home. Hopefully, he would pick up the language soon. There was so much to talk about, and so many questions she wanted to ask, but she knew the most important thing already. He belonged to her now.

Tails make for a new angle of "attack" to worry about from anthros.

>more dexterous tails can outright grab you
>tails also contain some scent markers on them so having a tail rub against you gets their scent all over you
>bigger/fluffier ones can act like walls and force you closer to the anthro

Reminder that the human resistance has never taken a single square mile since the war began, and they've lost ground every single day, without a break, for several years now.
If you're a resisting human reading this, you need to accept that you ARE toiling away for a losing cause and you WILL be captured or killed eventually. YOU ARE ALREADY A SLAVE. You simply work for an ideology that WILL fail in your lifetime.
The happiest life you will ever lead will be to drop your weapons and start walking to the nearest anthro controlled city. Tell them where you came from and everything about your resistance. You will be pampered by your new owner, and your friends will thank you once they've been broken.
Surrender. Submit. Give in. Worship the new world and resent the life you had. You will be happier this way.

Why is the NEET archetype so amazing yet so rare? Why aren't there more moody shuddin girls? Could you make one?
Also what's another career human men would be in high demand/craved for in an anthro society? Besides Streaming and Lewd stuff, obviously. I kinda wanna say councilors, negotiators, or sales representatives. Since big swole animal women run all the major countries and corporations, you'd want to abuse their attraction for cute humie boys as much as you want, the humans distract/seduce them to better manipulate a deal in your favor. Or is this a little too unrealistic and too much like a conspiracy?

The dark cravings for such rich, light meat came naturally for Krystal; the primitive upbringings of backwards tribals saw to that. What such cruel incantations by bonfire witnessed by such exotic flora and a vast, foreign starry night, than to the copulation of underage children by mature, comprehending and vicious vixens. To such a people, if they could even be flattered with such terminology, the semen of boys is a precious gift, not to be wasted, but ensnared, coaxed and torn heatedly from within his very loins.
This is, to wit, life, or so it's called. Men are not desired past their duties as drones, genitals winded and wills caved and so it falls to the youngest among them; the incoming, to deliver centermost to rites by their young, unripe bodies.
And yet Krystal desired the youngest of them yet. Filial, without a hint of resistance in their puny little minds, practically foolish, suicidal even in their insipid efforts to rationalize her predatory intentions of drawing countless greedy mouthfuls of their sweet, childish, impotent and inconsecratable spunk from their barren, smooth little kid cherries.

Acclimating to the rules and standards of modern society and the expectations of floods of fans has been tough on Krystal. Too many times did she want to say how much she hates lizards, or how much she's dissatisfied with Fox during press conferences.
But now, all alone with her own team filled with the most capable ladies she could get, she can express herself clearly, free of the law, expectations, and the ever present eyes of the public.
In the space at the edge of Cornerian influence, she finally has a chance to express her instincts and wishes when meeting a small boy on a rotting space station after picking up a new contract. Dragging along the lonely child into her mother ship, licking her lips, she introduced another mouth to feed to the rest of the girls...
