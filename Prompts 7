ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

I just want an Anthrostate wife who realizes how fucked the system is and just wants to smooch comfortably on the couch in between long days of work at the plant. Is that so wrong to ask?

>Late evening lounging with waifur.
>"Hey! I didn't ask you how your day was!"
Uggh. I don't want to think about it.
>She lowers her paws down your arm to reach your hand.
>"Oh no! Did the girls give a rough time again?"
They were all pressing up against me, demanded I let them dress me and forced me to let them put my tools in my belt and pockets. I don't know how they think up of new lines to cross!
>"I'm so sorry honey. This is my fault."
Pff, hardly.
>"No! I thought spooning you last night would leave enough of my scent to ward them off."
*sigh* It's alright. That was very nice.
"Sweetie..."
>She takes your face in her paws and stares directly into your eyes.
>"I'm going to make love to you every night from now on. Trust me. Those anthro girls will give you your space knowing I've claimed you, completely."

>everyone knows stories of giant war-kangaroos and monkey-men from the badlands are fake
>looks like there really is nothing good on right now
>you give the remote one last click and hope for the best
>then groan in miserable disappointment as the last channel you check is showing 'The Big Flea-bang Theory'

“Ssshhhhh shhhhh... it’s alright. I did promise to be home on time I’m sorry Mia”
>you said comforting her. Her muscles giving way for being softer, and now gently twisting side to side
>poor girl, poor- big lovable girl
>summoning all of your mightiness, you heave your 7’2 beeg girl to the couch. Plopping yourself down with her on top of you like those weighted blankets
>”mmm... don’t let go... my fur is still Kuhn... a little streaked- and I’m embarrassed”
“You’re fine, you can hold me like this as long as you need. I’m not going anywhere. Besides. We have all weekend to do what we want.”
>”I’d like that, love...”
>Mia doesn’t say anything more. Allowing you to lay there and stroke her back fur that doubles as this mane-like hair that goes all the way up to her head
>the plume of fluff you can’t keep your hands off of

>but for now. Hunger is starting to set in
“It’s about time for us to have something to eat. Do you want takeout? Anything you want as a home late apology”
>she shuffled on top of you a bit. Still embarrassed at her outburst today. No matter how many times you say that she never has to be embarrassed around you when it comes to this stuff. She always feels shame after her episodes
>you wished she didn’t feel ashamed for these things, especially since they remind you about how much she loves you
>”don’t get anything just because of me, but... takeout sounds good, yeah”
>there was a silence. A peaceful serene kind of silence that normally meant she was happy

“What’s that Mia?”
>another murmur but you can make out “for a snack”

“One more time babe”
>”I wanna have that DICK for a snack OKAY? I said it, when we’re done- you, me, broken bed, got it?”
>she blurted the normally white fur on that cute as fuck cheese wedge of a snout has this pink undertone coming up from underneath
“One order of your lo mein, teriyaki, and your boyfriend coming up”
>your teasing does not go undistrubed, her tail is standing upright at this point. Along with most of her food
>”stop making fun of me! You owe me for making me sad mister!!!”

>fleabag has a weird dream
>it starts in a forest, asche finding herself flanked on all sides by tall trees
>it's getting dark so she begins aimlessly wandering to find somewhere to rest
>she comes across a clearing with a cabin. the windows are covered by curtains but light is still visible behind them.

>the imitator says "oh, welcome asche. it's good that we can finally meet" in a cheerful tone
>just then, everything goes white and the aardwolf wakes up
>asche stares at the ceiling, wondering what games her subconscious is playing with her.

>”So remember everyone, happy employees mean happy customers. When you greet one of our valued customers do it with a smile and a friendly offer of assistance!” Your manager exclaims with a clearly forced grin
>God you hate these pre-shift meetings, nothing but wasted time and useless corporate propaganda
>”On three everyone! One, two, three!”
>”Wallyworld! Do it on the cheap!” Your fellow coworkers exclaim halfheartedly
>Your manager drops the fake smile, now replaced with her usual case of resting bitch face
>”I want to see more engagement with customers out there people. Stop being such antisocial rejects.” She mutters
>As usual you turn away and roll your eyes safely hidden from her gaze
>Another Monday, another workweek, another hellish 8 hours spent in this giant concrete prison masquerading as a superstore
>Hey, at least you get a two percent employee discount
>You walk with the rest of your coworkers out of the break room and onto the main floor
>Where to?
>Maybe you’ll go to the pet section and help some old lady put a bag of dog food into her cart
>Or maybe a trip to the electronics section to help some out of touch parent decide if their kid wants the Xstation or Playbox
>Or maybe…you’ll go to the usually deserted automotive section of the store and pretend to stock items until your shift is over
>Heh, ya, that sounds like a plan
>You casually saunter over to the oft forgotten section of the store and get to ‘work’ straightening items on shelves and doing your best to look busy, thankfully you’ve had plenty of practice
>While carefully rearranging a few cans of windshield cleaner there’s the clop of hooves and someone passes by you
>Whatever, they’re probably lost or something
>After very carefully straightening the last bottle so it’s label faced the aisle you stand up, look over and-
>Ah shit, your manager is at the opposite end of the aisle, arms crossed, staring right at you
>Your head turns in the opposite direction and there’s a cervine anthro a dozen feet down the aisle from you
>Looks to be a buck with a mighty set of antlers wearing a thick leather jacket, their back is facing you
>You look back to your manager and with the look on her face the message is clear, help the valued customer
>After a long sigh you walk up to the buck, put on your best customer pleasing smile, and say the corporate line
>”Welcome to Wallyworld, can I help you find something today sir?”
>The customer’s head shoots up from what they were looking at then he slowly turns to face you
>That’s…not a buck
>That’s a female reindeer based on the sizable breasts and thick eyeliner
>And that damn jacket hiding all of her curves from the back
>She looks at you with concentrated hatred
>”What…did you just call me, punk?” She spits with a husky feminine tone
>”Uhh-I-I didn’t-can I help you find something ma’am?” You awkwardly stutter in a futile attempt to save yourself
>Her eyes burn holes into you for a few seconds before she responds
>”No, I don’t think you can asshole.” She sneers
>With a swift movement she takes a bottle of oil off of the shelf and opens it, spilling its entire contents onto the floor
>”Oops, so sorry. Guess you’ll have to clean it up.” She says with a faux apologetic tone and malicious smile
>The reindeer tosses the empty bottle onto the floor and stomps away, the clops of her hooves almost deafening
>You look back to your manager, she’s shaking her head in disappointment
>Time to spend some time with your two dearest friends, the mop and bucket
>After slaving away to clean the oil spill you wipe the sweat off your brow and stow away the mop and bucket
>What a bitch
>Asshole
>Total cunt
>You can’t believe she did that just because of a simple misunderstanding
>God! How were you supposed to know she was female with those antlers of hers?!
>Whatever, she’s probably already left the store at this point
>Time to go chill out by the food section, restock some cereal, throw away some moldy bread or something
>After a few minutes of milling around you wander into the canned soup aisle
>You straighten a few cans and-
>”Excuse me sir? Do you think I should get the chicken noodle or the vegetable beef?”
>You turn around and yep, that’s the reindeer from before, her head shifts between the two cans of soup held in her hands
>What is this? Some kind of trick? She’s got to remember you from before
>”Well, uhh, I’ve always liked the chicken noodle.”
>She shakes her head in an affirmative
>”Ya, you know what I agree, the chicken noodle sounds way better than vegetable beef.”
>To your dismay she then tosses the can of vegetable beef behind her shoulder, it lands with a wet metallic thud, the contents spilled onto the floor
>”Thanks for the help bud.” She says, walking past you with a sly grin
>Un-fucking-believable
>What an asshole!
>With a defeated sigh your anger fades and once again you have a meeting with the mop and bucket
>After cleaning up the spill you decide on a new strategy
>You‘ll just roam from section to section trying to avoid running into that damned reindeer girl again, she’s clearly got it out for you
>First a few minutes folding clothes, then you restock some office supplies, and now a stroll through the cosmetic section
>Heh, there’s no way she’d expect you to be here-
>There’s a tap on your shoulder
>After stopping in your tracks you turn around and ya, there she is again
>How did she sneak up on you with a pair of hooves?!
>”Excuse me sir, could you point me to the antler polish?”
>”It’s right over there.” You flatly state, pointing to the row of products a few feet away
>”Thanks sir.” She says, strolling over to the row of glass bottles with a wiggle of the hips
>She makes eye contact with you, places a hand on one of the bottles, then begins slowly sliding it to the edge
>”Please…don’t.” You plead
>Her smile just grows wider
>The bottle is all the way to the edge, it begins to tip, it’s about to fall…
>Just as gravity begins to pull it downward you jump forward and fall to the floor! Barely managing to catch it before the bottle contacts the ground!
>You look up to the towering reindeer, a look of bewilderment on her face
>”Ha ha ha! You’re faster than I thought ya twirp.” She says with a cackle
>With your heart still racing she turns around and saunters off still chuckling
>After getting back on your feet you put the bottle of antler polish back on the shelf and gather your senses
>Okay, milling around the store clearly isn’t going to work
>That leaves the break room and bathroom as your only safe places
>You spend the rest of your shift switching between the two, thankfully no one seems the wiser
>Eventually the hours tick down and it’s time to clock out, thank god
>After putting on your jacket you step outside, the chilly winter air assaults your sense and inky darkness puts you on edge
>Left, right, no sign of the reindeer from before, good
>You parked around the side of the building, if you hug the wall on the walk over it’s doubtful many people would see you
>Slowly, quietly, you begin slinking over to your car
>Almost there, just have to-
>*CLOP-CLOP-CLOP*
>You look at the source of the sound just in time to see a tangle of pointy antlers rapidly rushing your position
>With a girlish scream you turn away and hug the wall
>Several points impact the wall on either side of your head but thankfully none go into your skull
>Slowly you open your eyes to see the reindeer from before staring at you, her wet black nose mere inches away
>Her breath comes out in wispy clouds that tickle your face
>”You punk! Thinking you could get away from me so easily! Cowering in the break room like a sniveling child.”
>”I’m sorry-I’m sorry-I’m sorry-I didn’t mean to call you sir please don’t kill me” You desperately repeat
>Her head moves away from yours and she crosses her arms
>”Happy employees, happy customers, right?”
>”H-how do you know that phrase?”
>”Used to work here. Hated it.” She says with a huff. “So tell you what, you’re an unhappy employee and I’m an unhappy customer. Why don’t we fix that?”
>You straighten your hunched posture and feel your heart slow
>”What do you mean?”
>”Well, I, umm, do have a problem you could help me with.”
>Sex, she wants you to fug her, gotta be
>”Uhh sure, just let me get my pants off here and-“
>”Ew! No!” She shouts, cutting you off. “I’m talking about…this.”
>She flashes a bottle of antler polish at you before quickly putting it back into her pocket
>”I need some help polishing my antlers.” She whispers. “It’s real hard to get the whole set by myself and none of my friends want to help. They think it’s weird helping a girl out with her antlers considering, well, you know, it’s mostly dudes that have them.”
>Still somewhat in shock you slowly shake your head up and down
>”Ya, sure, I’ll help you out…but what do I get out of it?”
>She cocks her head, an annoyed look on her face
>”You get to go home with only the holes you were born with. And I won’t tell your manager you’ve been slacking off all day.”
>”Okay, deal.”
>”Good, now follow me wageslave, you’ve got a long night head of you.”

>You stand in a queue at the Office of Anthro Relations.
>Ahead and behind you stand dozens of men
>All here for the exact same reason
>Each one of you holds in your hands a small collection of documents that amount to your life and accomplishments
>Yours is a bit light
>The line slowly shuffles forward until only one man stands in front of you
>Your palms are a little sweaty and you can’t help the fidgeting nervously as you wait
>You’d spent the last couple weeks working yourself up to this, but actually being here was something else all together
>You’ve heard a lot of stories, most good, many not
>You’d be lying if you said you hadn’t considered other options
>But the idea of moving back in with your parents filled you with a dread that you haven’t felt in years
>“Next please.”
>A chipper voice draws you out of your thoughts and you quickly step up to the counter
>Greeting you is the smiling face of a sheep anthro
>“Good morning sir, how may I help you today?”
>You clear your throat a couple times to give yourself a moment to collect your thoughts
The sheep woman waits patiently until you place the manila folder with your application form on the counter and slide it through the gap in the glass
“Yes, um…I would like to volunteer for uh……placement…p-please ma’am.”
>The sheep woman giggles and takes your application
>“Of course sir. And on behalf of the State, thank you so much for volunteering.”
>A quick flip through the document is all that’s required before it’s given a stamp and filed away with the other applications turned in that day
>“You’re application will be processed and, if approved, you’ll be entered into a sorting pool. You will then be sent a letter detailing any other instructions before you’re scheduled for relocation. Please visit the help desk before you leave and they can answer any other questions you might have. The State again thanks you and wishes you luck on your road to marriage.”

>you realize she probably meant you to see her or wasn’t trying to hide at all
>you used to hate her but now your just apathetic
>she gets back from work at 12 but you still only really see her when she wants to see you despite you sharing the small living space
>you wondered if there was some sort deep mental biological thing inside her brain or brain equivalence telling her to hide from you

>it's over
>your long quest is finally done
>you were just a nobody working a dead-end job, until one day you were transported to a magical world of adventure and peril
>the goddess who summoned you tasked you with slaying a demon lord and saving the world before she would send you home
>kind of a bullshit deal, but she gave you magic armor and a sword that made you super strong without putting in any effort, so you weren't too put off
>plus it was a lot more fun fighting monsters and evil wizards than it was working nine-to-five at home
>even if you almost died a few times
>you needed this vacation
>but now it's all over, you and your party have killed the demon lord, and returned to the capital as triumphant heroes
>tomorrow you'll go back to the temple so the goddess can send you home
>you had considered making your goodbyes in the morning, but decided to skip the whole emotional trouble
>the friends you made here were nice, but you weren't going to see them ever again
>better to just quietly disappear, rather than go through all the tears and the hugging and all that garbage
>the dwarf will probably break your arm again with one of his 'friendly' punches
>you wander through streets packed with jubilant citizens, still celebrating victory over the demon king
>no one notices a lone human, without armor or sword, weaving through the crowds toward the outskirts of the city
>seems fitting you'd go back to that generic fantasy inn where you spent your first night in this world
>the innkeeper greets you warmly
>"Ah! Welcome back my friend."
>the friendly old orc is the only one to recognize you without your armor
>"I've kept your room tidy for you. Your guest is already waiting."

>her tail twitches from side-to-side beneath the hem of her bright yellow dress
>"I thought I'd find you here. Where it all started. You always had a poet's heart, mister hero."
>you sigh and step into the room, closing the door behind you
>guess you couldn't get away without at least one goodbye
>poet's heart is maybe a little much
"You don't have to call me that. I'm not really a hero."
>she clasps her hands together and steps closer
>you have to tilt your head down to maintain eye contact with the cat whose ears only come up to your chest
>"But you are! You saved the world, you killed the demon lord!"
>you just shake your head
"Really Mrana. It was all magic. That armor, that sword, they did all the work. Before I had them, I was nothing special."
>Mrana shakes here head and mewls
>"No! No, you're very special. Remember, when we first met? Before you had the armor, before you had the sword. You saved me from that mob with just your words! I was so scared back then, so weak. But you were brave, even without magic!"
>you remember, it was the first lucky break you had
>a bunch of angry peasants wanted to burn Mrana, so you stepped in to try and save her
>mostly because at the time, it seemed like the sort of thing that you ought to do as a hero
>"You're special to me. You're my hero."
>your heart warms, and you can't help but smile
>she's just so adorable, the way she looks up at you with her glowing eyes
"I was just playing the role. Really, I was scared out of my mind the whole time."
>you tried to break eye-contact with Mrana, but you find you can't look away
"And I think you've paid me back for saving your life already. I'd have died a dozen times without your healing magic."
>Mrana starts to purr
>her eyes stay locked on you
>"We were all scared. But bravery is about overcoming fear."
>she steps closer still
>"I'm so very scared right now, but I'm being brave for you."
>what is she talking about?
"Mrana, what are you scared of? Are we in danger?"
>she laughs, the delicate sound ringing in your ears
>"No, no. You're perfectly safe with me, my hero. It's just so very hard to say..."
>Mrana suddenly stands on her tip-toes to kiss you!
>her whiskers tickle your skin, her thin-lips are warm as they press against yours, her paws reach out to take yours
>you're completely stunned
>Mrana still holds your hands when she drops away from the kiss with a giddy laugh
>"To say I love you!"
>oh god
>she loves you
>you feel the rumble of her purr in her chest
>fuck
>goddamn she is so cute
>those eyes seem to draw you in, make you want to say the same to her
>you almost lose yourself to the temptation
>but you know it can't be
>the goddess is sending you home in the morning
"Mrana..."
>her eyelids flutter
>"Yes, my love?"
>rip off the bandaid before it's too late
"Mrana, I'm sorry. I--I can't. I'm going home, in the morning. Back where I came from."
>her smile melts away
>a flash of anger underneath, that quickly turns to sorrow
>"Going home? B-but this could be your home too. You could stay with me, couldn't you?"
>she refuses to let go of your hands when you gently try to pull away
>this is why you wanted to avoid the goodbyes
"I can't. The goddess will be waiting at the temple to send me back to my world. I have friends, family waiting for me."
>Mrana grips your hands harder, claws coming out of her paws to prick your skin
>"Please..."
>her voice trembles, tears starting to form at the edge of her beautiful green eyes
>"Please Anon..."
>gritting your teeth, you pry your hands free from her claws and step away
"I'm sorry Mrana. I have to go."
>you turn back toward the door, trying to control your own breathing
>"Please don't make me do this."
>what?
>make her do what exactly?
>you stop, hand on the door handle
>but it's too late now
>turning back would just hurt you more
"Goodbye Mrana."
>you turn the handle, and start to open the door
>when your leg snaps
>you gasp, immediately dropping to one knee as you're rocked with pain
>what's happening?
>"I'm sorry my love."
>Mrana's voice has lost its tremble
>"But I cannot let you leave me."
>you clasp at your leg
>it hurts
>worse than when you broke it on a quest ages ago, crossing the great desert
"M-Mrana. What did you do?"
>you look back to her, green eyes now cold and hard like emeralds
>"Healing magic is a tricky thing, my hero. The body needs time to heal. If my magic heals your injuries all at once, your body never has a chance to fix itself."
>she makes a gesture, and wounds start opening up on your arms, legs, chest
>"My magic takes away the damage. My magic can put it back."
>there's so many
>each one a flare of concentrated misery that drives the breath from your body
"It hurts..."
>you manage to gasp out
>Mrana sighs and leans over you to shut the door
>"I know, my dear. My magic takes the pain away too. Or, it took the pain away, until now."
>she strokes your hair, claws threatening to cut your scalp as she goes
>"I don't want to do this my love, but you left me no other choice! I confessed to you. Bared my soul to share my love with you for all the rest of my days. And you rejected me!"
>Mrana leans over you, tracing a fingertip down your cheek that opens up another old injury
>"How could you do that to me? And you were going to leave me! Your injuries may hurt, but not worse than my poor broken heart."
>the cat woman kneels down beside you, watching as the blood from a hundred old wounds seep into your clothes
>"But if you say you love me too, it would fix everything! Those words would heal my heart just as quickly as my magic could heal your flesh."
>what is she saying?
>does she think you'd ever love her after torturing you?
>you shake your head, and speak through the pain that's starting to fog your mind
"No. Have. To. Go. Home."
>the witch sighs, ears flicking in irritation
>"You can't go home, my hero. Even if I let you, what do you think would happen when you left this world? My magic would go away. All of it. Even the magic that saved your life..."
>she twitches a paw in some arcane gesture
>and you gurgle as you feel something inside you break
>a deep tearing pain
>the world starts to spin, and fade
>you're dying
>but then the world starts coming back to you
>a world of Mrana's green eyes boring into you
>"Do you understand Anon? You will die without me. Time will never heal that wound."
>the lighter injuries across your body start to seal up again, the pain fading away like it was never there
>"Even if you healed each cut, each broken bone, every single injury. That one. The one that killed you. It will never, ever go away."
>the enormity of what she's saying hits you like the truck that brought you to this world in the first place
>"Every day I keep you alive is a day that I save your life. I am your hero, my love, just like you were mine."
>by the time she's done, all your injuries are gone away again
>but the horror still grips your hammering heart
>"Thank me, Anon. Thank me and say you love me. Then I'll take you far away from anyone who would ever threaten your life again, so we can make a new home together."

waifur with motorcycles are nice
>have to cuddle up to her to stay on
>maybe even have her tail wrapped around your waist for extra security
>or you're sort of sitting in her lap with her arms around you to cage you in
>maybe she even gets a side car just for her precious soft boy
>probably also gets you a helmet that matches hers or her species/fur/scales patterns

>Your rental bike arrives to the assignment center late, as it does most mornings. You don't complain, though: the bikes are working as intended. You should have simply slept less and arrived earlier. After all, you have the privilege of living in the most advanced sector in the NA Region:
>Sector COW
>You don't recognize any of the other guys in line as you all shuffle from the parking lot into the center: A3694B and A7654C must be late too. Or early.
>It's refreshing when you finally are inside, out of the baking sun. The reservoirs are low, so you could only rent half a bottle after yesterday's shift.
>More than you deserve.
>The dull sound of the assigners fills the cramped space as the line shuffles forward, everyone silent otherwise.
>When you finally get to the front, yours looks at you with dull eyes, scowling slightly.
>"This is the 3rd time you're late, A9999N," the skinny goat says, "You know what that means, right?"
>"Yes ma'am," you say sheepishly.
>"You'll be put on basic assignment," she says anyway, "If you're too busy to contribute to the sector's high-priority goals as you said you wanted to, then you'll provide basic support instead."
>She gives you a gesture you've only seen three times before as she clacks away at the keyboard.
>"I, A9999N, repent," you recite, "I am a human male, and it is my kind that have caused all the ills of this world. I know that Sector COW and all those within it seek only to improve the world and erase my flaws. I consent to this change in station."
>The small camera blinks a light at you, confirming you've done things correctly.
>"Please enter the transport pod," the goat sighs, the line having grown stale, "You'll be taken to your assignment shortly."
>You do so, and after 45 minutes in the narrow tube, a large wolf comes and grabs your tube. He doesn't speak much, like the rest of the male anthros: you know that they're special, and respect them all the same. He sets you down with the customary roughness into a chute; you roll down and find the bottom surprisingly empty. A pair of technicians, both felines, jump a little when you arrive and pull you out from the transport pod, sitting you on a cold metal table.
>"Alright, A9999N," one says, doing something on a computer while another prepares an odd-looking cart, "You're on milking duty."
>That's strange. You've done that before, and it wasn't on a cart.
>"There's a button on the cart near your left hand," the other technician says, showing you the big red circle, "If you push it, your supervisor will be notified. But that doesn't mean that they have to listen.
>This is very strange. This isn't at all like the previous time you did this job for the Sector.
>"Excuse my ignorance," you say, bowing your head, "But I don't recall this being the procedure the last time I was on milking duty. Has the Sector come up with a superior way?"
>The one by the cart groans; she's dark, and looks young.
>"You can cut that groveling crap," she says, "I swear, I--"
>The other technician, older, silences her with a look.
>"This is a... different milking duty," she says. "You'll be providing service for a Supervisor while they work. They'll explain the rest when you arrive."
>There's a soft 'ding' from the computer, and the technician lets out a sigh.
>"And it looks like it'll be Betty today."
>The two cats load you onto the cart, with is very strange: it's made of a very comfortable material, soft to the touch and cool. It seems contoured to you as you lay down on it, your arms and legs being strapped down in subtle channels. The button they were talking about is there, though you have to stretch to reach it-- it's difficult, too, given how your arms are strapped all the way out like a 'T.'
>Another male anthro takes you from them, wheeling the cart around a series of narrow hallways. You're not able to make out his species, with your head where it is.
>You find yourself a little sleepy: the material on the cart really is comfortable. You know you shouldn't be sleeping on assignment-- unless your Supervisor tells you to-- but you can't help yourself, and nod off.
>You wake to a loud crash of doors and a jolt as the cart rams through a pair of them. The room you enter is large and loud, the clattering of keyboards filling it along with the sound of voices. It's bright, with actual electric lights in the ceiling. Things are a little muffled from the fabric of your cart, but you think you hear people talking to you or at you. You can't do much about it, unable to move your head and respond, and you don't dare risk talking out of turn.
>Eventually, the cart stops, and your escort knocks on a door. It's answered, and you hear a feminine voice say "Ahh, good. Thank you."
>You're pulled into a new, more quiet room: there are still lights in the ceiling, but things aren't so painfully bright.
>"'A9999N,' a voice reads, "You're a pretty new one, then."
>A shape looms over you: she's the most sacred of species, a Cow!
>You attempt to get up and kowtow, but she giggles and touches your shoulder, steadying your struggles against your restraints.
>"Don't worry," she says, going back out of view, "you'll be paying plenty of homage to me today."
>Betty moves the cart around the relatively small room to a desk. There's another 'ding' of a notification, and she grunts, leaning over to address it. You notice that her breasts-- large as any other cow's, just like her-- are hooked up to tubes, the neck of her shirt pulled down below them.
>"Hit that red button for me," she says, looking down at you. You do as she says, and there's another 'ding,' this one sounding different, almost happy. She lets out a satisfied huff.
>"Looks like that works," she says, looking back down to you, "Now, you're going to be helping me today. Are you excited?"
>You nod: you're not worthy to speak in the presence of her, the species that built Sector COW and endeavors to enlighten the other parts of the Anthrostate.
>"Good," Betty says; she lifts one leg over you and the cart, standing over it. Her big, bovine behind hangs above you a she seems to adjust the carts position with her thighs, and you notice she's wearing nothing below her skirt.
>"You will be stimulating me down there while I do my work. You may press that button when you're out of air for these first few times, so I can get an idea of how long you can go," she says, seeming to have positioned everything to her liking, "But after that, I'll get unhappy. Understand?"
>She graciously lowers her rear so that it brushes against your face, allowing you to keep your silence. You nod against it, and she sinks down on you completely.
>The pressure is immense, but spread out as she settles in. You can feel her haunches covering you nearly to your wrists, and for a moment you simply sit there in awe. She's so soft, so warm... and she's a Cow. You, A9999N, are allowed to serve a Cow like this, personally, intimately.
>A hefty bounce from your Supervisor brings you back to your senses. "You alive down there?" she asks, "Get to licking."
>Licking?
>You wonder why others don't sign up for basic support all the time.
>You press your tongue out onto her soft flesh, lightly furred. She tastes good, better than a standard ration, if a little salty. As you're savoring it, however, your lungs remind you of their existence. You panic for a moment, struggling meekly before remembering the red button.
>She lifts briefly when you hit it, just long enough for you to expel a puff of air and quickly gasp in a breath.
>"30 seconds," Betty says, grinding down on you slightly, "Room to improve. And give me some more action down there, try moving your head."
>You do so, though her weight allows you to do so only a little. It seems to please her anyway: that's what you assume the noise she made was for as you feel her relax onto you.
>After about five more cycles of this, Betty lifts up a little longer, wanting to make sure you hear what she has to say.
>"Okay, now I don't want you to use that button. I know how long you'll last. Nuzzle in deep, A-N. You're doing good."
>You do as she says, her descending butt not giving you much choice. You wiggle your face in and are rewarded with a sigh as she relaxes, your tongue giving her pleasure. Your ordinary tasks, the advanced ones-- being on committees for machinery and systems you did not understand, deciding which crops would be planted when and where, helping design the latest round of Sector posters to promote moral and patriotism-- none of it compares to this.
>Again, your lungs intrude on your thoughts. By reflex you start to reach for the button, but Betty lifts up all on her own.
>"See?" she says, her voice trembling a little as she sits back down hard, "Good job. Keep going."
>You are all too eager... The world fades around you, the only thing you want or need being Betty's butt.
>It all begins to run together as she ascends and descends, pressing you deeper and deeper, her taste, her smell-- her-- becoming engrained into you.
>You don't even ask for a midday ration, happily licking away at her underside as she eats hers.
>The sound of the shift-change chime pierces even her thick cheeks, and she lifts up for good with a somewhat reluctant sigh.
>"Nice work, A-N," she says, looking at something while you pant and your eyes adjust, "I made 10 gallons!"
>She strokes your matted hair, leaning over you with a slightly sad face.
>"I hope I'll get you again tomorrow," she sighs before pulling away, "But there's no guarantee."
>She pushes your cart all the way under her desk then, and you find it leads to some kind of chute. As the darkness consumes you, you find yourself hoping for the same thing. Eagerly awaiting the one warm dark in your life...
>THIS FILM WAS BASED ON TRUE STORIES FROM SECTOR COW REFUGEES
>CITIZENS OF THE FREE SECTOR OF TX: BE VIGILANT
>ACCEPT HUMAN REFUGEES FROM SECTOR COW AND OTHERS LIKE IT; BE WARY OF ANTHRO IMMIGRANTS FROM SAID SECTORS
>The theme of Sector TX, an old-sounding number with brass and drums, played through the speakers as the film ended. An attendant stopped the tape, looking up to the muskrat that sat in the desk along with the others in the darkened room. She nodded slowly, a look of concern on her face.
>site doesn't like extra returns, apparently
>"It'll work as a base," she said, "Though I can't help but worry that some'll get the wrong idea."
>"How's that, Governor?" one of the members asked.
>"Well, it's erotic!" she said, blushing a little, "See if you can't have the more egregious parts cut out, both the visuals and the narration. This is meant as a warning for our sector, not an endorsement!"
>People wrote the request down, and half the room began to mobilize.
>"Governor," a human said quietly, seeming to slide through the chaos and come to her side, "I caution you: I believe that this may be too little, too late for TX."
>"How do you mean?" the muskrat asked the human, leaning in.
>"The film is as provocative as you said; Sector TX may already have had enough COW plants and sympathizers. And now they're hijacking their efforts at dissuading more."
>The muskrat frowned, he expression reflecting off his dark shades.
>"You may be right," she said quietly, "But I've got to believe that's not the case here in FL. Thank you again for your services."
>"Of course," the man replied with a bow, kissing the back of her palm. She giggled despite herself.
>"You're something else, ain't you?"
>"In my business," the quiet man said, holding her eyes, "You've got to be."

>Alaska.
>It was the perfect place to disappear, you thought to yourself.
>A thousand miles from the stupid problems, a thousand miles from the small talk, a thousand miles from all those tiny, persistent tortures that made day to day life just marginally, completely, unbearable. Circumstance would simply never give you the perfect excuse to just throw it all away. But it's what you wanted, more than anything.
>Well, you were tired of waiting. In a sudden flash of self determination, you upended your entire life and moved.
>Alaska. That's where you'd change, where you'd get tough, finally find some meaning. Just your thoughts and you.
>"Just my thoughts and I." You scroll listlessly through social media while waiting for the bus.
>"No kidding," you think to yourself.
>A thin haze of snow swirls lazily around the city. Peeking above the sparse skyscrapers was the white-capped Mount Spur, casting a long shadow over the entirety of Anchorage.
>When you'd first arrived, you thought the view of the mountain was incredible, otherworldly even.
>But you've come to know that its presence imbues the air with a bitter chill, the kind that gnaws on the tip of your nose, along with your will to put one foot in front of the other.
>Now it just pisses you off.
>Things are just the same here as they were where you came from, the same as everywhere. Just colder.
>Despite being here for a few months, you've got very little to show for it. No new friends, only acquaintances and coworkers.
>No new relationships, only forced smiles and impersonal banter from familiarly uninterested women.
>Upon entering the bus, you comprehend that your life here is almost identical to the one you'd left behind, the only difference being your job and the temperature.
>"Christ," you say under your breath.
>You shuffle lethargically to the back of the bus and find a place to sit. The cold plastic seat sucks the warmth from your legs and leaves you slightly shivering. The driver never has the heat on.
>What you wouldn't give to sit in a car every day again.
>Mercifully, it was Friday. You had a whole two days to hibernate before returning to your slog of a job again the next week. And just like every week since you got here, as soon as you open the door to your apartment you make a b-line for your bed. You flop down and twist yourself up in your blankets and pillows.
>You close your eyes and wait to drift away. However, there is a tension you cannot shake. That realization you had on the bus, it prodded at you as you lay there. Nothing's changed but the job and the temperature. Nothing's changed but the job and the temperature.
>Nothing's changed at all.
>You process this idea for a few minutes more, denying yourself the much-desired post work nap.
>The snow now taps steadily on your window. With every tap you become more aware of time passing, more aware of your position, more aware of the stubborn mundanity of your existence. Then in an instant of absolute rapture, you are possessed of the same fire that drove you all the way out here to begin with.
>You shoot up from your bed and march directly to your PC.
>In the search bar you type, "reliable low temperature camping equipment"

>You'd forgotten your cycle pill the day you kissed Anon
>Most mustelids have to take them during heat season, and for good reason.
>Primarily, you might literally die of horniness. It's an anthro thing.
>For most it doesn't get that bad, but every once in a while you hear about some unfortunate kid going through puberty dying because no one realized what was happening.
>You hadn't taken yours that day, which probably explains how you could have been so impulsive.
>Hands touched, nervous grins were exchanged, you'd rested your head against his chest, and you could feel the magic in the air.
>For him it was just a peck on the lips.
>For you though? It was the worst and best decision of your life.
>Only now, years later, can you honestly admit to yourself how wrong it had all been.
>What you did to him afterwards...

>It's so cold
>you shiver and shake as you stumble through the snow, the leafless trees providing little shelter
>the night sky dark and moonless
>you can't think straight
>the rifle in your numb, frozen hands is heavy
>why are you holding it?
>why are you here?
>...
>there was an explosion
>you were in the camp, just getting ready for bed
>then the whole world blew up
>you had come to in a bank of snow, having been flung out of your tent, your AK still slung around your chest
>you had looked back into the camp
>fire everywhere
>bodies
>another explosion
>it had set off your fight or flight response
>so you ran, the only light the firestorm engulfing what was left of your life behind you
>you've been staggering through the woods for some time now, you can't really tell how long
>it's so cold
>you're going to die out here
>you want to cry but can't
>you can't even remember your name
>there's something wrong with your head

>you try and gather your thin camo jacket in tighter around you as you make it into a clearing
>the snow has started again, falling silently around you
>you look around the clearing
>where are you?
>is this the right way back to town?
>can you even g-
>there's a noise
>you turn to see a dark, bulky figure standing in the snow on the other side of the clearing
>a pair of dull green lights shine out from its head
>and a laser flickers from the weapon held in its' hand
>the beam catches snowflakes here and there before settling on your chest
>one of them
>the enemy
>it (probably she) has you dead to rights
>you force your lips to open
>”Please don't shoot,” you say, your voice croaking
>the laser lowers down to the rifle in your hands
>”Drop the gun.” The voice is husky but feminine, and calm.
>you try
>but you can't
>your hands are stuck to the gun, frozen to the metal
>you try harder, feeling the skin on your fingers start to tear
>it's agony
>you can't
>tears finally roll down your cheek as you start shivering again
>”I can't. T-the cold, it's stuck to my hands.”
>the figure cocks its head slightly, and tenses
>the weapon in it's hand is still pointing at you, the laser roaming up and down your chest
>”Please, I don't want to die.”
>the laser drops away as the weapon is slung
>a gloved hand is proffered to you
>”Come here. I can help.”
>Now's your chance
>Shoot this bitch!
>would that even accomplish anything, though?
>what the hell were you even doing out here?
>the war is over
>long over
>you start trudging towards the enemy soldier, wading through waist high snow
>a squawking, tinny voice echoes from a radio
>”Negative. It's under control.” She whispers back to it
>as you get closer, you realise something
>this thing is probably about half a foot shorter than you
>and the bulk is coming from a huge winter coat pulled over a tactical rig
>the green lights coming from some kind of HUD display on her helmet
>and a blonde canine snout poking out from a balaclava
>you get closer still
>the dog raises her hand again, motioning for you to stop
>”Stay there, let me warm your hands up and get that gun off you, okay? Don't try anything funny.”
>she stomps towards you
>you can see her weapon, now strapped to the side of her rig
>it looks like a gun, but not one you've ever seen before
>probably one of their fancy caseless guns
>then she's right next to you
>she raises the front of her helmet, the green lights flickering off
>you can see a pair of gleaming pale eyes gazing back up at you
>She puts a hand on your shoulder and pushes down
>”Knees.”
>you kneel down, now just below eye level on her
>then she pops the buttons on her big coat, and wraps it round you
>you find yourself pressed up against her body as she pulls you in tight
>its so warm
>the coat must have a heating element inside
>you groan as you feel the heat spreading through you
>”That's better, huh?” She asks, her arms resting in the small of your back.
>”Y-yes.”
>she shifts slightly and
>”Put your head on my shoulder, okay? We can try and get your hands free in a minute.”
>you comply, and she shifts slightly to press her snout into your neck, giving you a sniff.
>the gun is awkwardly positioned between the two of you, poking out from under her coat
>”What's your name, sweetie? What's a young thing like you doing out here?”
>”My name...”
>oh god
>where is it?
>why can't you remember?
>tears well up on your cheeks
>”I-I don't know, I think I hurt my head. God help me I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry”
>you feel tears freezing on your cheek as you start to panic, your world still spinning
>she squeezes you tight
>”Shhh it's okay, I'm sure you'll remember. You can call me Sarge, okay? Just calm down, you've got nothing to worry about.”
>she strokes your head with her gloved hand
>”Okay Sarge. Are, are you going to hurt me?”
>”No-one's going to hurt you, babe. The war's over. You just need to relax and come back with me. Did anyone else make it out of the camp?”
>”I didn't see anyone else, but I don't know. I can't think straight, I might have banged my head.”
>”Don't worry about it, there are doctors back at the base, they'll have a look at you.”
>” ...okay.”
>you kneel there for a while, feeling starting to return to your hands as the heat spreads from her body to yours
>you notice a rank pip, of three slashes printed on the side of her coat
>and a large blue unit badge
>SWEET SIXTEEN
>STATE MARINES
>the words surround an image of a grey wolf with a dead, bloody rabbit dangling from it's jaws
>you feel a little of the chill return
>if she's from the marines...
>”S-sarge?”
>”Yeah hun, you ready for me to try and get your hands free?”
>”N-no, it's still numb. I don't think it's good.”
>”I'll have a look.”
>She sticks her long snout inside the coat
>you feel a faint nudge as she pokes the hand on the rifle's pistol grip
>”Yeah, it looks pretty bad, babe. We should really let the medics see this. I don't want to make it any worse. Come on. Did they not give you proper gloves at that camp?”
>”No, they...”
>something's not right
>hang on
>”I, I never told you about the camp, Sarge.”
>She stiffens
>”No, you didn't.”
>”You blew it up, didn't you? A bomb or something.”
>”A drone, actually. I saw you go flying and followed you for the last hour.”
>it's only been an hour?
>”Everyone else...”
>”They didn't make it.”
>”You killed them?”
>”Yeah.”
>she says it so casually
>”My squad made sure no one else made it out. Apart from you.”
>”God in heaven, no, please let me go, please!”
>you try and struggle away from her
>she holds you still with a grip of iron
>”Don't be an idiot, you're not going anywhere. You'll die if you run off into this weather.”
>”Why the hell would you care? You...”
>a spike of cold realisation pierces your fogged up brain
>there's only one reason a state marine would want you alive
>you look at her in terror as she shuffles even closer, rubbing her snout against your neck
>your skin crawls
>”Why would I care? Because all my girls got their hubbies weeks ago, hun. It's the price of being sergeant, everyone else gets a pick before I do.”
>she's licking your neck
>teeth
>”But you're right here, and with the war being over...”

>for eons upon eons ago. Earth has been inhabited by Man, not alone: but it is thought they are the oldest race- whether minimally elder to the rest of the “upright species” or far more ancient then the rest; both remains to be confirmed, and is irrelevant
>for the vast majority of known history and prehistory, mankind has always had species who walk- and talk like them
>these species have always been seen as a companion; not human, and yet very much part of man. In friendship, in neighborliness, and in marriage. These other species have been around
>almost every religion has had its way of making an educated guess at why, how, and where these species originate and what their relationship is to man
>ancient middle eastern and Abrahamic texts cite these fellow bipeds as originating from a “second Eve”. After the first had broken the covenant between man and God
>pagan faiths seem to have a convergent idea in their mythos that mankind was the final model for the Gods image. And because the first being had been given life these first maker-gods had decided they shall all be family
>far eastern belief holds that the bipedal form is the archetype of perfection, each of these species merely being a permutation of a more abstract ideal
>regardless- prehistoric archaeological evidence has shown that the male human genome has since it appeared has remained in a relatively mutation-resistant state. Being prone to preserving not just itself. But it’s mate’s species via what is observed and thusly named para-linear reproduction. Where depending on the sex of the offspring it will retain the species of either the mother or father
>how this feat of somehow being able to not hybridize- much like cousin species do. While still being able to reproduce with what theoretically should be impossible to breed with humans was a topic of heated debate since the first human baby was was born from an anthro mother by philisiphers, naturalists, and perhaps every other thinker concerned with the idea of what makes a human a human
>it was not until man, with his curious heart and brilliant mind that it was discovered that the Y chromosome, the very same thing that made sons, sons. Also preserved their humanity. It dictated everything distinct to humans and humans alone. And was able to even completely rewrite genes from *any* that otherwise weren’t compatible when first merging together to conceive life in the womb within the first cell of an unborn child
>meaning somewhere either along the long road of the human legacy, or by design from omniscient- unseen hands. The final chromosome in every man on earth contains both an ancient and powerful genetic historical tapestry. But also the means to become wholly part of any tribe with a single female with minimal turmoil. As half of all the new members of this theoretical tribe would still be fully the species of the mother- while maintaining a genetic benefit for the father in passing down his own unique ancestry to half of his progeny
>with how sturdy the human phenotype is. One must wonder if there are any drawbacks to this refined strategy of expanding mating prospect.
>and in terms of outward effects- there are a few that stand out
>namely statistical ramifications
>the first, is that Man’s reproductive versatility makes him a commodity- especially in zones with tribes that lack enough males of their own, tribes that had suffered losses from the elements or other tribes, and finally human-scarce zones altogether
>evidence suggests that anthros who share an ancestry with these rare human fathers and barbarian ancestral mothers are far more likely to be of a megafauna-like stature, and are also more likely to birth males of a similarly strong quality. Much like their mutual ancestors
>this carries the consequence of these anthros being more likely to act in the same way as their barbarian ancestors did in terms of mating strategy: capture, breed, puppy-gaurd
>anthros who have this strong and rough-&-tumble ancestry have been dubbed through scientific jargon as “mega’s” or “macro’s”. Denoting both stature and behavior
>though, the term is rarely used unless in a scientific or discussion pertaining specifically to this genetic archetype
>on the other end of this species-spanning range spectrum were anthros who share ancestry with mothers who has far more males available to them, at about a 1:1.7 ratio of man:anthro is where this change in evolutionary mating strategy is observed. Sometimes aided by tribes being either closer together and more neighborly, tribes having more plentiful resources or higher overall prosperity through its ancient history.
>while it’s true these anthros *can* be sometimes larger than humans in terms of height or frame. They do not have the trait muscle mass or bone density that their evolutionary cousins have.
>these societies have mixed and coexisted for a long time. Though routes are easily traced to region more often than not, and many modern society’s often reflect these stone-age trends.
>societies that encourage “tournament” competition for humans includes: “anthrostates” “assignment regimes” “cougar castes” etc: in essence a male has less say in who he mates with in order for females to secure a husband effectively and in a fair manner
>the societies where anthros have used the opposite end of the mating strategy spectrum are “collared countries” “pet-hierarchical systems” “submission zones” etc: in essence the male carries the authority because there are enough males to go around for a female to not worry about mating-prospect-security
>there are of course mixed societies, for example in the western world; there is something that has been colloquially named an “anthro welfare biased nation/ anthro welfare state”. In these societies the social contract is more complex. But the effect is that by either the politics, culture, popular movement or law, that a bias toward being permissive to more sweet ive anthro mating behavior.

My take for DMVstate is that it's a situation of a massive gender imbalance and a really unhealthy society that develops cos of it (dowries, multiple wives, huge amounts of "surplus" females) which causes unrest finally leading to-

[OVERWATCH REDACTION ENGAGED - GLORY TO GREAT LEADER]
-anyway in the state's current form they own the planet and you have a female dominated system where it's far easier for anthro females to get human husbands instead of the massive pain in the ass of courting an anthro male
as for kids all babies will be anthro (plot point), hybridisation extends only to certain physical features and doesn't really have stacking effects the more generations you go down
For example Alice is pure tiger, both her parents are anthros. She's really tall, her boobs are small and she's got an overall slightly inhuman/animalistic set of proportions
Sally on the other hand has a human dad, she has a more "feminine" form, is more anthromorphic and she's a womanlet lol
You might get other things like eye or fur/hair color that are passed down but nothing much beyond that
All the above is just my ramblings and may change later if it is comedic or sexy to do so

>"Who owns you, little man?"
>”You do, my love.”

>”And what does that make you?”
>he mutters under his breath
>”I didn't hear you, J,” she growls at him
>”I'm your bitch.”
>”That's right, you've got an addiction, don't you?”
>he squirms as he feels her lining his cock up for rapid entry
>”You're addicted to yeen pussy, aren't you, bitch?”
>”yes.” he says in a very small voice
>that earns him another kiss and a subvocal “good boy” in his ear
>before she drops on him like an anvil
>the whole bed is bouncing as she roughly rides him into the mattress
>both of them are moaning at this point as she presses her paws hard into his shoulders, her breasts jumping up and down

>she grabs a hold of them
>then pulls them out from under her and lays them on her shoulders
>he gulps as he realises what's about to happen

>good thing he's so flexible
>”you okay?” she whispers to him, getting ready for the final stretch
>he responds with a hungry kiss
>before whispering “I'm yours.”
>with that, she goes for it again

>Jimmy pulls the rig camera off to capture this wonderful sight before throwing the big white duvet over her
>as he clambers into bed to join his wife, he turns the camera, winks for the audence, and switches it off

>wifwolf asks if you want to try recording amateur porn
>the "porn" is just her cuddling you while speaking sweet nothings into your ear
>despite being recorded it still feels as good as when you two cuddle normally
>sometimes she'll spice things up by jerking you off while holding you or by smothering you with her breasts while she gently rides you.
>once she even gave you a nursing handjob on camera
>what surprises you however is the viewerbase

>her tail wagged so fast I feared it would fly off and into deep orbit
>her whole body was shaking like a tail wag. Actually
>a little dance of excitement and joy

>dates went well. It doesn’t take much- just be interested in what they like and try to integrate some parts you enjoy into the time you spent so you have things to talk about
>sure she’s pretty. But learning she’s also fun is a total bonus
>the connection is real
>I’ve got a throbbing in my heart and a swelling in my loins for this big woofer with large hips, butt, and awoobas

So, hypothetically speaking, if someone were to write a fantasy story based around Egyptian mythology, which species of waifur would be best for the goddess?
A >pic related croc so big she can basically fuck herself with the MC like he's a doll, or a more jet-black sphinx type goddess who demands body worship?
Hypothetically speaking, of course

depends on what flavor you want
>sekhmet is literally an amazon lioness war goddess who canonically is married to a green human god who likes building things
>she also has cow goddess form all about breeding/pregnancy from the time the other gods got her drunk in order to keep her from killing the whole world
>sobek for nile crocs which were actually cared for by people in Egypt in places where sobek was worshiped
>taweret is a hippo goddess of maternity and childbirth making her one of the literal mommy gods of Egypt
>anubis does have a female counterpart so you could go with a dom route from a legal side given the whole judge of the dead thing
>set is pretty untapped and also is sort of a jackal god too in some descriptions if anubis is too mainstream for you
>also can work with the whole angle of set being passed over for ruler of the afterlife and maybe work in a girl version of horus wanting the MC for herself etc
if you dig into it you'll find most goddess in Egyptian lore are some form of cat

>Anthros are the Xenos
>Long ago after meteors and ice ages and all other stuff happened and Earth became a stable life sustaining planet, the Anthro race visited our planet and "laid the eggs" so to speak to populate the world with species that would start primal and feral, but over time evolve into the intelligent space-faring anthros and join the rest of the race
>Millions of Earth years later the Anthro species returns to check on the growth of the offspring they left
>They're shocked to find some offshoot of the primates, "Humans", have somehow advanced far faster than any of the other species
>They scan Human history and see all the poaching, animal abuse, zoos, putting animals in danger for entertainment
>The Anthros decide these Humans must be invaded now and shown their place

>the predecessor sapient race which beget humans and anthros arose not from terrestrial soil, but the lunar lowlands
>at an indeterminant point in the abyssal past, a great schism occurred in this society which left the vast, Plebian castes exiled on Earth and denied of the technology and resources which their society boasted as imminent within this gap of the Oort Cloud
>as millennia turned to eras, the excised populace no longer developed in tandem with their sibling species
>as it was, there were now two sapient species across the two spheroids, worlds apart in likeness yet mere seconds in distance for the advancements of the primeval anthros
>as the subsuming of humankind ensued in the modern age, it was an irony not lost upon the elder forebearers, wizening among themselves from their lunar conservatories, observing man from his earliest days of divergence

>It's shortly after the war, humanity surrendered quickly
>Once the dust settled, these new "relations" took place, Humanity and Anthros were still very unfamiliar with each other, behavior and culture-wise
>Those who surrendered and didn't fight back were placed into "Zones" heavily patrolled by high-tech Anthro police
>We have no jobs or government anymore, we can go outside and engage in social activities and other gatherings, but all media is Anthro-run and we're given weekly stipends to spend at Anthro commissaries for our daily needs
>You're walking to a friend's for some poker games, you stop to pet a friendly dog and give it belly rubs
>A large Anthro Dog officer yells at you, demands to know what you're doing
>You try sputtering out that you were trying to pet the dog
>She cuffs you and says "you're just another disgusting human who likes to hold down and abuse anything you see as lesser."
>She shoves you into her vehicle and hauls you off to the station
>After processing, you're shoved into an interrogation room with cameras
>The door opens and its the Dog Anthro who arrested you
>She sits down across from you and immediately demands you answer to what you were doing
>You start explaining you were heading to your friend's for some card games
>She slams her huge paw on the table and demands to know specifically what you were doing to the dog
>In a panic you just blurt out, "Belly rubs!!!"
>The officer cocks her head at you with piercing eyes like she's trying to stare into your soul
>She states that the dog was on its back, flailing its legs in a panic as you assaulted it
>You argue back that you weren't abusing it, dogs typically love belly rubs and scratches, they find it comforting and enjoyable
>The officer's eye shift around the room, she then reaches into her pocket and you her a button click
>The power lights on the cameras go off
>She slowly rises out of her chair, walks slowly around the table towards you, and sits herself down on it right in front of you
>She proceeds to remove the top part of her uniform, eventually revealing a big set of fluffy well-defined abs and a busom you're surprised she could fit inside the armored portions of her uniform
>She tells you that you need to present your evidence then on "Belly rubs", and she'll be the one to judge you after that

You know I was entertaining an idea about something about milk
>Anon living with a cow morph
>Typical Wisconsin anthro: she's proud of her milk
>Most of the fridge is either alcohol or dairy products
>Naturally the latter is all made "in house"
>Anon comes home eating subway
>She notices that "cheap beast milk" immediately
>Anon's next few days have each meal be heavily dairy-based
>She stands behind him and, as he eats each dish, whispers the description of the ingredients
>The way she describes them is borderline pornographic
Basically I wanted to write a story channeling the energy of the old Grilled Cheese Accademy website, but I wouldn't be able to do it justice. Also I'm not a foodie, so my frame of reference on that is limited at best. But the idea of a lactation-fetish story that's more than just breastfeeding is something I'd enjoy

>privately, the scenario you just went through is terrifying
>you know wolves mate for life. And if you said no...
>what would happen to her? Would she spiral? Would she off herself?
>for a moment the worst possibility that hits you. Is that she might give up on you and find someone else

>you’re about to have a heart attack from the cute levels assaulting your senses
>it’s been a couple weeks since you told her yes to an actual relationship without her having to use her terminology to weasel her way into being your lover
>but that’s only made her bolder
>the both of you make even more time for eachother now however. So you’re in bliss every other moment when she’s not being inappropriate
>it’s gotten so bad that when in a passing statement to when it was relevant that you mentioned you had a girlfriend, one of your male friends jokingly said he already knew because you’d come into class smelling like “poochie coochie”
>that one earned him an arm punch, but it made you laugh
>one day well into the semester you’re chilling at your fluffy awoo gf’s house when she beckons to you in the kitchen

>god damnit why does she have to be so cute
>her tail isn’t just waging anymore, it’s straight up in the air, you can tell she’s resisting the urge to wag about wi to her whole body like last time at the arcade with the “doggy dance” as you call it
>the little dance some canines do when they’re so happy that they can’t wag their tail hard enough. So their whole body joins in the swaying
>you don’t act, partially because you’re not sure how to respond to her, but also out of wondering if she’ll break her control and start doing *the dance*

>her grimace wasn’t intimidation. She was trying not to break down
>I can see the big mustache’d cook in the back shaking his head slowly in disappointment

>within an instant her composure finally snapped and she was full on crying
>looks like I really hurt her feelings
>great, now did I just bully a girl who was happening to be too loud. I also profiled her based on her species
>”could you have asked any more like an arse for us to quiet down?” One of her friends said harshly
>but I could barely register her comment over the 8 foot tall supreme spaghetti-pocketed awoo over here pulling on my sleeve and crying out:
>”PLEASE SAY YOU DONT MEAN IT IM NOT AN UGLY FEMCEL IM NOOOOOOOT” with massive teary eyes like you’d see on a chibi character
>it’s uncanny, the level of baby-crying I’m seeing
>I’d laugh at her if it didn’t make me feel like such a fuckhead for making her this way, and if it wasn’t as adorable as it was, in its own way
“Hey, calm down now... I didn’t mean it... I just wanted you to quiet down a little, that’s all. I’m sorry I was mean”
>she sniffles, her eyes still doing that thing where they’re teary and seemingly huge. A sad toothy grimace still marring her snoot
>”y-you’re mean... I was having fun with my friends and you come over here and hurt my feelings calling me names *sniffle*. It’s not my fault you hate doggies, w-what kinda person *sob* hates fluffy girls...?”
>my heart
>my soul
>now I really have to apologize, and mean it
>god I’m an asshat sometimes
“Look. I’m sorry, I don’t actually think you’re mangey or ugly, or flea bitten- I just had enough of the loud noises. I.. I apologize for being mean to you. You didn’t deserve me being so harsh”
>she’s wiping away her tear matted fur on her face now, trying to compose herself
>”I-it’s okay, we’ll quiet down a bit and be more mindful next time... arwoo?”
>the last thing wasn’t even a word. But she held open her arms for a hug. A peace offering
>”my mom says people make up better when hugs are had. Is that okay?”
>my hesitation loses to my wish to make amends
>even the mustachio man in the kitchen looking out swishes his hands forward in a gesture saying “go on, don’t just leave the poor thing hanging”
>fuck it, I’m going for it
>I bring it in. Letting the giant fluff ball envelop me like a Venus fly trap catches a tiny kricket
>”you’re warm... you’re not a bad guy. Bag guys don’t hug people and tell them they’re sorry” she coo’s
>followed by soft, probably signs of comfort woo’s
>”...mwuu... ooo.. mmm, woo...”
>she’s hypnotically gentle and soft
>I could get addicted to this
>”can you guys knock it off the the PDA? There’s still the issue of an actual apology”
>the large wolf backs off upon hearing her friend. Scratching at her chin
>”uhm... oh I know! You could promise to buy me a coffee tomorrow at donkey-donuts” the big one added, her tune now back to having some pep
>I guess she really just needed that hug

>Be at the beach chilling out
>Can't help but notice all the lifeguards on duty today
>Limber otter babes with athletic bodies, a fluffy awoo with a silky coat, there's even a milfy capybara teaching a swimming class
>Get the brilliant idea to swim out and fake that you're drowning to get the attention of one of those smoking hot ladies
>Swim a few dozen feet into the water, face the shore, and begin wildly flailing all your limbs while shouting "I'm drowning! I'm drowning! Someone help!"
>See the lifeguards all enter the water and begin swimming to your position
>Hehe, all according to keikaku-
>Suddenly a large arm covered in white fur wraps around your torso
>"Don't worry human! I got you!" Someone screams into your ear
>Look to your left and there's a polar bear woman rapidly swimming to the shore with you in tow
>Where the hell did she come from?!
>"No, I'm actually okay, it's just-"
>"Don't talk! You'll just get water in your mouth and get even closer to drowning!" She sternly orders
>"O-okay" You meekly respond
>Before you know it her feet touch ground and she's walking up the shore with you in a bridal carry
>A few feet onto the sand she gently lays you down, all of the lifeguards surrounding you in a circle
>From the look on their faces they look none too pleased
>"So," Says the otter, her arms crossed. "you somehow managed to swim all the way out there by yourself with no troubles, then suddenly forget how to swim? Really?"
>Fuck, they saw through your ruse
>"uhhhh, ya."
>The capybara huffs in aggravation
>"Another one of these pervs looking to get lucky with a lifeguard. The absolute nerve!" She grumbles
>But then she looks to the polar bear, a sly look now on her face
>"Scarlet, I think this one needs some swimming lessons to ensure he doesn't "forget" how to swim ever again but I'm too preoccupied with my current students. Why don't you give him a lesson or two?"
>"It would be my pleasure ma'am!" She happily responds
>The other lifeguards walk away leaving just you and Scarlet
>"So Scarlet, uhh, what's our first lesson going to be?"
>She takes a knee and pushes you flat against the ground
>"Well, I know you need swimming lessons but I'm a little rusty on my first aid, so why don't we do a little of that first."
>"Okay, so like how to apply bandages and stuff?"
>She leans in closer
>"Yes, but first I'd like to start with some...mouth to mouth resuscitation." She says with a devious smile
>Gulp

>decide to take some time off from work and go on a camping trip

>you park and find a nice spot to set up your tent
>you can hear a flowing river nearby, the sound is very comforting compared to all the traffic and computer noises you're so used to hearing
>you walk towards the sound of the river, you want to see and breathe in some nature
>once you've cleared the trees you see the river in all its glory
>noisy, elegant, flowing, you scan across it left and right
>your eyes then land on a mass of fur in the water
>several huge bear ladies bathing themselves in the waters
>you remember the sign warnings and start to back away towards the trees again
>some rocks shift under your feet and make noise
>the bears all perk up and focus their attention on you
>you're frozen
>after what seems like minutes, one of the bears throws her large paw up into the air and calls out to you
"Yoo-hoo! Hey Camper! What brings you out into the wilderness?"
>"just trying to get away from city life for a bit", you shout back
"Oh how lovely! It's always nice to see someone who wants to appreciate nature!" she shouts back
>the bear talking to you looks excited, and starts conversing with her other bear friends, you can't hear them since no one's shouting over the river

>I should’ve set my alarm clock on yesterday
>The bus left before I can even reach the bus stop station for my school leaving me in the dusts
>God damn it, I can’t just go back to my house. My mom is already pissed off as she already is after being late and have to finish my homework in the fucking morning. Doesn’t make it better that my mom is a Doberman who is chubby but muscular enough to lift me and dad both up with her fuzzy arms.
>Screw it, I might as well walk over a mile to get to school. Not risking to go back and have my mom bite my ass.
>I heard a chuckle from behind me
>I turn and see a reptilian lady in a slightly revealing biker clothes where I can see her underwear’s strings
>”Oh… poor lil’ humie missed his bus? Oh mommy would be so mad at you, wouldn’t she?” She cooed at me like I’m some sort of baby pet.
>I was told not to talk to strangers especially anthro women who often takes advantage of young human boys for their sick desires but she’s been looking at me for a solid minute and I have to response or things will get awkward.
>”Um, y-yeah… I woke up late and had to finish my homework in time before I left the house. Now she’s gonna be even more pissed once I come back to the house!”
>She chuckled once again, “Oh baby, I know how to solve that problem~“
>She walked pass by me and showed me a really expensive sports bike
>”I can get to your school in no time flat, babe~”
>She then signals me to come over with her fingers slowly
>I’m a bit creeped out that she cooed at me, but it is another thing that she call me ‘baby’ and ‘babe’ in THAT tone. But, I really don’t want to come back to my angry dog mom and starts barking at me for ‘not taking responsibility’ and some shit. So I accepted.
>As we both got in the bike, the gator lady uses her tail and pulls me a lot closer to her butt
>”Hang tight, it’s gonna be a wild ride!”
>I’ll be honest, I thought riding a bike would be too dangerous for me if I don’t balance correctly, but it is actually kinda fun and accelerating
>As we pass through the cars, I saw the road that leads to my school
>”Ok! So I want you to turn right and go straight ahead!”
>She didn’t slowed down when I told her
>”Uh, can you hear me? I said turn left!!”
>We zoomed passed the road
>I look back and see a school bus turning to the route we were suppose to go
>”Uh… you missed the directi-“
>”Just getting something from my house! We’ll be back in a minute”
>I stood there in disbelief, did she really ignored what I said on purpose? Or did she really want to get something from her house? My heart starts to beat a bit fast
>”Uh… ok…” I respond cautiously
>I have no idea how far is her house is, but where ever it is, it’s definitely nowhere as close to my school or even my house

Kinda like the idea of taking the anthrostate assigned marriages/husbands idea to a galactic scale
>humanity meets up with a galactic civilization/coalition of different anthro aliens
>insert hand wave reason that the space anthros have way more females around than males or such
>also throw in super advanced tech that lets alien crossbreed successfully or human guys have amazing capability with that tech resulting in more healthy offspirng
>human guys can get a free trip to space/other planets if they sign themselves up for assignments to space anthros as their husbands
>go through interviews to see what environment and species they'd best match with
>stuff like do you prefer cold or warm weather, types of food you like, awake mainly during the day or night, enjoy swimming or not, etc
>then get your profile added to the list the species/planet that fit you the best have
>once a space anthro picks you you get taken on a spaceship ride to that species planet where you will now live
>getting married to your new space anthro wife making you a citizen of that species/planet's government
>which means you're also now subjected to their laws and customs with Earth having no way to interfere ever since you're no longer part of the Earth's laws/government

I just got the idea of a detatched, depressed war veteran anthro coming back and picking up her assignment out of obligation.
She isn't mean, but she more or less ignores him at first. He's excited to meet her and eager to please, and he can't understand what he's doing wrong and why she isn't happy.
Turns out she gunned down a lot of humans wherever she was, and hates herself for it. Her faith in the state, and more importantly herself, is completely shattered. She's disgusted by the thought of taking part in assignment, or taking advantage of what she sees as a brainwashed man with no individuality.

Sounds like good way to write some comedy with the guy she's been assigned to trying to show he actually cares for and wants her to pin him down
>tons of shenanigans he goes through to try to keep snu snu
>naked apron greeting asking if she wants diner or to "eat" him instead
>her coming into her room to find him tied up on the bed doing the whole "oh no~ I'm all vulnerable" routine
>making her dinner with a crude drawing of her fucking him on the food using sauces or such to draw it
>wearing provocative shirts that say stuff like "I'm asking for it", "bite me", etc
>and other goofy ideas

I was thinking he goes through typical romantic motions like singing for her, making meals, cleaning the house, and she shows next to no appreciation for it. She's deeply uncomfortable being touched, so he can't try and relax her that way either. The tension eventually boils over, and he lashes out at her, screaming and whacking her with impotent rage.
>WHY! WILL! YOU! NOT! LOVE! MEEEEEE!
this finally gets through to her, she sees the passion in him isn't just manufactured by the state. After that she sees him as a person and they start to bond.
Forgive lack of images I cleaned off my phone.

>selfless anthro hero who gives her all to protecting humans
>however it gets quite lonely in her fortress and she wants to find companionship
>quickly finds out that while the humans admire her they're also intimidated by her. with some even expressing worry that they might be targeted by villains
>eventually it becomes too much to bear and she kidnaps a reporter who she fancies
>she goes to rape him but quickly stops when she sees him crying and cowering for his life
>she becomes disgusted by her actions and feels a deep sense of shame.
>after flying the guy back to his apartment she returns to her fortress and distances herself from the outside world, rarely if ever leaving her fortress

goofy idea regarding language differences
>could be fantasy or scifi, either works
>anthros misunderstand or due to the difference in their language see the words certain differently
>don't have a word that fits "husband" due to being female dominant species and what a female does culturally
>best they can do use similar words like provider, protector, strong mate, etc
>sees the word "wife" fitting for what they would call a male they're married/bounded to in regards to caring for family, cooking/cleaning, helping make children, belonging to their partner, their to provide pleasure to their mate, etc
>which causes funny situations with how they apply it to human males
>and more so when the proposition or compliment human guys
>"you'd make a great wife", "if you were my wife I'd never let you leave the bed", "I want you as my wife", "with a someone like you as my wife we'd have an army of children", etc

>think you're safe around lesbo anthros

>or she possess him and they go on supernatural mystery adventures together when she's not sexually harassing him
>where the humie boy gets molested by other spirits/demons/entities/monsters/etc and the ghost anthro has to save him or joins in on molesting him too

Anthro ghost possesses the anthro medium, which was incredibly easy because the medium wanted to fuck him too. Enter the weirdest threesome where the ghost and the medium keep switching off who is in charge seemingly mid-stroke. Once everbody has cum, and the situation cleared up, then onto the paranormal adventures with the three of them. Investigating ghosts, aliens, monsters, and the supernatural in general, often involving the human boy being the object of the phenomenon’s sexual desires.

>You stew in a deep depression while waiting for the date that you have to be reassigned

>Frightened, you approach the door, flip the lights on, and open it
>What you see is your waifur
>She's clothed in the tattered remnants of a military uniform, her fur has all but rotted off, and her eyes are replaced two black holes, but that is without a doubt your waifur
>This can't be real, she's dead, she died on the battlefield, how is she...
>In shock, you just kind of stand there staring at her in the dim light
>That is until she raises her arms up

>Like a reflex upon hearing her voice you rush forward and hug your waifur tightly, hands feeling the bones flex underneath her tattered fatigues
>She returns your embrace, bony fingers feeling your back and a beleaguered sigh escapes her maw

>she gestures toward you, but a quick glance in front of her desk reveals there are no seats
>in fact, she's occupying the only chair in the room
"Uh, Miss Carol--"
>"Ah! I will remind you of company policy regarding humans addressing their superiors, Anon."
>she chides you with a toothy grin
>you know what she wants you to call her, but you're not going to say
>your face burns, and you grit your teeth
"I am not using THAT word. I work here. I am a professional."
>Carol just laughs and starts typing out on her computer
>"I'm afraid I'm just going to have to give you another write-up. We take office policy very seriously at Aardman-Deinemeijer Health and Diagnostics."
>she finishes speaking at the same time as her final keystroke
>and a buzz sounds from her computer's speakers
>"Oh goodness! The fifth infraction in a week! That's not good, Anon. Frankly, if we can't solve this today, it may mean the end of your time here."
>you groan
>they're going to fire you because you won't play into their creepy sex roleplay while at a workplace
>the coyote folds her ears and gives a soft coo of pity
>"Now now, no need to look so down. There may be a compromise we can reach. Please, take a seat."
>still aren't any seats
>you hold your hands up in a shrug
"Where am I supposed to sit?"
>in answer, Carol carol gestures for you to step around her desk
>when you do, she leans back and spreads her legs, creating a space on her oversized chair for you to sit
>"I want all employees to feel comfortable with me during meetings. Why do you think I got the Bear-Luxe extra-large?"
>she covers her mouth to suppress a giggle
"Are you kidding me?"
>Carol purses her lips, but her rose-colored eyes flash with devious intent
>"I am completely serious, Anon. In fact, if you insist on not meeting management halfway, I don't see any other recourse than your immediate termination."
>god damn it
>should have gotten another job lined up before this meeting
"Alright. Fine. I'm still not calling you...that."
>you step fully around the table and perch on the very edge of the seat in between Carol's legs
>despite your best efforts to avoid body contact with her, she sidles closer to you
>her legs swing inward a bit, so her thick thighs press against yours and you're trapped by her legs
>"There, good boy!"
>you make a grunt of annoyance
"What'd you call me?"
>your coyote captor makes a dismissive gesture
"Just praising your willingness to compromise. You should really get used to body contact, Anon. Many species relish in...closeness."
>she emphasizes that last word with a dramatic movement, folding forward over you to press her chest against your head
>you feel her heavy tits, barely constrained by a low-cut blouse wrapping around you as she leans forward to start moving paperwork on her desk
>"So tell me, Anon. Why do you have a problem with our new policy?"
>you try to focus
>this is the exact kind of shit you're tired of
>these anthro women harassing you, touching you, not taking you seriously
"I'm not using that word. It's degrading."
>she hums
>and you can feel it through her chest
>"You don't like calling your superiors 'mommy', is that it?"
"Yes. Exactly."
>Carol laughs, causing her breast to bounce against your head
>"Is that all? Why didn't you say so? You can just fill out an exemption form. Let's see..."
>Carol pulls the chair forward, pinning you between the hard edge of the desk, and the soft plush of her mature body
>you feel your body heating up even more
>so you try and focus on the bewildering stack of paperwork Carol's laid out on the desk
>"Why don't I get it started?"
>Carol takes a pen and starts marking off different checkboxes, and filling out blank spaces in a blur of bureaucratic skill
>too fast for the eye to follow
>"Just filling out your basic information here, since I already have it pulled up on the computer."
>you glance at the computer screen
>there's your profile
>your name, position in the company, birth date, home address, gender, species, hair color, eye color, relationship status, creep shots of you around the office, theorizing on what sounds you'd make if Carol were to nibble your ear
>holy fuck she is really, really into you
>you start to squirm out of the chair, but Carol's other arm goes around your waist to catch you
>"Careful dear! Don't want you falling out of the chair."
>her paw starts to trail over your chest and abs, groping and squeezing idly
>"Now, we have a few options for if you don't want to call your superiors 'mommy'. If you wish to remain formal in the office space..."
>yes, please
>"...then your best option will be to use 'mistress'."
>what
>Carol continues on
>"You could also opt for terms of endearment. 'Dear, honey, sweetie', though if you have more than one direct superior, they may get jealous."
>her paw starts plucking at the buttons of your shirt, untucking and opening it to start exploring your skin with warm paw-pads
>you huff, trying not to enjoy your molestation too much
"Carol, what are you doing...?"
>but fuck, you'd be lying if you said you weren't
>Carol's got something that drives you a little wild
>even if you were normally too pissed at dealing with HR to acknowledge it
>"Oh dearie, you just seemed to be heating up so very much! We do have a very lax uniform policy. I thought you'd be more comfortable if you were open with me. I know I am."
>you're left in the cold temporarily when Carol stops her paperwork and leans back from you
>when she returns, the blouse has gone, and you find yourself buried in the valley of her bare breasts
>"Much better. How are you feeling, Anon?"
>she goes back to plucking at your shirt buttons, until she's gotten them all
>you're too overwhelmed to answer
“Uh.”
>she chuckles warmly
>"That's what I thought. I knew you'd be more agreeable once you were in the right mindset. Good boy..."
>she ticks a few more boxes on the paperwork
>"Now, I think our last option will work best for you, especially in your new position as my personal assistant."
>the molesting paw trails downward, and slips down to grasp your raging hard-on
>"From now on, you call me Auntie Carol~"

>first, the pleasant noise of crickets had died down
>then the rustling of wildlife
>soon even the murmur of the brook I had not been far from was strangely quiet
>all that was left was me, and the crackling of my fire
>and of course my red cloak
>a gift from my mother, made to last a lifetime
>it had a way of staying clean, almost gleaming, it’s edges embroidered with a warm golden color
>much like...
>much like those eyes... over in the distance, between the brush and the trees
>I’ve been caught
>whether by my incognito interceptor, or by some other thing that these woods have sent upon me
>it seems to be circling me up to the point it runs to the babbling stream, then closes more distance upon its next strafe around the circumference of my camp
>then reaches the stream where the eyes can tread no further
>I do not move. My helmet is off and my sword just within reach

>the eyes
>they pieced me
>as they completed each sweep towards my fire, the tension in my chest grew greater
>whatever body this thing had, it made nought a sound upon its approach
>I am not a man of superstition. But the eeriness of this entire debacle was shaking me to my very core
>eventually as those unsettling, pale amber eyes came upon the threshold of my fires’ luminous aura and the shadow beyond, daring not to tread further as if the light would bring it harm
>for a brief instant I remembered how the unrighteous cannot come upon holy ground lest the very place be the sinners doom, his impurity of spirit serving as making his soul unfit to be in the light without facing utter destruction
>but the eyes were not locked upon my fire pit
>they were locked upon myself
>minutes passed, the gaze unblinking and unwavering
>when finally the silence broke. And a whisper ushered forth
>”I can’t believe it... it’s you”
>if it was any louder than the mouse like sqeak I fear the terror of two beastly eyes speaking my tongue would have caused me to jump out of my skin
“IT TALKS!?”
>I shout while reaching for my blade, hoping to strike whatever I had now been convinced was hunting me since this little spectacle began
>”w-what? No I...”
>the voice spoke again. This time with its proper voice, feminine and seemingly in shock
“... a woman, then?”
>the eyes broke its gaze, they looked down. Seemingly in some form of embarrassment, then back to meet my own gaze
>a wolfess. Tall and lithe. Two breasts pushed up by her day dress and corset. And fur as white as the under fabric that cover said mounds of flesh that seemed to fit just right for her size and physique
>a beautiful woman then
“What? Who are you? And what are you doing in the wilderness in the dead of night?”
>she takes a step back in surprise. And her fur puff up in the way her kind experience when an intense emotion or sensation is upon them
>”o-oh!? You don’t remember me? I was the woman you risked your life for in that fire half a year ago”
>she spoke softly, as a mother would to her beloved child, sweetly and with no shortage of mirth
>”it was when in Brookesfield, the inn’s spirits had caught alight, and I was stuck in a room out of reach from everyone in time”
>I remember the fire well, as well as the souls you saved that day, and upon diving into your memory, a spot for her was reserved
>you let her continue however. With manner she spoke and the weight she carried her, it seems she had waited a long time to say something, to remove something off her chest
>as she spoke she laid herself down, sitting daintily by my side
>”and before I lost consciousness and slipped into the sleep of the smoke around me, I saw your shiny armor, and your red cloak dowsed in water to come save me”
>when she finished there was a pause. And a smile from her. I do not exaggerate her beauty, the smile shined as the sun- much as her fur like the moon even when the warm light of the fire touches it
“Yes, I remember you. Albeit you do not look the same from my memory. Not the picture of elegance I see now, you were injured- Your legs very burnt... how are they? Are you able to walk without pain?”
>she let out a soft giggle and her smile turned wryly
>”why yes I am fine, oh hero mine. I feel much better now thanks to your act of selflessness. Would you like to see~?”
>she pulls on the fabric of her dress while she sit. Both legs facing my in her sideways position of sitting
>out of respect for a lady’s modesty, and value of my honor code I avert my gaze
>she giggles once more in her feminine way
>”you may look, my knight, I wish you to see how well I’ve healed after all”
>hesitating for a brief moment, I look back at her legs
>no longer were they the damaged appendages I knew from the inn, covered in burnt fur that turned them black and smudged in char. But were now, if still healing slightly. The feminine legs of a wolfess in great health
“You look much better than when I retrieved you from the fire. I’m relived, truly”
>a weight I didn’t know I even had lifted off of me. Knowing your struggles bear fruit that bring goodness into the world is a reward worth dying for
>my fur in some places has yet to return. But the physician in Brookesfield tells me it’s only a matter of time before my coat is as complete as the red one you carry with you”
>she smiles, quite pleased with her recovery as she stares back at me for a moment
>her eyes now seemed... longing
>”you are utterly selfless, a savior... *my* savior”
>she’s starting to inch closer to me now
>despite her politeness and her demure attitude, she is making me feel uneasy
>”you are a paragon worthy nothing short of veneration as a Saint. My hero... I would like my children to grow to be just like you...”
>she is uncomfortably close now, I can feel her breath, and her eyes feel as if they could pierce through me
”children... you are a mother?”
>I ask, in a pitiable attempt to divert the conversation
>alas, it fails so hardily that it seems to work in favor of her own tirade
>”no, but if you’ve read my letter, children are something that’s something that’s soon to be arranged for”
“Letter? You mean the one the she horse handed me, the innkeep. I-I’m afraid I haven’t read it yet, it slipped my mind while I was fishing”
>a sudden look of surprise, along with a return to her usual merrymaking just as quick snapped across her face
>”well my hero, before you read it I’d like to ask of you enjoy some whine with me, my cart and horse is nought but half a league from your site here. I wont be more than a moment”
>I ask her another question before she disappears into the shadows again. Hoping to dispel my apprehension over what has just happened leading up to now
“Whine... you wish to celebrate? Are you to be wed then? That’s wonderful!”
>she looks back and smiled, letting off one more giggle
>”why yes I am getting married soon. Was I that obvious?”
>no you were not
“There were some hints that gave it away!”
>I say with laughter, forced and fake. But I wish to give her the benefit of doubt, an olive branch of reason facing against my own instincts to turn tail and run
>she enters the woods, out of sight and sound again. I search for the letter given to me, it may have answers
>”oh my kniiiight~! I’ve returned with wine and candies, the sweets are a home made specialty from Brookesfield!”
>confound it
>I shall have to steel myself against my own misgivings about the situation at hand
>she pours the wine into modest metal goblets
>upon tasting it. You cannot discern any poison or concoction. And she has drank from the same bottle as I
>absentmindedly I try a candy. Spying the paper box with the Brookesfield village seal upon it
>both are seemingly trustworthy
>the candies are delightful too, the one I’ve placed in my mouth tastes of elderberry, and long lasting since they are hard candies
>then it happens
>the coat of hard and flavorful sugar breaks to reveal a syrup with the same taste underneath
>these treats are unlike anything I’ve had
>but... somethings off
>I feel dizzy
>and not because of the wine.
>the candy
>it was in the syrup
>before I collapse. I see the mark on the other side of the box of sweets
>it’s some form of more appealing medication
>damnit all. the wine was a red herring
>Evelyn catches me in her arms and lays my body upon her own, as a wife would hold a husband
>I understand now
>”congratulations, oh husband mine~...”
>I am in blackness
>wandering an abyss, some foul pit
>I’m being watched within this wretched place
>as I look out into the foggy black nothingness. I make out a pair of pale, yellow... eyes...
>I feel the urge to run, and I obey it
>I reach for my blade on my hip but it’s missing
>and so is my armor now that I check, all I have are my travel clothing and my red cloak
>the abyssal demon chasing behind clasps at my cloak catching me and at once choking me
>I’m on the ground now. Facing those pale yellow eyes
>attached to a snouted creature, it’s grinning grimace perverse and predatory
>it’s body as inky black as the void around us, it warbles as it speaks
>”~I~.~love~.~you~.”
>it says with a wretched giggle it’s claws gripping at my body and beginning to tear off my clothwear, licking me with its tongue. Leaving a trail of black wherever it traced
>a feeling of instant shock and panic in my nether regions is felt. In an instant the beast is gone. And I look into an endless backdrop of grey mist
>my eyes slowly open. And my mind returns to this reality
>I am within a wagon on some bed and bench combination seat
>my armor not on me. But nearly placed within the wagons inventory of other things
>my sword is nowhere to be seen
>and the cart is moving
>”looking for this my dearest?”
>I follow the voice. Evelyn is staring back into the cart from its front window opening to the drivers seat. Holding my sword by its scabbard
>”For the journey home I shall use our new family heirloom to protect our new family, while my little sweet-roll rests of course”
“Evelyn, you must let me go, this isn’t right. What do you plan to do with me?”
>she looks back. Smiling in her usual way I’ve known since yesternight
>isn’t it obvious by now love? I’m taking you back to Brookesfield, where wedding bands will be made of some of our combined gold coinage. And then I shall take you home and show you our marriage bed. Where all our little children will be conceived forever and ever- amen!”
>she clapped her hands together at the end with the joy of a small child, strange considering her willingness to commit a crime such as kidnapping with no moral qualms. One with think her smile before hand was a facade
>I do not know if her smile being genuine is worse, I fear that it is
>”oh, unless we move of course. I would still like our marriage bed along to a new house if ever we relocate. Did you have a place you cannot bear to be away from my love?”
>she asked looking back to me again
“I’d prefer to be freed again that I may continue my great labor, Evelyn”
>”I thought you would say that, and it is something I cannot do. Your place is with me, and that is that. Wherever you go, I shall follow. As will be the vise versa”
>she let her statement remain standing in silence thereafter. Driving home her point of this being her final opinion on the subject
>regardless, I sat upright to argue more upon the very subject that left my neck collared to a hitch with chains. And my hands bound with rope
“I do not disagree with love, Evelyn. But don’t you consider this to be a little extreme?”
>I say poking my bound wrists through the little opening. She mustn’t be completely lost to irrationalality, right?
>”the lord can forgive extreme acts, my love. I shall simply have to forgive mine as they stand I’m afraid”
“Do not speak to me of faith. Evelyn, you and I both know it would have been better if this extreme path not be taken at all in favor of a better one”
>”I know what you’re trying to do my love. And it matters nought your correctness on the ethical qualms on the subject- I’ve done what I’ve done. And I will see this through until you and I have had at *least* three dozen little ones. Or until you confess with your mouth and with your heart that you reciprocate my love for you. Which we comes first; preferably both!”
>she speaks of defiling me were it as simple, easy, and joyous as eating a cake
>rationalism and arguing has thoroughly failed me this day
>at least she is forthcoming about what her plans are, I know what to expect from my time in captivity
>also... three dozen children merely in notion makes my head spin, let alone thinking that would be my future
>maybe someone in Brookesfield will notice, and come to my rescue. >Assuming she lives in town and raises suspicion
>otherwise I am hereby royally had
>hours become days
>days become weeks
>and weeks turn to months
>about two months had passed with Evelyns horse and cart making a direct journey with few stops
>every stop was far away from civilization, no city or town, or even village in sight
>she fed, washed and groomed me by hand, not daring to cut even my hands loose
>clever woman knows I could use them to make my escape if ever they were unbound
>our time together also emboldened here to do more lascivious acts first it was merely feeling my hair, or perhaps a hug and a kiss.
>now she demands each night we lie together
>I have not lost my chastity yet, but I fear that day draws closer
>her paws wander over me whenever she gets the chance in recent days
>a heat she had already passed. She cried that day. Lamenting it as if it was a miscarriage
>I suppose I’m her mind a missed opportunity to bare a child is nothing short of loosing a fair soul she could be mother to
>my resentment boils sometimes, but it is clear her mind is different than the common man’s. Seeing her in that state of agony and sorrow was distressful.
>I am called to be better than spiteful, or bitter, or to resent someone- even if they’ve sinned against me
>in addition to this calling. Hers is a crime of passion
>in good time we came upon the territory of Brookesfield again
>”it won’t be a day before we’re home and our rings will be made, my love. I am already very intimate with the size of your ring finger. Do not worry about a thing”
>she plants a kiss on my cheek. She is saving our first kiss upon the lips for her preparations to alope with me at sword point
>”I was just thinking, my honeydew... my i swaddle is in your beautiful cloak this eve before we arrive home. I know the thing is special to you.. and... I’d like to be special to you too”
>she unfolds my cloak before her and wraps it around the mantle of my shoulders. Covering herself in it as well
“This... still isn’t right, Evelyn. Your actions insult your sweetness and the good heart I know you have. These actions are not conducive to earning my heart...”
>for the first bit of her response, she ignores what I said before actually making a reply
>”it was just like this, covered in your cloak like they were the wings of an angel when you saved me... and... I k-know... my love, I know what I’m doing is w-wrong”
>she holds me. Still within the cloth flanks of the cloak and her embrace
>”I know you should be freed, that this ultimately is hurting you”
>her tears are flowing freely now. And it looks as if she’s in pain
>have I finally gotten through to her?
>”I-I don’t know why I’m like this, perhaps it’s in my blood. But I *cannot* let you go. I’m too afraid, so I’m not changing my mind”
>she steeled her face. Tears still dripping from her pale, yellow eyes, and her voice betraying her expression
>”forgive me for the future my love. I beg of you...”
>poor thing. Her conscience eats at her
>I’m greatly relieved, even if I’m still enslaved to her whims. This is progress toward righteousness


>"Okay" the she-wolf you recently learned was called Norma instructed as she led you to your new home, "The rules are pretty simple."
>"First and foremost: you have the freedom to do whatever you want, but obviously things that break the law or trying to run away are a no-go."
>The heavy wooden door creaked open to reveal the modest interior of a rural single-story home
>"Second rule: I won't ask you to do much, just keep the place neat and tidy while I'm at work. Maybe set up some coffee in the morning if you're up before me."
>The place was cozy, with signs of life everywhere.
>It also reeked of wolf, but that was to be expected.
>"Lastly, and this is the important one, if you EVER need help with anything, feel free to call me. I 'm your wife now, and it's my duty to help you as it's your duty to do the same."
>And with that, she took the rest of the afternoon showing you around. A single large area that made up both the living room, with a door to the left leading to the kitchen. A hall in the back led to what you assumed your shared room would be, along with the other amenities.
>With that in mind, you asked where the bedroom was, so that you could move your stuff.
>"Oh right, I forgot to ask: did you want to sleep together or separate?"
>Your brain fizzled out for a second?
>This isn't how you assumed it was going to go at all.
>You had, for good reason, expected to be held down and raped, then bitten as a show of dominance.
>Now, if you were understanding this correctly, you didn't so much get given a wife as you did find a new roommate.
>You told her you'd rather have some privacy, and she nodded sagely.
>"Good idea. Don't want to rush things, right Hubby?"
>...
>Right.
>As she led you to your room, which was on the opposite side of the hall from her's, you settled in and spent a couple of hours getting your place just how you liked it
>Suddenly Norma called you from where you guessed the kitchen should be
>You were basically done with your room, settling on the organized chaos it was left in, and made your way to the kitchen
>There you saw your wolf-wife in an apron that was comically girly compared to her tomboyish looks
>"Actually, do you mind helping me cook? It's been a long day and I assume you're pretty hungry too."
>You had to admit you were fucking starved. The stress leading up to today had sneaked behind your appetite and assassinated it early on
>But the vast amount of meat on the counter rekindled your body's need to feed
>You nodded a little too eagerly and Norma smiled
>"Good. Now put this on, wash your hands, and get over here. We're making stew."
>You were tossed another bubblegum cloth horror and washed your hands as told
>"Just chop those veggies up. Should be a knife nearby. Meat's almost done and just needs to be added back in with the veggies."
>You nodded, and grabbed the knife, only to immediately drop it
>What was this thing made of?
>It felt dense, and heavy, and your grip wasn't anywhere near firm enough to lift it
>It stuck in the cutting board point-down
>You looked to Norma, who was brandishing a similar blade with finesse as she made quick work of potatoes
>You didn't want to be outdone, so you grabbed the cutlery and went at it again
>By the type the carrots were rendered into small-enough chunks, you felt a burn in your forearms
>A bit of sweat was on your brow, and your fingers felt stiff
>You put down the knife apparently forged in the heart of a star and asked Norma about the blade
>"Oh yeah. It's no big deal, just prefer things that are built to last. It's nice, right?"
>You nod, figuring you must have been more tired than you realized
>"Here, Hugh, have a seat and I'll get the rest set up. Gotta watch the pot and make sure our precious beef doesn't burn."
>You decided that wouldn't be so bad of an idea, and plopped onto the large leather couch, grabbing the quilt
>The material was heavy
>Not "thickly woven" but physically heavier than any quilt you'd seen before
>It weighed down on you with an oppressive sort of heat and snugness that might be comfortable if you weren't completely surprised by it
>You could only last five or so minutes underneath it before you were fighting to get it off of you
>Your arms were feeling the burn again as you hefted the thing back to the side of the couch were it belonged
>At least the cushions were soft
>A dozen minutes of idle watching later and you were called both by Norma and the scent of stew that was begging to be consumed
>You practically leapt over the back of the couch to rejoin her in the kitchen
>She had set up two huge bowls with the stuff, some rolls, sides you weren't aware of beforehand, and enough utensils that you wondered if she came from old money
>"I have to admit, I outdid myself this time. Everything is perfect and you're to thank for part of it!" she said, raising a glass of champagne as you took a seat across from her
>"To us, and our life together!"
>You lifted the flute, thankful that at least this wasn't deceptively heavy, and clinked it against hers
>The two of you made quick work of dinner, and you tactfully ignored how the utensils were also weightier than you were expecting
>The rest of the night was spent letting the 'itis kick in and lounging on the couch
>The smother-quilt from before came back, but thankfully a lot of its bulk was off of you
>This show was pretty go-
>It was morning.
>You weren't sure when you fell asleep, but you woke up nearly covered by the assassination-comforter, tucked in neatly
>You spent a few moments fighting for your life as you used all four limbs to eject your self from its embrace
>There was a note on the coffee table
>"Hubby, sorry to leave you alone, but I had to go in and you looked so cute snuggled up like that. Help yourself to whatever, and take care of the laundry for me.
>Love, your wonderful wife"
>Her handwriting was also remarkably flowery
>She used pink ink
>It'd be hard to believe the hulking wolf woman would be behind the overwhelmingly girly things if you hadn't seen it with your own eyes before
>Oh well, do chores then slack off until she gets back.
>...
>Somehow you should have seen it coming
>Norma seemed to favor things that were thick and heavy
>It started with the realization that nearly every comforter in the house was the same dense material as the one from the couch, and every door seemed to be twice fortified or at least made of the most sturdy wood you've ever seen
>The dishes from last knight were also the same as the knives used, unsurprisingly
>You barely made it down stairs to the laundry room without giving in to the mass of the laundry basket itself knocking your balance off
>And it kept happening
>Heavy plates seemingly carved from stone
>Possibly the most industrial-looking vacuum you've ever used
>An actual weight set (in hot-pink) that you somehow hadn't noticed before when checking out the living room
>The (pretty nice) shower's pressure practically flattening you from all sides
>The full-body fur-dryer you tried on a whim almost knocking you off of your feet
>Everything
>E V E R Y T H I N G
>was powerful!
>And you had only spent a few hours on it.
>You weren't sure when Norma was going to get home, or even where she worked, but you were feeling peckish
>Time for a late lunch
>You didn't feel like leftover stew...or dealing with the borderline cauldron of a pot she had placed it in
>So you decided on a sandwich
>Nice and simple
>You nabbed some bread from the fridge, some mayo, and all the fixings you needed to put a certain mystery-solving pre-war sleuth to shame
>Oh yeah. It's all coming together
>All you needed now were the pickles
>...
>There was no fucking way, right?
>You eyed the jar in the fridge with a kind of trepidation
>The sort borne from knowledge of old sitcom tropes
>You gripped the jar
>Then the lid, and
>Nothing
>The lid wasn't moving a millimeter!
>You wiped the jar down to remove condensation, and made sure your hands were free of any potential lubricant
>Still the lid refused to budge
>You smacked the bottom, tapped the edges with a knife, and even ran the whole thing under water again
>Still the green deliciousness was denied
>Your pride as a man was also taking damage
>Norma lived this life normally (heh) and you couldn't hack it
>Still you tried, and tried, and tried until once again you found your brow getting moist and your arms shook
>"I had almost forgotten."
>You practically jolted when Norma's voice sighed from behind you
>To your credit you didn't drop the jar
>"I had forgotten something important again...."
>She leaned over you, and her arms slid along yours
>You could feel the muscles flexing with every little turn
>"You humans are always so prideful. You are rare to ever ask for help."
>Her finger ran over your hands, grey fur lacing themselves between yours
>"Even if you don't think you need it. Especially when you really need it."
>Her head laid on your shoulder, and you found that you were both gripping the jar now
>"It can lead to problems, Hugh. There's no shame in asking for help, even when the situation isn't life or death."
>Her fingers grip intensified
>"You know that, right?"
>You gripped it along with her
>You could feel her arms flex again
>You nodded.
>"Good. While we're together under an...unusual premise, were together all the same."
>Sher turned her hand, and yours with it
>And, soon, the lid along with them
>"We can help each other so much without even realizing it."
>Pop!
>The scent of brine filled your nose
>"Because we're a team."
>She nuzzled against you, and you enjoyed the feeling before she pulled off
>"By the way, I love how neat everything is. Thank you, sweetie."
>Normal walked off, patting your ass as she left your area
>You looked at the now liberated pickles
>Then to your wife's ass as she left
>Y-You too.

>tfw you'll never have a ditzy, overly-enthusiastic pokewaifur who doesn't know her own strength. accidentally hurts you when trying to hug you after winning a match, so spends the next few weeks being extra doting and gentle and loving to you as you recover

>your machoke gf demands "de-stress" or "relief" sessions after heavy training
>she's holding you in her two powerful arms in a smothering hug as you erupt into her
>you start feeling her growing, and is that two more limbs suddenly groping you?
>she evolved into a machamp during the act
>she strokes your head and tells you thanks for helping her level up

>Finish gruelling workout with Machoke gf
>"You feel your blood pumping Anon?"
Aghhh, ahhhhh, I feel it alright... My heart's beating so fast!
>"Oh really? That might be because your libido goes up after intense exercise..."
I think I'm going to collapse... Hold on, my what?
>"My my, you look so tense. You know, sex is a great for stress relief!"
Machoke... Don't do this to me. I can barely move!
>"If you're feeling weak you need more testosterone! Now what's a great way to increase testosterone?"
Is it-
>"Having sex!"
>You're still catching your breath, bent over with your hands on your knees but looking up at Machoke.
>She's absolutely beaming with her hands on her hips.
>Well, she was. Slowly she's coming down from that high, staring directly into you, beginning to breathe heavily.
>You can't stop what happens next.
>She swings her arms out, grabs you by the waist and pulls you on top of her as she falls backward to the floor.
>"Oh come on, fuck me already!"
Nnnn... How sore am I going to be tomorrow?
>"Don't worry Anon. Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger!"
>You have no idea how you'll survive the night.

Do you try sparring with your Machoke gf yourself? Or do you make sure she has another pokemon opponent?

>she'd start out with traditional holds that you'd find in mma, rear naked, triangle choke, something where she can at least have her legs wrapped around you in some way.
>she doesn't ever put too much pressure on you to break you, be it your arms, neck, legs. just enough that she knows you can't escape her
>eventually during one session she decides to sit her ass on your face and pin you that way
>you grab at her and your body flails, but at a certain point you give up and submit
>you also get a ragin hard-on
>she stops fighting too, and suddenly you're feeling absolutely fine with her sitting her plump ass on your face

>anthro supremacy must prevail
>she solely invades a fire watchtower
>the anon who got scheduled for that shift has no idea what's going on
"Uhh...what?" he suddenly inquires
>She points her knife at him and motions to her gun
>"Just surrender now Anon! I've taken capture of your watchtower, cooperate, gently lay out your munitions and I'll take you in as a POW rather than kill you!"
>Anon raises his hands
"I protect the woods from fires, I have fire extinguishers and a medical kit. This isn't a military outpost."
>"Shut up humie! I-wait...you said you protect these lands? Do you include the animals?"
"Yes, of course, I don't want anything to die."
>She pauses for a second, then puts her knife back in its holster.
>"Hmmph, well I'm going to have to monitor you for some time to be sure you aren't a threat. Prepare some food and a bedding arrangement for me."
"O-okay."

All human men must cover themselves in public so they don't tempt anthro women

Would shorts and v necks be seen as slutty clothing?

>necks/shoulders lewd to predator species and more so if they have no bites or marks on them
>exposed stomach really lewd to anthros since showing belly is a really submissive gesture added on with humans being furless and more vulnerable

Let me rework this dumb idea I posted because why would anthros be in a zoo?
>Anthros work at zoos to ensure the care of their feral cousins.
>Humans visit to learn about the ferals
>Suddenly enter the Anthro area
>The Anthro area menagerie is a bunch of differently styled "break rooms" where the employees relax
>When a human walks by who one of them likes she can hit a buzzer to get their attention
>She points them out and motions for them to meet her over at the door over there
>Starts inquiring with the human if they'd like to know more about Anthro biology.

>a sort of galactic space zoo filled with alien anthro species
>maybe run by some sort of AI or eldritch entities/species keepers
>humans are a new addition to the zoo
>maybe something happened to Earth or our species
>or maybe the keepers "acquired" some human males when they discovered something about our genes/DNA that adapted well to some tech/treatment they have that allows human males to breed with pretty much any alien species
>makes it so the children are the mother's species
>so the keepers do whatever it is that they do to the human guys they got so they can throw them into the enclosures with the other aliens so they can breed
>maybe focusing on endangered or rare species first
>the poor human guys barely understand what's happening to them made worse the keepers didn't bother to give them translators
>also the question of how sapient some of these species are comes to question with how feral some act despite the humanoid bodies and mannerisms they have
>many seeming content to act on instinct and animal-like behaviors
>maybe it has something to do with how they were changed, but the alien females seem almost too eager to mate with the human guys
>and since it's a zoo that means they're on display to be seen
>mostly with the human guys being pinned and fucked for the even stranger alien visitors to watch along with being monitored by the keepers as well

>two things stand out
>1: tech that humans are mastering have mostly already been mastered by other species. And it’s simply a matter of reverse engineering: rendering your degree as far as humanity as a government is concerned as utterly useless for who knows how long because all the technological improvements that have been made were simply traded for cultural, manufacture, or service goods
>2 Venus is a **resort** world, not exactly meant for learning, industry, technology, anything like that
>so it’s evident to you now why Sol, the home star of mankind is terraforming everything, including the ones thought impossible to do for like Jupiter or mercury
>TOURISM

"Sorry. Nervous."

>you wonder what she'll be like

>just like it's hers to love and protect you
>you proceed out of the assignment office and down the hallway to your waiting room
>and you shuffle through the files as you go
>inside is all the information you need to get to know your new wife
>let's see
>'Naome Fortin'
>a canine!
>you were hoping for a canine
>she works as a mid-level data collator for the Bureau of Health
>sounds like important work
>she has a small house in the suburbs
>your new home!
>you hope it has a big yard
>most of the other information is less impressive
>diet restrictions, income bracket, things to that nature
>you enter the waiting room and take a seat
>you don't have to wait long
>the door to the waiting room clicks softly, and your new wife steps through the door
>a borzoi!
>she's tall, at least a foot taller than you, with bright white fur elegantly styled and immaculate
>she's dressed like she just came from the office, a bright white blouse and simple beige pants, along with a purse hanging from her shoulder
>you can't contain your excitement and hope off the couch
"Hi! I'm Incog Netto. It's a pleasure to--"
>Naome lets you continue until the door is closed behind her
>then she growls lowly
>"Quiet."
>you shut up, taken aback by the sudden aggression
>did you do something wrong?
>"First rule. You do what I say, exactly as I say, immediately."
>her tone is cold
>you nod your head
>of course
>you're supposed to serve your wife
>maybe she's a little strict, but you're sure once you've made her happy she'll treat you well
"Yes. Of course, I'm happy to--
>Naomi growls again
>"Second rule. Do not speak unless I say so."
>you go to respond, but a hard look from the canine silences you
>Naome steps closer, drawing from her purse a loop of plain leather
>a collar
>and when she's right in front of you, she affixes it around your neck in one motion and cinches it tight
>too tight
>the leather collar squeezes against your windpipe, making it a slight challenge to breath
>you reach up to try and tug at it
>and Naome slaps you across the face with the back of her paw
>"Don't touch. Try again and I will tighten it."
>you tremble
>cheek stinging
>you have to fight down the urge to rub at the spot that will surely bruise
>meanwhile, Naome steps around you, inspecting you with her cold eye as she continues explaining her rules
>"Refer to me as mistress. I expect breakfast in the morning, and dinner waiting when I get home. You will wear nothing in the house, except when I tell you otherwise. When I say so, you will drop to your knees and service me."
>Naome stops in front of you
>"Knees. Now."
>you stare at her, not sure if she meant it or not
>the health classes warned that sometimes something like this would happen after assignment
>your wife, so overwhelmed with love for her new husband, may not be able to wait to get home
>but Naome doesn't seem overwhelmed
>just coldly indifferent
>in a flash, you're struck across the other cheek, this time her claws leave a stinging row of marks across your face
>"I said knees!"
>you whimper and rush to comply
>dropping down and bowing your head in the hope of mollifying her
>even when she struck you, Naome maintained a completely cold demeanor
>like it didn't even matter to her whether you obeyed or she punished you
>she grabs your hair
>"You get no dinner tonight. Learn to obey me or there will be further consequences."
>using her free paw, Naome undoes her pants, and drags them down enough to expose herself to you
>no underwear
>with a harsh tug, she steps forward and mashes your face into her crotch
>she yanks your hair
>"Get to work."
>with a trembling jaw you start to eat her out
>at first she sighs and her grip loosens a bit
>but then she yanks even harder after a few seconds
>"Harder. Deeper. Do better or lose breakfast too."
>you try your best, lapping at her drooling slit with as much effort as you can muster
>it feels like she's going to pull your hair out as she bares her teeth in a sneer
>"Don't look me in the eye. Keep eating me out."
>you look away
>her hips thrust
>Naome humping your face in the middle of an Assignment office waiting room
>"That's right. Keep going. Know your place."
>Naome breaths harder, her thrusts get harsher
>her grip has gone from your hair your entire head, claws digging into your scalp painfully
>she finally cums, drenching your face while letting out subdued moans of pleasure
>when Naome's done using you, she shoves your head away and looks down at you in disgust
>"Get up. We're leaving."
>you pant for breath
>made harder by the collar
>and stand to follow her out
>Officer Gretta took her spot by the front door
>she glanced at her partner, just to the side of the doorway
>her equine partner nodded
>then back toward the collie in the gray uniform of an inspector
>who also gave a nod of approval
>Gretta took a deep breath and reared back
>"State Police!"
>she roared as she kicked in the latch to the front door, splintering wood with the force of the blow
>the house inside was unlit
>Gretta stepped inside, pulling the flashlight from her belt and pointing it around the darkened living room
>it seemed like a normal, well cleaned room
>"Clear."
>Gretta focused
>she sniffed deeply, just inside the doorway
>human scent, canine scent, both suffusing the house
>food from the kitchen
>stink of trash
>and then something more
>the irony scent of blood
>to her left, up the stairs was the main source of it
>she indicated with a paw, and proceeded cautiously
>her partner followed her in
>the inspector last
>Gretta could hear it now
>soft, trembling gasps
>"Hello?"
>she called down the hall, pointing her flashlight to illuminated darkened doorways
>the one at the end of the hall was shut
>that's where the smell and sound were coming from
>the inspector was at Gretta's back now
>Gretta's partner was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, watching their backs
>the inspector must be hearing and smelling the same, Gretta thought
>"Clear the rest of the rooms. Quickly. Then we'll take the door."
>Gretta nodded and moved quickly to follow orders
>the rooms on her side were empty
>an office, a bathroom, both unoccupied
>the inspector worked with near indecent haste, arrived at the end of the hall before Gretta
>"Door's locked."
>in a stride, Gretta was at the door
>the inspector stepped back a pace
>"I'm taking it."
>Gretta watched as the inspector perfectly mimicked the door-kick from a minute ago
>"State Inspector!"
>the inspector was being hasty, but Gretta didn't blame her
>from the smell alone, she knew it was bad
>the inspector was inside the bedroom first
>"Clear!"
>Gretta followed up behind, shining her flashlight in
>she wished she hadn't
>Gretta illuminated the scene
>the border collie kneeling at the foot of the bed
>next to a human
>he looked like death
>completely nude, on his knees, and covered in injuries
>a deep bite wound on each shoulder, far more than a simple marking bite
>claw marks running down his arms
>a black eye swollen shut
>and a series of deep purple bruises up and down his left side
>he stared ahead, looking right through the inspector like she wasn't there
>Gretta was shocked by the sight of him
>"Officer."
>the shepherd officer didn't respond at first
>"Officer."
>the inspector's voice was stern and steady
>"Get an ambulance en route, then contact the Public Safety office. I want Fortin in cuffs. Now."
>a bit of emotion slipped through the inspector's professional veneer on the last
>she was furious
>Gretta snapped back to action, training superseding emotion
>she leaned over to start relaying information and orders into her radio
>the inspector reached out toward the human with a gentle paw
>the boy still didn't look at the collie, but he started to tremble
>and tears began streaming down his face
>'God', Gretta thought, 'he looks like my husband'
>once she got the acknowledgement from dispatch, Gretta turned away
>she couldn't bear the sight of him anymore
>but she could still smell his blood
>and hear his unsteady voice when he finally spoke
>"P-Please..."
>Gretta clenched her fists
>"Please don't t-tell mistress I was crying."

>most anthros aren't extreme sadists

>and who could forget poor jimbo.

He won’t so much as touch his woman unless it’s in the effort to maul her. In order to have offspring as required by the government she had no choice but to drug and take him, which only made him more doggedly hateful of the anthros, because in her need to have children she proved her husband right about her kind
>when they were boys- they were in the same anti-anthro (AA) machine gun squad
>they were brothers in arms. And now brothers in spirit
>and yet now with children of their own. Those sons are taught like their fathers were. their fathers prophecy of how terrible anthro kind is may even come true.

>they wanted to make the entire complex bleed for what it did
>their fathers stories screamed in their heads
>they wanted the worst examples of their stories, and to poetically turn the tables with as much pain as they could inflict
>local authority knew about these men. But they were too risky to call attention to them and rouse their ire. And too small-time to raise suspicion
>their fathers were chalked up to merely being traumatized

>We reach our destination.
>The largest ship In the harbor.
>If there are enough human crewmates, we may be able to rebel.
>The pig gestures me to walk up the plank.
>I have half a mind to jump into the port and take this swine with me.
>I have to be patient, I'll get my chance.
>I'm first in line walked up to the deck.
>The deck hands all howl and pant at us.
>The sneering beasts nudge each other and make obscene gestures.
>While the others are sent down into the hold, I'm are walked the length of the ship to the captains quarters.

>Big tiger girl at a pool
>Has her sights on a human lifeguard
>The only issue is she's deathly afraid of water just like many other cat anthros which makes it hard to get close to him, in fact it to her weeks to build up the courage just to enter the pool building
>So she waits on a beach chair, pretending to enjoy the sun while stealing quick glances at her prey
>Eventually she sees him wade over to the edge and get up out of the water, perfect
>Hiding her face behind a magazine she watches him walk over to the bathrooms
>Now all she has to do is hide next to the bathroom doors and pounce on him as soon as he exits
>Then when he's safely pinned down by her mass she'll confess her undying love for him
>Oh how long she's waited to do this! Years of watching him by the sidelines too scared to make a move like some frightened little kitten
>The closest she ever got was when she gave him a tiger stripe shirt to wear as a birthday present, she hoped he would get the hint but he just thought it was a platonic gift
>Whatever, as soon as he exits the bathroom she'll pounce him in the hallway and finally take him as hers
>Carefully dodging a few puddles on the floor she stealthily sneaks beside the door to the mens room facing the entrance to the pool
>When he exits he'll try to go right back to try and finish his shift, then with his back turned she'll be in a perfect position to make a move
>She casually leans against the wall and waits...and waits...and waits
>And...the door opens!
>And now he's walking back to the pool, perfect
>As quietly as possible she sneaks up behind him, crouches slightly to be in perfect pouncing position, gets her paws out to grab him, does the classic cat butt wiggle, and...jumps!
>Her muscular legs propel her through the air and she's right on target
>She reaches the apex of her jump and to her horror her target slips on a puddle of water in the hallway
>He falls forward on his belly and with her current trajectory she'll sail right over him
>Damnit!
>At least she might be able to land and make up an excuse for why she nearly hit him
>The tigress prepares to land but her feet have no traction when they hit the ground, the whole damn hallway feels like it's coated in grease
>With her sizable mass and momentum she tumbles forward and continues sliding on the wet ground, her claws trying to find purchase in vain
>The pool looms closer and still she continues forward
>With one last desperate movement she digs her claws into the ground and they screech against the floor in an attempt to arrest her slide into the pool
>But it's no use, she hits the water with a splash and immediately begins flailing around as water fills her lungs
>Why oh why did she just have to fall for a guy that works at a place filled with water when she doesn't know how to swim? What a cruel twisted fate has befallen her!
>Her lungs burn for air as she slowly loses the battle with the pool, her head eventually sinking below the water line
>Just when she thinks she's a goner there's someone shouting above and an arm reaches into the water towards her
>She reaches out and grabs it by the forearm, the hand wraps around her own forearm and pulls her up and out of the water with a surprising amount of strength
>She climbs out of the pool coughing water and sits by the edge catching her breath, whiskers drooping and fur soaked with water
>"You okay?"
>She looks up towards the voice and sees her cherished lifeguard with a concerned look on his face
>"Uhhhh....ya. I'm fine.” She says with a cough. “Who pulled me out of the water?"
>"That would be me. You gave me quite a memento back there, but they'll heal."
>He brings his arm out she can see it, there's several red claw marks across his entire forearm from when she gripped it
>The sight almost makes her cry
>"Oh my god Anon I'm so sorry I-I-I must have forgotten to put my claws in when you pulled me out. Oh my god I'm so sorry.” She whimpers, hands on her cheeks
>”Don’t worry about it. You should consider yourself lucky I was there to get you out before you drowned. I'm going to go ahead and guess you don’t know how to swim?”
>”No.” She says with a sniffle, eyes now tracing the floor
>”Well what about some swimming lessons? I could teach you, would you like that?”
>”I-I-I-I” She stutters and stops, face growing hot and embarrassment flaring as she tries to find the right words
>Eventually she gets up and begins walking towards the exit, desperate to get away from this terribly humiliating situation with her crush
>”Anon I'm so sorry! I'm really not such a clumsy cat you have to believe me. Please forgive me!” She yells before running off to the exit
>Anon looks at the waterlogged cat depart and scratches his head
>What a strange girl
>Who knows, maybe one day he’ll work up the courage to tell her how much he really likes her

anthrostate baking shows must be interesting to watch with some anthro host talking about how to cook for various species or watching a humie in an apron cook on screen to get anthro viewers

>psychic anthros putting lewd thoughts in your head

>doing chores around the house

>last thing you remember is going to the bedroom to yell at her for messing with your mind while you're working
>wake up several hours later, naked, sweaty, and wrapped in dragon gf's arms
>what were you mad about again?

Here's a concept I had in my head but don't have anywhere to implement in my stories:
>Anthros can't sweat, since animals can't either.
>Heat regulation is usually done with a combination of fur, panting, or just resting in the shade ect.
>But those are all passive options that don't work in every situation, like the gym.
>The solution: human water-boys, carrying around squirt-guns, misters, and sprayers throughout the gym during workouts to keep patrons cool.
>Personal trainers probably carry some with them too.
>Water-loving species like hyenas or tigers especially love it, but normal cats/lions have begrudgingly accept it and get pissed at unsolicited sprays.
Feel free to steal it, won't fit into what I'm currently writing.

>Anthro dog girl demands to have evening walkies
>Anon is terribly embarrassed by doing this
>Especially since it's clear he has not control of his "dog"
>She's basically dragging him around by the leash
>It's like an owner being led around by their big dog on walks
>Completely unable to control the dog despite the leash
>Making it clear that the dog considers herself to be in charge
>Only he's not just a weak guy being led around by his dog
>He's a pervert being led around by his "dog" who's a foot taller

>Pretty cool gal, very strong, and a excellent swimmer, a bit rough with him but she truly loved him and never did more than some teasing.
>However some time ago she seemed to be in a hurry.
>According to my friend she REAAAAAALLY wanted to fuck, not just the usual rump, not even the pelvis breaking kind.
>She took him to her house, near a lake and convinced him to go skinny dip with her.
>That was a mistake, according to him, the moment he joined her in the lake, she went straight to him and started to fuck him in every single position that was possible in the water.
> He almost drowned a few times, it was so intense he passed out, but that wasn't the worst of it....
>When he woke up he was extremely sore, he also found an ice cooler with no ice, instead it was full of eggs with a message from her telling she loved him and to take care of their children, and then he found her...

>maid anthro who works for a rich human guy
>she appreciates and respects her master, but absolutely despises his spoiled brat son

Anon inna Anthrostate
>Gets assigned 5'4" mouse wife.
>Fiercely tries to assert her dominance and authority.
>Simply too nice to hurt him even accidentally. Curls up in a ball when she scratches him.
>Takes him home to her family's colony.
>Anon immediately swarmed by a bunch of horny mice trying to get that D.
>Clan elders very upset when mouse wife says that it's HER husband, the law says so, she doesn't have to share if she doesn't want to, and It'd be mean to pimp him out if he doesn't want to be.
>Pulls him off to her room.
>Bumps his head on the way in.
>Tiny one bedroom with a twin bed.
>Oh no
>Confesses she put in for assignment without permission and never expected to actually get a husband.
>They promise to try and be happy together.
>Everybody works in the colony.
>Anon assigned kitchen duty. Mouse waifur turns out to have a PHD in accounting, which is how she got a husband so fast.

>Sexually dead until someone tries to make a move on Anon.

>Now she's facing a disciplinary hearing, not for the murder but for unauthorized preggers.

>despite her new position as new alpha bitch in the school, it does nothing to assuage her paranoia that someone will try to snatch you from her.
>as a result she makes sure that absolutely everyone in the school knows that you are HER human (and future husband)
>she does this through a variety of methods, but her favourite is to routinely engage in aggressive make out sessions with you in the hall or anywhere she knows people will see.

thx for coming to my Ted Talk

>You woke up with a pounding headache
>Your mouth tasted of puke, whiskey, and...something else
>You were in a strange place, and wearing an oversized shirt you didn't own
>And, most importantly, you-
>"Well, well, well, Look who's finally back from the dead..."
>Your head snapped to the other side of the bed
>Sitting on the edge, wearing your leather jacket, was a she-wolf
>A freshly-lit cig clutched between her fingers
>And a cocky smile on her face
>Between her undressed state, and the soreness of your hips, you came to a certain conclusion
>With a voice not nearly as masculine as you'd like, you ask the bi -she wolf- what happened last night
>Her grin grew three sizes, displaying way more teeth than you were comfortable with
>She took a long drag of the cigarette and added to the tobacco stains of the dingy hotel ceiling
>"Mister 'I don't think anthros are attractive' here got one taste of cookie and couldn't handle it."
>Wait...
>No that's definitely not what happened last night, right?
>You were out with your friends at the pub down the street...
>"And" she continued for you, "You got so hammered that I could smell the booze on you before you even got close."
>She pantomimed holding a stein, and swayed a bit
>"You were all like 'hey sweet stuff. How'd you like to have a taste of domestication?' while barely able to stay upright!"
>She fixed you with a glare, and the smile disappeared for a bit
>"Honestly it kinda pissed me off. This wasn't some porno and I was trying to have a nice time after work..."
>Well you're still in once piece so...
>"So I figure 'why not put this humie in his place?' and dragged you here."
>You didn't...she didn't...
>No way you'd stoop so low, not with a bitch like that!
>She smiles, eyes wide with glee
>"Oh but we did! And you know what the best part of it was?"
>She pounced on you
>You were pinned under her weight!
>"You came! Like a fucking freight train!"
>She leaned in closer, and you could smell the scent of smoke and sex-funk wafting off of her
>"You kept going on about how 'shameful' it was, and how much you were 'debasing' yourself, but you were still rock hard the whole time."
>Oh god.
>She leaned over to grab a blocky-looking phone, thumbing through something until she turned it to show you
>There you were, face red with drunken delight, legs hiked around her shoulders
>Balls deep in that exotic snatch of hers
>She took a fucking selfie of herself riding your dick
>"I hadn't even heard of the 'amazon position' before this, you know. I'm a real big fan of it now, though."
>You wanted to look away, but in your horror you couldn't
>It was fake, right? Some clever photo editing to blackma-
>"Like I'd try and extort some wageslave! Face the facts: you put your hand in the cookie jar and liked what you found."
>"And those self-degrading comments? Shut right up the moment I got your legs on my shoulders. When you finally sank that dick of yours into the place it really belonged from the get-go."
>She leaned in and whispered "You only begged for more from that point on, you know. Only wanted me to do more and more 'shameful' things to you."
>Your face was getting flushed again, and it wasn't from booze
>"Let's see...you wanted me to fuckin' BITE you, for one thing. Wanted me to claim you as a beta or something..."
>"Wanted to know if I had any friends so that we could take turns breaking your hips under, and I quote, our 'wonderful wolven legs' while writing shit in marker on your back."
>"You even mentioned getting a tattoo, but that shit's expensive for a one-night stand. Also...kind of embarrassing. Your browser history's gotta be something intense, man..."
>You asked her if she could just kill you and get it over with
>"Haha, no way. Your friends are probably waiting for you to come back with stories of triumph."
>But all you have is
>"Memories of being fucked silly..well at least you would, you lush."
>Her ears perked up, and she leaned back
>"Well look who's up and ready for round six..."
>Standing proud, free of any confines like boxers or plush furry thighs, your traitorous erection reached for the sky
>Or, you suspected, towards the warm and wet place it was apparently deep inside last night
>"Did all the strolling down memory lane do it for you, or were you just that eager to sink back inside."
>Rough pawpads circled around the base of your dick, now happily twitching away
>Her hips raised a bit and you could see that her recounting has had a similar effect on her
>God, she was so wet you wonder how you didn't feel it pooling around you!
>"Well I know I'm itching for a top-off before I bail. What do you say, now that you're all sober and back to being a speciest douche?"
>You looked to her
>The hulking wolf-woman who held your precious part in her fingers
>The shit-eating grin that hasn't left her face
>The way her sex baptized your born-again member in holy water
>You shouldn't. You know you could brush away last night as the ramblings of some mongrel but...
>The vision before you was too much to bear
>You agreed, not wanting to make eye-contact like that wouldn't count as a defeat
>She didn't have a witty retort, or snappy one-liner
>All she did was sink
>First the plush lips that kissed your crown like a lover welcoming her mate back
>Then the draw inward as you were pulled past that plush cushion into the real passage
>You groaned in spite of yourself as she sank further down, gripping you with more than her hand at this point
>Swallowing you up
>Welcoming you back to where you belonged
>By the time her hips settled down against yours, you were already a shuddering mess
>She took a moment to drink in your expression
>A canine tongue ran over a wolfish muzzle
>"Tell me, skinnie: is it as good as you had hoped?"
>"No, don't tell me. You're already twitching so much that anything you say would only be half the truth."
>Then she started
>Her movements, contrary to the slow decline, were rough
>Hungry and feral
>They were so wonderfully bestial that you could only grit your teeth and clutch the sheets as she extracted her pleasure from you
>But, even if she was being selfish
>And focused only on getting herself off
>You were in ecstasy in this taboo embrace
>In that small and smoke-filled room, away from the places you were used too, you were free to express yourself
>As that inhuman cunt did its damndest to squeeze another round from you
>As those plump lips ground into your base from all sides
>As her claws dug into your shoulders and her face pressed against yours
>Her vision filled yours as her hips raised almost entirely off your shaft only to slam back down
>Again, and again, and again until you were sure you'd be walking funny
>"Tell me you want it!"
>"Tell me that you want to fuck pup into me!"
>Wait, what?
>"Admit that, if you could, you'd give this 'Bitch' a litter of her own!"
>"That you'd get your pleasure at seeing her all ready to pop with your seed!"
>The images came before you could stop them
>This wolf, belly round with the result of your frantic mating
>The idea of knocking up this anthro filled your head
>And those thoughts liquefied and collected in your crotch
>There was no way you could hold back after imagining that
>And you could tell that she noticed too
>"Do it!" she husked, "Let it all out, you fucking pervert!"
>And so you did, hips trying and failing to raise the mass of fur and muscle pinning them to the mattress
>You could practically feel your soul leaving your body with the way you poured your all into her
>The words that came out of your mouth, you still aren't sure what they were
>Just that whatever you said ticked her to no end
>"Good boy." she said when you finally came back to your senses
>You felt tired...
>You could sleep for a little longer, right?
>With the fur blanket covering you, it was easy enough to do
>Your sleep was deep and dreamless
>And when you woke again you felt like you had just ran a marathon while fighting a heavyweight boxer that also sucked your dick the entire time
>And yet...no shame came
>You expected it to come, but as you realized you were alone in the hotel room, it never did
>You were still wearing what you assumed to be her shirt
>And you didn't find your jacket anywhere!
>Damn it, you liked that ja-
>Your phone was ringing
>Your phone was ringing and you spent way too long fishing it from the side of the bed where it had fallen at some point
>You weren't sure who "Sam" was, but if the fortune cookie picture was any hint, you could take a guess
>You answered the call and a familiar voice greeted you
>"Ah. So you're finally awake."
>"Had to bail on you, since SOME of us have businesses to run."
>Wait she owns a business?
>"Yep, and now I've got to deal with customers while smelling like a cookie monster's fleshlight."
>"But I bet you'd really enjoy that, though. Knowing that everyone, even dull-nosed humans, will know exactly what I was up to?"
>You were glad she couldn't see your dick springing up
>"Well you're probably rock hard again thinking about it, I bet."
>Shit
>"Oh, by the way. You still have my favorite shirt. I'll be needing that back. If you look in the breast pocket, there should be a business card..."
>You fished around, undoing a button and fishing out the card
>Eggshell with Romalian type
>Nice!
>On it you read the name
>Some brewery you hadn't heard of
>But it sounded familar
>"I should be in my office until ten tonight. Funnily enough, If I'm not mistaken, that pub you went to should be carrying my supply starting next week. I'm planning on celebrating weeks of dealings and could use a drinking partner. You free?"
>You look to the card, then the shirt you still wore, and the triangular "kiss" mark on the back of it
>Yeah. You think you can make it...

>beeg wife too loving to want to ever bite you
>still has serious security issues when you go do things that happen to not be in her presence

>you spend all night searching until you finally come upon it
>an early Iron Age “throttle”

>"Hello! Welcome to Better Health Solutions. How may I help you?"
>you slide the flyer over the desk for her to see
"Yeah, hi, I'm here about the medical trials. The flyer just said this address. What kind of trial is this?"
>the receptionist nods her head and reaches under her desk to pull out a sheaf of papers pre-paperclipped
>"Excellent! Please take these forms, go up the elevators on your right to floor six, and fill them out in waiting room three. Everything you need to know will be in the first couple pages."

"Uh..."
>you double check the top page of the packet
>yep, that's what it says in tiny letters
"Yep. That's me. Guess I'm the only one, huh?"
>he shrugs
>he holds out his paw for the papers and you hand them over
>"It would seem so. Please follow me."
>he leaves through the same door, holding it open for you to follow
>"Okay, you have selected home treatment. You understand that's a full-time course for six months, correct?"

"So when do I take the pill?"

>what client?
>you go to ask him, but the nurse has already shut the door

>a pair of those fuzzy pajama pants in cheetah print

>on the front is printed 'World's Fastest Cutie!'
>and an illustration of a winking cartoon cheetah head

>in a flash she's by your side, and you're entangled by her long limbs
>"Hi!"
>she whispers in your ear
>what is going on?
>you look to the doctor
>she's busy scribbling down notes on a clipboard, looking unconcerned
"Uh, excuse me, doctor?"
>the badger looks up from her work
>"Hm?"
>the cheetah works at constricting you with her limbs, somehow pulling you into her lap while remaining wrapped around you
"What's going on here?"
>the badger and the cheetah hit you with a simultaneous 'huh?'
>the badger lowers her clipboard, and the cheetah pulls away from you
>you glance in between the two, completely befuddled
"Sorry, wasn't this supposed to be a medical trial?"
>the cheetah mewls quietly, frowning
>"Keep going Krista. It's not your fault."
>at the doctor's direction, Krista the cheetah slowly starts to hug you again
>while you're fixed with the evil eye
>"You signed up for this trial. Did you read the provided material?"
>no
>quick, come up with a lie!
"I uh, skimmed it. I thought this was an anxiety thing?"
>the doctors sighs
>"It is an anxiety treatment. For Krista. We're studying the effects of non-medication alternatives for patients like Krista."

"So why is she cuddling me?"
>Krista really is cuddling you

>"We asked for humans because you present as a non-threat to a vast majority of predator and prey alike. Your bare skin allows for greater transfer of body warmth, and its texture is considered soothing by many other species."
>the badger flips over a couple pages on her clipboard and sighs deeply
>"And, according to in-house surveys, humans were rated as 'cute'."
>she doesn't have to make air quotes for you to feel the gesture in her voice
>but Krista starts to purr and murmurs in your ear
>"Very cute~"
>the doctor continues on
>"If that answers all your questions, then I have one for you. Did you really agree to a six-month live-in trial with our patient Krista, on behalf of BHST, without bothering to read the contract you signed?"
>shit
>live-in?
>as in you'd have to--
>"Yes, as in live in her home during treatment."
>how does she do that?
>Krista giggles
>"My own human to cuddle."
>it looks like you've done exactly what the doctor says you have
"Uh, yes. I think I have done that."
>the doctor groans and mutters to herself, scribbling furiously on the clipboard
>"Fine. Fine, that's perfectly fine. Waste thousands of dollars in company time, putting patients like Krista out of pocket because you can't spend five minutes reading a contract."
>you flinch as the doctor berates you
>Krista shushes you and runs her claws through your hair, scratching your scalp soothingly
>it's starting to feel like she's comforting you more than you're comforting her
>the doctor's expression softens
>"Tell you what, take the half hour with Krista. When I get back, we'll see if you want to follow through on your agreement."
>looks like you're not getting much choice in the matter
>you don't bother to raise any complaint, so the doctor makes one final mark on her clipboard and exits the room
>leaving you alone with Krista
>she goes on purring and petting
>hugging and humming
>and even starts to throw in tentative licks to your neck and cheek
>there's no clock in the room, you can't tell how long it's been
>but she's started murmuring in your ear
>"You'll do the full trial, won't you? I already feel so much better. You're so soft and sweet and precious."
>you make no attempt to escape from Krista
>even as she lays you down on your side to spoon you
>her legs go over yours, and you feel the purr in her chest laying against her
>"This is the best I've felt in months. It's amazing. You're amazing, my little human. I promise, you'll love those six months as much as I will."
>her paw slips under the sweater and she coos
>"And you look so cute in my sweater! It'll be even cuter when I'm wearing it, and you can slip inside to cuddle on those cold winter nights."
>this is her sweater?
>guess that's why it's so big
>Krista makes a compelling argument though
>cuddling is really nice
>"And who knows, maybe once the trial is done, you might want to stay with me even longer?"
>her confidence wavers, turning what started as a teasing remark into a hopeful question
>you think your heart might melt
>but you don't get a chance to answer, as the door swings open for the doctor to interrupt you again
>"Alright, thirty minutes is up, and..."
>she looks up from the clipboard, then pinches her snout in irriation
>"...you two are about to fuck in my exam room. Brilliant."
>Krista sits up with indecent haste, leaving you half-in her lap, still awkwardly lying on the edge of the couch
>she stammers and tries to smooth out her shirt
>"Sorry! S-sorry. You said--There wasn't--"
>Krista lapses into silence
>by this point you've managed to get back to your original position sitting beside her
>Krista is starting to tremble as she withers under the doctor's gaze
>thankfully it gets a little better when the badger turns her attention to you
>"Have you decided to complete the trial?"
>Krista looks down to you
>her golden eyes glow in the low light of the exam room
>full of need and anxiety
>a single word escapes her
>you barely hear it
>"Please?"
>well there's only one answer to give to a question like that
>to a person who clearly, desperately needs your help
>you lean against Krista and wrap your arm around her bicep in a side hug
"Of course. The full six months."
>Move in with cheetah girl
>House is a messy wreck
>"I, heh, tried to clean up before you got here..."
>Guess tried is the operant word here, huh?
>Some things piled in the corner, a few dishes in the dish washer now, but otherwise it's pretty messy.
>How long has she lived like this...?
>Poor baby...
>Feeling self conscious, she pulls you onto a big easy chair for snuggles and cartoons.
>Routine develops over the next week
>Go to work, come home anxious and sagging, snuggle on the chair and feel a ton better.
>Sometimes you start to feel something stirring inside when Krista grooms you and affectionately calls you here "little human."
>The doctor's voice in the background admonishes you though.
>"Krista's emotional well being is your primary concern. Remember to listen, never judge, never scold, and to tell her it's not her fault when something bad happens."
>"And whatever happens, keep your personal and romantic distance. Feel free to share you thoughts and be friendly, but keep a professional detachment! If she gets too close, she'll have trouble letting go at the end of the trial. Worse, you might just become a source of new anxiety for her."
>"Let us know immediately if she tries to engage you."
>When was the last time you were held though? Having someone actually WANT you, give you praise and just be happy to see you...
>It's intoxicating.
>Cuddles turns into spooning, always with you as the little spoon.
>Her hands start on your tummy, inevitably, but they always seem to sink towards you pelvis or up your chest.
>Her hips get awfully close, like she's trying to feel your butt.
>With no complications and marked improvement in Krista's dopamine and serotonin levels, you're approved to accompany her to work as an emotional support human.
>Your paperwork lists you as a service pet. Her office was strangely willing to go along with it.
>Are they getting paid too, or...?
>Whatever. You were more than happy to be there. Beats being alone all day.
>New instructions come in from the doctor.
>You've got a dress code now.
>Comfy pajama pants and sweats are a must. T-shirts with calming colors and and cute designs.
>Krista loves one especially: a baby blue t of hers that's two sizes too big, with a chibi human holding a blanket on the front.
>It says "snuggle monster"
>Shoes permitted only when necessary. Sandals preferred.
>Never thought you'd have an assigned underwear brand, but apparently cotton did excellent on their exit surveys.
>"A 20% increase in feelings of ease and safety have been noted with familiar scented clothing."
>It's almost all hers, and she's always doting on how cute you look.
>"Eeeee! You look like my little cousin with you long sleevies and cute little jammies!~"
>You soon become VERY popular at the office.
>Sitting there on her little bean bag while she works, you soon have a constant stream of tired looking anthros asking for hugs and cuddles.
>Sign up sheet for designated hand holding hours.
>That lasts for about a week before Krista's mood starts dropping.
>"I don't mind..." She says, half heatedly as she sags in her chair.
>She cries and holds onto you for the better part of an when you say you're going to focus on her.
>That's the first time she kisses you on the cheek.
>"You're too good for me, Nonny"
>HNNGGG
>Her anxiety improves significantly, even better than before.
>With a little prodding, you two spend a free afternoon tidying up your house.
>Krista's workplace productivity increases dramatically.
>Lot of salty coworkers though...
>Then things start getting more intense.
>She wants you to sleep in her bed with her now, and always wants to spoon.
>You spot her sniffing your underwear while you're doing laundry.
>During your monthly check in with BHST Krista and the doctor have some kind of hushed argument.
>She comes storming out, looking red faced and embarrassed, and sits you down right there for hugs nuzzles.
>You have a good idea what about.
>One evening while cooking dinner you realize there's a spice missing from the recipe.
>Go to the store alone to get a shaker of the stuff.
>Come back to Krista crying on the couch.
>She leaps out of her seat to glomp you into the wall.
>Hums a familiar tune while she's rubbing you're back.
>"My little human, my little human, aaaaaaahhhh~"
>Confound that children's cartoon.
>After dinner while preparing for bed, you see her standing just outside your room.
>"A-Anon, I'm going t-to take a shower, and I-I had a really bad day..."
>"Do you...want to m-maybe, join me?"
>No one could resist those pleasing eyes.
>She insists on washing your back for you, and holding you while you bathe.
>Licks across your neck and cheek while her hand trails downwards and touches your penis.
>Your erection is immediate, despite your best efforts.
>Warm, soft paws start to stroke you.
>"Good boy Anon...I know you can do it!"
>Anon lick across your neck that sends a shiver through your body.
>"You make me so happy, my little human. You're so soft and precious, I need to make you feel good too."
>You don't last long.
>So much for emotional distance.

halloween in /adhg/ settings
>humie guys/boys running around in costumes that make anthros act up
>some costume are intentionally lewd while others end up lewd unintentionally to certain species
>also all the couple's costumes they can wear with their waifur
>like little red riding hood outfits for wolves
>an excuse for certain species act out fantasies due to the spooky atmosphere
>some species like black cats, wolves, bats, and any that have ties to stuff like the occult, witchcraft, horror movies, etc get extra into the season
>colder weather which means humans want to cuddle up more

>anthro lawyer woman defends your honor and reputation in a court
>because of the nature of the case has to learn a lot about you, your background, and the content of your character
>finally wins out in the court case, but it’s had a side effect
>she’s completely fallen head over heels from your bio. From her perspective it’s like her favorite character from a storybook is her living, breathing client. Who also happens to be right next to her in the court room
>she was composed the whole time during the court case. But the moment you’ve been awarded your winnings she starts fidgeting a bit
>before you leave. She approaches you again
>Mister Ymous. I’m afraid upon review of your case. That I’ll have to press charges myself
>she sues you based on the mental damages of being unable to marry the man she was made to learn about in full as if she were married to him
>unfair payment charges, the claim was the money was not fair recompense for the cost of falling in love
>she fucking wins this court case too
>she’s to be awarded a fully legally binding marriage vow and certificate to you
>you ask her off the cuff after the case is closed that if she intended to marry you, what was the pint of paying her?
>”I put it to our new 401K9 (get it?) and to get you this!”
>she takes out a gold wedding band and places it on your ring finger
>she refuses to let go of your hand thereafter
>let decide which house we should stay in- after that we can work on filling the one we like more new little lawyers!”

>Later anthrostate timeline
>Society has cooled down and men's suffrage has made strides.
>Anthros no longer just pluck random men off the street.
>Most pairs are assignments or traditional dating.
"Yeah man I don't know. I delayed assignment because I'd rather find a girl the old fashioned way."
>"You want to date? I assume you would be swimming in girls if that were the case."
"no, I mean yeah, girls shoot their shot with me sometimes, I'm talking about the OLD fashioned way."
>"You mean like the decades after the troubles? Seriously?"
"Yeah. snatched up off a dark street corner by a big strong girl, the works."
>Later, via text
>"Hey man I was thinking about what you said. You weren't joking right?"
"Nope."
>"There's a girl I know that I think has been looking and might be into it. I guess I can't just send her your number or whatever. Are you really serious?"
"Tell her I'm going to see night of the long claws 3 on Friday at 10."
>"Isn't that the stupid borderline fetish werewolf flick where a dog girl turns into a werewolf and claims men? You are so cliche."
>Tell her she's 'not invited' If you catch my drift"

>Friday comes and you're nearly shivering with excitement.
>The teller gives you a weird look when you stutter out the name of the movie, she probably thinks you're a pervert or something.
>To be fair, if your impending wife wants you right there in the theater there's probably going to be a mess she doesn't want to clean.
>Sorry lady.
>You get your ticket and skip concessions to go straight to the theater.
>You snuck snacks in your pockets, naughty boy.
>Who would seriously pay four bucks for candy bar though?
>You enter from the back and take your seat in the middle and see the only other occupant in the theater, a large anthro sitting near the front of the theater.
>You cant make out the species but she's at least twice your size.
>Probably not a wolf, maybe a bear or a hippo?
>Is this her? How much of the movie are you going to sit through before she makes her move? Does she already know you're in here?
>The preshow advertisements aren't even done rolling and you're already vibrating with adrenaline.
>Will she take you then and there?
>Will she something or just claim you without a word?
>When will she bite you? Maybe before? After?
>You should have come prepared with medical gauze but hindsight is 2020
>The movie is just starting when you hear another patron shuffle into a seat in the row behind you.
>As you look back you realize that it would spoil some of the fun if you saw her too soon so you quickly look forwards again.
>In the short glimpse you saw in the dark it was another anthro. She was shorter than most, probably about your height and skinny.
>Shes going to ruin your moment, your new wife probably wont claim you right here if she has an audience.
>You grumble and sink into your seat.
>The movie plays and you're only half way into the movie.
>The anthro anti-hero has already claimed a lumberjack in the forest, but she had turned into a big werewolf at the time and forgotten her actions after turning back
>by the halfway point she had learned of her affliction and lost control again.
>now she is stalking a yuppie as he gets lost in the dark side streets of a city.
>He's literally you
>You're paying more attention to the girl sitting at the front of the theater.
>When will she make her move?
>Eventually the story wraps up with the dog girl getting caught but her victims refuse to testify and there is no case against them.
>They all give her saucy looks during their time on the witness stand.
>They've really ramped up the fetish since the first movie in the series.
>The director knows her audience, you guess.
>The credits start playing and the anthro stands up.
>This is it.
>Shes approaching.
>Your eyes have adjusted to the dark and you can see shes a huge moose.
>Easily three times your body weight.
>She walks right past you.
>What?
>She makes her way to the exit and leaves without even acknowledging you.
>You look around the theater and you are alone and confused.
>Will she take you on your way home?
>That would be so hot.
>Your excitement renewed, you leave the theater and begin walking home.
>Your instincts tell you to look over your shoulder but your refuse.
>You even make a detour through a dark alley.
>This is the perfect moment.
>You can't help yourself and look back.
>Empty. Seriously? maybe is a species that is really good at hiding.
>You get home unmolested, which unlike everyone else you think is a bad thing.
>As you lock the door to your apartment you fish you phone out of your pocket and call your friend.
>It rings several times and just before going to voice mail he picks up. "Dude, what?"
>He sounds very sleepy and unhappy.
"Nothing happened!"
>"You know people usually wake up their friends to tell them something important happened right?"
"Yeah well I went to the movies and nothing happened!"
>"What are you talking abou- oh right the girl. I don't know man, maybe shes stalking you or something."
"Well tell her to stalk... faster or something."
>"Ugh fuck you dude I'm going back to sleep."
>The line goes dead.
>He didn't mean it but you deserved it.
>The next morning you plot out a different course for your morning run.
>A long trail along the river walk until you get into a worse part of town.
>That's to tire you out.
>Then a path that cuts through some side streets that you think should be quiet.
>Finished by a run back through a nearby park that is well forested.
>The last two legs are probably the worst paths someone would take if he wanted to stay safe.
>You send it off to your friend. "My new route for morning runs at 6. Send it to her."
>You didn't expect much on your first day. Your buddy probably wont even be up to send it to her before you're done.
>A cat roller blades past you on the river walk.
>People still do that?
>Various other species are going up and down the walk at their own pace but pay you no mind.
>The side streets are quiet as you hoped.
>Too quiet being that you weren't getting snatched up by a giant wolf or bear.
>On the run back through the wooded tow path you see a greyhound sprinting towards you at full tilt.
>She seems to notice your sudden fear and gives an apologetic wave as she passes.
>She must be able to run four times your speed.
>Too bad she wasn't it.
>You get home knowing there was no time for your mysterious stalker to intercept you but you still feel let down.
>You check your phone to see two new messages from five minutes ago.
>"Alright it's sent."
>"Weirdo"
>Don't knock a man who appreciates a girl that can crush watermelons with any part of her body.
>You spend all day imagining various buff anthro ladies covered in red watermelon gore.
>Tiger arms.
>Wolf claws.
>Gator jaws.
>Collie thighs.
>The morning after you're on your run again.
>Roller blading cat: check
>A huge doberman walking next to her husband showing off a gnarly claiming scar while pushing a double stroller with two healthy pups: lucky.
>After passing the family you become aware of someone running behind you.
>By the cadence of the footsteps there's no way that's a human, shes charging right at you!
>Is this finally the moment?
>She's already upon you!
>A cheetah blows by like shes about to win a gold medal.
>Darn.
>You are an anxious, horny wreck waiting for a moment that could come any time.
>Side streets: still quiet.
>tow path: The greyhound passes you by again but this time instead of fear you only feel a minor sense of disappointment.
>You get home, still frustratingly unmolested.

>Be anon
>Be only human living in an apartment complex full anthros
>Due to sociopolitical reasons, this means your rent's cheap and you need to write a report once a month
>There's a certain detail you tend to leave out, though
>That detail is currently pinning you to the ground after bulldozing through your cracked door
>Ms Crowley is your neighbor and she tends to bake, leading to your recent weight gain
>So when she asked you to help her make a pie, you figured it was a harmless request
>She meant a creampie
>Not the kind that required a tin
>So, after practically breaking your hinges, shredding your slacks, and coating your face in slobber, she's getting exactly what she wanted
>Also, to her credit, she didn't spill the sugar you got for her
>But a very different kind of cookie is getting glazed at the current moment as she rides your dick like she just got out of prison
>You'd object, or file a report
>But the way her tits sway above your face is hypnotic
>Her ears being supremely petable, even when getting borderline raped, helps too
>You make the token attempt to push her off as you feel yourself getting close, but you've already been through this song and dance enough times
>Your hand are held above your head, and babbling adoration is mixed with a deep growl
>Her thighs squeeze more and, while you can't see it this time, you know her ass is flexing with every bit of muscle needed to wring you dry
>Which, thanks to your kegal exercises, is much more than a few months ago
>Once again stuffed, she pulls up her panties, fetches her cup of sugar, and walks out your door with an exaggerated sway in her step and a dotted line across the hall.
>Sure enough, she also took your pants again...
>You're sitting around playing tekken a couple hours later when you hear a knocking at your door
>It's her
>She's got pie!
>Actual pie this time!
>It's your favorite!
>It's fucking delicious!
>Also your pants have been patched up!
>with a tearaway seam in the crotch

>be human
>used to go to mixed species gym
>you'd get hassled every moment
>bigger species like cows and bears offering to check your form and spot you while you lift, just happen to grope you while 'helping out'
>equines, bunnies, and greyhounds try to show off while you're doing cardio and turn the treadmills to the max setting
>always get grabbed on the way to the shower for a wolf, dog, or coyote to huff your scent
>not to mention the creepers who 'accidentally' go into the wrong locker room while you're changing
>so now you go to a human only gym
>and try to ignore the anthros fogging up the windows as they stare from the sidewalk

"F-f-f-fuck."
>your teeth chatter out the curse into the icy night air
>you're so cold it hurts
>whatever skin of your face that you couldn't stuff under your jacket's collar stings
>your feet are numb from long marching in wet socks and damp boots
>your arms are drawn in from your sleeves to wrap around your chest
>and your teeth just keep chattering
"Fucking woods. F-fucking snow. F-f-fucking cold snap. F-f-freak weather. Ssshitty fucking c-c-car."
>snow crunches beneath your feet with every plodding step
>you want to go faster to get back to some kind of civilization
>but your last attempt at hurrying resulted in you tripping and tumbling into a snowbank
>your soaked clothes a reminder of your clumsiness
>you think you remember that being wet in the cold is really, really not good
>but you're not hiking all the way back to the campground to get changed
>you think you're closer to the ranger station than the campground at this point
>you have to be
>you've been walking so long
>must be at least an hour, from how tired you are
>so tired
>you grunt and shake your head, trying to stay focused
>so you do a little more ranting
"Brilliant f-f-fucking idea Anon. 'Don't worry about me. J-j-just gonna go it alone. Gonna try and f-f-find myself'. Stupid. Find myself frozen like a g-g-goddamn popsicle."
>you shiver
>not just from the cold, but the terrible thought
>what if you do freeze?
>out in the middle of nowhere in a national forest
>you grit your teeth and struggle to push the thought away
>the wind picks up, making the bare tree branches rattle
>lashing against you to strike at your determination
>your breath comes in shudders that stab cold deep in your lungs
>what if this is really it?
>you don't want to freeze to death
>then, carried over the wind, a sound that makes you freeze in your tracks
>a wolf's howl
>on second thought, freezing to death sounds better than being eaten
>it came from somewhere in front of you
>you stare deep into the darkness in front of you
>thankfully it's a full moon, and your visibility isn't awful
>you catch a twitch of movement behind a patch of evergreens to your right
>but maybe that's just the wind?
>you look closer, and closer
>oh shit!
>there it is!
>a glint of light you're sure are the eyes of a wolf waiting to spring out and eat you for dinner
>your heart hammers, forcing adrenaline to your sluggish limbs
"F-f-fucking wolf! Fuck off!"
>you make a break for it, cutting left and churning your legs hard through the thick snow
>you burst through a thicket of young trees, barely feeling their branches whipping against your face
>is it following you?
>you turn back to look, but can't see anything through the trees
>but when you turn back to watch where you're running, you slam into the trunk of a tall oak tree
>you bounce off it, and with your arms still wrapped up under your jacket, you fail to correct yourself
>whumf!
>you fall straight back into a pile of snow and lay there panting
>your body tells you to get up, keep moving or else
>but the adrenaline is wearing off quick now that your momentum's been brought to a halt
>you're just tired now
>too tired to bother standing back up
>need to take a breather for a few minutes and then you'll get to the ranger station
>there's that howling again
>it's much closer this time
>the image of your favorite t-shirt, one with three wolves howling at the moon comes to your mind
>and you laugh
>so fucking dumb
>you howl too
"Awoooooo!"
>then you descend into weak laughter as you shut your eyes to rest
>cool fucking shirt though
>it's warmer now
>that's a relief
>when you open your eyes, the moon is gone, replaced by a roof of wood slats
>did you make it to the ranger station after all?
>something about this space doesn't scream 'forest ranger station'
>could be the flickering of firelight that illuminates the space
>or the fact this is clearly a wooden hut
>maybe it's the strange bed you're lying on
>it's warm, lined with soft fur, but strangely shaped and firm on places
>your head is resting on a soft pillow of the same material
>overall it feels amazing, like you're wrapped in a hug made of pure warmth
>when you shift slightly, you find that metaphor more true than you know
>something wrapped around your waist is holding you down on the bed
>feels like more fur
>you blink in confusion, half-asleep mind taking its time to comprehend that you are in fact completely nude
>explains why you feel fur on your ass cheeks
>you try to move again, will your sore body to sit up
>"Hey. No."
>a husky feminine voice murmurs in your ear
>the grip around your waist tightens and tugs you back down
>so you pick your head up to look and see a pair of fur-covered arms hugging you
>terminating with paws that have wicked-long claws
>your thinking brain tells you this is really bad
>that you're laying on top of some kind of wendigo or werewolf that's going to turn you into long pork
>but your instincts say otherwise
>your instincts say that you're warm instead of cold
>that you're inside instead of out
>and that you're found instead of lost
>so you decide to trust your gut and let your head drop back down
"Sure thing. Not going anywhere."
>the voice doesn't respond
>now that you're more awake, you can feel it moving beneath you, chest rising and falling as it breaths
>you let it go on for several long breaths
>but you gotta figure some things out
"So hey, uh, where are we?"
>"We are in my home. I brought you here."
>well that seems pretty obvious
>at least her--it sounds like a she--home is warm
>on to the next question
"Alright. Guess it'd be worse if it wasn't your home, huh?"
>you chuckle in attempt to lighten the mood
>your living mattress makes a snuffing sound
>"It would be, yes."
>she sounds amused
"Right. Next question I guess. Who are you?"
>"I am Saoirse."
>Seer-sha?
>never heard a name like that before
"It's nice to meet you Seer-sha. My name is--"
>she interrupts you with your own name
>"Anon. I have heard you talk to yourself."
>oh
>you were being pretty loud last night
>she goes on, sounding amused
>"You have not stopped talking since the moment you arrived in my forest."
>she snuffs again
>how long has this thing been stalking you?
>"You sing very well."
>ah fuck
>she heard you belting power ballads to yourself when you thought you were alone
>even by the warmth of the fire and her body heat, you can feel yourself burning a little
"Thanks."
>whoever this is, she's been watching you for the last few days
>you decide to probe a little more
"So uh, Seer-sha, what exactly are you? No offense intended! Just, you're not a human right?"
>Saoirse shifts
>suddenly you're turned as she slides out from under you
>she deposits you on a bed of actual animal furs and straddles your waist
>your first good look at her is striking, as the lean, deadly looking wolf woman cranes her head to howl
>you recognize it as the same howl that followed you in the night
>you jaw hangs loose
>she's a vision of otherworldly beauty
>Saoirse lowers her head to look at you
>her eyes glow gold in the firelight
>"You are not scared? You fled from me in the night. You told me to fuck off."
>you did do that
>is she pissed about it?
>it's hard to read her expression because she has a wolf face
>a well-sculpted wolf face, with ears that twitch ever so slightly
"Uh..."
>smart
>use your words genius
"I thought you were going to eat me."
>not much better
>Saoirse snuffs again, and opens her mouth to pant
>you think that might be her laughing?
>"And now?"
>what do you say?
>that she's the most beautiful creature you've ever seen?
>or may just 'thanks for saving my life'?
>you blurt out the first coherent sentence
"Now I think you're the reason I'm out here."
>that was dumb
>fuck is that supposed to mean?
>Saoirse turns her head to the side in a canine show of confusion
>"What do you mean?"
>come up with a lie, quick!
"You're beautiful. Like nothing I've ever seen before. And you're my hero. If you hadn't found me out there, I'd have died alone and scared in the dark."
>that's not a lie
>that's more truth than you should ever admit to a woman you just met
>even if she's a wolf-woman who saved your life
>her golden eyes bore into you, seeming to drag even more out of you
"I came out here cause I'm sorta--I'm not doing great. At home. In my life. I wanted to do something new, come to the middle of nowhere to find myself, but shit..."
>you smile up at her

Had a weird idea for a prompt earlier:
>Because anthros are covered in fur, that's what they aren't too concerned about skin care. Stuff self regulates thanks to fur/ the oils it produces.
>But because humans don't have that, anthros focus heavily on their skin-- like, to the point that they will pressure their humie into shaving all but their head.
>It's soft, sensitive, and it's what they put their scent on, after all.
>They make sure it's very well taken care of because of how much they like it: special shampoo, lotions, and lots of sunblock, even when you probably don't need it.
>Guilty pleasure for many anthros is human pimple-popping videos; many a racoon and possum dreams of having a bf with acne they can pop.

>also expect it to be a dimly lit gothic dining hall
>instead it’s a well lit dining room. Sure the gothic architecture is still there but there are more modern features
>there is gore all over the table though, but it’s not from people
>it’s all fruit leftovers. Pineapples, mangoes, strawberries, apples, bananas, star fruit, kiwis, the variety seems endless
>and at the very end is the culprit of this fruity fratricide. A young bat woman with her hands- err... wing-paws up in surrender
>she’s partially wrapped up in what I can only accurately describe is a magenta cozy blankie. Mouth still partially full of the peach she was destroying
>seems the order was only half right
>she swallows her food, clearing her throat and pretending to be a civilized creature even though her greenish fur is stained with every color of her fruit rainbow
>”I uhh... I surrender? The village said nobody uses the castle anymore and that it was okay if I gave them the fruit I grow in my garden... I’m not going to be evicted am I?”
>she thinks I’m a cop
>I put away my weapon. She’s still looking at me with her giant bulb-like puppy eyes apologetically
“I’m not a property officer, miss. I’m not here to kick you out. I was sent by some... authorities- who had some information that there were some less... savory people here. My apologies”
>”well uhm. You came all this way thinking there would be trouble. You must be hungry from looking for bad guys. Do you wanna have some breakfas- I mean dinner? My day gets started at this time because the sun makes me sleepy instead of the dark.”
>she’s far too welcoming to strangers. But she’s right. I was under the impression my life would be in danger. That spends a lot of energy
>ultimately I take her up on her offer. Sitting by her and having a part in all the fruit she’s got at her table
>she eats like (pic related). It’s rather endearing. Even with her huge size.
Anthros are... larger than humanity.

>”*nom*... sho mishter, *lip smack* if you’re not a po-leesh- *sound of fruit crushing in her mouth as she closes her eyes and swallows*. Then why come to an old castle that has no use other than that it’s got some historical and structure value?”
>I don’t suppose I can tell her. Both because that might blow my cover and or just brand me as a crazy sicko
“Let’s just say I’m paid to keep places like these free of the unsavory. But because somebody is living here. I haven’t got anything to worry about. You might wanna start finding who actually owns this place and sort out some kind of deal with them though, I’m not the law- but I’d rather see you out of their gaze as well”
>before responding she jams a peeled orange into her mouth. No rind but the whole orb
>”itsh okie mishter. I’ve got da *smack smack* datsh sour...- *smack*- I got to talk to da county governer. He made a contragt *munch* to help me buy dish place. Thish castle is a fruit farm now too! The greenhoush *swallow*- conservatory thingy is where I grow the stuff that needs more heat and sunlight. I uhm... I make my own fertilizer, and the normal things I have a tractor for. I just need to repair the actual castle and maybe turn the east wing into a place to process stuff. I got an agricultural degree and this.. well it’s my dream project.”
“It’s an admirable dream to have. Well, I’d best be going. It’s been a pleasure. Perhaps I’ll come back to buy some of your first crop”
>”yeah! It was nice meeting you too! Please visit sometime soon. But please knock next time. The way you burst in was scary”
>with that. I left. I checked on the village first to confirm her story- can’t be too careful. And everything was fine. I left town and reported back to the order. A few weeks later though. A basket a fruit with a letter reached me, it was the bat girl.
>”dear mister with the funny hat. I don’t know when this letter will reach you. But I hope it’s in time. The fruit are my first big harvest to be sold. And I wanted you to honor your promise of trying them! P.S. it was really hard finding where you worked. I had to ask lots of people around town and even to the mayor. But I finally found you!”
>wait. She found me- as in she somehow managed to find the facade we use as a cover up and trace that back to me. We use at least three levels of disassociation.
Which means she both somehow squeezed out the place I “work” and the fact that I was even there at all. Most people a sworn to secrecy when a member of the order shows up
>better keep an eye on this girl
>which means it’s about time to pay her a visit, maybe get her off the paper trail that could lead to my *actual* profession

>Ikit will tie you down and use you as a guinea pig for new sex toys, occasionally stepping in herself to 'collect data'
>Queek will simply wrestle you to the ground and have her way with you whenever she feels like it (and then cuddle for a bit afterwards)

>Thanquol will threaten you with sorcery so that you 'willingly submit' to her, will ride you while gloating about how great she is, and then lose her balance, fall off and knock herself unconcious
>Sniktch will sneak into your room at night, bind and gag you, then wake you up with sex, will keep going until you pass out again, and when you wake in the morning there is no evidence that she was ever there beyond an incredibly sore pelvis

Ikit:toys and electrodes
Queek:total and utter domination, resistance will result in decapitation
Throt:Snu snu then vore
Sniktch:sudden surprise
Tretch:Rat on top while demanding you stroke her ego
Skrolk:endurance beyond belief, she will be on top for hours
Thanquol:Skarbrand accidently summoned. Run.

>phone app that's sort of like a dating/hook up app
>except there's 2 versions that are linked
>one for humans and other for anthros
>the human version has guys set up their profile/pic and after activating the account sets their location on their phone active
>the anthro version is basically just a map with active dots that are the humie guy's locations they can select and track
>essentially the human guys who set up an account for the app are consenting to be free use for any anthro that uses the app
>that at any moment an anthro using the app can stalk you wherever you go and grab you out of nowhere for some fun

>Get attacked by hostile tribal wolf anthros in the middle of winter
>Get saved by a different tribal wolfur and taken to her cave hideout to heal
>The hostile tribe attacked her tribe and she's been hiding from them ever since
>She tries feeding you raw meat, you have to tell her that humans can't digest that stuff without getting sick
>She refuses to start a fire in the cave due to smoke and possibly getting spotted by the hostile tribe
>It's winter so no berries or fruits to eat, all she has is a steady supply of fresh game
>Eventually she forces you to suckle from her wolf titties for sustenance, the only other option being you starving to death while under her care
>She isn't particularly well endowed, and the milk from a carnivore doesn't taste all that appetizing, but she manages to produce enough milk to keep you at a healthy weight
>It becomes a nightly ritual for you to help her gut and skin the game she brings in before retiring to a bed made of furs and drinking from her as she rests, a warm paw resting on your head and soft coos escaping her muzzle
>Eventually the hostile tribe has a power struggle in the spring and dissolves
>You and your wolfur venture out from her cave and decide to team up
>Find a new area to build a cozy cabin in with plenty of game and friendly neighbors
>You and her have plenty of food during the winter, but every now and then she gets nostalgic while in bed gently shoves your head to her breast, an expectant look in her eye

>Tfw you really enjoy lactation kink, but are so lactose intolerant that if a cow looked at you funny you would probably explode
And to add insult to injury I live in Wisconsin. The Laughing Cow is laughing at me, specifically.

>The Laughing Cow is not used to getting denied what she wants.
>To say that she took it badly when Anon denied her *simple* request, would be, an understatement.
>Not that she showed that, always the professional, she kept her composure.
>But anon would soon come to realise his mistake.
>Finding where he lived was trivial.
>Changing his targeted advertisements to those of milk and milk-related products,(from yours truly),was equally important.
>Next came the billboards,the free samples, the phone call questionares and advertisements.
>No cost to great to right this wrong.
>Sooner or later Anon will realise his mistake and come back.
>And she will happily accept him in her loving embrace.

>Silky smooth cat anthro has you for rehabilitation..
>Sits you in her lap and reclines
>Starts running her hands through your hair
>Sometimes switches to scratching your scalp lightly
>Asks you about your life.
>Your feelings and hardships.
>She doesn't get upset with anything you say, just listening and understanding.
>She even takes state criticism in stride.
>She starts to purr
>"I'm so sorry it's been hard on you Anon. It's going to be better now."

If you can get in, so can she, and much easier. Anthro women are extraordinarily persistent. Your best bet is to get on a plane.

>imagine she follows you across the globe
>you just spend two days on the new continent in some shitty small motel just to hear the pounding on your door.
>Barricading the door with furniture only buys you so much time before she crashes through.

>You'll be Ye Olde Anon, amateur alchemist
>Your first year of official learning will have started a week ago
>You'll remember being all too eager to leave your dull town and move into a dorm like a bigshot
>You will underestimate how cold those dorms got in winter, leading to the coldest night you'll ever deal with
>You'll realize that your teeth can make an audible clattering sound when your shivering reaches its worst
>With dread, you'll look and see that the sun is just then starting to set, and realize that it'll only get colder going forward
>In your hubris, you won't think to bring any additional bedding with you because surely such a prestigious place will provide you with some
>You wouldn't stop to think that the majority of students will be nonhumans, and that the majority of the nonhumans will be beastfolk
>As you try to bundle up under your sheets and cloaks, you will hear a voice from across the room
>You'll remember that you have a roommate, and that your shameful shivering will have been seen in its entirety
>The dire wolf, nearly twice your size, will watch with her head propped up in her hands, smirking
>You'll recall giving her the cold shoulder earlier, as your fondness for beastfolk will be negligible at best
>You won't say you hate them, but you definitely will not say you like them
>"So, Anon," she'll say in that same condescending tone, "Are you ready to throw your pride away?"
>You'll tell her to fuck off
>You'll assure her that you've got this under control
>You just have to make it through that night and you'll be set
>That's what you'll try to say, but the shivering will make it come out as a long stutter
>She'll coo again, and her tone will get even more smug
>"What's that? I don't think I can hear you well." she'll say, even going so far as to cup an ear in her hand for emphasis
>It takes longer, but eventually you manage to call her a bitch clearly and free of shiver-stutters
>If it has an effect, you won't be able to tell as her face will keep that same smug smile
>"Anon, I'm shocked. Here I am trying to help you and this is how you treat me?"
>You'll watch as she raises her cover, thick and likely stuffed with fluffy down, and flaps it in your direction
>A wave of warm air will pass over you as she brings it back down
>It'll be so warm and pleasant that you can't help but long for more
>But you won't
>You absolutely can not
>You'll sooner freeze than give the wolf what she wants
>Even if it would just be for one night
>Even if you will still go to the dorm and demand more sheets
>Even if your body is already moving over to her while you tell yourself otherwise
>By the time your mind catches up with your body, you'll be halfway in the process of climbing in
>All movement will stop as a pregnant pause fills the air
>She'll arch an eyebrow at you, and you'll retreat to the side of the bed
>To think that you'll have almost given in like that!
>It'll be so shameful
>Warmth will bloom on your shoulder as you find the source
>From the covers a large grey arm will have snaked out and a similarly sized clawed hand will rest just under your neck
>As much as you'll hate to admit it, it'll feel good
>"Anon, I really do want to help you out."
>The grip on your shoulder will tighten
>Suddenly the ground will start to get further away
>You'll yelp as you're dragged under the sheets
>"Which is why I'm not going to let the new humie catch pneumonia."
>A pair of strong arms will wrestle with you as you fight to get back out and reclaim your pride
>It'll become quickly apparent which one of you two is stronger as she manhandles you
>Eventually the cold and the struggle will wear you out, and your limbs will flop uselessly down
>"Atta boy. Finally giving up, eh?"
>You won't admit that you're too tired to move anymore
>With the last of your resistance bleeding out of you, the sudden all-encompassing warmth fills the space it leaves behind
>You STILL won't admit it, but having that much fur at your back will feel amazing
>Even though they're still jelly, the parts of you that can move will try and settle into a more comfortable position
>Which will be helped by some lupine arms dragging you bodily into her
>A sigh will escape your lips before you get the sense to stop yourself
>And, of course, that'll only prompt her to drag you in further
>You'll practically be wearing her as a cloak by the time she decides you're properly tucked in
>"See? This is much better than shivering under paper thin sheets, right?"
>You'll tell her to fuck off, but won't make any attempt to move
>You'll figure out your pride in the morning
>And as long as you don't admit it out loud, it won't count as a loss
>Right?
>"You know you've been narrating your thoughts out loud, right?"
>You will only now realize that
>Suddenly thoughts of every foul thing you've thought will flash through your head
>...tomorrow will be devoted to finding a way to tie a nose out of a bedsheet
>But...
>"Just shut up and enjoy it, Anon."
>You'll just shut up and enjoy the wolf molesting you
>And you'll hope that your erection is purely from the struggle earlier
>You'll decide, in your quietest external-thinking voice, that you'll try to figure out
>Suddenly losing your lifelong xenophobia will take some getting used to
>But that will be something for tomorrow-anon to deal with
>Current Anon is already finding his eyes getting heavy
>His mouth won't stop yawning
>And he (that is to say You) will ignore the hand creeping down your stomach
>The gentle murmurs of the wolf will be glossed over as you drift to sleep
>The gentle rhythm from your pelvis will fade into a nice background as you'll hear her say
>"Sweet dreams, Anon"

The idea of being a househusband for a big strong chubby anthro wife sounds so damn arousing
>Wakes up to cook breakfast for your big rhino wife
>Sees her walking into the kitchen as she hugs behind you and give you a lil cheeky kiss
>Watch her take big mouthful bites on the fried turkey and bacon with her big hands and finish off her meal with a big burp
>’God she is perfect’ as you thought
>She grabs you as she presses her whole mouth on to your mouth as you two trade licks to each other’s tongues as you feel the bits and flavor of her meal
>Saying goodbye as she puts on her skimpy (yet completely protected) armor and helmet
>See her come back home from a fight she got from the tribes that almost raided the town
>Tender her slash wounds as you heal it with alcohol as your big wife tries to ignore the burn
>Hear her talk about how she had gal-time with her co-workers
>And sleeping on top of her chubby belly as you rest your head between her big milk-tanks as you hear your big muscular anthro snore giving you comfort to sleep.

>”I used to be a warrior on the battle field”
>”I used to charge into the crowd as I slices off enemies’ heads and arms

>”I used to have abs that can shred cheese!”
>”I used to swoon humie men as I flex my muscles for them!”
>”And where am I now?”
>”FAT and sitting on this chair that can barely support my weight…”
>Yeah, that’s nice sweety, now can you tuck our children into bed now?

>Hearing a washed up drunked warrior wolf women telling a random human boy about her “glory days” where she poked a yeen’s eye just to save a Human Prince

>Get lost in the sea after a battle with the english navy
>Get picked up by a mysterious ship
>Wake up suddenly in what appears to be the captain quarters
>Find it weird nobody was there to check on me if i was a navy spy or rival pirate
>Open the door and get on the upper deck of the ship
>Suddenly several big tiddie chubby croc anthros surround me
>About to speak
>But what appears to be the captain of this vessel says
>"Say hello to our new bedmate"
>Oh fuck.jpg

>It's week 2 of having your cock confined to a cage
>tries to get hard but the walls of the cage pressing down just makes you go soft again
>you were mouthy a few times in week 1, then you started to beg to be let out, but after she didn't relent you've gotten sulky instead
>every time she sees you sulking she slaps your ass playfully and smiles at you
>"ready to apologize for your behavior yet?"
>"I... I already said I'm sorry..."
>"But you didn't mean it. I can see that look on your face. You're mad at me for locking you up. You need to really understand that this is for the best. When you thank me for locking you up, and you really mean it... maybe then I'll think about letting you out. In the meantime, go make me some tacos, would you? You know I like em extra spicy."
>"Good boy." She pats your ass as you leave.

>be you, anon
>on your phone watching furhub for purely innocent, legitimate late-night reasons
>because you're a lonely fuck
>so lonely, that when you're in the middle of watching "Lonely Office Bunny Meets Human Delivery Boy", you spot an ad that catches your attention

>big cow tits out
>and flashing 'fuck me' eyes at you

>"PLEASE"
>you tap it

>but nothing else happens
>you phone doesn't even burst into flames
>you shrug it off and go back to your completely legitimate night time internet viewing activities
>and then you're off to bed for work in the morning
>that next morning goes pretty normally
>shower, shave, brush teeth, then you're out the door
>wave hi to your hyena neighbor in the garden
>and her husband with the broken pelvis in his wheelchair on the porch
>then it's off to the bus stop
>you notice an elephant woman at the end of the street, staring at her phone
>looks a little lost
>you shrug it off and keep going
>bus ride is quiet, except for when the moose woman taking up extra chairs sitting next to you to strike up a conversation
>"Hey there hun! Where are you off to so early?"
>you cock your head at the sudden friendliness, but smile and explain that you're off to work
>"Oh, I see. Well, if you're looking for a little fun, call me when your shift is over."
>she pulls out a pen and paper, and scribbles her number out to give it to you
>you accept it with a smile, but as your stop arrives, you have no chance to continue the conversation
>she waves to you from the window and makes a 'call me' hand gesture
>when you get into your work, you're accosted by one of your co-workers
>a snow-leopard girl who was fond of teasing and tormenting you
>and not in the fun way
>"Wow Anon, I didn't realize what kind of guy you were."
>you have no idea what she's talking about
>"Haha! Oh yeah, sure you don't. Guess that's why you never talk about your love life, huh? Too embarrassed, loser?"
>you tell her to piss off and try to ignore the mocking laughter as you walk away
>but the rest of your day at work goes pretty well!
>no major issues come up, and you even get another girl's number!
>a perky giraffe who came in looking to buy something from another department, but honed in on you the moment she saw you
>she towers over you, but leans way, way over to meet your eye and smile
>"Oh hey! I didn't think I'd meet one here!"
>you think she means meet a human?
>though you don't know why, humans aren't THAT uncommon
>she giggles
>"Funny and cute! Oh my gosh if I didn't have a million things to do today I would so take you to lunch. You gonna be here tomorrow?"
>you are
>every day until Friday, as a matter of fact
>"That is perfect! Here, call me for lunch tomorrow. I can't wait!"
>she picks you up off the ground to smooch your cheek and continues on her way
>you're riding so high you're not even bothered by your co-workers snide mutterings and derisive sneers
>free lunch!

>and catch even more attention from a big anthro girl
>this one a seven foot flemish giant who catcalls you from a construction site across the road
>hang on, was that there this morning?
>"Hey there small fry! Looking like you could use some company!"
>this earns a chorus of agreement from the other large anthro women working on the site
>did you step into some weird 80s reverse stereotype for a moment
>not sure how you feel, you board the bus home uneasily
>and find it packed with massive anthro ladies
>they're all taking up two, three, and even four seats
>an elephant, not the same one as from this morning
>two rhinos
>a bear
>a Holstein cow that looks vaguely familiar
>and shoved in a corner seat, a tiny armadillo who seems just as put off as you feel
>all eyes are on you
>you clear your throat and take a spot standing near the door
>there are no seats open
>the bus groans with the combined weight of all its passengers as it rolls along
>"Is that him?"
>whispers one of the anthros
>"I think so! Check the picture, check the picture!"
>there's a tap on your shoulder
>the Holstein gives you a warm smile when you turn to look at her
>"You can sit on my lap if you like baby. I'm sure you're real tired."
>before you can say 'I'm fine, thanks', she takes your arm to gently but firmly pull you across the aisle and into her lap
>"There you go!"
>the elephant next to her trumpets indignantly
>"He didn't even answer yet! Maybe he wanted to sit on my lap!"
>the Holstein snorts and hugs you tighter, pressing her breasts against your shoulders
>hang on a minute
>the two women go on arguing as vague memory coalesces
>this is the cow from that internet ad last night
>"You're not big enough for him you hussy!"
>the elephant takes your arm
>"You don't want this dainty little half-pint, do you?"
>the bus hisses to a stop, and your salvation comes
>you inform the cow and the elephant that this is your stop and you need to get off
>the cow lets you go
>but to your horror, you find all the other passengers
>save the armadillo
>have followed you off the bus
>and they shadow your steps as you walk down the street to your home
>you whirl about to point an accusing finger and ask what the hell is going on
>they all stare back at you
>one of the rhino speaks up
>"You're Anon, aren't you? From the Growl-XL app?”
>what
>she's talking about that ad on furhub?
>the ladies all groan in disappointment
>from their grumblings, this seems to be a common occurrence
>the bear steps forward and continues explaining
>"It's hard for ladies our size to find partners. They started putting out these predatory ads cause the app was doing so poorly."
>oh
>well that's a shame, you thought the big ladies you met during the day were pretty sweet
>immediately the mood of the mob raises, all of them looking hopeful
>you'd been pretty lonely yourself lately, so you could understand their feelings of wanting to make that connection
>so while you're not entirely happy about this random internet ad painting a target on your back
>you're willing to give it a try
>that was the wrong thing to say
>as you're suddenly surrounded and overwhelmed
>a hug from behind
>a kiss made awkward by a long horn
>a trunk going for your rapidly tenting pants
>your expression of shock is lost in the jumble as you're hoisted off the ground and carried down the street to your home
>looks like it's gonna be a long night
>at least it won't be a lonely one

>Anon stuck in the elevator with the silent cat who works in the same office
>She's on her phone, not paying him any mind
>Meanwhile his phone is constantly going off
>She looks at him
>He looks at her
>The notifications stop
>She maintains eye-contact as her free hand drifts down to her skirt's hem
>She pulls it outward, and her phone goes between her legs
>You think she's taking a picture, but suddenly you're getting a video call
>You KNOW you shouldn't, but she's still staring at you
>So you take out your phone and scroll past the dozen-or-so new pictures to add to your unwanted collection
>You watch as you're treated to a blatant upskirt shot of the cat in front of you
>Her expression hasn't changed but you've learned two things
>The first is that she's not wearing any panties
>The second is that she's VERY happy to see you
>Eventually she reaches her stop, and gets off without saying a word
>A second later you receive an email
>From xXBlack_CatastropheXx@Wordaddress.com

>You watch as they all start typing as one
>You get twelve new notifications from ten new emails

>It's mustelid heat season

>try to keep at least one other guy, or at least a non-ferret, with you at all times
>plan goes well until the end of the day, when you're walking to your car in the parking lot
>you thought you got off scot free
>but it turns out they know which car is yours
>and so you never made it home

>Baptisms are always done from between the thighs of an anthro.
>For humans, this means that they must eat out the Mother of a church, or one of her Sisters, so she may gage his faith and anoint him.
>For anthros, they must find a baptized and unmarried man and reperform his baptism without allowing her legs to buckle.
>However due to divine orders to not waste seed, unmarried men are often in short supply so it is often the Husband of the Omnifur that is the man who is rebaptized.

>no secret relationship with your college professor where you fuck her to keep your flagging grades up because the other teachers are trying to flunk you to force you to fall back into prostitution.

>She knows how desperate you are qnd forces yout o indulge ALL of her fetishes.

>He's the only human in a school of 6-7 foot anthros
>Plenty of packs and cliques that do their own thing, but the cats and dogs are always at each others' throats.
>The dogs are always barking and getting aggressive around the cats, while the felines enjoy spreading catty rumors and shit talking.
>Your arrival shakes things up for the worse.
>See, cats love humans because they're the friendly, outgoing type that they love to dote on.
>The dogs meanwhile are satisfied by the way you seem to fulfill all of their protective instincts.
>Both think your 5'6" ass is adorable, and heat season is right around the corner...
>You cannot escape Anon. They're all going to dress you up in dog/cat themed clothes and takes turns snuggling you during lunch.
>Which will it be? Aggressive and dommy tigers and lions, or mommy type canines who want to protect from those big, mean rat chases?
Also secret option three: a bunch of Vidya playing rodent girls who'll simp for and fight over who gets to sit next to you.
Be warned, they're freaky as hell in the sack.

>Be big tiger mom
>Have the strong maternal urge to groom your kittens (even the stripeless ones) with your tongue
>But you can't do it to your human kittens, your tongue is simply too rough on their delicate furless skin
>Hell, your husband can barely withstand a few licks before needing a band aid
>So you have to sit and stare in envy as other anthro moms groom their babes with softer tongues

>anon was fed the state coolaid all his life, is a fairly happy husband coming second to his wife
>she quickly rises in the ranks of government
>eventually this means he becomes the anthrostate equivalent of "first lady" seen in many western governments
>all of his words and actions in public are nitpicked by talking heads and terminally online social media users.
>does he wear this pin that supports this social issue or not?

>The day your disbelief broke down and you accepted what was in your favorite food.
>The extra spices, the extra fries added to make a heaping mound, the slightly better than average patty on a good burger.
>All things you commented on liking and suddenly started getting more off.
>Each tainted in some certain way, what you'd thought was fresh globs of oil on your fries, the added softness of the bun, and increased moisture of the burger.
>Each leaving a minor cloying aftertaste, a taste you had enjoyed.
>It explains why she had tried so hard to hide anxiety, and later her grin, when you mentioned the taste and how you liked it.

>You skipped a day, you had to.
>The other burger place you went to, one that was decently rated, was... lacking.
>There seemed to be too few fries that had sat in the warming tray too long and served a bit too cold.
>The burger with it's stiff, three-day old bun and overcooked patty and a tomato that was little more than a bag of water, the pickles were no better.
>No crunch and no taste.
>You'd left with the taste of disappointment and char on you tongue.

>Another day and another place.
>Slightly better, but still so many flaws and at a higher cost than what you'd gotten two days ago.
>There was no char, but an unfamiliar film of grease is in your mouth.
>You don't like it, nor do you like the stony feel in your gut.
>You'd gone back to your regular shop.
>The moment she saw you, her ears perked up.
>She was curious where you'd been, you made some excuses about family and being late.
>You'd made the mistake of making eye-contact by accident.
>She saw through your excuses, and she knew that you knew she did.
>The reddening of your face was the final nail in the coffin for her learning exactly what you'd figured out, as shown by her widening grin.
>Lowly, she asked if you wanted extra 'sauce' on your usual.
>She was satisfied with your slight nod.
>Even gave it to you on the house.
>It was exactly what you were craving.

>dragon wife calls you the crown jewel of her hoard
>she likes laying on you and holding you, wrapping her wings around you both
>smothering your head between her massive breasts until you think you’ll pass out
>if you think about leaving cave without her permission she’ll breathe fire at you that only burns your clothes, leaving you unharmed and naked
>she likes bringing you along to watch her pillage villages to expand her hoard
>she also knows you like seeing the same creature that holds you as gently as she can, rip, tear and burn her way through buildings and people
>and afterwards she enjoys celebratory victory sex
>in the air

>keeps you in her office all day
>Has you do all her odd jobs, bring her coffee, generally orders you around
>Has you under her desk so she can get her pussy worshiped while she works
>Has a couch in her office which she ruts you on whenever she feels like it

>her work productivity goes actually goes up a noticeable amount
>higher ups take note and wonder if it can be applied office wide
>hiring humie guys to help with "work productivity/morale"
>other businesses/offices also notice and start doing the same
>the largest increase in worker morale/productivity was seen in jobs that generate high stress like fast food workers, construction, teachers, doctors/nurses, military, etc
>having special rooms where humie guys are waiting to be used to relieve stress from anthro women through sex and cuddling

>working regular job at an office
>anthro employees keep mistaking you for a 'productivity assistant'
>you keep getting grabbed and cuddled when you're trying to get work done
>security keeps trying to escort you to one of the quiet rooms
>you just want to work a normal job like a normal person

I actually just had an idea that was also about an office anthro.
>Big-shot executive fox keeps you as a desk toy on her excessively large desk.
>You sit on a small seat where you sit on your knees, blindfolded and arms locked behind your back, and with a pedestal to display your crotch for her to toy with.
>An elongated bowl placed between your knees and calves to catch any precum drippings or shots of cream.
>Sometimes she ignores you, other times she works you up and suddenly stops just to watch you twitch and hear you groan.
>Some days she gets bored and just bats your shaft around to watch it bounce and spring back.
>The most notable times are when mating seasons start beginning, then your job flickers between sating her heat so that she can get her work done, kneeling between her thighs and either devouring her slit or being told just to sniff, and being a distraction for any other business women who come to her.
>As it would turn out, having a blindfolded man with a precum leaking dick makes an anthro in heat agreeable to some rather lopsided deals, especially when he's offered up to her.

>Father's day, it's a special day for honoring, and making, fathers that takes place about a week after the start of mating season for most of the anthros in the area.
>Sperm boosting drugs and foods are freely handed out and bondage tools and structures are set up for general use.
>Ice packs and pillows are also offered to try and ease and mitigate bruising.
>It's traditional for men to wear their oldest and most worn down clothing as it's probably going to get ripped off them.
>In some towns official 'Breeding runs' take place, these are events where several nude men are set up in a line before a line of anthro participants and told to run with a 30 second to a minute headstart, the man who gets the furthest wins bragging rights.
>The event ends once all men have been caught, there is no finish line.
>Certain towns have unorganized Breeding runs, but they're very similar in nature.

>Your muscles strain against your wife's intricate ropework.
>Thursday was movie night, a favorite for both of you.
>She came home and unwound by telling you about her day.
>At the same time winding you in intricate shibari.
>You squirm just enough to get her attention.
>Gagged or not, interrupting the movie with a grunt was against the rules.
>"Is something wrong sweetheart? Are you cold?"
>The powerful arm that was draped across you brought a hand up to your face, and you nodded into it.
>"You poor furless thing. I'll throw a blanket over us."
>Thursdays are the best.

>humans being cute and non-threatening to anthros often set off their nurturing instincts
>as it turns out, having something to hold and cherish can be beneficial to anthros suffering from a number of mental disorders.

>Be Lilly the Fox
>Be making small talk with your coworker Lisa.
>Conversation meanders aimlessly for a bit before you manage to steer it towards a topic you feel you really need to talk about with someone.
>"So...you have a chance to meet the new office human yet? His name's Kyle."
>Your coworker Lisa takes a sip of her coffee and shrugs. "Uh, yeah. Was feeling kinda shitty after today's conference, so I thought I'd go destress. Wanted to get some snuggles in, you know?"
>She grimaces and looks away from you.
>"Does he seem ahhh..."
>Lisa coughs
>You speak up to fill the gap.
>"He's not quite as good as Anon was, is he?"
>Your wolf buddy heaves a heavy, frustrated sign and slouches.
>"Right?! God, this new guy just feels so...so corporate, you know?"
>She starts counting a list of complaints off on her fingers, one by one.
>"Yeah, he's even shorter than Anon, which is cute I guess, but it's like he just parrots HR!"
>"Exactly" You chime in, venting your own frustration. "Anon was a pure little snowflake, but this guy feels like he's totally faking it! Just kind of a glorified cheerleader."
>Lisa grits her teeth angrily, pulls some non-dairy creamer from the shelf over the coffee maker, and closes it just a little too harshly.
>You can feel yourself getting emotional, despite yourself.
>"First time I went to see Kyle they had him dressed up in a bunch of company merch. Beanie, t-shirt, freaking KHAKIS. Who wants to cuddle someone wearing khakis?! I couldn't just want in, either. There was no one else around, and they still made me go into the system to book an appointment with him."
>"Anon took walk-ins..." You grumble to yourself.
>There's a long silence between you two.
>The bags under Lisa's eyes make her look even worse than you.
>At this point you'd trade all of your vacation days for just 15 minutes of ear scritches
>"Do you think...maybe Krista would be willing to share Anon again? Just for today?" She covers her face with her hands and sighs.

>Fucking Krista
>Shows up 2 months ago, screws up left and right, and they let her have a whole human to herself.
>He's really cute, too.
>Especially when he wears those sweatshirts with sleeves twice as long as his arms.
>Someone in management is totally playing favorites.
>"The worst part is he's done wonders for her," Lisa says, as if reading your mind. "Remember Janna's old position? Heard they're gonna promote Krista and put her and Anon in the senior Dev's corner office."
>Your eyes go wide and your ears go stiff.
>"Okay, at first I was jealous. Now I'm jealous AND kinda pissed off." You pinch the bridge of your nose. "It's gotta be favoritism. They TOTALLY just want to have Anon nearby."
>Lisa shakes her head, dejected. "Remember that botched contract with the DoD? Krista pulled an all nighter and fixed it herself, code was flawless. Found her and Anon like this in the morning."
>She pulls out her phone and shows you a photo of the Cheetah and Anon, who's wearing some seriously adorable jammies, out cold and spooning on the bean bag chair in her cubicle.
>All you can do is groan.
>You look up at Lisa, who's sporting a shot eating grin.
>"Haven't spotted it, have you?"
>"Haven't spotted wha-?"
>That's when you see it.
>No way. It can't be real.
>Not your pure, virginal Anon.
>"This is fake!" You spout, thrusting Lisa's phone back into her face.
>"He doesn't even have a mane yet! I refuse to believe Anon's dick could be that big."

Your finger hovers over the download button. Three months., it had been three months since you finally settled in after college, working at some sleepy town’s Starbucks making minimum wage, barely covering your rent. Serves you right for getting a degree in anthropology. You sigh, muster up your humility and push the download button. After a few seconds, a prompt appears on your phone. “Tailwag has finished downloading. Open?”. With less hesitancy than before, you open the anthro centered dating app and start filling out your profile. Name? Anon Y. Mous. Location? Nowhere, USA. Looking for? You stop. In the three months you’ve remained in your sleepy college town, not a single girl bothered showing interest in you. The barista mandated baseball cap and apron did little to help that, but you figured you served an average of 5 cute anthros a day, of all shapes and sizes. A few even reciprocated your patented gentle smile as you handed them their cups of hot liquid sugar, but none bothered to go any further. Except that one short disheveled rabbit, but we don’t talk about that incident. You put down “no preference” and keep going. You use a picture taken by one of your coworkers at a mandatory social event outside of work. It’s a picture of you at your boss’ house, all your attention focused on his cat which has settled comfortably in your lap. It’s one of the rare images you have of yourself on hand, and the only one where you look happy. The registration process finished. You swipe through the first few recommendations before realizing this app’s selection was absolute garbage. Nothing but the obese, single mothers, and yeens. Usually all three. In frustration you exit the app and spend the last of your night idly swapping between forums and videos before sleep overtakes you.
For once, you wake up early. It gives you time to fuck around on your phone before you actually have to get ready for work. You open the lock screen and are surprised to see you’ve gotten five messages. Your heart picks up as you open Tailwag and navigate to your messages. Unfortunately, they all seem to be scam bots. “Hello! Human boy! Need a sugar mommy? Just click this link and donate to my OnlyFurs!” They all contain some obvious scam link. That is, except for one.
“What’s a cutie like you doing in a town like this?”
It was sent almost right after you went to sleep. Jaded by the other messages, you decide to test the waters. No sense wasting your time on yet another phishing attempt.
“What’s a scambot like you doing in my DMs like this?”
Surprisingly, you get a reply almost immediately. They must be up early too.
“I’m flattered you think I’m a bot, but I’m as real as you are, assuming you aren’t one either. Want me to prove it?”
You smirk and try to think of something a scammer wouldn’t have on hand. Immediately asking for ‘tits or btfo” wasn’t your style to begin with, and any prospective scammer would undoubtedly have ‘something on hand for that situation.
“I take it you’re still in bed, right? Go ahead and send me a selfie of you wearing your pillow like a hat.”
Your eyes widen as you get an image reply. While the massive pillow covers most of her face, the clear white snout of a goat woman smirks knowingly at the camera. Her horns prop up the edges of the pillow, making it look like she’s wearing a wide brimmed burka. Even with her eyes obscured, you can tell she finds this hilarious.
“Cute. Now I wonder what I should request from you. . .”
“The same kind of picture?” You suggest.
“No fun. How about one replicating your profile picture? You can use your on pillow in lieu of a cat, assuming that one isn’t yours.”

"Death!"
>you cry out, sweeping your ax at the armored figure of the ferret woman
>she brings up her shield, painted white and emblazoned with a black cross to represent her order, to catch the blow
>and counters with a swipe from her sword that sings through the air
>you jump back, out of her reach, and ready for another strike
>she presses the attack, trying to get within the reach of your weapon
>the ferret may have proper armor and weaponry, but you have the advantage in height and reach
>you swing low as she steps in, and manage to catch her thigh
>the ax doesn’t bite, however, merely glancing of her skirt of mail and staggering her
>it’s enough to keep her off balance
>so you throw your weight, turning to bowl her over with a shoulder tackle
>the Teuton goes down heavy, armor raising a clatter when she hits the ground
>you bring your ax up high
>but all it hits is dirt, as the knight rolls away from the deadly strike with unnerving speed
>you growl in frustration and pry your weapon from the dirt, losing the advantage
>she’s taken her feet again
>you can see her chest heaving from the exertion
>even though you’ve been fighting, it seems to be affecting her more than you expected
>you’re still breathing evenly, if a bit heavily
>while she's gasping with every breath
>she keeps her distance and starts to circle
>”Verdammter mensch. Gott gibt mir kraft.”
>you hear her muttering in her own tongue, but can’t understand a word of it
>she calls out when you take a step forward
>”You can still yield. Drop your weapon. Repent.”
>you sneer
>repent?
>this is nothing to do with faith
>her god, or your gods
>no
“Invader!”
>you snarl the word
“I will send you home in pieces!”
>you charge, ax held high
>you put all your might into the swing, counting on her exhaustion to slow her down
>but she’s not as tired as she seems, the shield comes up in a snap to catch the blow
>instead of bouncing off, the head of the ax buries deep into the hardwood shield and sticks
>if the force of the blow hadn’t thrown the ferret off-balance again, she would have skewered you with the retaliatory stab she threw out
>luckily it’s ill-aimed, cutting through your shirt but only imparting a shallow cut that stings and bleeds
>but not enough to impede you
>you release the handle of the now-useless weapon and go to grapple with the knight
>first snatching her wrist to pull yourself within her guard
>then the hem of her tabard, heaving with all your might to bear her to the ground
>you struggle with the knight, keeping her sword arm pinned with your weight
>she releases the blade and ruined shield
>and wretched ferret she is, writhes in your grip, wriggling free in an instant
>you try to hold her still, reaching for her throat, her wrist, anything to pin her down
>but she flows like water around you, the weight of her armor only serving as a counter to your advantage in bulk
>you quickly find your positions reversed, one arm pinned to the ground, the other forced out to the side at an awkward angle, with the knight on top of you
>she’s still breathing heavily, gasping and shivering
>you wrench against her
>you fall on your back, and she repositions to grab both your wrists
>and straddle your chest
>you kick your legs futilely
>glaring wild-eyed up at the crusader that will surely kill you
>there’s something strange about her expression though
>”Gott bitte, nicht jetzt.”
>her nose works furiously as she leans in closer
>she bares her fangs at you in something between a snarl and a groan
>”Repent! Accept the Lord’s mercy, human!”
>you shake your head
“Leave my homeland! Invader!”
>the knight groans again
>and you notice her weight shifting back and forth on top of you
>picking your head up, you see her rocking her hips forward and back with every groaning breath
>is she wounded?
>you see no blood
>the knight releases one of your wrists and grabs your hair in a fist
>then slams your head down hard against the ground
>”Repent! Renounce your gods human! I need this.”
>you are further confused by her words
>what does she need?
>you use your free hand to try and grab at her arm to free your head
“What–”
>she responds by yanking up, then smashing your head against the hard-packed dirt again
>”Quiet! Just say it! You have to say it!”
>the paws move again
>in an instant they’ve seized your throat
>squeezing
>crushing your breath
>the cold iron of her gauntlets stinging your flesh
>you grasp her wrists and make a struggle at prying free
>your legs kick harder
>to no avail
>the Teuton crushes down on you, squeezing harder and harder
>all the while rocking her hips and groaning desperately
>her fangs bared in a grimace of some unseen torment
>you can feel your struggles getting weaker
>failing to draw in breath, the world starts to swim and darken
>is this it?
>dying along in the dirt, strangled by a mad ferret?
>you don’t want to die
“P–Plea–”
>is all you manage to gasp out at first
>the iron grip around your neck slackens, just enough for you to take a thin breath
>”Say it!”
>you cough weakly
“Please…I r-r-repent. Can’t breathe.”
>the ferret releases your through with a gasp, leaning back to sit on your belly
>"Gott sei dank!"
>she starts pulling her gauntlets off, then her belt
>what is she doing?
>next goes the white tabard, she takes a frantic pace to try and disrobe
>you're baffled by her haste to disrobe and doff her armor
>she pauses, looking down at you with the same strange expression as before
>bright blue eyes wide
>then she falls on top of you, hands on either side of your head to take a deep sniff at the crease of your neck
>her whole body shakes
>the incessant rocking of her body becomes a deep thrust against you
>"Gut. Gut."
>she hisses
>"You stay there, barbar. Do not move. You have submitted, now I must satisfy my..."
>the ferret shivers again
>"...my brunst."
>it is clear now what she means
>and what she needs
>you have only been spared because the spring has come
>and she is in heat
>you are shaken from your thoughts by the feeling of cold steel against your neck
>the knight has retrieved her sword, menacing you with the blade
>"Do not try anything, barbar. You are mine now."
>she lifts the blade and slams it down, piercing through your tunic close to your shoulder and pinning you to the ground
>she stands off you, and starts to undo her breeches
>when she finishes, she kicks them aside, leaving her in her hauberk and nothing else
>the skirt of it hides her nethers, but you see her fur soaked down her thighs
>the knight drops down on you again, this time on your chest
>she grabs your hair again, just as harsh, and drags herself forward
>"Haaaah. Komm zu mir, mein Preis."
>you don't understand her words
>but you know well what she expects of you when she lifts the skirt of her hauberk and slides her weight forward to smother your face between her furry thighs
>she drops down with no time for you to prepare
>"Go! Eat!"
>the ferret commands, yanking your hair upward while grinding her cunt against your mouth with the force of desperation
>"I can still--Gott in Himmel--still kill you barbar!"
>you submit to her orders shamefully
>her slit constantly leaks onto your face and tongue, her musk fills your senses
>you lick and explore her, at first hesitantly
>then with more ardor when she yanks hard and hisses at you
>"Harder! Faster!"
>her thighs squeeze around your face and she presses the full weight of her body down against your probing tongue
>it does not take long to bring her to her first shivering climax
>she moans without shame and gushes into your mouth
>you cannot see
>but your other senses are occupied by the ferret
>the taste of her orgasm that spatters over your face
>the smell of her musk taken in through shallow breaths
>the feel of her heat and weight smothering you
>she goes on moaning and grinding down on you
>giving you no respite
>she only slowed slightly after her first climax, her grip on your hair loosening for just a moment
>but she tightens it again as she resumes using you
>"We are not done barbar. Not nearly."
>the knight rides your face for what feels like an eternity
>your jaw aches from the constant effort of slaking her lust
>any urge to resist long since suffocated in a constant barrage of abuse
>the sixth
>or seventh?
>flood of squirt fills your mouth and you swallow it down
>there seems no end to her stamina
>but this time she is merciful and leans her weight back off your head
>your eyes sting from the daylight after so long in the dark
>the knight looks down at you contemptuously and thrusts your head back into the divot she's made with it
>you take long, greedy gulps of fresh air
>but the smell and taste of her lingers
>her own chest heaves as she speaks
>"That is enough...for now. You are mine now, barbar."
>she rolls off you to one side and stands
>the sword pinning you down in yanked free from the earth
>"Get up. You are coming with me."
>you stare up at the sky
>just a little while to catch your breath
>you hear the Teuton scoff and step to one side
>then groan in pain as she presses a clawed footpaw against your long-ignored hard-on
>"Up! We must go to the priester to sanctify the union. I am your mistress now, and you will not defy me."
>she presses harder and you squirm desperately to escape the pain
>the knight kicks you away and you slowly stand
>"Collect my things, knechten. Do not waste time."
>your voice is ragged, entire body sore and wound stinging as you hasten to follow orders
"Y-yes mistress."
>you fall in line behind her
>the ferret laughs
>"Gott ist Gut."

Scent and scent marking doesn't get as much play as it should with stories. It can be used for a lot drama or story beats.

ive been getting a lot of requets for goat teacher lady quite a bit. and i agree i need to do a goat story some time soon. im actually thinking of 1 of 2 story possibilities with her/someone related to her. because doing her story feels a bit too samey- HOWEVER, theres a great narrative idea for her as well. ill pitch them both to you guys and see what you like better. both of them are still gonna project into what i think of when i consider a goat-lady anthro
>fist one is the teacher herself. who while doing her dream job of educating (indoctrinating) the next generation in her "history" classes. shes also fawning over and more likely than not sexually harassing the science teacher at her workplace. using every tool in her bag of tricks to skate by unpunished.
or one with the teacher characters niece, similar situation
>mischievous goat woman in the office using her guile and lying through her teeth or monopolize her coworkers time to get what she wants. what she wants being as much pleasures of the flesh as she can squeeze out of him. sneaking this poor guy who just wants to climb the corporate ladder but instead being taken into the bathroom, or utility closet to do god knows what- and he cant really say no considering she's already blackmailed him or manipulated him in some way to get what she wants
the format of what i want out of the goats as a species it kinda like pic related. https://desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1667/85/1667851619795.jpg their eyes oozing a sexual deviance. goats as far as im concerned represent the most perverse in the anthro's. even though theyre the eyes of a prey species they emanate a malicious affection for whomever their victim is. and i think i'll do the most perverse stuff using them as the more or less super jew of the anthro world, to use /pol/ terms, rotten and deviant to the very core. but still having an albeit sick love for mankind

>he doesn’t ask for much, must have a large grain silo or something
>word gets out however that a petty war that he’s involved in has broken out. And with the soldiers away. The bandits come out to play
>for awhile you and your village are left alone to fend for itself
>the garrisons left over weapons were enough for awhile but eventually the bandits kept on escalating
>eventually it was too much and the village was about to be overrun
>that is until the knights came
>they must’ve seen the pillars of smoke from a couple of the thatched roofs burning, because they cut down the bandits as quickly and unexpectedly as they came
>A knightess. An equine woman after the battle was done stepped forward among the roaming cavalry
>”rejoice! Though art under our protection now. And in exchange for our path to protect your lands. We merely wish for you to instead tithe your grain to us... as well as one other thing
>she with her armored hand... hoof? Beckoned you over
>”able bodied men such as he no younger than the age of squire-hood and no older than knightly eligibility! We shall bring him with us as your first tithe of the year. If you have no more men of this age range then we will accept a percent more of grain in his stead until another man comes of age”
>she swishes her hoof at you once more
>”retrieve your clothing from your home and all you can pack lightly, you shall come with us within the hour”
>something about her was off. She seemed to garner a satisfaction, and one beyond her knightly musings. Maybe you were simply unsettled that she picked you out from the crowd like that after a traumatic battle
>after a day and a half’s travel you make it to the keep and it’s territory
>your quarters were obviously above the station you thought would be given. As in you don’t live in a house outside the keep
>instead for some reason you’ve been led to and placed in a living space within the keep itself. A lavish one at that.
>Pillows and silks and furniture deck the room
>suddenly after you spend time washing up with a bowl of water somebody enters the room. And you peer to see who it is
>it’s the equine knightess
>”oh! My prize is already here”
>prize? What prize?
>”help me take off my armor- young man. I cannot remove all of it myself”
>seeing no reason not to oblige- you help her dismantle the armor from her undercoat
>her breasts were massive and heaving- even with the armors make adjusting to be more rounded and fitting at the top- it was clear that it was squeezing down on her mammaries
>her hips were no different. The armor at least could be made more to fit down there given it was a skirt-of-plates
>you could stick your head into the thigh armor carapace even when it was closed shut to be around her thighs. And she had special accoutrements for her digitigrade hoofs
>this whole thing feels highly inappropriate. Now you *know* something is up
>”now, my boy- why don’t you have a seat while I wash myself a moment. I hope you saved some water for me”
>you try to make yourself comfortable while grasping at the dark for what is “sitting properly”
>she returns, and with yet more requests to make of you
>”please, rest on the bed for me”
>swallowing your tongue you obey. Laying down on the linens and cushiony mattress of this bed- which as far as you are concerned is nothing like the sleeping cot you made for yourself out of cheap fabric, wood rods and straw
>”I shall enjoy this eventing thoroughly, now that my handsome little tithe is here”
>she begins undressing you, but you guard yourself and protest.
>with a slow and methodical pushing away of your hands that rushed to your defense. She leaned in and started whispering
>”I thought it would be obvious by now- you’re not going to be a farmer any longer. Nay- thou shalt be my consort. and soon many of your fold from your village will be all ours to enjoy. Lady Irene is next for her tithe of a fresh- and handsome man. I’m glad I took the opportunity to pick you, though. Now come here oh lover mine~... stop struggling”
>she effortlessly keeps your arms off you. Allowing her undercoat to fall free and expose those breasts that could nurse quadruplets
>had these been different circumstances, and your bodily autonomy not violated- you probably would have offered a girl like her a flower back home
>but this was clearly not home to you
>more of a cage now that this looming horse was over you. Now spreading your legs apart after removing your trousers. Along with her own
>”I’d promise to be gentle, if I had more control. But for the moment...”
>she heat of her sex is immense, and your body cannot help but begin to respond to the stimulation
>”*bray...* for the moment I have no such control... prepare yourself handsome...”
>the lips of her somehow- by your judgement muscular equine pussy almost was too hard to push in. Even with her legs that could crush skulls bearing down on you
>with a gasp and a forceful drop. She brings you down and hilts you inside her snatch
>you feel so violated. Especially with the way her snatch grips as you as if it had a mind of its own. It was not unlike what you imagine a cow being milked would be like
>no. A cow releases milk in a non invasive way for their dairyman- but this. This was your poor member being clenched. Like it was an unwilling font of liquid gold
>your legs were spread. As she bore down on you with her hips she licked and kissed your face with a perverse glee. The knightess is pressing her whole body on you as her hips buck harder than an angry bull trying to escape its pen
>”my consort, my handsome man, my -slave-... give me your seed. Paint my warrior womb white. Else this will go on, well... you’re so tempting I may just indulge in you all night anywa- OH~!”
>in that instant. With one of her pussy’s pulses of musculature gripping at you in an attempt to milk you- your body give in and you dump the largest load you’ve ever released into your rapist
>you look away in great shame. Fighting back the urge to let tears fall. You were still a man after all. And to you it was even more shameful to cry at a time like this. Though tears flowed anyhow
>”hmmph. Oh yes that felt good~. It made me climax- something about you seeding me like the nice farmer boy you are just...”
>she shudders again, her pussy gripping you hard and you can feel a second squirt on your crotch as she then gasps
>”UUNGH... I wonder if I’ve conceived... but even if I have. I don’t think I shall be stopping.”
>her hips begins grinding in little circles. Her tongue lulls out and looking at you with this expression of devilish joy licks you up your neck to your face. Tasting the salt of your tears her eye wanders to yours. Her face still close
>”don’t cry. No crying, my little sugarcube. Making love is something to revel in...”
>with her open mouth, her tongue wanders to your lips and she locks you in a French kiss. Her long tongue assaulting your entire mouth and even goes far enough to reach your tonsils, bordering on triggering the reflex to gag
>with her arms now wrapped around you, she squeezes hard, and pops her mouth away from yours to speak
>”this is only your primary duty, but I’ll make sure you learn all of your tasks you must do for me daily on the morrow”

>Enter a world of anthros
>Become deeply infatuated with one
>Others seem to think it's strange, but you don't know why.
>She's smart, she's suave, she has money...
>wait...
>Over dinner one night you ask how old she is.
>"Fifty-Seven"
>Being human, you can hardly gauge an anthro's age
>It turns out they age much more gracefully than humans, remaining strong into their twilight years.
>It's still a little unusual to be dating with an age gap over thirty years though.
>But you don't care what others think.
>It's going to take more than a little grey on the muzzle to take you from your oldfur.

>only problem is she did it under a temple of sigmar. And she in the presence of his holy light was blessed with a revelation. Now she works in that same temple.
>She assures you it’s your calling to give her as many little skaven pups and man-baby-things as she desires.

>One day she announces she's in heat and wants your kittens
>Get cold feet and run out the door to your motorcycle
>Start up and drive off
>A few minutes later you hear a voice to your left
>"Anon! You asshole!""
>Slowfully, fearfully, you turn your head towards the voice
>It's...your gf...casually keeping pace with you going 40 down a side road
>"Sex! Fuck me you piece of shit! SEEEXXXXX! SEX WITH MEEEE!!!"
>Before you even have a chance to speed up she reaches over and rips the keys out of the ignition
>The engine dies and you begin to slow down, gradually accepting your fate as her mate

>Be Anon
>Be living inna Anthrostate
>Get assigned to a waifur after years of dodging by running away, coming up with excuses, and even maiming yourself with a nail gun one time.
>It was worth it to preserve your freedom for so long, but now it's time to pay the reaper his due
>Special assignment
>They're going to give you some psycho, or a police officer who's been trained trained to break your spirit or...
>You shudder
>...or a yeen with a pegging fetish.
>The horror...my god, the horror.
>Finally the moment of truth. You're led away down a tight hallway, the door is clicked open and you're greeted by
>A...dog hiding under a blanket and shaking like a leaf in the wind.
>Huh.
>You turn around and try to talk to your escort.
>"Uh, are we sure this is...?"
>But she's already gone.
>You clear your throat. The shaking lump under the blanket freezes.
>"Uh, hi, are you miss," you check the paperwork, "Wayne?"
>A timid, sniffing snoot pokes out, followed by flicking eyes and floppy ears.
>"H-hi. I'm Sammy. Imma Aussie Shepherd, a-and I'm a virgo, and it's nice to meet you Andrew."
>And then it hits you.
>Old dog families are very proud of their breeding lineages. This also makes them VERY inbred.
>Including what's politely called "dog brain."
>You...
>You've hit the jackpot.
>You fall to your knees and give praise to Anthrostate Jesus.
>Sammy quirks her adorable puppy head at you, derpy little tail wagging at you purely from instinct.
>D'aww
>"You... you're happy to be married to me?" She asks, mood improving quickly as she climbs out from under the covers?
>"Of course I am!~" you chime in, wrapping an arm around her.
>Sammy's tongue hangs out eagerly, and her tail wags so hard it physically shakes her butt.
>"In fact," you whisper, leaning in towards her.
>Sammy looks at you in awe, puppy dog eyes glimmering as if you're the greatest person who's ever met.
>"...we should go on walkies and get some steak to celebrate."
>Yup. Your life is going to be great.

My thinking goes:
>Purebred dog families are inbred.
>Occasionally this leads to "dog brain."
>They're aren't retarded per say, but they tend to be socially inept, overly trusting, and not particularly eloquent speakers.
>Since dogs tend to be wealthy, pack oriented, and well connected they have an easier time finding husbands than most.
>Including for their dog brained siblings.
>Sammy lucked out. Her mom is a party bigwig, her sister sister works for the assignment bureau
>She even has a cousin who's an inspector, or something.
>Anon was specially screened and picked through personality testing as the ideal candidate to keep an eye on her without abusing her.
>Plot summary: Anon and Sammy move into the Wayne Family Manor and must navigate canine pack politics while fending off licentious hands and abusive relatives.

>Midway through the story
>You and Sammy have faced some shenanigans together and overcome them with the power love and friendship.
>After a long day of social maneuvering to make sure Sammy doesn't get disinherited or some shit you're glad to be back in her bedroom.
>You turn towards the dresser to change into your PJs and see Sammy standing there awkwardly in thigh high socks and nothing else.
>Hnng
>HNNNG
>Them titties are fire holy SHIT
>"A--Anon. As, a-as your wife it is my duty to...my PRIVILEGE to, uh..." she covers her face with her hands.
>"Oh, what did Jenny tell me to say...?" She whines anxiously, looking away from you.
>Her face is beet red and she starts babbling.
>Hands go to cover up her embarrassment
>"Take your time, sweetheart. Remember to breathe."
>After a a minute of breathing exercises she calms down significantly.
>You just look at each other awkwardly for a moment.
>"Anonymous," she begins, "I want to do the thing that, uh, people do t-that makes babies."
>Her face is red again.
>"Except we don't have babies this time because that'd be a bad idea right now."
>You're not sure how she dommed you from doggy style, but she did it.

>Have dommy deer waifur
>Feel the need to constantly remind her to be careful around roads, use crossroads, look both ways and don't freeze in the middle of them if they see a car
>She feels like you're talking down to her, so she goes extra rough in bed with you
>She still keeps your advice echoing in her head as she goes about her day after having her way with you

>Insane shit is happening
>Weird dark creatures are popping up and killing people
>See the news
>It's grizzly
>Decide the best course of action is fortifying barricading yourself in your house
>Just got done fortifying every possible entrance to your house
>Wipe your brow, satisfied nothing's getting in
>*whoosh*
>You turn around
>Ten of those things are staring right at you
>You freeze, unable to do anything but stare at them, as they stare back at you with those beady yellow eyes
>They're... monkeys? They certainly look like monkeys, anyway. Orange-brown fur with dark brown hands and feet, and a long tail following
>They also appear to wearing clothes and accessories, each wearing a brown shirt with that weird emblem those creatures seem to have
>They're also wearing a lot of jewelery, with bracelets, anklets, a gold choker, gold earrings, and... a red bow?
>After what felt like an hour of staring between you and the intruders, you finally make a move to get even the littlest bit away from these things
>You don't stand a fraction of a chance. As soon as you start to move, the leap into action and grab different parts of you
>Well, the certainly have the grip strength of a monkey, at least
>Within seconds, they rip your clothes to shreds, leaving you stark naked
>You start to panic and scream as one jumps on top of you
>You feel something that makes both your panicking pause and your dick start to get hard
>No way... d-does this thing have a pussy?
>Two of its friends stand by its side
>Its thumbs do a 'which' gesture to both of its side
>The one on the left is moving its finger through hole made with the other hand
>The one on the right draws an imaginary line across its throat
>The message is clear
>You can't believe it
>This is ludicrous
>Disgusting
>There's no way you're having sex with this thing
>
>But you need to live
>With a mountain of reluctance, you swallow and say "O-okay... Do what you want just... j-just don't kill me!"
>They don't seem to understand, so you point to the one on the left
>That seems to get your point across
>Giving you a nod of confirmation, the one on top of you gets to work
>It - well, she, you suppose - tries to put you inside of her, but your cock's only half-hard
>She rubs herself on it, which does the trick to get you terrifyingly, humiliatingly hard
>After that she wastes no time bouncing up and down your entire length
>She's strong
>She's quick
>It feels like every time she touches you base, your pelvis might shatter
>She keeps looking you in the eyes as she rides you
>By god, those eyes
>Two yellow lights in an empty, black, skull-shaped void
>It would be horrible enough to look at alone
>Let alone while she's doing this to you
>You can't take it
>You close your eyes and look away
>One of them, sitting behind your head, grabs it, locks it towards her, and pries your eyelids open, forcing constant eye contact with your "partner"
>You're a virgin
>You always imagined your virginity would be taken by a girl you really love
>Not stolen from you by whatever this thing is
>The sex goes on for some time
>You mainly mentally focus on waiting until she's had her fill
>Until soon, you feel yourself getting close
>She must be too, because her bounces are getting slower and (even) more forceful
>A few meaty *PLAP*s later, she slams down hard on you, siphoning out your orgasm
>You cringe in disgust, mostly for how good it makes you feel
>She lets out a squeaky croon as you fill her up
>After a few more moments filled with heavy panting, she gets up, your cum dripping out of her
>Your body's too tired to even have a reaction to what happened, so your only choice is to catch your breath
>You barely notice when another hops back on your dick
>No
>No way
>You can't do it again
>It's impossible
>You just came, you should be flaccid
>But you're still as hard as a rock, to your horror
>This time, though, your violator is facing away from you, giving you an up close and personal view of her ass
>Holy shit
>Her cheeks are absolutely massive
>They would look big on a normal-sized human woman, but they look even bigger on her proportionally smaller body
>So big, that no matter how disgusted you are at these things and what they are doing, the deeply carnal part of your mind can't help but be attracted to it
>And that just makes it all the more worse
>As she starts to ride, you begin panicking again
>"N-no, stop, PLEASE! You already drained me, I can't take anymore, please stop! NO! HELP, SOMEONE HE-"
>*MMMF!! MMMMMMMMMFFFFFF!*
Your screaming is cut short as another large ass comes crashing down on your face
>It belongs to the one that previously made you look into your rapist's eyes
>Your arms flail wildly beside you before two of the others grab you and make you stop
>You panic so much that you don't notice the worst part of it all
>The smell
>With your nose pressed against her labia and close to her hole, her scent hits you like a truck when you notice it
>It also appeals to the carnal part of you
>Your brain can't take it
>The pleasure your dick is getting
>The fear you have of these things
>The humiliation of being forced to go through all this
>The musk your breathing in instead of oxygen
>The last rational part of your brain is worried you might go insane at this rate
>Just before you pass out, the one on your face finally gets up, just in time to watch yourself cum a second time
>You cringe, a pain forming in your loins
>You're not sure how much more you can take
>As the second one gets up, the ones that were holding your arms down help you up
>You look around
>You realize you won't get out until all of these monkeys get a piece
>You're immediately filled with dread
>You barely get a moment of respite before its time to please a third one
>Unlike the last two, though, this one expects you to put in most of the work
>She stands with her hands on the wall and ass sticking out
>Looking back at you, she spreads one cheek from the other, exposing a tight, pink hole
>The three standing at your sides and back start fondling your scrotum to induce another erection
>You beg again, quieter this time, asking for even a shred of rest or mercy
>Your pleads fall on death ears
>Before you know it, you're hard again, and your dick is pressing against her back entrance
>With one shove from behind, you penetrate her anus
>As you barely have the energy to stand, the monkeys hoisting you up thrust into her for you
>It's a strange feeling, having your body being moved for you
>Her hole was much tighter and more resistant to your penis than the pussies were
>Despite the throbbing soreness you felt in your crotch, it still felt immeasurably good, which would you make you disgusted if you had the energy for it
>Her ass jiggles with every thrust into her
>Had she been a human, you would probably have almost found it hypnotic
>You can't tell if time is moving too slowly or too quickly, but eventually, you cum again
>It's painful, but at the same time, your much too numb to completely register it
>Afterwards, your pulled out with lewd *POP* and set on the ground
>Before your mind can begin to wonder what's next, the two monkeys that were holding your arms kneel down
>One on your torso, one on your legs
>They take of their shirts and begin giving you a dual titjob
>In the past, something like this happening would have seemed like an impossible dream
>Now, it's a terrifyingly possible nightmare
>You're not even surprised that you're hard again
>God it hurts so much
>You muster all the strength you have to look up
>You're face to face with an amazingly fat ass and and a supremely tight pussy
>You can't think
>You nearly pass out as you cum again
>You're brought back to full consciousness when something enters your mouth
>A banana
>One of them shoved it into your mouth
>She grabs your jaw and makes you chew it
>Then she shoves her fingers down your throat and makes you swallow
>Several others follow
>Of course
>Their toy needs to keep his strength up
>Otherwise, how could he be awake for the 'fun'
>You wish you could enjoy this
>Everything would be so much easier if you could
>Then all of this would make sense
>And you'd realize that you deserve something that felt good
>Apparently, they figure your body needs some time to rest, so the stop the sex
>But your mental state can still be played with
>They shove their feet into their face and make you lick them
>They pelt you with banana peels to watch you squirm
>They force your face between the breasts
>They bounce you around amongst themselves with their asses, like a twisted game of foursquare
>All the while, they're laughing
>The laughing
>It's so horrible
>From what you can tell, they communicate in high-pitched, monkey like squeaking
>Hearing the repeated high-pitched squawk would at worst be irritating normally
>But now it's unbearable, because you know they're laughing at you
>Because they're degrading you
>Because they're humiliating you
>Because they made you their toy
>You can't take it anymore
>It doesn't make sense
>You don't like it
>But... why?
>You've always wanted to have sex
>Now they're here to give it to you
>B-but... they're not hu-
>So what? It still made you feel good, didn't it?
>Yes, that's it
>Of course
>The person making this miserable is you
>Just let go
>Embrace the madness
>Then it'll all make sense
>Then the pain can stop
>In the midst of all the laughter, you knelt down and screamed
>"I GIVE UP! TAKE ME! DO WHAT YOU WANT! I'M YOURS! A-AND I LOVE IT! I NEED YOU! I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO TO ME ANYMORE! JUST MAKE ME FEEL GOOD!"
>The laughter stops
>Then, wordlessly, one spreads her legs and presents for you
>You know what you have to do
>You crawl over to her and hover over her, staring her in the eye
>You're hard again
>You guess your body's given up trying to feel pain at this point
>Or maybe it's mixed in with pleasure now
>Either way, you slide in and fuck her in a mating press
>As an active participant, you feel so much better
>Like you're earning your pleasure
>The monkey seems to be having more fun too
>You hammer away at her for several minutes until you both cum
>You feel like you have a moment clarity
>Yes
>The monkeys weren't trying to hurt you
>They were trying to help
>By making you let go and have fun
>And now, you will
>The next several hours are an orgy
>Some monkeys jerk you off with their feet
>Some get you musk musk drunk off their asses
>Some fuck you hard enough to make cracks in the wall
>And you don't stop cumming
>And you love every minute of it
>But alas, all good moments must come to an end
>Your final orgasm is had while having doggystyle anal sex with one
>After you cum, you pull out with another *POP* and just lay there
>It seems your exhaustion has caught up with you
>Your body can't take any more
>The monkeys seem to realize this too
>They all gather around, staring at you
>They did this for you
>That's the only reason you can accept
>So you can feel good
>They really care about you
>They have to
>You finally pass out, having never felt so loved
>
>It was all a dream
>It had to have been
>That's the only explanation
>The dark creatures invading and attacking?
>Just a bad dream
>Everything's fine
>Everything's normal
>The boarded doors and windows?
>The banana peels?
>That's just because you were sleepwalking
>Nothing else
>In fact, you're still dreaming
>You have to be
>Otherwise, why would those monkeys from last night start appearing before you when you were awake?

>meet a nice human girl online
>she suggests you meet at a cafe near her place
>gives you the address, but it doesn't sound familiar to you
>decide to call a taxi, let them figure it out
>the driver gives you this weird look the whole drive over there
>ends up dropping you deep in the rat part of the city
>even makes you double check the address before leaving you there
>sure enough, you find the place she mentioned
>it looks a lot sketchier than you imagined though
>more of a bar than a cafe, with a neon sign reading "The Nest" over the entrance
>might as well take a look inside, you've come this far after all

>Skaven girls jealously trying to prove their superiority by dressing their boy-things in the fanciest clothes and trinket-things
>constantly bringing new gifts and shinies pilfered from who knows where
>end up looking like a prince from some far off land
>spend all day grooming and doting on you to make sure you look your best
>excitedly hugging you and muttering "mine-mine" under her breath

>Be you
>Be hired as a night-shift security guard at local museum
>It’s not very big, so you’ll be the only one there
>But recently, they got this rare, ancient necklace
>Apparently, it’s worth more than everything else there combined
>Absolutely vital that it never gets stolen
>The first few nights go on with no incident
>Think the job will always be this easy
>Until the CCTV suddenly goes out
>Immediately head out to make sure the necklace is there
>Thankfully, it is
>Not wanting to take any chances, you hide it in your lunchbox, hoping the museum will understand you weren’t trying to steal it
>Head back out in case it really is an intruder and not some system-wide camera malfunction
>After a few minutes searching, you catch someone with your flashlight
>”FREEZE!” you yell
>It’s… a bat?
>She certainly has bat wings and a bat head
>But you only dwell on her species for about two seconds, because you immediately notice two other features of hers
>Her breasts
>To put it bluntly, they’re huge
>And that heart-shaped chestplate she’s wearing only covers the nipples-down, so you have a great view
>The rest of her outfit wasn’t much less skimpy, consisting of a skin-tight catsuit that left little to the imagination, and boots and gloves covering her lower arms and legs
>She smiles slyly at you
>”’Evening, officer. Here for the midnight exhibit too?”
>”Y-you’re not supposed to be in here,” you nervously creaked, your voice not sounding half as authoritative as you would have liked it to
>”Please leave, or I will have to call the police.”
>She scoffs and rolls her eyes
>”Oh, come on, officer. Is there really any need for that?”
>You take your eyes off of her for half a second to look at your walkie-talkie
>That’s all the time she needs to leave your line of sight
>You look around for her dumbly while humming confusedly
>Then you feel her presence behind you
>”Okay, then. If that’s how you wanna play it, that’s how we’re gonna play it.”
>Before you can react, one arm puts in you in a headlock, and the other grabs your walkie-talkie
>”You won’t be needing this anymore.”
>You’re awestruck as she crushes it in her palm
>She similarly disposes of your phone, gun, and baton before wrapping her free arm around your arms and torso
>Without much effort, she carries you back to your security office and throws you onto the chair
>She locks the door behind you
>”Okay, here’s the deal. I came for that necklace. I scour the place, and you know what I don’t find?”
>She paces around as she speaks to you. You just sit there with a dumb look on your face
>”Pretty much everything but the necklace. So, one of two things happened. Either another, craftier jewel thief came before me and stole it under your nose, or…”
>She stops pacing and leans in close to you
>”Some wimpy night guard hid it from me.”
>You swallow and (badly) try to save face
>”Y-you might as well give up now. I’ll never tell you.”
>She just chuckles at your failed attempt at portraying confidence
>”See, here’s the thing. I COULD knock you out and look for it myself. But…”
>She bends down, giving you an even better view of her tits
>”...Where would the fun in that be?”
>You know what she’s insinuating, but say nothing
>”Oh, don’t play coy. I saw you eyeing me. Most guys do. Don’t worry, I like the attention. And if you like my body so much, why not play with it? All for the low-low price of a necklace.”
>You remain silent
>”Don’t believe me? Here, look at this.”
“She takes off her chestplate and her boobs bounce freely
>If you weren’t mesmerized by them before, you certainly are now
>How can someone with a rack like that be so quick and nimble?
>”Th-that only works in m-movies.”
>”Oh, really? He seems to be a fan.”
>She points down
>You’re dick’s hard
>Face cherry red, you hurriedly cover it up
>She chuckles again
>”Calm down, it’s nothing I haven’t seen before. In fact…
>She removes your hands
>”I wanna see more of it
>She ignores your attempts to stop her as she undoes you zipper
>Your dick flops out
>”Hoo! You’re bigger than I thought. This might be fun after all.”
>She looks you in the eyes as she grips your cock
>”So tell me, lover boy, ‘you a virgin?”
>”That’s not your b-business”
>”Ah, so virgin. Gotcha.”
>”You grunt half in annoyance and half in arousal as she starts stroking slightly
>”Well, aren’t you lucky to have me as your first?”
>You begin to uselessly sputter protests
>She responds by squishing her tits around your dick
>So soft
>So warm
>It feels way too good
>”Well, well, what happened to all that dignity?”
>She rubs her boobs along your length for awhile
>A few minutes later, she starts using her mouth
>Light licks, kisses and suckles coupled with the titjob drives you wild
>She seems to be pretty experienced with this
>Going at the perfect pace
>Hitting the right spots
>You’ve never felt physically better
>You almost cum a dozen times, but she seems to know when you will, and pauses accordingly to drag it on
>Finally, after about a half-hour of this, she lets you cum, catching your load in her mouth and swallowing
>You fall go limp in your chair, panting
>She sits up on the table
>”So what’d you think? Good, right?”
>You say nothing. Even after that, you’re not gonna give her the necklace
>So, whatcha say? Scratch my back, now that I’ve scratched yours?”
>You merely shake your head
“>No? Really? Guess you have more ethics than I thought.”
>She begins taking off her gloves and boots
>”No matter. I’ve got other ways of making you talk.”
>You don’t what she means until she shoves a foot into your face
>The smell is... weird?
>Sure, let's go with that
>Although it's probably not as weird as the fact you don't completely hate it
>She wasn't wearing socks
>Only the stirrup ends of her one-piece
>And all of the acrobatics and gymnastics she does reflects in the smell of her sweaty feet
>"I wanted to give you an easy ride, but you just HAD to be honorable, didn't you?"
>She rubs her feet on your face, giving you an eye, nose, and mouthful of them
>"Oh my god... you're actually into this?"
>Sure enough, your dick's hard again
>"HAHA! Holy shit, I can't believe it! How could you be such a weirdo?"
>You look away in shame
>"I wonder what else you're into... WAIT! I have an idea."
>Within seconds, she stands up and takes the rest of her outfit off, leaving her nude
>She's beautiful
>Her face
>Her breasts
>Her legs
>Her hips
>Her belly
>It's all like a work of art
>But you don't get to admire it for too long
>She turns arounds, sticks her ass out, and forces your head in
>"Try my hole and pussy, loser!"
>While not as proportionally big as her tits, her ass is still great
>With nothing else to do, you start licking wherever your tongue can reach
>Despite herself, she moans
>"That's... really good. Great, even. Wait, actually..."
>She flips onto her back and spreads her legs
>"...Eat me out for real."
>You comply, licking her from anus to clit
>You're not as experienced as her, but you try your best
>When you're ready to make her cum, you start sucking on her clit
>She grabs you in and holds your head to it
>"Ah, fuck! Don't stop! Make me cum!"
>You keep sucking until, with a satisfied sigh, she finishes
>She lets you go and takes a moment to catch her breath before standing back up
>"Okay, let's try again. Are you gonna give me the necklace now, or what?"
>In spite of it all, the answers still no
>Her face hardens
>"Okay, now you're starting to annoy me."
>She gets up close and personal
>"If you're not gonna comply, I guess I'm gonna have to go all out."
>It’s only 1:30
>The museum doesn’t open until 8:00
>It’s a long night
>You had no clue sex could be so exhausting
>But then again, this isn’t really average sex
>This is non-stop, hour-long sex with a girl who has VERY high stamina
>She fucks you full force and doesn’t stop
>You beg her to slow down, but she dismisses all of it
>She wears you down verbally as well as physically
>The way she makes you lick every last inch of her and mocks you for it
>"Enjoy it, freak, it's the best you're ever gonna get."
>"Don't pretend you don't enjoy it, pervert."
>"You should pay me for the privilege of huffing my asshole."
>You can't do anything but take it
>You use her mouth, pussy and ass, but she never seems to get looser
>You're tired
>Light-headed
>Dehydrated
>Finally, after busting another load inside of her as she rides you, she gets up to take a break
>It's 5:00
>She sits and leans against the wall, winded
>You lay sprawled out on the floor, unable to move
>"Whew! Gotta give credit where it's due..."
>She stands back up
>"You're one tough nut to crack."
>"Though not that hard to bust."
>She smirks at her joke and stares down into your defeated eyes
>She won
>She doesn't even have to say anything
>"Lunchbox..."
>"Hmm?"
>"The necklace is in the lunchbox. On the counter."
>She blinks before smiling again
>"Clever. Probably wouldn't have looked there."
>She retrieves the necklace and looms over you with it in hand
>"Gotta say, that was the most fun I've had on a heist in a while."
>She pulled out your wallet and took a look at your ID
>"Tell you what, I might visit you sometime at your house, and I could make up for the whole degradation song and dance. Oh, and the job. You're probably losing that. Sound good?"
>Once again, you say nothing
>"I'll take your silence as a yes. See you around lover boy."
>She gets dressed and exits as if the last few hours were nothing to her
>They probably weren't
>As soon as she leaves, you pass out
>At 8:00, your boss finds you unconscious on the floor and the necklace missing
>Fortunately, the thief last night (wait... you never Did get her name, did you)? got you all dressed back up before she left, so no one has a clue about what happened last night
>But you still get fired
>You just finish watching a news report on how the museum (and by extension, the city) lost tens of millions of dollars because of that necklace
>In the end, you're left with two important questions
>Where are you gonna work now?
>And do you really regret what happened
>Suddenly, you're thoughts are cut short as you hear a knock at the door.

>Crash landed in an uncharted jungle world?
>Sole survivor?
>Survivor's Guilt?
>Don't know a thing about survival?
>Trapped between bloodthirsty wildlife and slaver natives?
>Fresh meat to Krystal, then...

imagine how dangerous it is being a pizza delivery guy in an /adhg/ setting
>you're a lone humie with food
>going up to an anthros house/apartment
>high chance they're drunk anthros so they may make more impulsive decisions
>there might be multiple rowdy anthro females in the place
>just one pull and you're in their "den"
>getting called to anthros that live in more remote areas
>traveling a lot at night
>all the heavy handed flirting about "tips" and extra helpings of "meat/sausage" on their pizzas

>she will never shout abuse over her mic, then mute it to call you a good boy
>you will never get fucked hard and rough when she rages over losing
>you will never get fucked extra hard and rough when she celebrates winning

anything a humie does to be edgy just attracts certain species
>bone/skull designs gets attention from species that eat/chew on bones
>covering yourself in spikes gets species like hedgehogs, porcupines, etc hitting on you
>wearing all black just has panthers, bats, rats, crows/ravens, black cats, black bears, etc paying more attention to you
>being loud and aggressive just draws more attention and a humie's aggression comes of more cute due to anthro's size/strength advantage
>etc

>be the damsel(male) in distress
>your GF is a half feral animal woman that's good at platforming

"...okay."

We've seen a bunch of Anthrostate stories set in the city, but what about stories set in the countryside?
>Breakdown of central authority and the threat of raiders from the Badlands has forced farms to turn themselves into mini fortresses.
>They're sustained by the high food prices this arrangement inevitably brings.
>Whole extended families live under the same roof so they can collectively guard their most valuable possession: their males.
>Bartering chips in settling local disputes, arranging cash dowries, and creating alliances between families.
>It's practically neofeudal on the frontier, but much, much safer and more traditional the closer you are to urban centers.
>Gotta be careful though, because even your neighbors might not be trustworthy.
>Husband raids don't just come from the Badlands, and you don't want to be around when a blood feud breaks out.
>Even the army is going to think twice before interfering...

>the state can barely afford to police the land outside their central urban regions so the countryside is largely left to itself.
>the families and cliques have all organized themselves into various agrarian tribes whose main exports are whatever they can grow on their land
>regularly selling the excess produce to the state and whatever badlands tribe that doesn't immediately try to kill them
>males are seen as highly valuable and the tribes will sometimes try and steal eachothers men as males are usually quite rare as well
>despite the chaotic nature of the frontier many males from the state will flee there as life with one of the agrarian mini-nations is seen as preferable to the iron pawed rule of the state.

Even some human microstates have managed to carve out their own niches in more remote parts of the frontier.
>Their heraldry and symbols often declare allegiance to old traditions and countries now long since passed into memories.
>Loose confederations like the Snake Nation, The Starry People, the Republic of Dave, and New Desseret.
>Inspectors are the closest thing to neutral law enforcement the frontier has.
>Distrusted by many as representatives of a distant, in name only authority out to collect the runaways that become many of their husbands.
>More often though they're the only thing standing between many humans and a life of kidnapping, rape, or worse.
>Most important of all, they work to prevent the wars that would kill far more than just farmers.

>the largest of the human states, the republic of zion, was made as a "promised land" for men fleeing the state. a place to live built by humans, for humans.
>due to being surrounded on all sides by potential enemies and with paranoia over anthrostate inspectors and expeditions, the people of zion have developed the most militaristic culture out of any microstate
>some have considered letting anthro defectors settle in zion's lands. but a mix of hatred and paranoia about inspectors kidnapping runaways has made this prospect unlikely.
>most of the inspectorate is tied up with work in the city. as such few resources can be spared for operations into the frontier.
>and when frontier work is called it's usually some powerful anthro demanding her runaway husband be retrieved
>this makes inspectors a rather rare sight in the frontier.
>when they do show up the locals treat them with suspicion at best, and hostility at worst.
>more often than not. human runaways have managed to integrate themselves into one of the frontier tribes and show no signs of leaving anytime soon.
>sometimes an ambitious and naive inspector will attempt to bring justice to the frontier. with varying degrees of success.

>Has you kiss her socks and thighs
>Bowing down and worshiping her
>Eventually says you've earned a reward
>Anticipation building
>Tells you not to move
>Turns around and pushes you inside her
>Doesn't let you go pass the tip
>Teases you with her words and her feet
>But reminds you to stay obedient
>Asks you if you want to earn your orgasm
>Say yes of course
>She pulls you back down to kiss her thighs
>Then slobber all over her clit
>Only after hours of toying with you does she actually let you cum

>you stare at the thermostat sullenly
>the display reads a depressing '53'
>goddamn landlord can't be bothered to send a repairman for four days because he's busy not freezing his ass off in Texas
>he finally said he'd send his niece around to take a look at it today
>and as the only tenant without fur, and therefore the one complaining the most about the cold, you've been tasked with letting her in the front door and taking her to the basement
>so you sit in your living room, alternating between glaring at the thermostat and checking your phone for her text
>meanwhile, you've done all you can to keep warm; a sweater over your shirt, along with socks, slippers, and thick flannel pants, all wrapped in one of those fuzzy blankets
>finally, your phone buzzes
>'im here. can you come unlock front door?'
>you throw off the blanket around your shoulders and head out of your apartment to let her in
>the sooner this gets done, the sooner you can have some heat in your apartment
>the stairwell is even colder than your apartment, and you shiver all the way down the steps
>the landlord's niece is knocking repeatedly at the door when you approach
>you can understand her desire to get inside
>it's a blizzard out there
>the knocking intensifies
"Alright, Jesus, give me a second."
>you swing open the front door, letting in a blast of cold air that forces you to step back from the flurry of snow that whirls in from outside
>silhouetted in the doorway is the frame of a tall, bulky snow-leopard
>apparently your human landlord's sibling has a thing for fur
>or this woman was adopted
>the snow-leopard steps inside, giving you a better look at her, and her state of undress
>she's not bundled up for winter, wearing a well-worn workman's jumpsuit tied off at the waist, and just a sports bra showing off a pudgy belly but muscular arms that carry a heavy toolbox
>she looks down at you with her double-pierced ears folded
>"A human? You must be freezing!"
>you look at the door, still open and letting in freezing air
"Yes. Please close the door."
>the snow-leopard whirls about and slams the door shut with indecent haste
>"Sorry! I wasn't even thinking! Are you still cold? Look at you, you're shivering."
>you roll your eyes
>of course you're shivering, you've been shivering for days now
>you just want to get this fixed
"Yeah. The basement's this way.”
>you turn about and trudge further down the stairwell into the unfinished basement of the building
>you blow against your numb fingers as you lead her deeper into the cluttered space
>it's even colder down here somehow
>"I'm Claire, by the way."
>you glance back to see her smiling sympathetically
>her tail droops along the ground
"Anon."
>you almost trip over a pile of discarded golf clubs someone left down here and swear
>"Easy!"
>you're grabbed by the back of your shirt and held up by the snow-leopard
>you go to swat a hand at her arm, but end up grabbing an arm full of fur
>oh god it's warm
>how?
>she was just outside
>you realize you're still holding onto her, and release the handful of fluff to step away hastily
"I'm fine, I'm fine. Just go fix the thing. Please."
>you finally make it to the defunct furnace, gesturing at it as though she could miss it
>Claire chirrups and sets her toolbox down
>"Sure thing! I'll get this done quick as I can, then hopefully you'll be able to warm up!"
>you nod quickly, thankful she's more focused on the furnace than on you right now
>resist the urge to touch the fluff
>resist!
"So uh, how long do you think it will take?
>Claire kneels down next to old machine and prizes it open with liberal application of a screwdriver and the claw-end of a hammer
>"Dunno. If all goes right, could have it working in under an hour. If not..."
>she shrugs
>that's not reassuring
>maybe if you could steal a little bit more heat off her before you go back to your apartment it would make things more tolerable
"So...is there anything I can do to help? Speed things along?"
>Claire flicks an ear
>her two earrings clink against each other
>"Hm."
>she's forearm deep in the backside of the furnace, so you lean over her to watch
>"You don't want to go back to your place and warm up? I know how sensitive you humans can be to the weather."
>you cross your arms and try to feel indignant
>that would be easier if you weren't feeling the cold so much
"If it gets done faster, I can turn the heat on faster. Guess you don't mind with all that fur. Must be warm."
>all that soft, fluffy, warm fur must be warm
>just one more touch
>Claire's tail starts to flick side to side and she chirrups again
>"It's very warm! I was thinking about how nice the weather was today on the way over. I can barely feel it!"
>she pulls her snout out of the opening in the side of the furnace to look at you with a rounded pupil
>"But I bet you have it much easier in the summer! If you want to help, you mind pasing a 5/8th's wrench and a flashlight?"
>you kneel down next to Claire and start rifling through her toolbox
>the cold metal of the wrench hurts your skin, but it's all worth it when you hand it over and brush your fingers against the fur on her paw
>you can't stop a sigh from escaping you when it happens
>"Oh! Your hand is freezing!"
>she grabs your hand with a free paw, enveloping it in toasty fur and soft pawpad
>"Gosh..."
>you stare at her paw
>just one more touch was never going to be enough
>"Actually..."
>Claire's tail starts flicking side-to-side
>it bats against you with every turn
>"You think you could hold the flashlight for me while I work?"
>she flashes her fangs at you in a friendly grin
>you don't want to let go, but you also don't want to disappoint her and get sent away from another opportunity
>so you let go of her paw and grab the flashlight out from her toolbox
>taking a spot beside her, you shine it into the furnace
"Is this good?"
>Claire chuffs, leaning to one side to make room for you
>then her paw falls heavily on your shoulder, and drags you forward and over so you're trapped between her and the furnace
>she presses her entire body down on yours so you're enveloped in a blanket of snow-leopard fur
>your face lights up red
>"There you go! Much better, huh? Just hold that light up for me, okay hun?"
>her heavy paw lifts your hand up, and goes over your thumb to flick the switch on the flashlight and point it toward her work
>Claire leans in, folding you further beneath her as she starts working again
>her arms reach around you and keep you penned in
>not that you'd try to escape the heaven that is her cozy embrace
>"Perfect. You just stay nice and comfy. I can't believe Uncle Mike let a poor little humie freeze like this. He should know better."
>she tuts at your landlord's indolence
>"I'll keep you warm until the heater's fixed, don't you worry. The way you shivered at the front door, I could barely stop myself from scooping you up then and there!"
>you wish she had
>this is amazing
>"But you were after my floof this whole time, weren't you?"
>chuffing again, Claire withdraws a paw from inside the furnace to pat your head
>"That's okay. I'm glad to be of service!"
>you manage to hum your agreement
>it's hard to speak when you're melting under the tender hug of a hard-working cat
>so she goes on working and purring, all the while acting as a bulwark against the frigid basement air
>until finally she huffs in indignance and sets her tools down on the floor
>"Well! I have some bad news, and some good news."
>uh oh
"What's the bad news?"
>Claire sighs as she leans away from you to grab the toolbox and start putting things away
>the cold starts to creep back in at the edge of your perception
>"Well it looks like I'll have to order some replacement parts for the furnace. At least a week for them to arrive."
>that is bad news
>an entire week of freezing
"But what's the good news?"
>Claire's warmth surrounds you once again, driving off the invading cold
>her arm snakes under yours and around your chest so she can hug you tight and lift you to stand with her
>but even standing, she doesn't release you
>"The good news is I promised to keep you warm until the furnace was fixed, and I intend to keep that promise! You ready to be my little snuggle-bug for the rest of the week?"
>that's the best news you could have gotten
“I’d love nothing more!”

>Maternal Deathclaw and a frightened, lost, and lonely vault child she found in the woods

>Be Anon
>19 year old kissless virgin who just moved out for college
>Live in an apartment by yourself cause rich family
>Very cozy and fairly modern
>Only problem is you live across the street from the wolf sorority
>They like to annoy the neighborhood with loud music and howling
>Every. Single. Night.
>You’ve called the police at least ten times, but they’re usually of no help
>Currently it’s 1 am on a Friday night
>You can hear their chorus of cheers and socialization
>Covering your ears is of no help
>You hear them from across the street
>”One, two, three! Awooooooo~”
>Their howls ring across the quiet neighborhood
>And you’ve about fucking had it
>You jump out of your bed and slip your shoes on, venting your frustration by cursing to yourself
>Too tired to get into any clothes so fuck it
>March across the street in your pajamas, a white t-shirt and striped pants
“Stupid fucking mutts. These anthros just don’t know when to shut the fuck up.”
>You angrily walk their door and you begin furiously pounding on it
>You keep up with it until the door opens to reveal a wolfess
>”Geez kid, you got a problem?”
>Her slightly-messy fur is a dark gray, and she’s a head or two taller than you, making you eye level with her sizable bust
>But that’s besides the point
“I have had it up to HERE with you and your pack. Every single fucking night it’s just all of you HOWLING. There are people TRYING TO SLEEP! SHUT THE FUCK UP!”
>You let your rage out in full swing
>And the wolfess currently standing in the doorway just stands there in complete shock
>That’s when you hear a voice coming from inside
>”Hey Carol, neighbor’s giving you a problem?”
>Moments later a brown wolfess walks next to her friend
>She’s wearing a shit-eating grin on her muzzle, god you just wish you could break her snout off
>”Heyyyy~, aren’t you a cutie? Can’t sleep, hun?”
>She starts wagging her tail and hips as the words come out her muzzle
>You can’t help but slightly blush, but that still doesn’t do anything in making you feel any better
“It’s past midnight, why the fuck are you girls howling? I can’t get any sleep because of you!”
>Carol looks back at her friend and mimics that same grin. ”Heh, looks like this kid can’t sleep cause of us. I don’t think he understands wolf culture.”
>You’re about to respond when Carol’s friend interrupts you
>”Yeah, sounds like this humie doesn’t understand us. How about we introduce you to our culture and we can maybe work out a deal, hmm? Name’s Beth, by the way.”
>She gives you a lustful gaze while licking her chops
>You don’t know how to respond to that
“I… I, uh-I’m Anon? Could you just, please stop with the howli-“
>Suddenly Beth grabs your wrist and yanks you inside the house
>Carol follows suit by grabbing your free hand, leaving you completely helpless
“H-Hey! Put me down already! I just want to go to bed!”
>Carol seems to brush off your remark, “Oh don’t be such a baby, this is a learning experience, you should get to know us better!”
>You’re taken inside the living room and dumped on the couch
>”Hey girls!” Beth barks out
>Suddenly, a group of wolfesses walk into the living room
>There’s at least twelve of them, and all their furs are different colors, some black, gray, and white
>They look at you with curious eyes with a couple of ooh’s as they stare at you and look back to Beth as she speaks out to her pack
>”Listen up girls. Mr Anon here is upset at us but we plan on fixing that by the end of the night, and we’re going to give him a proper introduction to wolf culture. Is that clear?”
>Excited barks and yips come from them while you sit on the couch helplessly
>”Alrighty then! Let’s show Anon how we get down around here!”
“Listen, I appreciate it, but I uh-“
>Carol puts a finger to your mouth
>”Shut it. You’re going to sit here and listen, understand?”
>You shakily nod your head
>”Good boy.”
>You can’t help but blush from that comment and try to cover your face with your hands
>But suddenly all the wolfesses around you take hold of your arms and legs
“H-Hey, let me go!”
>Your words fall on deaf ears as you struggle helplessly, but they are far stronger than you
>One of them displays a claw to you and begins to tug it at your shirt
>Then with one quick motion, she tears it down the middle
>Another wolfess is tugging at the waistband of your pajama pants with her claw, and seconds later your pants are off
>You’re half-naked in an embarrassing display in front of a pack of wolfesses
“What the fuck are you do-“
>You’re interrupted as Beth scoops you up into her arms, smiling at you like a mother would her child
>”You’re so cute when you struggle, you know, I want to see you keep doing it.”
>You flail your arms and legs around in an attempt to get away, but she doesn’t budge as she carries you upstairs into the bedroom with the rest following you
>It’s essentially just one big mattress as a floor, and she tosses you down onto it
>You’re about to get up when you’re greeted by the sight of the wolfesses undressing themselves
>Beth and Carol are already out their clothes and their features are covered by white lingerie, giggling as you start gawking at them
>”Enjoying the view, humie?” Carol sticks out her round rump and gives it a light slap
>Blood starts rushing towards your groin and you start to heat up
>You try to say something but the words can’t come out of your throat
>”No need to be ashamed sweetie, you’re just learning our culture after all.”
>Beth and Carol are crawling towards you and you instinctively back away
>Before you bump into a wall of fluff, somehow a wolfess got behind you and you didn’t notice
>Her breasts are pressing against your back and she puts her arms around you
>”Don’t be scared, we won’t bite”
>The wolfess behind you starts nibbling at your earlobe and moves lower to your neck, eliciting a moan from you
>You didn’t notice that Beth already got a clawed finger on the waistband of your underwear, which comes off seconds later revealing your erection to all
>”Ooh, this looks very nice” Beth coos while licking her chops
“P-Please stop. I don’t—oh!”
>Beth flicks out her tongue on the underside of your rod with a single lick
>Carol is impressed by the sight too
>”Pretty pent up kid?” before she uses her hand to grab your balls
>You gasp, feeling her rough paw pads sent shivers down your spine
>The wolfess behind you giggles and starts licking on the back of your neck
>The feeling of her wet tongue added to your arousal
>Beth brings her muzzle close to your rod, taking her nose to your tip and giving it a sniff
>”You smell good, Anon.” she chuckles to herself
>Carol follows suit to give your balls the same attention
>All the girls in the background are watching with anticipation
>Beth begins licking on your tip while Carol starts licking your balls, causing an audible moan to escape your mouth
>They both seem to chuckle at your reaction and increase their pace
>The stimulation is too much for you
>The wolfess who’s been holding onto you the whole time starts licking on your cheek and gets ever so close to your lips
>Beth stops licking at your member and wraps her fingers around your dick
>”You’ve been such a good boy for us, Anon. You enjoying your lesson so far?”
>She starts moving her hand up and down as you try to find the words to respond, but they remain stuck in your throat
>”That’s what I thought, baby. How does a treat sound, hmm?”
>She takes her hand off and suddenly takes your member into her muzzle, causing you to moan loudly
>At the same time, Carol starts sucking on your testicles
>The stimulation is too much and your eyes roll to the back of your head
>The wolfess licking at your cheek turns your head towards her and shoves her tongue down your open mouth
>She easily overpowers your tongue and pushes to the back of your mouth
>You instinctively try to pull away but her hand moves to the back of your head and pushes you towards her
>To add to her dominant French kiss, she moves her muzzle sideways to give her more leverage, allowing her tongue to reach the back of your throat
>She laps around in the inside of your mouth, coating it in the taste of her saliva
>Meanwhile Carol and Beth continue to greedily suck at your genitals
>Their mouths send powerful waves of pleasure throughout your body
>Beth bobs her head up and down faster, while Carol sucks on your testicles harder and swirls her tongue around for added pleasure
>Your mind is going numb, the intense feeling of arousal is making it hard for you to think
>Your penis throbs as you feel a building sensation
>Beth and Carol take notice of this and their eyes widen
>And they assault your groin by increasing the speed and intensity of their ministrations
>The wolfess kissing you fully shoves her tongue down your throat, making you gag in response
>You instinctively curl your toes and grab the sheets on the mattress below
>As your climax reaches its peak, you screw your eyes shut, and then
“Mmf-!”
>Your moan is muffled by the wolfess French kissing you, who sucks on your mouth as soon as you cum
>Ropes of semen spew out of your cock and directly into Beth’s mouth
>She greedily swallows it while continuing to bob her head
>Carol starts to gently chew on your sack, being careful enough to not pierce skin
>Once your orgasm died down, Beth kept her muzzle buried in your crotch for one final time before letting go
>”Thanks for the meal. Good boy~”
>She winks as her praise makes your face heat up
>Carol takes her mouth off your balls
>”Hehe, looks like you’re enjoying your lesson about wolf culture.”
>The wolfess kissing you laps in your mouth and sucks on your tongue for one final time before letting go
>A thick strand of saliva connects both of your lips
>”You’re such a quick learner, sweetie. Keep it up.”
>She starts licking on your face, coating it in saliva
>You want to back away but you’re far too numb from your orgasm so you let her have her moment
>You don’t notice that Carol and Beth move away from your genitals, and the rest of the pack is circling closer to you
>Once the wolfess stops licking your face, she moves away from you
>You whine when the sensation of her warm fur leaves
>That’s when you realize your lesson is far from over
>Carol has already stood above you, feet on either side of your head
>She gets down on her knees and leaves her rump inches from your face
>Her lingerie sits between you and her butt, and you notice a wet patch on it as well
>You’re exhausted and you decide to protest
“H-hey, I need a—“
>”Ah ah, zip it! You’re not done with your lesson yet.”
>You try to move away from her butt, but two wolfesses from the pack grabbed your wrists and held them down, leaving you unable to move away
>She slowly peels off her panties in front of you agonizingly slowly
>You catch a whiff of her scent, it’s smells both coppery and sweet
>Her musk surrounds your face and it succeeds in making you crave for more
>You attempt to get a taste by moving your head up, but she pulls away just before you can get your mouth near
>She looks back at you with a smirk
>”Ah ah ah~ You need to stay obedient and do what we say, understand?”
>You whimper and weakly nod while she slowly lowers her butt down near your face again, tail wagging excitedly
>The girls holding down your wrists made sure to also hold down your shoulders for added measure to keep you obedient
>When her butt is a few centimeters above your face, she wiggles her hips left and right to produce muffled claps from her cheeks
>To further tease you, she reached back and spread her cheeks apart, giving you a clear view of her vagina and anus
>The smell of her musk increased tenfold, and caused you to squirm under the grasps of the wolfesses holding you down
>But you weren’t going anywhere
>”Aww, what’s wrong sweetie? Do you want taste of this wolf pussy?”
>She lets go of her cheeks which wobbled as they collided with each other
“Please…”
>You weakly grunted, but this wasn’t enough for Carol, who looked down at you and grinned while flashing her teeth
>”Well, this is a lesson after all, so if you want a reward, you’re going to have to do something for me.”
>She gave a light smack to her ass which sent light jiggles through her cheeks
>”If you want to eat me out, you’re going to have to howl.”
>What
>The wolves holding you down started giggling as you became flustered
“I, uh, I don’t know—“
>”Awroooooo~!”
>Carol’s howl reverberated through the room, and all of the girls followed suit with their own chorus of howls
>”Come on, Anon! You can do it! Howl! Show me what you got!”
>You nervously open your mouth, and try to mimic the pack
“arooo-uh…”
>A very soft and weak howl came from your lips which unsurprisingly satisfied no one
>The girls started laughing at your embarrassing howl
>”Oh come on now Anon, don’t be such a baby! I know you can do better than that!”
>Carol started bouncing up and down which made her butt nearly collide with your face
>So close, yet so far apart
>”Awrooooooo~!”
>Another howl breaks out from Carol, and all of the girls responded in turn
>So you try a second time
“Awrooo~”
>Carol seemed satisfied, but she was looking for more
>”Louder Anon! Show me how much you want this wolf pussy! Awrooooooo~!”
>A third chorus of howls broke out, and you finally decided to up your game
>God this is humiliating
>You breath deep and let out a howl
“Awrooooooo~!”
>This seemed to satisfy the girls, because they responded with howls of their own
>”That’s it, Anon, you’re a quick learner! Get ready for your reward.”
>All of a sudden, the ass that eclipsed over your face dropped down, smothering you in flesh and fur
>Her ass was incredibly soft, like two pillows squishing either side of your cheeks
>You crane your neck forward to get to your prize, but you struggle trying to get through Carol’s cheeks
>She helps you by using her hands to spread them apart, and your lips finally reach her pussy
>It tastes sweet and coppery, overwhelming your tongue with something you’ve never experienced
>You arousal becomes apparent as your member stiffens back up again
>”Oooh, that’s it boy, get right in there.”
>Carol grinds on your face by wiggling her butt side to side, smearing you with her juices and smothering you deeper in her ass
>Her grinding causes you to buck your hips in response
>Pre is dripping from your cock as you moan in Carol’s pussy
>Some of the spectating pack members move closer to you
>Though you can’t see anything, the shifting weight in the mattress makes it apparent
>One is rubbing the inside of your thigh as another is licking your stomach
>More girls soon follow as you feel their hands and tongues surround your body
>Every part of your legs, stomach, and chest are groped and kissed
>Their soft caress overwhelms your senses, causing you to buck again
>They seem to be annoyed by this as they hold down your ankles, not letting you move in the slightest
>All the while, you’ve been eating out Carol and her climax is reaching its peak
>You can barely hear her panting and moaning as she bounces up and down on you
>It’s getting hard to breath under her
>”Oooh god~ I’m so close”
>She reaches down to grab hold of your hands
>”Oh—oh god, I’m—ah, cumming~!”
>She presses her rump hard onto your face and her vagina clamps down on your tongue
>Her sweet juices invade your mouth and nearly drowns you
>You’re greedily licking her cum as it fills your tongue with a pleasant taste
>After a few moments she finally gets up off of you
>Fresh, cool air finally hit to your face and you take in lungfuls of it
>Your face is covered in her juices
>Carols looks at you to admire her handiwork and a smile forms on her muzzle
>”Heh, you really enjoyed that Anon, didn’t you?”
>You weakly nod as the wolfesses restraining your arms licking off any remaining juices from your face
>They also occasionally nibble your ears and cheeks
>In the middle of your tongue bath Beth spreads your legs open and sits between them
>”Don’t go passing out on us, understand? Your lesson has just begun~”
>You look up to her, eyes wide with fear
>This is going to be a long night

>"Yeah so I was checking out this video I got linked to on awood.com and it was really--"
"Awood?"
>"Yeah! Like a wolf howling. Awoo'd. It's this fetish site for wolves domming human boys."
"Wow, they have an entire website just for human guys getting dominated?"
>"Oh no, there's like, a hundred of them. You got awoo'd, yeen'd, yeen'd, wink'd, claw'd--that's for felines in general but there's also sub-sites for all the different kindsa cats..."
"Geeze. I didn't realize--"
>"Then you've got stuff'd for Thanksgiving, elk'd for reindeer on Christmas, spook'd for halloween, hopp'd for bunnies especially on Easter."
"Okay wow that is a lot of information all at--"
>"Then it gets more obscure. Trot'd, squeak'd, trunk'd, yote'd, gote'd, milk'd, scale'd, mustelid'd--that one's a mouthful--beep'd for sheep, uh..."
>she tails off, getting more interested in flicking through what must be a ludicrous amount of porn on her phone
>"Let's see, capybara...capybara...damn it."
>she looks up from her phone give you the bare trace of a grin
>"Hey dude, wanna help me make a new website?"

Humans went extinct for some reason, animals evolved into anthros, and then they decided to resurrect humans but as their servants.

With an inescapable disease ravaging the world, the few healthy humans all froze themselves in a vault to wait for it to all blow over. They overslept by a long shot. Animals began to evolve and take humanities place. They only have vague memories of humans, becoming like myths. They progressed to our general level of technology and are doing fairly well for themselves. And then they found the vault.

>Doberman marine lady opening up one of these mysterious. But somehow... nostalgic cases
>the frost fades, and a face is revealed
>it’s... she knows this person. She doesn’t know why or how. But she *knows* this person
>it’s her best friend, she doesn’t know his name.
>but one thing for sure is that she knows that they somehow belong together
Really a late stage society finding their precursor human makers/predecessors sounds more up /collared/‘s alley. But all the same it’s a great story setting overall

sounds like it would work well in /adhg/ to me.
>humans are disoriented
>there's hardly any of them left
>anthros are protective and want to keep them as a healthy population for posterity's sake

>Working out at the gym.
>You usually go for the less populated hours, fewer girls are around to drool at you.
>Currently you're just doing some cardio work, just a nice jog on one of the treadmills.
>Unfortunately, unlike usual, there's an anthro doing her own workout on one of the benches.
>She's lifting several times your weight and you can see her staring at you in the mirror.
>You can't tell what species she is, but those horns and ears are unusual.
>Eventually your hour-long jog comes to an end, normally you'd extend it, but you'd rather not get stared at any further.
>Heading into the locker room, you debate whether or not you want to shower here or go home to shower.
>Going home means that every fur you pass on the way will be able to smell all of your post-workout sweat and pheromones.
>Your train of thought is interrupted by creaking of metal, a surge of paranoia kicks in and you whirl around.
>There's nothing behind you.
>You halfheartedly laugh off your fear as you strip down.
Standing at your open locker, you quietly mutter to yourself, "Should I shower here or go home to do it?"
"I'd say here, you stink," comes the unexpected reply.
>Whipping around fast enough to stumble puts you face to face, or rather face to stomach given how tall she is, with the girl you saw earlier.
>You can't even get out a cry before she's picked you up by the shoulders and thrown you onto her head.
>Her two paws pin you to her head, one on your lower back and the other cupping your ass.
She buries her muzzle into your balls, taking a deep huff and moaning out, "Nice..." before tasting you with her long tongue.
>It slides across and lifts your sack, that, combined with the occasional thrilling scrape of her fangs, gets your shaft firm and grinding against her nose.
>She continues for a dozen or so licks before she pulls you back a bit.
>Instinctively, you hold onto her horns to prevent falling while her maw yawns wide, catching your member in her jaws as she does.
>She lets her jaws slowly close as she pulls your hips back to her muzzle, pausing only to use her tongue so she can get your balls into her spacious maw, and the side of your dick drags along her fangs all the way.
>Fully enveloped, she closes her mouth and locks you within her muzzle before allowing her tongue to do as it wishes.
>It stays agile and in constant motion, she goes from grinding you against the ridges on the roof of her mouth to coiling around and milking to slurping on your sack.
>You try to hump into her muzzle, but you can't get any deeper and the best you can speak is just moans and other cries.
>The relentless and rapid pace drive you to the edge, then proceed to push you over it.
>She doesn't slow down or give you any rest as your seed spills out, your hands gripping her horns as it does.
>The taste seems to draw a purr from her and the vibration coaxes more cream out.
>When it becomes apparent that she's not going to stop at all, you try to get out a plea for her to stop.
>All it does is get her purring kicked up a notch.
...
>You feel like a juice box that's been sucked dry.
>The last drop of your juice drips out of your after your tenth, or was it eleventh, orgasm.
>She finally slides you out of her lips, using her tongue to drag off any driblets before setting you on the ground.
>Lulling her cum-coated tongue out, she shows you what you've poured into her before tilting her head back and swallowing.
"Thanks for the protein shake, hon," she thanks you with a smug look, "Let me know if you want me to do it again, or if you want to return the favor~"
>She gives you a generous hip sway as she walks out of the locker room.
>You can't help but fall to the side and pass out.

>be you, silver spoon middle child
>family throws extravagant parties every other month
>probably celebrating another hostile takeover of some random startup company
>you're a natural shut-in with no connection to the opulence outside of your infinitely-fed supply of geek paraphernalia and an internet connection
>hardly feel that much relation to your own older siblings
>but that doesn't stop your anthro sister from getting tanked, stumbling her way back up stairs and pestering you endlessly to "let loose" and that you're "too old not to have a gf"
>naturally she stands a full head over her older brother and two and some change for you
>despite the fact that you're the only human between a mixed-species couple
>and naturally, she won't take your noes and indifferent grunts for an answer

>Hyena rival is irritated that you are no longer keeping up with your gains.
>She wants you to stay just a little bit behind to keep herself motivated to improve.
>To ensure you're getting enough protein to build your muscles, she pins you down and forcefully breastfeeds you.
>There's some justification, hyena milk is very protein dense, but now she's calling you 'Momma's little boy' and has promised to do so until you surpass her.
>H0XMAW

>You've been the henchman for this weird coyote girl for a couple months now.
>She paying good money, but you have no idea why she's obsessed with catching this roadrunner, a roadrunner with thick thighs and a fat ass at that.
>Couldn't she just hunt one of the regular ones around? You've caught a few yourself for dinner.
>Anyways, watching the roadrunner's ass bounce as she darts away is a decent enough perk.
>As for the coyote, she's a tad scrawny, but still somehow strong enough to push boulders and throw anvils.
>You've no idea how neither of you have died yet, she gets blown up and crushed with disturbing regularity and just... walks it off.
>But as of late, the usual surprise fuckups have been directly involving you instead of just her.
>It used to be something like: A bomb goes off next to your boss and she's left with singed fur.
>Now it's: A bomb goes off next to your boss and she's flung ass-first onto your face.
>Just last week the roadrunner led your boss off a cliff edge while you were at its base and, as your boss was falling, ran down to pass you somehow leaving you naked.
>Then your boss fell on you, just in the perfect position to have you hotdog her, naturally.
>Hell, even two days ago your boss managed to fumble a grenade towards you without it's pin.
>Miraculously you survived unharmed, but all your clothes got shredded to shit, because of course they did.
>You had to go the rest of the day nude in the sun.
>Somehow you didn't get sunburnt to hell, but the 'lewd accidents' increased dramatically.
>It was difficult to keep your eyes from wandering, even when hers did.
>You're getting blown up as much as your coyote boss is, but she's getting covered in ash and you're getting stripped.
>It's like a fucking anime at this point, but you're in too deep to get out now.
>At least she can make decent food with the groceries you buy, guess there's something her 'Certified Genius' card can attest to.

>Another night indistinguishable from hundreds, thousands that came before
>Loneliness, emptiness, desolation, monotony. A cold dark sky wheels above the patchwork ruin of this tower's roof. Chill air rustles my fur, but the cold does not touch me.
>I look into the shattered mirror and no longer think I see a stranger. A monster, yes, but no stranger.
>I do not remember the face that once was mine. Too many days have passed for me to recall it.
>I am a grotesque mishmash of animal features: square muzzle that makes me think jaguar or hyena but is neither, thick muscular neck, a dark brown pelt lightly spotted along my sides, a stubby, wispy tail. Small pointed horns that curve inward toward one another, like no goat I have ever seen – perhaps I am a demon.
>Cruel golden eyes that betray nothing human. No intelligence. No soul.
>Hands like paws, with short fingers, thick black pads and claws fit to puncture hides, but are so poor for grasping tools and other delicate work – I did such things once, I know, but it has been so long that I do not remember how.
>I am thick with muscle. My breasts are small doughy lumps that hang from bulging pectorals, all their weight gathered behind the nipple. Six more nipples, smaller still, dot my abdomen, invisible in my thick fur.
>I am waiting for something. What is it? I have forgotten. I devised a plan, but it has been years. I must wait.
>A voice.
>"Hello?" he calls. Deep. Masculine. Uncertain. The sound echoes. It is very faint.
>My ears flick. He is somewhere below. He has passed beneath the stone arch, walking around the heavy oak doors that never close, for they are broken and the hinges too rusted to move. Snow and old dried leaves have blown into the entry hall. Vines that grew in planters near the door have curtained the doors themselves and extend their tendrils just inside, as far as the light reaches: nature attempting to reclaim this place.
>I leave my skull. I sense my domain -- this castle and the miles of wintry forest that enclose it. It is a snowglobe I cannot see beyond. If I focus I see movement. The tiny antlike dots that are moving creatures grow larger, clearer. I can see. I peer through the broken doors of the entry hall.
>It is a man. I see a pale face, but the rest of his body is clothed totally in boots and gloves and a long dark coat dusted with fresh fallen snow.
>Charcoal hair is tousled, parted off-center and swept to one side, just long enough for a damp lock to cling to his brow. His beard is thick but neat, wiry, lighter than the hair on his scalp and brows for the white and light grey hairs that grow at random. This, too, has collected snow.
>He is weary, although the lines, the bags under his eyes seem as though they are permanent fixtures on a serious face. The skin of his lips is cracked, peeling. His ears are pink.
>Yes! This! This? This is what I have lowered the barrier for. He is here, finally. I have waited for so long!
>I notice the pounding of my heart upon my breastbone, and yet I cannot bother to stir. I do not know how to approach this prey. I seem to remember that this is a delicate creature. I must say a certain thing, I must perform certain actions before he can be mine. I try to remember.
>It is too far away, too long away. I do not know.
>But he is cold. He has taken off his gloves so he can breathe into his own cupped hands and hold them to his freezing ears. He walks deeper into the gloom, his shoulders hunched. He calls out again, but I can tell from the sound of his voice that he expects no answer. He has no reason to. Clearly, no human being has lived in this place in a very long time.
>Deeper in the receiving lounge, I focus my energies on the half-charred logs that lie cold in the hearth. I need only to focus on a single point that begins to smoke, then flicker with red light. By the time the man has shuffled in, the heavy door groaning as he pushes it aside, a small fire crackles.
>"Hello? Hello! I'm sorry to intrude – where are you?"
>He approaches cautiously, glancing about himself, but he must be snowblind for he appears not to focus on the dark shapes that fill the room. He must know he is alone. There is no movement, not a breath or a heartbeat here. Only soft crackling as the fire gradually grows and its light reflects off the brick at the back of the hearth.
>He gives up searching and crouches before the fire, holding out his hands to warm himself as my consciousness recedes, draws away from the room and back into my own skull, where I blink and begin to stir from the pile of furs I have made my bed.
>I am as comfortable moving on four legs as two. My thighs are short, my arms long, and when I stand to descend the spiraling staircase I lumber in an apish way. When I drop onto my hands I am grace and power. In this way I pad silently across the tattered runner that leads from the staircase until I come to the door he has left ajar.
>I see his body silhoutted against the fire as he stands, rubbing at his arms to work feeling back into them, and to look around again.
>"I know you're here... why will you not answer me?" The words are muttered, tinged with... fear. He is confused. Frightened, but attempting not to display this.
>I try to conjure my own voice but something in my throat has atrophied. The sound I produce is hoarse, guttural, unpleasant, nothing smooth and easy like I know it once was.
>"Whelllcomm.."
>He jolts at my rasping voice and whirls to face me as I step forward, still moving on all four limbs to make myself smaller, less shocking. Even as I crouch low my head is almost level with his chest. If I stood, I would tower over him.
>He shrieks, shuffles back rapidly, whirls and makes to run but catches his thigh on a chair which had been angled toward the fire. He stumbles awkwardly but does not fall. So much happens all at once. Without thinking I bound toward him, claws scraping against the stone floor.
>He darts toward the wall that, if he follows it, will take him to the door he entered from. Despite my size I am faster and cut him off, rising on my hind legs and slapping a palm to the wall to block his escape with my arm.
>Time seems to freeze while he stares up at me in pure horror.
>A flash of steel! A dagger I did not realize he carried slashes at my muzzle. I flinched away from the attack but the blade still grazes a whisker pad.
>With an angry snarl I backhand him across the face, hard. He looses his footing and tumbles to the floor, but before he can scramble away I drop onto him, grabbing each of his wrists in my monstrous paws so he cannot slash me again with the knife. He kicks furiously at me from below and I bellow into his face, my lips pulled back from gums and fangs. He is thrashing, grunting, yanking hard against my paws.
>"Ss...Stop!" I manage to say, but my voice is too weak. Too hoarse. He can't even hear me over his own noises. He is kicking me in my ribs and belly. It hurts. I am becoming angry. He has rejected my hospitality! I do not want to hurt him, but my patience is wearing out and soon I will snap.
>I try more.
>"Sstop! Stop! Won't hurt... human! Be still!"
>He begins to realize that although I have him pinned, I am not biting him and I have not beat his fist against the floor to force the knife from his hand. He still holds it, but at an angle that cannot hurt me while his wrist is pinned. He yanks his face to the side and screws his eyes shut, his chest heaving wildly, mouth open and panting.
>Little flecks of blood have appeared on his cheek. I am startled and dismayed. I have injured him! But then I realize the cut from my face has dripped on him.
>"What do you want, demon!?" It is a wild screech. He continues to tug at my hands, but is no longer kicking.
>"Calm. Calm, human." I sit down on his legs which he does not like; he twists underneath me, but my weight has him pinned. He turns his face back to me, so terrified, hyperventilating. His lips are twisted around his teeth which are clenched together, his nostrils flare.
>I release his left hand – the one without the knife, and immediately he tries to hit me with his fist. I grab him again, after a short struggle in which he renews all of his annoying kicking and thrashing, but I growl sharply at him as if he is a disobedient pup and slap his hand down against the floor.
>”No hitting! Human will be still!”
>Carefully, I let go of him again. He is still so frightened; his eyes dart desperately around, trying to find some way out of this situation before snapping back to me in horror. His now freed hand crosses his chest, to protect himself I suppose.
>Moving slowly, still lightly panting from powerful jaws held two feet above his face, I cup his cheek. He flinches from me, screwing his eyes shut again. He begins to shake his head.
>”No, no, no, nonononono...” He is almost sobbing.
>”Human. Shhh. Shhh. Will not hurt you.” I pet him gently on his cold pink cheek. The hairs of his beard tickle at my calloused pad. His head hair is damp with melted snow and sweat; it sticks to his face near his temple. My blunt fingertips and the thick pads on their undersides offer me little dexterity, but with a long, curved claw I carefully sweep this lock of hair behind his ear.
>Slowly he opens his eyes, his entire face contorted with confusion. He is still squirming beneath me, but I think he cannot help but do so. I notice he looks pained. I shift my weight so less of it rests on his belly.

"There we go. Perfect."
>You stand back up and take in the sight of your newly put up tent
>The rain fly's a little fucked up, but it'll do the trick
>Turning back around, you look at the campsite you're staying at
>Except for you and your equipment, it's pretty much empty
>A couple of your friends were supposed to be here
>For one reason or another, they all bailed at the last minute
>Even though you and them had been talking about a camping trip for weeks
>But you still wanted a weekend out of the house
>And the forecast was about as perfect as it gets for camping
>So now you're here by yourself
>Whatever, they don't know what they're missing
>It genuinely is a beautiful day outside
>Well, what's left of it, anyways
>It's beginning to get dark, and you still need to make dinner
>Thankfully you marinated some steak in advance and you've already got a fire going, so it won't take long
>You get your frying pan out, and put it on the grate over the fire pit to heat up
>While the cuts of meat are sizzling away, you hear another distant burst of laughter
>There's another group somewhere nearby where you're staying
>Which you're perfectly okay with
>They're far away enough where you can't hear most of what they're doing
>The occasional sound has been sneaking through the trees to find you, though
>In addition to a couple whiffs of pot
>Not a big deal either, we've all done it
>And if there's a time and a place to be smoking it, it's definitely while doing dumb shit in the woods with your friends
>You slice through one of the pieces of steak to check it's doneness
>Yeah, looks cooked enough for you
>You hack off a slice, and pop it in your mouth
>Tastes pretty damn good, too
>While seated on one of the more comfortable logs, you balance your plate on your legs and eat
>A few minutes go by, until some crunching comes from the path you hiked up to get here
>Turning to look, you see a canine girl looking straight back at you
>You're not sure, you're not the greatest with species
>She waves a paw and breaks from the path, stepping into your campsite
>Just from looking at her, you instantly know where she came from
>She's wearing a tie-dye crop top, and jean shorts resting high on her waist
>It's as if she walked directly from Shakedown Street into the forest
>"'Sup."
"Hey."
>"Name's Kate, what about yours?"
"Anon."
>A lazy grin sprawls across her muzzle, and she leans in for a fist bump
>You tap your closed hand against her paw, and she sits down none too gracefully on another log
>Oh, she's completely stoned
>"What's good, Anon?"
"Not much. Just eating dinner, might go for a walk in a bit. What about you?"
>"Cool. Cool, cool. I gotta grab somethin' from the car. My fuckin' dumbass friend forgot the Jiffy Pop. Like, how do you even forget something like that? You ain't camping without Jiffy Pop..."
>She hangs her head, and shakes it in sullen frustration
"Damn, that sucks. Sorry about that."
>"I fuckin' know, right?"
>Her ears twitch towards her campsite when another uproar echoes through the trees
>"Shit, I should probably get goin'. Catch ya later, Anon."
"Yeah. Nice to meet you, Kate."
>You give her a farewell wave as she vanishes down the trail
>For a second, you get worried about her getting lost
>She'll probably fine, canines have good instincts for that kind of thing
>With the departure of your guest, you put away your food and toss a couple more bits of wood on the fire
>In the spirit of being among nature and unplugging, you crack open the book that you brought with you
>After only a couple pages go by, you hear the same crunches, in addition to the telltale rattle of corn kernels on aluminum
>Kate's brandishing a couple servings worth of popcorn
>She takes a few paces in your direction, and throws one at you to make up the rest of the distance
>"Enjoy!" she yells, while returning to her weed-laden headquarters
>You'll never say no to free food
>You're not sure if there's something you're missing
>The coyote seemed very adamant about having some, but you're not quite seeing it
>Again, free food; no complaints
>You stash away the aluminum carcass of the snack
>It's late enough now that you climb into your tent, and read your book in there until you're ready to go to sleep
>The instant you turn your light off and lay down your head, you're drifting off to sleep
>You wake back up after a little bit
>Two things immediately come to mind:
>The fact that it's still dark out, and that you're pretty cold
>Flailing around your arm, you feel that you left your sleeping bag completely unzipped
>Yep, guess that'll do it
>As your hand wanders for the zipper, you start to become aware of a weight pressing down on your lower half
>And a whole lot of snuffling
>Man, where the hell is the zipper?
>Closing your sleeping back drops to the bottom of the list of your priorities when you hear a deep, inhaling gasp, followed by a breathy "Jesus Christ"
"Whuh the hell?"
>"Mhmmm... Holy shit, Anon. You smell so fuckin' good."
>In what little residual light there is, you see that your new friend Kate has made herself at home in your tent
>She's positioned herself between your legs
>The coyote is hard at work taking in your scent, with her snout firmly planted in your crotch
>You try and wriggle away from her, but her arms have her locked in place around you
>Even if she wasn't, the tent has little space for you to escape into
"Kate, stop, please," you plead
>Either she didn't hear you, she doesn't care, or she's too stoned for any of that to matter
>She starts working the waistband of your pants
>By the time you reach to keep them up, the garment is already out of your grasp, wrapped around your ankles
>"There we go," the canine murmurs
>Your manhood is now fully exposed to the night air
>Her hot breath washes over your groin, heating you back up where it counts
"Please, I don't-"
>Again, your request goes ignored
>With your pants down, she wastes no time getting to work
>Her wide, long tongue runs over your length, from tip to base
>It makes several trips up and down, coating your member's entire surface with a layer of saliva
>She pauses, licking her lips in usual canine fashion
"Kate..." you croak out, hoping that she'll listen
>The coyote makes eye contact with you for a moment, before fully plunging her muzzle down on your cock
>With this, the majority of your resistance has disappeared
>Her mouth moves up and down over you eagerly, but methodically
>Each gentle caress of her tongue on your tip forces your head back into the ground
>While she teases more and more twitches and throbs out of you, you feel a paw leave your thigh
>You look down to watch her undo the fly of her shorts, and slip a paw underneath her own waistband
>It doesn't take long before the squelches of her pussy join the sloppy sounds of her blowjob
>The reek of weed on her fur melds with the heady scent of her sex
>Combined, the two smells are nothing short of intoxicating
>Your brain is in a messy, smoldering haze
>All rational thought is gone, replaced with the carnal need for release
>You buck your hips into Kate's mouth, and she redoubles her efforts on both you and herself
>The ministrations of her muzzle on your shaft speed up, becoming frenzied
>Her tongue is coiling up and down your length as fast as it can, as if it's trying to cover the entire thing at once
>The thrusts of her paw into herself have also accelerated, the wet sounds of her palm slapping against herself coming faster
>The smells
>The sounds
>The pleasure
>It's all becoming too much
"I- I'm gonna-"
>Hearing this, Kate slams the full length of her snout down onto your cock
>Your hips jolt off the ground one more time, and your world explodes into white light
>Rope after rope of your seed fires off into her mouth
>For each pulse of cum you release, she greedily sucks it down
>As your own climax slows, the coyote's body seems to shudder against you, and she lets out a contented moan
>She pulls off of you, and ventures up the tent until you're face to face with quite the toothy smile
>Her soaked paw lowers into your mouth
>You're too spent to fight it, and you suck her juices out of the fur on her fingers
>She withdraws her arm and fully lowers herself onto
>Without any words, she drags her tongue all over your face and neck, and rests her head on the crook of your neck
>You're not too sure how to feel about what just happened
>But at least you're not cold anymore

>She walks with you side-by-side, carefully guiding the two you over to the central castle.
>There's two fully armored guards with spears at the open gate, they halt you both and ask for ID.
>She pulls hers out of one pockets on her belt, you just draw it out of your wallet and they let you both through.
>Guess they're serving alcohol here.
>The guards at the gate narrow it enough so that two people can't comfortably get through shoulder-to-shoulder, so you fade back and let her take lead.
>You stay following her for a bit past the gate, until your eyes get drawn to her swaying hips and tail.
>It takes you longer than you'd like to admit that you noticed she wasn't wearing anything under her skirt armor.
>She starts to slow down until you reach the side of a tent where she stops midstride, turns a little, and shifts her tail to the right to give you a peek.
>Dumbly, you stare as she smirks at you over her shoulder before pressing on.
>Eventually, she leads you to a 'hidden' part of the castle, it's just a door, but there's nothing around to indicate it as anything.
>She opens the door and gestures for you to enter, she follows you in and closes the door behind you.
>There's another door and this corridor is more vocal.
>The moment you open the second door you hear the sounds of cheers and jeers and there's a stand in front of you.
>It's a vendor renting out all sorts of weapons and armor, including stuff that looks like just a sheet of hide.
>Your GF immediately steps by you and orders a 'barbarian set' for you.
The vendor hops to it and your beloved turns to face you to lean in and whisper in your ear, "Welcome to the private arena, love."
A steel clad paw goes down to grope you, "I hope you're ready to duel, I'm not on my heat meds, so I'm going to make you to put pups in me when I win. We'll figure something out if you beat me, good luck."

>"Hello Mr. Anon! I'm Grace, your new emotional support animal!"
>the cheery golden retriever in your doorway wags her tail vigorously and hands over a sheaf of paperwork
>"Here are the forms you'll need to sign, as well as the details of your care package."
>you stare at her in disbelief
>what the hell is she talking about?
>her shirt at least, corroborates her story, the words 'Emotional Support Dog' on her chest stretched by a large bust
>the rest of the garment hugs her slim waist and hips that widen out into voluptuous thighs and toned legs
>her gold-colored fur is tinged a little red, the shaggiest parts braided together with flower hair berets
>and her eyes are pink, lined by a smile that never seems to leave her face
>finally you gather the words to speak
"Lady, what the hell are you talking about? I never requested an emotional support animal. I've never heard of an anthro doing the job either."
>you try to pass the packet of forms back to the retriever, but she shakes her head and pushes them back toward you
>"New studies by Aardman-Deinemeijer have shown across-the-board success with human-anthro pairings when it comes to problems such as depression, social anxiety, eating disorders, and more!"
>you roll your eyes
>she's obviously reading off a script
"I still didn't order this service."
>that smile finally breaks, the edges of her mouth twitching downward
>"Oh, I'm sure you did. I have the exact address right here."
>she taps a section on the top form that has your personal information on it
>in fact, it has more than just your address
>full name, place of employment, insurance info, SSN
>the lot
>how the fuck did she get this?
>"One of the issues you mentioned was memory problems. You may have forgotten requesting our service?"
>that can't be right
>your memory is fine
>sure you forget stuff once or twice, but never anything like ordering a service anthro
"I don't know what you're talking about. You should leave."
>the smile breaks completely, and she frowns
>a pout so heart-wrenching it almost melts through your annoyance and consternation at her unwelcome presence
>"I understand. I'll just need you to sign a refusal of service form. May I come in so I can walk you through it?"
>and she's giving you the big, pretty pink puppy-dog eyes
>you're so entranced you can't help but step aside to allow her in
>"Thank you, Anon. You really--"
>she halts and looks around, mouth hanging open slightly and ears perked
>her wagging tail goes still
>"Oh dear. Is this--Is this how you normally have your home?"
>she stands in your kitchen looking like she stepped into a murder scene
"What are you talking about?"
>the retriever--whose name you realize you never caught--gestures toward your kitchen table
>"It's a mess! You have papers lying around..."
"That's the mail from the last couple days."
>she ignores you
"...and food, dirty dishes laying about. Piling up in the sink."
>you were getting around to washing those
>"Is that garbage just laying out?"
>no, that's your recycling bin, next to the trash can
>she tuts and shakes her head
>you think she's just blowing things out of proportion, but then she turns back to you with eyes full of concern
>"How have you been eating? You've been getting proper meals, haven't you?"
>you shrug
"I guess I eat out more than I should. Busy with work. It's not that bad."
>Grace whines and folds her ears
"...is it that bad?"
>she sighs, stepping over to the kitchen table to brush aside the small pile of junk mail on one end
>"It hurts me to say, Anon, but it really is bad. What do your friends say when they visit you? Or your family?"
>you shake your head, feeling more and more self-conscious
"I don't really have people over. But I still hang out with my friends once in a while. I'm fine."
>that frown just gets deeper
>Grace gestures to the spot she cleared on the table
>"I guess if you're absolutely sure, you can sign that form and I’ll go."
>you hesitate handing the forms back over
>maybe you’ve been a little lonely lately, and could use a little help getting motivated to clean up and take care of things around the house
“How uh, how much am I paying for this, if I wanted to do it? Is there any commitment?”
>Grace’s ears perk up again, and her eyes flicker with renewed happiness
>”Oh, none at all on both counts! Completely covered by your insurance, and you can cancel at any time."
>you chew your lip and juggle the options
>if it's really no-commitment, what's the harm in giving it a try?
"Okay, maybe I'll give it a try. Just for a few days."
>Grace gasps and hops on her paws
>she's back to the picture of pure canine joy and enthusiasm with wagging tail and excited panting and bright eyes shining
>but for just a moment, you think you see her expression change
>from pure joy, to predatory triumph
>but it's gone in a flash
>maybe just a trick of the light
>"Oh that's wonderful Anon! You won't regret signing up for our service. I promise, it'll be the best thing that ever happened to you."
>Grace trots over to you, taking the paperwork and gently pulling it from your hands
>then with the other paw pats your head
>"Good boy!"
>you quickly step away
"Easy. I don't go for the good boy stuff."
>Grace snuffs through her snout
>"Oh! Of course. I wouldn't want to make you uncomfortable."
>she turns away from you, tail swishing against your leg a moment before she returns to the door
>you could have sworn you heard her muttering something
>"...work on that too..."
>but then she's too far for you to hear more
>"I'll go get my things from the car! You're not going to regret this."
ONE WEEK LATER
>you scrub the dishes from dinner and set them aside for Grace to dry them
>she hums a sugary pop song as she works, tail sweeping in a wide arc
>and once the task is entirely done, she beams at you
>"Good boy!"
>you frown back
"You know I don't like when you say that.”
>"Oh, but I thought you were starting to like it. You said you were starting to feel okay about it last night before you went to bed."
>did you say that?
>you don't think you did, but Grace has been catching a lot of things you've forgotten over the week
>as well as keeping you on track with work, keeping the house clean, and going to bed on time
>you know she's called you 'good boy' a few times, and you guess it's a bit more tolerable
>still, you shake your head
"Just leave it, okay."
>Grace sighs and wipes off her paws with a towel
>then she rests a paw on your shoulder
>"If you say so. But don't forget you promised to let me help you get acclimated to body contact. It's important to be able to connect with others."
>she's been hounding you about that too
>you guess you'd better keep that promise, or else you'll get the puppy-dog eyes again
>like when she said you should start cooking every meal for yourself
>and her
"Alright, we can work on that some."
>taking your agreement as consent, Grace grabs your other shoulder and pulls you into a hug
>"Perfect!"
>your face is pillowed between her breasts
>despite her cuddly appearance and bubbly demeanor, you find she's much stronger than you and keeps you locked in that hug
>even when you start to pull away
>Grace admonishes you
>"Now Anon, we can't make improvements if you don't commit. Why don't we lay on the couch like this for a while?"
>you don't have much a choice when she drags you along to the living room and pulls you onto the couch
>she holds you there, her plush body a perfect bed
>you let the gentle rise and fall of her breathing put you to sleep
>the last thing you hear as Grace rests a paw on your head
>"Good boy."
ONE MONTH LATER
>you lay in Grace's arms, squirming as her paws rub over bare skin
>her fur pressing against your back as she spoons you
>once she started sharing your bed, she had gotten a lot more physical
>and wouldn't let you wear clothes to sleep
"I just--I don't think I'm comfortable with it. I need my job."
>Grace's whiskers tickle your ears as she shushes you
>"It's okay, Anon. Don't you remember how stressed your work makes you? How tired you are when you get home? As your service animal, I think it's in your best interest to stay at home with me."
>her paws stray further down, over your hips
>then teasing at your crotch
>you start to get hard at her touch
>Grace says it's just another way for you and her to bond
"But how will we pay the bills?"
>her soft laughter in your ear sends a shiver down your spine
>"You don't have to worry about money. I make plenty as a service animal. More than enough to take care you."
>Grace avoids touching your penis
>after all, that'd be inappropriate
>and instead strokes the inside of your thigh as she goes on
>"You don't want to go to work and leave me all alone, do you? No. You want to be my good boy. Besides, your job is so far away from my home in the suburbs."
>what is she talking about?
"Your house? Grace, I don't understand."
>you start to pull away, but your service anthro is still stronger than you
>she grabs your hips to keep you close
>"Oh, you forgot again. You agreed that once you quit your job, you'd come live with me. It's the only way to make sure you get the best quality care."
>you wrack your brain to remember agreeing to that
>you forget so much
>but if Grace says you said so, you trust her
>after all, things are so much better after she arrived
>you're eating healthier, your home is spotless, and she even has you going to the gym again
>so you relax into her arms
"I'll think about it once I've put in my two weeks."
>you feel Grace's entire body moving with the wag of her tail
"Good boy!"
THREE MONTHS LATER
>"Good boy! My good boy!"
>Grace slams her hips down against you again and again as she fucks you amazon
>she's had you working on your flexibility just so she could fold your legs back and reward you for being a good boy
>you moan out loud, at the mercy of your service anthro
>her tits bounce with every thrust, and her tail wags in a blur of ecstasy
>"Gimme a nice big load, Anon. You promised I'd be pregnant for our wedding day!"
>of course you did
>you don't want to disappoint her
>Grace fucks you into the bed harder and faster in a race to milk that load from you
>you grasp her forearms tight, the only thing you can do when she's riding you like this
>and Grace only relents when you screw up your eyes tight to blast the fifth climax of the day into her
>her thrusts slow down and she moans in satisfaction
>she still rolls her hips while milking the very last of your seed before releasing you to fall on her bed totally spent
>Grace folds you over onto your side to spoon you just how she likes
>she sighs happily as the pads of her paws explore your chest
>"I'm so glad you decided to be mine, Anon."

>Charlotte the Vixen and Alice the Coyote were the best of friends.
>They both loved living in the peaceful, quiet countryside.
>They often spend their days wiling away the hours at the local store.
>From the front porch their combined wisdom could solve all the world’s problems.
>Except one.
>”I just don’t get it Charlotte, What am I doing wrong?”
>Alice just couldn’t seem to find a man.
>”Girl, it’s not your fault!”
>Charlotte stopped to consider her advice a moment.
>”Well, it kinda is. You want a sophisticated human man, right?”
>Alice agreed.
>”Well then you’ve gotta learn to flirt like those socialites on TV!”
>The coyote groaned.
>”Flirt? Like tell him I like him? I tried that!”
>Charlotte leaned back in her chair and held out her pipe.
>”No girl, not like that at all. On TV, all the city people are mean to people they like, and nice to people they hate. You gotta flirt by being mean, but in a nice way.”
>Alice set her ears to 90°.
>One up, and one flat out to the side
>”I don’t think I understand…”
>Pointing with her pipe, Charlotte indicated a car approaching on the highway.
>”Look. There’s that new guy who moved out here from the city. When he gets here I’ll start, and you follow my lead.”
>”Okay…”
>And so it was that when the man arrived, he was greeted by two very promiscuous country canines.
>As he approached the steps to the little store they so loved, Charlotte greeted him.
>Well well! Look at the city slicker, pulling up in his fancy german car!
>Her tail waved back and forth through the gap in her chair as she spoke, and she concluded with a wink.
>The call was enough to stop the man in his tracks, although he seemed not to grasp the deeper meaning of it.
>He replied dismissively, and perhaps slightly annoyed.
“This car was made in Guatemala.”
>Still, the game was on.
>Charlotte elbowed Alice lightly, prompting her to join in.
>”Well uh… Pardon us! Mr. Gucci loafers!
>Alice wasn’t quite able to stifle a little laugh, pleased with her own joke.
>She cocked her head and looked at him with a big, innocent smile.
>The man, however, refused to part with his stormy disposition.
“I bought these shoes from a hobo.”
>Alice turned back to Charlotte, looking crushed.
>But while her friend may as well have been smacked with a newspaper, Charlotte wasn’t done yet.
>”Well Lah-dee-dah mister park avenue manicure~grrrrr”
>The little growl wasn’t a real one, she just rolled her tongue a bit.
>But the effort may as well have fallen on deaf ears.
“Sorry. I believe in good grooming.”
>Finished with the pleasantries, the man continued inside to do his business.
>Alice began to cry.
>She was scarcely able to choke out a word between sobs.
>”I..thought.. You..said..he’d..like..it”
>Now Charlotte was looking a little down too.
>”Easy girl. It’ll be okay. I’ll bet anything Ma has a pass at him in the store. Wanna see how she does it?”
>Ma vixen’s years of wisdom were on her side as the man strode into her little agricultural supply store.
>He chose not to greet the gray-muzzled woman as he picked up a pitchfork and bag of fertilizer.
>But that was okay. She was more than happy to start.
>”Back so soon sweetheart?”
>He gave no reply.
>He had more than enough of the local flavor for the day.
>It didn’t cross his mind for a moment that these animals had feelings too.
>He was about to learn it wasn’t all about him.
>The man laid his items on the counter in silence.
>”Keh! You’re not gonna grow nothing on the old Nymous place!”
>She narrowed her eyes with a wicked grin.
>”That’s why your daddy abandoned it.”
>She finally earned a response from the fed up farmer.
“Aw, what do you know.”
>”I know your soil PH is up around 9.6 and you need it 7 to 8 max.”
>The man turned around dismissively.
>He was not only ignoring her advice, but outright rejecting her help.
“Oh that’s just superstition! I-”
>”It isn’t superstition whippersnapper, it’s local history. Something you could really care to know more about.”
>As he whipped around to retort he was me with the vixen’s narrow eyes just inches from his own.
>Her pawpads traveled silently across the raised foundation, unlike his own loud stomps.
>As he tried to step away he felt five firm fingers digging into his asscheek.
>She leaned over him, resting her other arm across his shoulder.
>”Tell me. Do you have any idea what this place USED to be?”
>Breaching his personal space totally broke the man’s steely, grumpy demeanor.
>He shook his head a little bit, eyes wide with fear.
>”Let me offer you a demonstration <3.”
>Her maw stretched around his cheeks, and her long spade tongue dropped into his gaping mouth and down his throat.
>She used her free hand to hold his head in place, while her other sank its way beneath his belt to get a better feel.
>With his cries stifled by the vixen’s long tongue, the city slicker began to panic.
>Having lost the capacity for rational thought, he went weak at the knees.
>Perhaps he had wished that gravity would draw him away from his captor, but this was not the case.
>The wizened woman simply sashayed her paws as if part of a dance, pivoting him onto a nearby pile of feed sacks.
>After what felt like an eternity of occupation, the vixen smoothly withdrew her tongue from him, making a pop as it left his throat.
>Gasping, he looked left and right for a way out from under her but found none.
>”Comfortable dear?”
>Once again, he twitched his head back and forth.
>”Mmm. Me neither. GIRLS?”
>A loud tumble erupted from the front door, Accompanied by a frightened yip and some gekkering.
>”Would you help our new friend out of his trappings?”
>The girlfriends stumbled in from the porch embarrassed, but eager to learn from Ma’s technique.
>Having grown up with good country discipline they didn’t talk back.
>Respecting their elder’s wishes, they quickly pulled off his so-called Gucci loafers as well as his belt, pants and shirt.
>They were surprised to find that despite his poor attitude his dick was powerfully, painfully stiff.
>"See girls? It’s best to surprise them, it gets them excited where it counts.”
>Ma vixen, in her long voluminous dress, needed only to remove her silky panties.
>She wrapped them around two of her black, clawed fingers and took a brief sample of her aroma, before popping the package into man’s mouth.
>“Suck.”
>Thankfully her guest was taking quickly to his lesson in hospitality, and obeyed her without a thought.
>”Now girls, I’m about to show you why you should ditch the overalls and start dressing like ladies.”
>Keeping a hand very lightly against the man’s throat, she drew up her body on top of him.
>She towered over him as she straddled his hips.
>As she sank down, her dress spread out to cover the two of them such that the girls couldn't see more than an ankle of their mother, or any taboo bits of the man.
>Under the dress he could feel that remarkably, her skin was tight and muscles firm.
>She bore none of the effects of age that plagued his own kind.
>As he thought about his own kind, something occurred to him.
>The vixen tilted herself around and just as she was lined up to penetrate, he rose up his left hand.
>Even if he wasn’t guiltily savoring the musky panties in his mouth he was too shaken to speak. >He presented the gold band on the second finger to her.
>”Pity.”
>He breathed an inward sigh of relief.
>She stopped herself at the sight of it, clearly in recognition of the sanctity of marriage.
>”Girls, get a look at this.”
>As they shuffled closer, a distant part of his brain noticed they had his socks and boxers.
>”Humans can hardly smell, so they use these rings to show when they’re married to other humans.”
>Harmonic “oooh’s” came from the two of them.
>And then, with a rush of warmth and slickness she was over him, pressing herself down against his pelvis.
>”Ah, that’s very good.”
>She rose back up, carefully making sure not to let his tip drop out of her..
“Now see, since I’m dressed properly I can take this man right here on a bed of poultry seed, without indecently exposing myself.”
>She dropped again, more slowly, as if savoring the action.
>”Now I want the two of you to go get changed. When you get back you can both have a turn for practice.”
>The girls scurried out with their prizes to the old truck beside the store, which bore them away.
>As soon as they were gone Her muscles tensed and pace quickened.
>”And -ah- you young man!”
>She took the hand he had presented and popped out a tit for it to hold.
>It was barely loose enough to sag, still retaining a teardrop shape in the hand.
>”Are -ugh- getting a lesson on what -ngh- a real woman is like!”
>The four of them awoke when the rooster crowed the next morning.
>The man found he had slept remarkably well on his pallet of 50 pound sacks, beneath a blanket of dresses and stockings.
>He rose and began dressing himself.
>As he buckled his belt and gathered the things he had come to buy, Ma vixen lit up a cigarette.
>”You enjoy yourself? I sure hope so.”
>But his mind was on the things of the field, not the flesh.
“You watch me. I’ll grow something out there!”
>She strode over to him for one last goodbye peck.
>And as she did, she reached a hand into his bag of mixed seeds.
>Pinched between her elegant claws, was a filled and tied neon-green condom.
>She grinned.
>”Not if you’re planting gummy bears!”

>Omniwaifur takes you as hers.
>Immediately gets pregnant.
>A month later, you're caught off guard as she gets annoyed with being pregnant and speeds it up.
>She gives birth about five minutes later, in front of you.
>It looks like she laid an egg, except it's blue, white and green.
>On closer inspection, it's a planet, surrounded by a clear shell so you don't damage it, and the only living thing on it is grass.
>She tells you that she's just going to birth all of your children on the planet so she doesn't have to deal with pregnancy.
>Then she follows it up with stating that the two of you have to populate it now, down to the last tree.

"I'm getting close..." he murmured out.
>Beneath him was his landlady, a canine of some breed with her ankles locked behind his hips.
"Hmm, not this time," she whispered as she started to force him to start thrusting harder with her stronger legs.
>The panic on his face and his struggles to spill anywhere but in her got her laughing.
>Forced deep, eager seeds spread to try and find a fertile egg within.
>Failed and energy spent, he fell into her soft fur and embrace.
Speaking quietly, she wondered aloud, "Will it take this time?"
"What?" he replied, stirred from his calmness, "You told me you were on the pill."
"On a pill," she chuckled, "Once I'd learned that you'd gotten promoted, I wanted to... up the stakes. Didn't you read my letter congratulating you on getting promoted?"
>Racking his mind, he searched for any memory of such a letter, and found a scrap of it.
>He'd opened the letter, read through the congratulation but stopped about a quarter of the way through before just folding it back up and placing it on the countertop to be forgotten.
"No..." he weakly answered.
"You didn't? I even wrote it out manually, it wasn't quick to do..."
"Sorry..."
She gave a suffering sigh, "The big change I made to our deal was that I'd be randomly choosing between if I was using birth control, fertility pills, or a vitamin supplement when I'd come to 'collect your rent'. I have a jar with them mixed in, I don't look at which one I'm taking to keep the element of surprise."
>His shaft twitches unconsciously, earning her clenching down in return and a groan from her muzzle.
"Do you like it? This 'game' of ours?" she teases as he buries his face in her bosom to hide himself.
"Not knowing if you've had a litter of pups pumped out of you?" she continues, "I think you do, we both know you don't have to do these 'alternative payments' anymore, but every month you do and every week I come over to collect."

>"The key to a good and loyal human is fear. Not fear of you, but fear of everything else. Fear of his mistress will keep a human obedient, but not loyal. If your human feels safe only when you're around, he will do anything to remain by your side, where he knows he will be protected by the big scary world. Your absence should fill him with anxiety, wondering what he could have done to upset you enough to abandon him to the dangers of the world, while your presence should fill him with comfort and contentment. This fear must always be lurking in the back of his mind, to keep him docile, obedient, and above all, loyal."

>Anthro really likes facesitting you
>Does it even in a casual context
>Even if she's just chilling out watching tv, she wants your head under her ass
>Doesn't even let you decide when to breathe, she decides for you
>She's much stronger than you so there's not much you can do about it

>You're probably the only couple that has 'a bed' in the middle of their living room.
>It's not actually a bed, it has a mattress but the headboard is slanted back away from the mattress itself and cushioned.
>All to let her comfortably sit on your face while watching tv.
>With the regular couch you had previously, it was going to be uncomfortable for both of you.
>If you were laying on the couch, she'd have to sit across your face with your chin digging into her.
>There was a brief test where you'd sat in front of the couch for her to sit regularly, but it was nearly immediately canceled because she felt like she was going to snap your neck.
>The floor was also tried, you'd laid there with a pillow under your head in front of the couch, but you got achy from the floor and she wanted a full backrest.
>Of the three, the floor was the least uncomfortable, but still unappealing.
>She had to make do with simply sitting on your lap.
>Until you came up with a design, based somewhat on when she sat on your face while in bed and leaned back against the wall.
>It took having to convince her to allow you to get a new bed frame and mattress, a circular saw, a few 2x4s and some screws.
>Convincing her was the easy part, but finding the stuff you envisioned was a tad tricky.
>Ultimately it was doable, and you'd basically sawn off the headboard and tilted it roughly 30 degrees back, reattaching it and reinforcing it were another issue, but screws and the 2x4s worked if it looked a bit unsightly.
>The first test went well, you were comfortably listening to music with your face against cotton and fur and she was contentedly watching tv while leaning back.
>There were some issues, like the headboard not being cushioned and her bouncing during an exciting part of her show being straining.
>The former was easily fixed and the latter was endurable, if not enjoyable at times.

this would be interesting to read
>bully anthro has feelings for human MC but doesnt know how to convey that beyond the medium of bullying
>doesn't know why the MC seems distant and why he goes out of his way to avoid her
>thinks that him telling her to go away is just him playing hard to get
>one day she sees him chatting it up with some other girl and he seems, happy...
>like he's not trying to avoid this girl. and they seem to be getting along
>she doesnt even try bullying him that day. just goes home sad wondering what she's doing wrong
>she asks her mom or a friend for help and they explain to her that humans dont respond well to being treated like that
>she tries approaching him to apologize but he just tells her to fuck off.
I dont know where this can go but I feel it would lend itself to a female POV story.

Aight, here it is.
>Be Constance the Wolf
>Be just another kinda-popular-but-not-particularly anthro girl in high school.
>Be in Health Class with your favorite soon to be boyfriend Anon.
>Your instructor, the PE teacher, has the class divided down the middle into male and female halves, allegedly as a learning device.
>He's yammering on about this or that bit of male anatomy, but there's only one dong you're really interested in, and that's Anon's.
>You've got an anthro on the inside of the boy's bathroom, and according to him Anon's got a pretty nice set.
>The prey is set, your battle ground carefully chosen, and hunting techniques honed by the finest of teachers.
>Anon is yours by all rights, and every anthro in school already knows. You've been scent marking him and everything!
>Once your spade work is done you'll move in for the kill.
>Just need to keep reminding him who's got claim on his 5'6 ass before you zone in for the kill!
>...so why isn't he responding?
>You're doing everything right, and he's still avoiding you!
>Is it a human thing?
>They're all allegedly cowards, but is that really a *bad* thing?
>A 7'2 anthro like you could protect him easily, yet he's never given any of the right courtship signs.
>It shouldn't be this hard. After all, every anthro knows that Size Decides!
>If this keeps up you're going to have to call in an expert...
-----
>Be Anon
>Be trying to pay attention to Health Class.
>You say "trying" because Constance is on the opposite side of the room trying to heckle you again, and it's worse than ever.
>Fucking hell, why can't this animal just leave you alone?
>First she was just hanging around shit talking your height next to your locker, but now she's even pulling bullshit in the middle of class.
>Like right now! Mr. Dowry is talking about masturbatory habits across species and she's making direct eye contact with you.
>Bitch is pantomiming jerking off an invisible dick and eating pussy with her fingers.
>God, you get it! You're not getting any! Just GO THE HELL AWAY!
-----
>Anon makes a angry face at you and ignores your eye-contact.
>On the one paw that's good because he's submitting and refusing your challenge, but on the other hand he looks super upset.
>The confusion gnaws at you inside, and you turn away.
>"Pretend to watch the lecture...never let him see your hurt."
>...what are you doing wrong?
>What's wrong with you?
>You groom yourself every morning, you exercise daily, you always make sure he knows he's beneath you in the pack...
>How do you fix this?
>Later that afternoon as you're getting ready to leave for the evening you happen to hear Anon talking to someone.
>The first thing you notice is its feminine tone, which immediately gets your adrenaline going.
>Fight or Flight response? Not when mates are involved. There's only fight and more fight.
>Human school means no fighting though, so you do your best to keep calm.
>You try to keep your spying subtle, but that becomes impossible when you see whose talking to your future litter-father.
>It's SUSAN.
>THAT tiny little omega.
>The one who barely clocks in over 5'3.
>She's got this big smile on her face while she's talking to Anon.
>Then she does that pathethic *human girl* thing that somehow always works.
>The thing that makes every anthro girl's blood boil because of how stupidly effective it is.
>Susan brushes her bands behind her ears.
>rage
>Rage
>RAGE!
>You can barely take it, she's moving in on YOUR DIBS!
>Every natural instinct of yours screams to go and beat her senseless, but you know you can't.
>Instead you round the corner to the school's designated aggression relief room.
>Punching bags, bite and tear dummies...
>Nope, you go straight for the dented, empty lockers and start going to town with your fists.
>There's just something so satisfying about beating the shit out of something that makes a super loud metallic noise every time you punch it.
>"Stupid boy stealing whore! Why can't you little witches just FOLLOW THE FUCKNG RULES!"
>Panting and sweating, you eventually beat your knuckles bloody. That's when you hear a whistle from across the room.
>It's one of the volunteer student room-monitors.
>"Human boy problems?" Asks a lazy looking calico feline in a beanie and black hoodie.
>"Mind your own business."
>She flicks idly through whatever she's reading on her phone.
>"Trust me girl, they're 90% of the reasons why girls end up in here. No shame in it, I had the same trouble with my mate."
>The cat takes a puff of her Juul and blows smoke towards the ceiling, somehow failing to set off the smoke alarm.
>"Just hear me out. There's a ton of stuff I wish I knew about human guys when I started courting Mike that'll make your life a ton simpler."
>You're flashing your fangs and bearing your claws, but the voice of reason in the back of your head tells you to listen.
>That's the part of you all the human councilors at school tell you to heed, and they tend to be right. There's a reason segregation ending has worked out so well.
>"Okay, *pant*, talk."
>She nods easily. "Good, good."
>"First, thing you gotta know is that humans operate on a completely different playbook. It's not about being in charge because you're bigger, it's about being an attractive mate. You want to show that you're sociable and cool; That's why I get stoned with his buddies whenever I can and occasionally flash my tits on his Discord."
>She yawns lazily and takes a fat minute to send out a few texts on some group chat or another.
>"Second, just be nice and loyal. Human guys eat that shit up. They're all so sick of entitled human girls smacking them down they simp for anyone who'll pat them on the head and call them a good boy."
>Is this girl stupid high, or is she from bizzaro land?
>Is this girl stupid high, or is she from bizzaro land?
>"Third, just walk up and take the lead. Do a little spade work, yeah, but put rules 1 and 2 into action when you ask them out. Human guys spend all their time simping for girls who just want more attention. When I asked Mike out it floored him so bad he said yes without even thinking."
>There's a knock at the door. Human girl stands up. "If you do these things your future boytoy will be slobbering all over you, and the faculty will keep ignoring how much I toke it up in here. You know how many fights are avoided because I'm in here giving advice?"
>She opens in the door and is greeted by an enthusiastic human guy, even TALLER than she is, who lifts her off the ground in a bear hug. The end of the day bell rings and the two walk off hand in paw.
>Huh...
------
>The next day doesn't go much better.
>You do what mom and dad told you to do, Anon acts angry and ignores you, you feel gross inside and think about postponing the big ask-out another week.
>God, fuck, shit...
>Maybe she was right. Maybe humans are just weirdos.
>Are they really worth it then if it means all this pain?
>Then you remember what thugs furboys can be and change your tune immediately.
>Yeah, uh, no. Smooth skins and no-knot dicks for you, thanks.
>You're putting your books away when you hear that voice again.
>It's Susan, and you immediately notice she's doing that...THING.
>That thing you can't do because anthros don't have that stupid...weird...kinda pretty long hair humans have on their heads.
>Her bands slip behind her ears and you just about lose it.
>Before you can listen to the voice of reason you're already storming towards the two of them, and your hands slam against the lockers around Anon.
>Susan backs away in horror, but Anon just stands there, staring at you, stunned.
>"Don't be an animal..." the voice of reason whispers, "it's now or never. The anthro way isn't working, try the human way."
>"Uh...hey, Anon."
>He hesitates.
>"Constance?"
>#1: Be sociable.
>"Like the haircut, it looks cute on you. Short on the side, long on the top. Real submissive and breedable look."
>He laughs nervously. "T-thanks. Got it cut yesterday. Went to my favorite barber shop."
>"Cool, cool."
>#2: You pat him on the head. "You're a cool guy. I..."
>Shit, what would a model UN cuckquean do?
>"...know I'm kinda aggressive and stuff, but I'm trying. You've got nice calves and hips and seem like you'd fuck good."
>#3: Take the lead!
>"We should go on a date. Umberto's across the street after the bell, get some pizza? I'm buying if you're interesting."
>Anon glances at Susan, who looks horrified, before looking back at you.
>"Uhh...you know what, yeah. That actually sounds really cool. I'll meet you out by the garden?"
>"Yeah, sounds sick. See you then."
>Your heart feels like it's about to overload your circulatory system so you just punch him lightly on the shoulder and fast walk away.
>That's when you hear Susan's voice.
>"What the fuck? Anon, EWW!"
>You glance behind you, and what you see makes your heart soar.
>Anon's pitching a tent.
>You have to cover your face and sprint to the girl's room on the other side of the building to hide your smile.
>"YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!" You shout at the top of your lungs.
>GET KEKED SUSAN! SUPERIOR WOLF PUSSY STRIKES AGAIN!

>Be medieval human farmhand
>One day strange ships come towards your village
>The ships sail up to the shore and coming out of them is a sight you almost can't believe
>large woman covered in fur looking like mix between a human and a bear come pouring out of the long ships and they're armed
>They attack
>you run to your home and hide under my bed hoping the militia can fight these monsters off
>outside the sound of combat and horrifying roars fill the air
>Soon the sounds stop and all you hear are heavy footsteps approaching your front door
>The door is kicked open and goes flying off the hinges as a giant bear woman invades your home
>You let out an involuntary yell and now you know you've sealed your fate
>The bear walks up to you bed and grabs one of your feet and effortlessly drags you out from under it and picks you up
>She's big, at least 7 foot tall and strong too
>The worse thing is the look she gives you, pure lust
>You scream as she pushes you down on your bed and tears your clothes from your body
>You try to struggle to get her off you and escape but she's just to big and to strong
>Too your horror you also get a boner from this brute violently striping you
>She takes her clothes off
>You can see her womanhood is already drenched in excitement
>God she's going to take your virginity
>You wanted to wait until marriage not be violated by this monster
>She forces your legs up and lowers herself down on you and you feel you cock be enveloped by her hairy cunt
>The feeling shocks you, it feels good yet so violating to have this monster steal your virginity
>You start to cry and beg her "No, no, stop, please."
>She looks down on you and says something in a foreign tongue before kissing you
>Her long tongue invades your mouth as she bounces up and down on your cock
>She's so heavy it feels like she's crushing you with each pound of her hips
>But soon the feeling overwhelm you and you can't stop yourself from moaning like a whore as she fucks you
>She starts fucking you fast and hard and she's roaring in pleasure as she pounds you
>God it just feels so good you can't help yourself
>You let out a scream as you cum deep inside the bear woman's pussy
>She lets out a loud roar at the same time and you can tell she came too
>She collapses on top of you and suddenly your filled with shame in regret
>Another bear woman walks into your house and says something in their strange language
>The bear that just raped you says something back then gets up to put her clothes back on and pick up her axe
>You don't even try to get up and escape you don't think you can even move after that
>The bear picks up your naked body and carries you over her shoulder
>She carries you towards the long ship
>You see other bears with naked men slung over their shoulder headed towards the ship as well
>Your put on the ship with the other men along with the treasures of your town and set sail to the unknown
>You’ve been at sea for 2 days now
>The bears gave you some some rags to protect you from cold sea air
>Luckily the weathers been good and the wind is in your favor
>The bear women make you row the ship until you're too exhausted to move
>Looking over you the who time is the bear woman that stole your virginity
>You still don’t know they’re strange tongue but you’ve learned enough to know her name is Birna
>Birna has been looking after you while on the ship. She gives you warm food and takes over rowing when you can’t anymore
>At night you also sleep with her on her bed
>She hasn’t forces herself on you again yet but she likes to touch you
>You see the sun setting on the horizon and a bear woman calls out something and they drop the anchor.
>You finally let go of the oar
>Your muscles ache all over but at least
>Birna comes over to you her large body towering over you
>She says something in her language before handing you a steaming bowl of stew
>You take the stew and eat it savoring the lovely flavors
>These bear women by be monsters but damn can they cook
>Birna eats with you talking to you in her weird language
>You don’t know what she’s saying but you can tell that she really likes you
>You don’t know how to feel about this
>This monster raped you and stole you from your home
> but she’s been the nicest thing about this horrible sea voyage
>As the stars start to fill the sky everyone gets ready for bed
>The humans on the ship all sleep with one of the bears and Birna gets her bedroll ready
>You lay down on it and Birna lays next to you and pulls a blanket over you both
>She starts spooning you, putting her hands all over your body
>You get lay there and let her do what she wants, you know shall get mad if you resist her
>She takes off the modest rags given to you and roughly gropes your ass and cock
>She whispers unknown words into your ears before you feel her slimy tongue drag itself across your face
>Jesus it’s so gross but you must endure it
>She turns your head and looks you in the eye before planting a big kiss on your lips
>Her tongue invades your mouth as she kisses you deep and long
>You feel your cock getting hard as gropes it and tongues your mouth
>She releases the kiss and says something to you before grabbing your hand and putting it down her pants
>God it’s already so wet down there
>She guides your hand to her wet fur covered cunt and starts fingering herself with your hand
>She quietly moans as your hand touches her
>You go along with it fingering her until she takes her paw away and you keep going at it
>She grabs your face with her femcum coated paws and brings you in for another long kiss
>You finger her as her tongue forces its way down your throat again
>You feel so dirty as she does this to you
>She humps your hand and moans while her hands explore your body
>Soon you feel her cunt pulsate and she moans into your mouth
>You know this beast is cumming all over your hand
>She finally lets go of kiss then says something to before passing out
>Your left there feeling dirty but the worst part is that your still hard and you wish you came to
>You know you shouldn’t think such things but the thought is impossible to get out of your mind
>But luckily soon enough sleep takes you and you fall asleep in the large arms of your captor
>You wake up to Birna shaking you and saying some words
>The sun is coming out there's a cold nip in the air and the bear women are cooking some strew
>Birna walks up to them and grabs a bowl of stew of for the both of you
>with a smile on her face she hands you the bowl
>Your stomach grumbles as you take the bowl and start eating
>As you eat Birna watches you watch she smiles a look of love covering her face
>The love she has for you makes you conflicted
>You should hate this monster for all she’s done to you but when she looks at you with that face you just can’t
>One of the bear women clearly the captain gives out a command and directs the men to the oars
>You know it’s gonna be another long day of rowing
>You row the oars
>It’s hard work that makes your muscles burn all the time Birna is watching over you
>She takes over for you when you get to tired giving you little breaks
>After 5 hours of rowing a bear woman gives a shout. You don’t know the words she saying but it could only be one thing
>”Land Ho!”
>The sight of this foreign land fills you with a mixture of joy and dread
>At least you won’t have to row these damn oars anymore
>The ship pulls into port and you, the rest of the men and the treasures of your hometown are taken off the ship
>You look around this village and see what just a week ago would be unbelievable
>Bear people are everywhere
>You see the bear men, they are noticeably smaller than the woman by at least a foot
>No wonder the women do the fighting
>You see little bear cubs walking around one rolling a hoop with a stick
>Birna puts her arm over your shoulder and holds you close
>Her warm arms feel good in the cool air
>She’s says something to you and then starts to walk you through town
>You see the alien sights of this town before Birna walks you into a modest house
>She heads over the fireplace and starts to light a fire while you look around the house
>It looks nice there are several hunting trophies on the wall, the horns elk, deer and moose
>She also has a large bed that looks warm
>Birna lights the fire place and the house starts to warm
>Then she hangs up her large ax on the wall and walks over to you a huge smile on her face
>You know where this is going
>She picks you up looks you right in the eyes and plants a big sloppy wet kiss right on your lips
>Her tongue explores your mouth as she kisses you aggressively
>This should be so revolting to you but you find you don’t mind her kisses anymore
>In fact your already shamefully rock hard as she pins you against the wall making out with you
>Her claws tear apart your clothes has if they were made of paper exposing your nudity to her
>She carries you into her bedroom kissing you the whole time
>She breaks the kiss letting her tongue out of your mouth and then says something to you before putting you down
>The pulls off her clothes exposing her naked body to you
>It’s impossible to admit to yourself you're not attracted to her now
>She sits down on the edge of the bed and spreads her legs apart
>Her pussy is soaked with her excitement
>She points her claw down and says something that you don’t understand to you
>You look at her confused for a while before she simply grabs you by your hair and forces your head into her fur covered cunt
>She grinds her pussy on your face covering you with her wetness
>God it’s so sinful but so exotic you can’t help but to lick her pussy while she roars in pleasure
>She keeps your head in place, bucking her hips and grinds her pussy so hard into your face that you think you might pass out from lack of air
>Then she cums squirting her juices all over you face
>She lets go of your head as you pulls back a gasp for air
>Your cock is harder than it’s ever been in your life and she’s not dun with you yet
>She picks you up and throws you on the bed before she climbs up on top you
>She says some words before kissing you again and dropping her cunt onto you waiting cock
>Jesus Christ you didn’t even though something could feel this good
>She bounces up and down on your cock while kissing you and now you return the kiss
>Your tongue playing with her as her heavy body pounds down on you
>She breaks the kiss and says those same words again before grabbing your hands and pinning them to the bed
>Your fingers interlock with hers as she pounds you harder and harder
>She looks down on you with love in eyes as she says that phase over and over again while she fucks you
>Your so close to cumming now and wish you understood what she was saying
>You let out a moan and she roars as you both cum simultaneously
>As you cum it clicks in your head and you understand what she was saying
>She collapse on top of you her heavy body making you feel so safe and you repeat those back to her
>”I love you”

>captured by state government after speaking out against it online
>and anthros
>they grab you, haul you away to a black site and lock you down
>tied to a chair, head forced forward, watching a screen
>probably propaganda or devious mind control hypnosis!
>you will resist!
>you are strong!
>anthro agent assigned to you leans in close
>"Are you ready, Anon? For the consequences of your actions?"
>you snarl at the bitch
"Do your worst!"
>she simply scoffs and flicks a switch
>the screen turns on, revealing...
>a camera feed of a cat woman crying
>she's reading a computer screen, looking shocked, hurt, and betrayed
>you don't understand
>but you do feel bad for her
>"That's your wife, Anon."
>what?
>you don't have a wife
>"Your assigned wife. She was so excited to meet you, Anon. She bought you a pineapple because your file says it's your favorite food."
>you do like pineapple
>awful nice of her
>but you won't be swayed!
>she should be just as angry about assignment as you are
>"She's reading the part where you said you wanted to collect anthro fangs as trophies. Why would you say that? Do you want to do it to her?"
>the cat has her paws over her mouth, and she's shaking
>"She'd probably give them to you, if you asked. She loves you, Anon."
>the cat on the screen shakes her head and wipes her eyes
>then she reads a little more and breaks down into sobs
>you can't hear them, but you can see the force of her sobs
>for god's sake, why are they doing this to her?
>"She just read the part where you said you never want to get married. Look how sad she is, Anon. She's not a bad person, Anon."
>you hate to see someone so sad
>especially when it's a soft, cute looking cat like the woman on the screen
>"You don't have to marry her, Anon. But would you like to go give her a hug to make her feel better?"
>you would like to do that
>just one hug
>and maybe apologize for your 'fleabag' comment
>you go with the agent to meet the cat who's been assigned to you

>be me

>let alone one so... strange
>seriously, this one is both dense and... alive
>as in there are living things on all these icy rocks, makes sense for them to be here, I guess
>that aside. I’m in my own kind of pickle
>as in I’m up shit creek with no paddle
>something nasty the scientists found out there was brought in here.
>And I can only guess by the messes it’s left behind that it’s some sort of apex predator
>walls torn to shreds, vents ripped open, cables *everywhere*. The works.
>and because this place’s guest made even more ruckus my our arrival here. I’m stuck in the research segment of the station because of some airlock quarantine program going off on a false positive.

>praise the lord for plasma weapons I say. I’ve got 4 magazines of hot and ready terajouls for blasting
>though whatever was on the memo we don’t really understand in terms of what the fuck it actually is.
>So I will simply have faith that my weapon is enough at oh- say the maximum setting possible without overheat and eventual detonation
>once I pass through the first few labs studying the asteroid fungus or whatever. I hear a creaking noise
>one of the kind that sounds like a living think is shifting, rather than a structure like for example the hull or bulkhead
>this is both good and bad for my health. Good that I’m not about to be shot into space, bad because... well, it’s over there somewhere in the dark
>weapon forward I do the ‘I’m totally not chicken shit’ sneaking maneuver over to the noise
>took a few moments, but the crashing and creaking noises were getting louder, now with the sounds of shuffling
>at least it didn’t sound like it was moving. It didn’t know I was here
>let’s keep it that way
>’round a corner and another I go. Into a more office-y spot
>it’s definitely in one of these labs. These ones look like they’re meant to test fauna
>I think whatever this thing is- is the fauna in question
>blueish blood samples that I swear glow slightly are either still in tact or spilled and broken on the floor

>this thing was on a rampage through the whole wing
>odd that it messed up the first part of the wing only to circle back here
>either it got spooked by the door/ or it’s searching for something
>rather frantically and aimlessly searching.
>Judging by the noises I can still hear it making just over past that ajar sliding door out of eyeshot, anyway
>i go into the lab or office or whatever the room is
>the place is even more of a wreck than the rest of the wing, and the sounds are right over past the desk that was more or less part of the wall
>I take a sneaking strafe out to get passed the desk, weapon trained on whatever on the noise until I have a glimpse
>I’m on the precipice of only seeing flashes of the creature. I bite the bullet, and take a final long stride to try and get the element of surprise on this thing
>only I’m the one shocked
>face down, ass up. An oily pitch black pair of woman’s fresh apples are staring back at me. Complete with butt down feathers just over the tail bone- big shiny feathers too
>in my confusion I end up stepping on some glass that promptly breaks and alerts this super predator with fresh cheeks
>it looks back and changes to a defensive cat like stance, ass still in the air, but I can see it’s face now, as well as its teal fur colored tatas
>it’s snout is like an otters, or some other weasel, but it’s got 4 eyes and it’s head isn’t that latex black I saw on its legs and butt
>and it’s mouth looks like it goes all the way back to its end like a snake that can unhinge its jaw would have
>even in my frozen fear state of this thing looking at me- I connect some dots.
>It kinda makes sense, These creatures have to be colorful so they can see and cooperate with eachother, assuming they cooperate out there
>But the black-skin-stuff is a very strong non permeable hide that can handle the vacuum of space by my best guess
>the thing makes this screeching “RAAAAAA” sound, it’s feathers on its butt unfurl into a fan, but they’re red now. Not the usual teal
>’bout to die
>I go for the kill but the thing already had other ideas
>instead of jumping straight for me she took a separate direction. Jumping off the desk she moved towards to leap at me viciously

>boss lady is coming onto you
>she “brings you coffee” every now and again
>odd- usually the subordinate fetches coffee
>it tastes great, but also off
>she eventually asks you to join her in her office
>she seems happy enough, you doubt you’re in trouble
>at least in the traditional sense
>there’s two cups of coffee, one with cream and one black
>did the coffee shack make a mistake or something?
>suddenly, your boss unbuttons her blouse and goes full on free-breasted
>sits on the office couch next to you and starts milking herself into the cup
>”took some special hormones for a little while now, just for you~...”
>she says like it was just a normal everyday Friday
>but those eyes...
>they betray a different intent
>she hands you the cup, now full- and heavy on the cream
>”drink up sugar... or you’re fired”
>you bite the bullet, and down the cup of your boss’ creamy essence
>”good boy... now, about your contract with us here”
>she coo’s, getting up from her spot and starting to crawl towards you. Tits leaking and hanging from her torso like plump, ripe, and full fruits
>”I think you’re due a promotion. We can discuss it while I give you a... let’s call it an introductory on the job crash course”
>she’s straddling you now. Somewhere in the mix she managed to get her work pants off her ample frame
>”so, sugar muffin. Those hormones are on the company dime for a special project ive had in mind for a few months now”
>she’s moving her panties aside now, in all the shock of what the fuck is happening, along with the fact her other large muscular claw is gripping your shoulder like the handle of a Harley. You can’t move
>”I call it the no more office spinsters initiative. And you’re... part of R&D, catch my drift. Now be a good boy and put my fat milking teat in your mouth while I keep explaining. Those lips are asking for it”
>you can’t even protest before aforementioned object is right in your face-hole
>she’s being super deliberate about pressing it pressing it into your mouth all motherly like with her free paw not gripping at your shoulder like an industrial hydraulic crane-claw
>she’s completely smothering you at this point and let’s go with her grip. Grinding her hips against yours slowly
>since when we’re you not wearing any pants?
>good lord she’s even stroking at your hair gently now
>you’re about slip into this seemingly otherworldly trance when she speaks, snapping you out of it
>”we can’t keep these little meds I’m taking to play my fun little game for much longer. So I say we take the initiative to the next phase”
>she’s making the deepest eye contact with from the horizon of her massive mammary as her paw not stroking gently at your scalp slides down to your groin, playing with your very tight feeling boxers
>”your promotional contract includes the following transaction, you get this every day as part of regularly scheduled work, a ‘company life supply’ of your favorite heavy cream. And in exchange your ‘initiative supervisor’ will be supplied with as many litters as necessary for the project~...”
>suddenly everything stops, she’s sitting up, grinding on your bare cock.
>Her massive tit glistening and still flowing, as if her body didn’t yet know your mouth was no longer on it
>there’s a piece of paper in front of you now, on a clipboard with a pen attached
>”go on... you want more of this dont you... you don’t want it to end, I don’t mean to sound like a demon asking for your soul, but. Come and give yourself over to me, I promise your soul is safe~...”
>her eyes are like lasers piercing into my own. You consider what you might be giving yourself up for, her other paw gently places the pen in your hand and coaxes it to the clipboard
>You were weak, your signature- now in red on the paper sealed my fate to my superior
>”YES!!!”
>she screams, forcing your member inside of her and throwing the contract aside with enough force to make a baseball pitcher look twice
>as it lands with a crash, her arms bare back down to return to what they were previously doing, but now with a vigor you didn’t think your boss had in her
>she’s holding the back of your head like a baby. Interchanging between the sloppiest French kisses of your life and between her mammaries that rather than just leaking, now thanks to your intermittent sucking were nigh pouring her creamy sweet mana
>she coos at you in between everything getting as many words in as she can before falling to the urge to lick and kiss again
>”cmon. *hahhhh*... Cum inside your boss give mama your batter so she can BREED YOU. *smooch*.... that’s right, mamas doing the breeding, I’m the one who’s in charge, and I say the only place -your- genes belong is in every litter my body can fucking PUMP OUT!”

>your hybrid grandmother's vision had been failing in recent years
>despite this, her extensive pedigree kept an extremely robust physique that'd make the average bodybuilder jealous
>living with her was an odd task; despite no waning strength or stamina, her bifocals and liberal cosmetics pile betrayed advancing age
>but it was a secret only known between the two of you that in spite of her proud heritage, she could not reach her own back when cleaning
>and in more recent years, the undersides of her tremendous bust as they finally succumbed to sag
>you were a model grandson, raised healthy like she and despite being born physically inferior as a human, she loved you no less for it

>the film spins starts, and things are going well
>that is until you notice that there are several changes
>at first, you understand, got to expand to other groups besides niche comic readers
>but then you notice changes that seem to fit a more, anthro-centric culture, you should say
>such as the heroes suit, usually full-covering
>but now it’s more thin towards the down-center area of his body, showing abs and a very noticeable bulge
>you cringe internally, for the anthros have got to this
>and that isn’t the worst offender
>the worst is when his girlfriend is changed to an anthro
>and when she shows up, he’s head over heels for her love
>when in the comics it was more mutually natural
>and during the final battle, he’s practically nude, besides his torn pants turning into short shorts
>you swear to God that you heard some Schlicking during the more quiet moments
>ultimately, it was a waste of time and money
>but you got to admit the scene where the girlfriends tits were bouncing around was pretty nice

"Sorry, you're a what?"
>the anthro girl rolls her golden eyes and sneers at you
>"A fossa."
>you blink, not understanding
"Foo-saw? That's uh, a kind of cat?"
>she hisses and raises a claw-tipped paw
>"Do I look like a cat to you?!"
>you flinch away and hold up your hands in surrender
"No! Maybe! Kind of? Like, a mix of a cat and a weasel?"
>that just makes her angrier
>"A weasel?!"
>you yelp and dodge a swipe from those menacing claws and take a few scampering steps away
>"Stupid fucking humans! Think you're so superior, but wouldn't know a lion from a leopard. Or a fossa from a weasel!"
>you fear she's about to lash out again so you try to intervene as the arm comes down
"Sorry! Sorry sorry sorry! It's just you're so--so unique!"
>the paw halts mid-swipe for your face
>and she gives a soft mewl of patient curiosity
>"Unique?"
>you blink, shocked to still have a face
>so you decide to continue on
"Y-yeah! Unique. Like no other anthro I've ever met. I mean, you're like, graceful like a feline, but flexible and quick like a wea--"
>bad word choice
>the fossa furrows her brow
"Like a mustelid! Or uh, you know, something like that. But honestly, you're not like anything else. I mean, you're scary as all hell--"
>the fossa beams at the apparent compliment
>"Thank you."
>you go on
"--but in a cool way. I'm really, really sorry I got so confused about it. Clearly you're something special and I failed to recognize that."
>she giggles and raises a paw again
>but this time to step around and place it over your shoulder
>"Aren't you a little quick talker. I guess I can forgive you, since you didn't know any better. How about you and I go somewhere more quiet and I can teach you little more about my species?"

>anthro sit you on her lap
>you get all indignant and demand she put you down
>she just starts kissing your neck rubbing her paws over your body
>whispers sweet nothings in your ear while her paws wander over your flesh
>"good boy" "sweet boy" "so cute" "so beautiful"
>one paw slides down your pants, the other up your shirt
>your protests falter and degrade into moans and whimpers
>she fishes out your hardened cock, already leaking pre, and begins to stroke
>you squirm and groan, you beg her to stop, you tell her about to blow, she just pumps faster
>"Cum for Mommy, my good boy."
>you blow fast and hard, eyes rolling back, toes curling, back arched and mouth hanging open wordless cry
>she goes back to kissing your neck and whispering how much a good little human you are, as you drift into a post-orgasm coma

>"Tessa?"
>"Yes master?"
>the rat maid has a wide grin on her scarred snout as she sways her tail
>which holds a huge jagged knife
>you work hard not to flinch when she sweeps it in front of her, inches from your legs
>"Whatever is the matter, oh dear and kind master?"
>oh gods above
"Wh-Where'd you get that knife, Tessa?"
>your maid holds the knife up in front of her
>pointed at you
>and looks at it as if she hadn't noticed it before
>"Oh! This little thing? I've had it a while. Not long after you bought me, in fact. You were so kind to me, giving me free roam of the property."
>with a flick of her tail, she tosses the knife in the air then catches it in a paw
>she slices the air in front of your face
>the blade whistles and you feel it slice the air
>that breaks you, and you flinch away from the strike
>Tessa laughs, eerily chipper while she menaces you
>"Free roam I used to go and get this pretty toy. At first I planned on gutting you with it at the first opportunity."
>you gasp, and turn to flee
>but she's caught your foot with her tail, and you trip and topple to the ground
>"But you were so sweet! 'Please, Tessa' this and 'thank you, Tessa' that. My own bedroom, my own place at the dinner table. You didn't even beat me!"
>your desperate scrabbling to crawl away fails
>Tessa's tail drags you back until she can pin you underfoot
>"And so cute too! That little stutter when you try to order me around, just precious. But best of all was your crush on me!"
>Tessa leans forward and presses her knee on your back
>you turn your head so you can look up into her one good eye
>"You really shouldn't look at your maid so lasciviously when you think she can't see you. Especially when she's an old war-rat like me."
>war rat?
>the seller never told you about her being a warrior!
>but it would explain a great deal
>her scars that give her a dangerous, mysterious air
>her strong arms
>and those long, powerful legs you had to ogle when she wore her uniform leggings
>as well as her natural commanding tone, and easy handling of the knife that she now slides the flat of over your cheek
>"How could I murder such a meek, cute, kind little human master?"
>Tessa hums thoughtfully
>then turns the blade to press it into your cheek
>it's sharp, and threatens to break your skin with the lightest touch
>you whimper in pain as it slowly digs into your cheek, letting out a trickle of blood
>all your instincts tell you to fight free from under the rat maid, but any movement would only make the razor edge of the knife cut deeper
>Tessa's sweet, sing-song voice drops into a feral hiss
>"Maybe because he's slave-buying scum!"
>you can't escape from beneath her
>she just presses down on your back harder
>"They put me in a cage! They whipped my back to shreds! Starved me near to death!"
>once gain you flinch
>and the knife does its job, opening a line down your cheek that bleeds openly
>Tessa pulls the knife away, but continues in her venomous tirade
>"And you paid them. A small fortune! How many more of my kin were put in irons because of that fortune?"
>you don't know
>you hadn't considered it
>it was just a way of life
>how things are
>you thought you had given Tessa a good life
>that she was happy
>"Stupid, naïve boy! What did you think your kindness would win you? A proper warrior would kill you now and be done with it."
>tears run down your cheek, mingling with the stream of blood from your cut
"I'm--I'm sorry Tessa--"
>the knife comes down
>planted deep in the hardwood floor next to your head
>Tessa squeaks her outrage and kicks off your back to stand
>the air is driven from your lungs and you wheeze
>despite her weight being lifted, and the knife left behind, you don't stand up
>just rolling onto you back and sitting the floor
>trembling
>Tessa doesn't look at you, her tail flicks side to side in agitation
>"It doesn't matter now."
>you scoot back along the floor and lean against the wall, facing her
"What do you mean?"
>she spares you a glance with her good eye
>then looks away, out a nearby window
>"One way or another, I won’t be a slave anymore. I know you won’t stop me."
>she starts to regain her old, cheerful demeanor
>even laughing as though at a joke
>"And if you tried, then I’d have a reason to use this big, scary knife on you! We don’t want that, do we, master?"
>you shiver, fearing the cold touch of the blade again
>you don't want to die
>Tessa continues the repetitive twitch of her tail, brushing the tip of it against the handle of the knife embedded in the floor
>you push against the wall to stand on legs shaking in fear
"So you're going to leave?"
>the rat in the maid's outfit turns about and fakes an expression of shock
>"Leave my precious master behind, all on his own? Oh but how could I? When he's so kind, so cute, so weak? No, not unless you forced my…”
>that dextrous tail catches the hilt of the knife and wraps around it in a clear threat
>”...tail.”
>she steps closer to you, staring at you with that plastered grin on her face
>but the forceful glare of her blood red eye dared you to raise objection
>you bow your head quickly
>whatever happens, you definitely do not want to force her tail
>"No objections? Good! I think there will be some changes around the manor, dear master. First, you will purchase my freedom. I expect to be your equal in this household."
>of course!
>you would have done that if she ever asked
>it had just never occurred to you
>you nod your head fast enough to give you whiplash
>Tessa's round ears twitch and she relaxes slightly
>her smile seems a bit more genuine
>"Good! Good. Thank you, Anon."
>she sounds completely heartfelt in her thanks.
>but she continues, with a more commanding tone
>"Two. I will be taking a much more active role in the management of the house. Kind as you are, you'd be better off with someone more forceful in charge the estate. You don't object to that, do you, master?"
>you do just that
"Management? Of what? It's just just you and me here."
>the secluded little manor didn't need all that maintenance, so you never had much need for staff ever since you inherited the place
>the biggest thing Tessa does is keep you company
>or so you thought
>"That's right. Just you, relaxing in your studies, reading your books, whiling away your fortune, going on your walks in the countryside."
>Tessa mocks you in a sing-song voice, before becoming stern again
>"Leaving me to manage the house. Ensure food is in, wash all the floors, windows, take care of the yard. All those little things you never see me take care of. We're hiring a staff. And I will be in charge."
>is it really all that work?
>just for one person?
"Fine. The money for some new staff shouldn't be a problem--"
>Tessa interrupts
>"I'm managing the money too."
>you frown
>the house was one thing, but the money is yours
>and step forward off the wall to point an accusing finger at her
"Wait just a minute, you can’t--"
>the words are knocked out of you, along with the rest of your breath
>Tessa is on you in a flash, slamming you against the wall
>her claws dig into your shoulders and her jaws are wrapped around your throat
>you feel her teeth press against the tender skin of your neck
>threatening to tear it open
>for the second time, you're left whimpering and at Tessa's mercy
>she holds you there
>then her tongue swipes over your throat, hot and wet
>a hiss builds up in her throat until she pulls her head back and jaws shut
>you tremble
>"Do not ever think to command me again, 'master'. I am owed more than your wealth could ever repay!"
>she hisses in your ear
>whiskers tickling against your skin
>her fur bristling with anger
>gods above if she weren't threatening your life right now...
>but she is
>so you stammer out
"I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry Tessa. Please."
>she gnashes her teeth in your face
>"I am the master of this house! Do you understand?"
"Okay! Okay! I'm sorry Tessa! I'm sorry. I didn't know how bad it was! I just wanted some company and I thought--"
>Tessa shuts you up again
>with a forceful kiss
>her maw closes over yours, and tongue invades your still open mouth to wrestle your tongue into submission
>those claws sink deeper in your shoulders, eliciting a whine from you
>that only seems to drive Tessa wilder as she presses her body against yours to trap you against the wall
>what's going on?
>why is she doing this?
>she chokes you with her tongue, probing at the back of your throat
>her teeth scrape against your cheeks
>digging into the cut that stings in protest
>Tessa kisses you until your head starts to swim
>"Three..."
>she breaks the kiss in the sighing word
>"No more leering at me when I'm working. You will be polite and respectful to me, and any other staff I choose to hire."
>you catch your breath, held up only by Tessa's paws still holding you to the wall
>and you almost slump when she releases on to grasp your cock through your pants
>"I will come and relieve you when I see fit. Understand?"
>you nod
>can barely think enough for words
>Tessa grins and squeezes your shaft
>"Did a little rough treatment get you all hot and bothered, master? I love those little squeaks you make. So cute!"
>the paw squeezes harder, eliciting one such squeak
"Ah! W-wait!"
>Tessa loosens her grip
>but only just
>"Oh? Is that too rough? Oh my precious little master, why didn't you say so? All you have to do is ask."
>she starts up again
>squeeze
>relax
>squeeze
>relax
>"Ask Mistress Tessa to be gentle~"
>she's not stopping
"Please Tess--"
>pain
>she's crushing you!
"Mistress Tessa! M-mistress Tessa. Please be gentle."
>Tessa coos
>and switches her grip to gently rub your cock through your pants
>"That's better. Since you asked so nicely, I'll go easy on you. But one more thing..."
>her tender expression turns triumphant
>"From now on, whenever I say so, you will wear the fucking maid outfit."

>overhear a phone conversation from the anthro jackal waiting beside you at the bus stop
>"What do you mean they're free? Just take them?"
>like most anthros, she doubles you in size, and doesn't seem to even notice you're there
>"Aren't there like, laws against that? Huh. Uh-huh. So how long did it take for him to stop trying to run away?"
>you do your best to ignore her, but she speaks openly, and loudly too
>guess her friend adopted a feral cat or something?
>"I mean yeah, I'd want one too. Hang on."
>in your peripheral, you see her body turn towards you
>"Yeah, just one here at the bus stop."
>you stiffen
>she's talking about you
>"So what, just like that? Aren't humans supposed to be fragile or something?"
>she is definitely talking about you, and by the sound of it, something that might hurt you
>you start to shuffle away, hoping to open a gap before she notices
>but a big paw clamps down on your shoulder and drags you back to her side
>"Oh yeah, he's a real cutie. Sweating up a storm too. He's so scared!"
>the jackal giantess presses you into her side, so your face is against her thigh
>"Aww, I know. No, he's not much trouble, just a little squirmy."
>a little squirmy?
>you're fighting for your life to escape!
"Hey! Let me go! You can't just--whoa!"
>the jackal stoops down and swings her arm across your chest, lifting you off the ground and pushing your head against one of her massive tits
>"Hang on just a sec Bev."
>the jackal adjusts you in her grip so your head is stuffed into her cleavage
>your complaining voice is muffled by fur and flesh and the jackal finally addresses you
>"You be quiet. You're coming home with me and that's final. Be a good boy and I'll let you cuddle with mama in bed tonight."
>she goes back to her conversation on the phone, ignoring your struggles and demands for release
>"Yeah, I got him now! He's a little feisty, but I think I might just let him in bed with me anyways. I've always wanted a human of my own!"

>Pic related gets released to anthro audiences
>Several edits are made to appeal to them

The sex scene is switched and emphasized, he asks one of the girls to wear a fake tail, and the anthro audiences walk away with the impression that the movie is about a man being driven mad by his repressed submissive urges.
And that he's secretly into anthros too (but that's a stereotype they hold for all men)

Patrick Bateman is now Patricia Bateman and a female rabbit.
Nothing else changes.

>you stare at the screen, a mass of words half-covering the document you'd been struggling to continue for the last hour and a half

"Fuck it."

"Fucking moron. Can't write a single good story."
>the burnout is real
>not to mention a half-dozen other shorts you've left on the chopping block
>the Christmas special may be ready by new years 2024, if you're lucky
>dejected, you trudge to your bedroom
"Waste of a fuckin' Saturday. I give up."
>you flick off the lights
>then flop onto the bed to pass out
>hours pass in blissful sleep
>dreaming of collie thighs that will never be
>but you're awoken in the middle of the night
>you don't quite know why, it's still dark out and completely quiet
>with a yawn, you sit up and look around the room
>then you realize what's wrong
>your bedroom is fucked up
>the far end of it continues on into darkness far past where the wall and closet should be
>and the blackness beyond it seems to be almost supernaturally black
>an inky void that sucks in the meager light from the street lamp outside
>"Human."
>an woman’s voice echoes out from the darkness
>"Human I have come with a warning..."
>you see something coming out of the void
>two pinpricks of hovering light, deep blue, but flickering like flames
>but they don't illuminate anything else around them
"What's going on? Who are you?"
>the lights burn brighter for a moment
>"Who I am is not important! I warn you human, tonight you will be visited by three spirits. The Ghosts of Yiffmas!"
>whatever fear you might have felt is dispelled in an instant
"Yiffmas? What the fuck?"
>the flames wobble, and you think you can hear the voice snickering
>"Ahem! Yes! Do not mock these spirits, mortal, for soon they will be with you!"
>you pick your head up off the pillow and lean on your elbows to peer closer at the lights
>they're the still the only thing you can see in the darkness
"Three spirits. Like in that novel?"
>the lights flare, and the voice jumps up a level in volume
>"No! Not like the ones in the--"
>they dim to the normal level again
>"I mean, no. The spirits are not of your mortal realm, and have no connection to any stories you mortals may tell. Ask no more questions, for the first of these spirits approaches. The Ghost of Yiffmas Gentle."
>gentle?
>what the hell kind of name is that?
>whoever came up with that must be a moron
>the lights fade away, and the darkness itself dissolves until your room is back to normal
>you stare at the wall where the darkness used to be, waiting for something else to happen
>the clock ticks off several seconds of nothing
>so you decide to put your head back down
"Probably just a weird dream."
>but your head doesn't hit pillow
>it falls against something soft like a pillow
>squishy like a pillow
>but warm, and layered in thick fur completely unlike your usual pillow
>"Aww, you're all tuckered out, huh?"
>you jump up
>evoking an 'oh' of surprise from the tender voice of the anthro she-wolf whose lap replaced your pillow
>you spin about on the bed to face her, and make out more details in the soft pink light that suffuses the room
>she smiles wide
>"Hi there sweetie. I'm the ghost of Yiffmas Gentle."
>the she-wolf is nude, big and curvy and plush with heavenly thighs and a chest that's huge even for her size
>her soft fur is a light gray
>and now you see you're not in your own room at all
>instead, you're in a large, warmly lit bedroom
>seated in the middle of an impossibly soft mattress of ludicrous size
>you rub your eyes, trying make sense of your surroundings
>this can't be real
>just a weird dream, right?
"I'm going crazy."
>the she-wolf scoots closer on her knees and throws her arms around you in a hug that traps your face in her huge breasts
>"It's okay! No need to be scared, mommy just wanted to make her special boy feel good for the night."
>you're scooped up in her arms, and turned about so you're lying across her lap
>somehow, the entire time, your face never stopped touching the plush warmth of her chest
>"There's my good boy. Let mommy take care of you."
>you're given no choice in the matter, the she-wolf holding you in a grip that is somehow both inescapably strong, yet comforting and soft
>when you open your mouth to question her, a nipple is pushed into it
>and it immediately starts leaking warm, sweet milk
>the she-wolf shudders
>"Ooh, there's my good boy. Just drink my milk and let mommy Lupa take care of you."
>holds you in place until you finally swallow down your first mouthful
>a warmth flows through you when you do, and you feel safe and comfortable like you never have before
>if this is just a weird dream, you may as well enjoy it, right?
>you wrap your arms around Lupa and suck on her nipple
>more of her sweet milk gushes into your mouth, and she moans huskily
>"Oh! So eager!"
>holding onto her, you can support yourself while her paw leaves your back to pet your head
>"Good boy, good boy."
>her other paw works your pants around your thighs
>to caress your member
>the moment you tasted her milk, you were rock hard, and now you moan eagerly around her tit
>she has a feather touch, with pads that are soft as silk, and fur that's warm and comforting to the touch
>Lupa's warmth is all you could ever need
>she murmurs affirmations, assuring you that you are a good boy while she wraps her paw around you to stroke you
>even though her pace is gentle and steady, the she-wolf’s paw has you leaking pre-cum in no time at all
>you groan, unable to speak with your mouth full of milk and wolf titty
>unable to warn her that you’re about to burst
>Lupa shushes you anyways
>”Hush, my human. Mommy Lupa knows what she’s doing.”
>and she does!
>somehow she holds you at the edge of climax, keeping you squirming and moaning without ever changing her pace or grip
>and though you can barely focus, you keep on drinking and licking at her nipple for more of her milk
>the other teat leaks onto your belly
>”Ah~ You’re such a good boy for mommy. I want you to cum nice and hard. Can you do that for mommy?”
>you want to answer ‘yes’
>but instead you answer ‘mmmmmfff!’
>hard talking with your mouth full
>Lupa seems to get the idea, and she jerks you off faster
>her pawpads are slick with pre-cum, that coats your entire cock by now
>you thrust weakly, complete putty in her paws
>”I’ll count you down. Five, four, three…”
>she goes even faster!
>her grip somehow tight and soft at the same time
>”Two…”
>her milk keeps flowing
>you suck at her nipple like it were life itself
>you’re getting lightheaded, too busy drinking to breath
>”One!”
>the spell breaks
>and so does the dam
>you gasp, Lupa’s nipple forced from your mouth
>your cock spasms against the she-wolf’s paw as you’re rocked with the most intense orgasm of your life
>totally beats jerking off
>rope after rope of cum paints her fur paw’s white
>along with your lap
>her arm
>the bedsheets around you
>and you think you even hit the ceiling
>her velvety caress continues, slowing down again to her original pace
>”Good job! Good boy~”
>your mouth hangs open to leak out spent moans
>but it's stuffed with Lupa's nipple again and you start swallowing her milk to avoid drowning
>Lupa lets you suckle at her teat while she licks her paw clean of your spunk
>then her arm
>then she leans down and starts on your cock, reviving your erection as she goes
>the she-wolf finishes with a contented sigh
>"Keep drinking, baby boy. You'll need your strength."
>you will?
>you think you used up all your strength cumming your brains out
“Fuh wuht?”
>you manage to ask around Lupa’s nipple
>she smiles down at you and giggles like you're just too cute
>"For the next spirit! She's the ghost of Yiffmas Rough. You'll be sore in the morning, I'm afraid."
>you start to return to life a little
>Lupa's warning has got your heart beating faster
>how rough is 'Rough'?
>are you about to be put in traction?
>you're so busy worrying about the next spirit that you don't notice the flow of Lupa's milk has slowed to a trickle
>the more you wake up, the less you drink
>until it finally stops, and Lupa gently pulls your head away from her breast
>"I wish you the best of luck, my sweet little boy. I'm sure you'll do your best!"
>you cling to mommy Lupa harder
>but she's fading away
>"Call on me whenever you need mommy's milk to keep you strong. You work so hard, and deserve a reward every once in a while~"
>and then Lupa's gone
>you're alone again, in your own darkened bedroom, clinging onto your pillow, instead of the waist of a motherly wolf woman
>just like your average Saturday night
>you lie there for who knows how long, waiting for the worst
>but the worst never comes
>no more anthros, it seems
>maybe it was just a weird dream after all?
>the only evidence of Lupa’s existence is your pants, still slipped down around your thighs
>but you pull them back into place, assuring yourself it just happened in your sleep or something
>you roll over and close your eyes, and start to fall back asleep again
>you have a very rude awakening
>"Wakey-wakey meat! You think you're done?"
>you choke
>dragged out of bed and upright by your collar until you're standing on two feet
>and in a blink, you're no longer in your bedroom
>or inside at all
>your feet land on dry, dusty ground, warmed by bright sunshine that beats down on you
>it was winter when you went to sleep
>but now you're in the middle of an endless sunny savanna, with something big and strong and decidedly furry at your back
>you're released from its grip and shoved forward a few stumbling steps
>"Well? Get a good look, meat."
>the voice rumbles in a low growl
>you take slow steps to turn around, and turn your head to see the next spirit
>a lioness
>bright golden fur, almost glimmering in the sunlight, with a darker mane that covers her head and flows down along her back
>she's built like an amazon, not as well endowed as Lupa, but pure muscle with little fat
>broad shoulders, muscular arms, long toned legs that could run for days
>along with thighs and a rear befitting a runner
>abs that look harder than stone
>modest breasts that fit her frame
>you have no doubt as to this lioness's identity
"You're the ghost of Yiffmas Rough?"
>the lioness laughs and nods her head, tail lashing side to side
>"Good guess, meat! My friends call me Gwen, but I think you'll just be whimpering and screaming for me."
>the lioness holds up a paw, and flexes it to show off wicked claws
>"So here's the deal, meat. I'll give you a thirty second head start, then I'm going to hunt you down and fuck you until you can't walk."
>wow
>she knows what she's about
>and you know what you’re about
>you’re about to be running for your life
>or at least your pelvic bone's structural integrity
>but then the logical part of your brain speaks up
“Why should I run? You’re going to fuck me either way, right?”
>Lupa's constant rumbling grow stops and she looks at your with a furrowed brow
>the lioness sneers
>"What kind of question is that? To get our blood pumping! To make it real! Because it's not a real hunt unless I beat you completely."
>you don't know why, but you think she has a point
>as she speaks you feel your limbs start to fill with nervous, jittery energy
>your heart rate picking up, and breath coming faster, as though you were in mortal peril
>Gwen takes a deep breath and snuffs out her nose
>her ear flicks
>"There's your fear. Are you ready?"
>you give her a quick nod
>you played along with Lupa and loved it
>may as well play along with Gwen
>her tail whips and she goes back to rumbling in anticipation
>a predatory grin on her muzzle
>"One. Two. Three..."
>you take your cue and bolt
>an explosion of pent up energy you didn't know you had sends to pelting across the grassland at a breakneck pace
>faster than you've ever run before
>Gwen's voice fades while you flee further and further away
>you feel amazing
>alive
>like you're going to give that lioness the chase of a lifetime
>then you hear her roar echo over the savanna
>and you know you won't be fast enough
>you keep running, but the sound of her snarl gets closer and closer
>there's nowhere for you to hide, just more endless plain to run across
>you don't dare slow down to look behind you
>but you can hear her paws pounding against the ground
>feel her breath on the nape of your neck
>her claws reaching out
>you throw your leg out to try and come to a sudden halt
>diving aside as a missile of fur and claws spears through the air where you once stood
>you laugh in the thrill of the hunt
>and make it three more steps before being plastered by Gwen the lioness
>you're hurled to the ground, somehow uninjured besides some scrapes
>and the lioness is upon you
>you struggle, wrestling with her
>but for all your frantic energy, there's no beating the queen of the savanna's might
>you're pinned, face-down in the dirt with all of her weight on your back
>Gwen's breath comes in long huffs as she runs her nose up your back, ending with a lick on the side of your neck that sends shivers back down your spine
>"Ah, you smell good meat. Now comes the part where I devour my prey!"
>you're rolled over onto your back
>the claws come out, flashing as both paws come down
>your shirt goes first
>each swipe scratching your skin deep enough to leave a mark
>but not so deep you start bleeding
>you cry out, more from the shock than the pain
>pumped with adrenaline as you are, it feels good
>Gwen takes the opportunity to lick at your neck even more with her rough tough while she blindly shreds your pants with the same precision she did your shirt
>"Keep fighting, meat! I'm gonna take what I want, but I want to earn it!"
>you never stopped struggling, kicking your legs, pushing with all your might
>but she's too much
>too powerful
>and she's loving every second of it
>her searching paw finds what it's looking for
>and grips you tight enough to make you squirm
>"Haaa~ There's my prize. You put up a good fight, meat, but now it's time to acknowledge your superior."
>Gwen doesn't wait for a response
>instead sitting back and hauling your legs up
>up
>up
>pinning them over your shoulders in a position you don't think you'd ever be flexible enough to pull off
>she lines herself up, you can see her thighs soaked with desire
>her cunt glistening
>she slams her hips down hard enough to jolt your brain
>she's burning hot, and tight enough to clamp down on your cock with her muscles
>Gwen lets out a roar of triumph that makes your whole world shake as she takes you to the hilt in one mighty thrust
>claws dig into your legs that she keeps pinned behind your head
>you prove her prediction right, moaning and whimpering
>totally helpless while this might huntress conquers you like the prey you are
>and in turn, she has no words for you
>only snarls and roars with every thrust
>just like before, this spirit has you nearing climax quickly
>but you struggle valiantly to hold off, letting her wring more pleasure out of you
>the lioness doesn't seem to care about you at all, smashing you into the ground over and over again
>getting faster and rougher
>her roars louder and longer
>you can tell she's nearing a climax of her own
>fuck that's hot
>this giant of a woman using you to get off
>you hang onto her arms and moan like your life depends on it
>finally, Gwen throws her head back and slams you down hard into the dirt in a flurry of rapid, feral thrusts
>you're pretty sure she just broke something of yours
>the roar dies down, but only because she leans over you
>still rutting like a maniac
>and bites down hard on your shoulder
>you wail in pain
>and moan in pleasure
>as that final shock is enough to drive you over the edge into another explosive climax
>Gwen doesn't stop thrusting
>not until long after you've emptied your balls inside her
>just as intense as last time, and yet totally different in every way
>when she finally releases you, licking blood from her lips with a satisfied mewl, Gwen stands
>a gush of cum leaks from her and runs down her thighs
>but the lioness doesn't seem to care, letting your legs drop to the ground
>she lets out a sigh in a long satisfied 'haaa'
>then looks down at you
>"You put up a good fight, for a cut of fuckable meat. Pass my thanks along to the fox."
>it takes a few seconds for you to realize that you're being talked to
"The...fox? Is that the next one?"
>the lioness scoffs, and offers you a paw to lift you to your feet
>"Ha! You wish. Next is the ghost of Yiffmas Kinky. Good luck."
>kinky?
>is that worse than 'rough'?
>you go to ask Gwen as she seemingly ignores you to pick at her claws
"Uh hey, what should I expect with--"
>the lioness looks up and interrupts
>"Hey meat, think fast!"
>you do not think fast
>and so you don't get out of the way when she sweeps her leg out in a kick that throws your own legs vertical
>and your face hurtling for hard earth
>but it doesn't hit the ground
>instead smashing into the softer landing of your pillow
>your whole body back in bed, in your own home
>you groan
>starting to think this really isn't a dream
>because your shirt is still just tatters hanging around your shoulders
>and you're starting to feel monumentally sore from Gwen's rough treatment
>you roll over to the side of the bed and call out to the empty darkness
"Alright. Whoever's next, can you give me like, five minutes to get a glass of water?"
>when no answer comes, you stand up and wander from bedroom to kitchen to get a drink you so desperately need
>and absentmindedly note the fresh glass bottle of milk sitting in the fridge next to the water bottles
>it takes a moment for you to realize what it is
>but when you do, you snatch it up and pop it open to drink the dairy like the waters of life itself
>it's not as good as straight from the source
>but it still fills you with that warmth, and soothes all your aches and pains
>by the time you’re done, a quarter of the milk is gone and you feel totally refreshed
>returning to your bedroom, you’re ready for whatever may be waiting there for you
>and shockingly, it’s still just your bedroom
>the only thing different is the hyena sitting on the bed
>compared to the last two ghosts she seems downright mundane
>for a seven foot tall hyena woman
>she has neither the exaggerated curves of Lupa, nor the superhuman physique of Gwen
>the striped hyena has a middle-of-the-road build, but with only a little but of pudge around her belly
>a thick neck and broad shoulders, giving her a slight hunch-backed posture
>her hips curve pleasantly, and her breasts are big but not to the exaggerated side of the she-wolf
>her fur looks plenty soft though
>what you can see of it at least
>this is the first spirit you’ve seen fully clothed, wearing some skinny jeans and a t-shirt with an incomprehensible metal band logo on it
>she seems to be taking the same opportunity to look you up and down as you do the same to her, then offers you a casual wave
>”’Sup dude. Nice toes.”
>well
>hell of a way to say hello, but given your night so far…
>you wave back
“Uh, hey. You’re the uh, kinky one?”
>the hyena cackles and bobs her head
>”That’s me! I’m the spooky scary fetish yeen!”
>all things considered, she doesn’t seem very spooky or scary
>besides being a hyena she seems downright normal
“You don’t really seem all that bad. I figured you’d be more uh, sex-fiend-y. No offense.”
>the hyena cocks her head
>then gasps
>”Oh yeah! I totally forgot!”
>she springs off the bed, and snaps her fingers
>her clothes dissolve, leaving her in fetish wear that couldn’t have fit under the normal outfit
>a black latex corset, matching leggings with garter belts attaching
>a black g-string
>her perky breasts are exposed, her black nipples half-covered by dusky brown fur
>”And the finishing touch!”
>she gestures around her crotch, and what materializes damn near gives you a heart attack
>not just any sex toy
>a strap on of ludicrous size
>two-feet long, and at least four inches in diameter
>ending in a fucking fist
>”Bend over, bitch!”
>you stumble with indecent haste get away from the ghost of Yiffmas kinky, throwing open the bedroom door and backing out
>she just cackles in wicked amusement
>”Hey! Hey come back, I was kidding, I was kidding!”
>the light in the bedroom flicks on
>and the hyena’s head peers out of the doorway, ears flopped apologetically
>”Hey, I put the fist away. It was just a joke, honest. Come back, please.”
>you stare at her, suspecting a trick
“I go in there, and then you grab me and tie me to a table and do horrible things to me.”
>your houseguest rolls her eyes
>”Do I look like a snow leopard to you?”
>you double take, earning another cackle
“Snow leopard?! Don’t tell me she’s next!”
>”No! No! No snow leopards, forget I said anything.”
>this ghost is doing a real bad job at reassuring you
>you stay where you are in the hallway
>”Please, no more jokes, promise. Come back to the bedroom.”
>she manages to get her cackling under control, and gives you a toothy smile that seems genuine
>so with a deep breath to steady yourself, you follow her disappearing head back into the bedroom
>where she’s taken a seat on the bed again
>you note with approval that ‘the fist’ is gone, and take a seat behind her
>”See? All good. No more teasing until the fun begins, promise."
>she gives you another grin
>god those are some big teeth
"The fun. The part where you get all kinky."
>that grin stretches wider
>and takes a predatory edge
>"Yes! I am the ghost of Yiffmas Kinky, after all! But first things first, do you have a safeword?"
>the question catches you off guard
>a safeword, for the spirit of fetish sex?
>who wields 'the fist' for jokes?
"Uh..."
>fuck, how do you do a safeword?
>isn't 'pineapple' the usual one?
>the yeen pre-empts your answer with a suggestion
>”Try to think of something you know you’ll remember. How about ‘collie’?”
>you blink
>you certainly would never forget collies
>how did she guess that?
>however she did, it seems perfect
>you nod firmly
"Collie."
>your guest cackles again and claps her paws together
>"Perfect! It may get a little intense, so if you can't handle it, just use that word and we'll stop, alright?"
>makes sense to you
“How intense is a little intense?”
>she hums in thought
>”Nothing I don’t think you could handle. Some pain, some pleasure. I prefer to make it a surprise! Now, once we get started, I’m gonna be in the zone. Like flipping a switch. So, when you’re ready just say the word.”
>you absorb that information
>looks like she’s giving you a choice in the matter
>much more than you’ve gotten all night
>you could just say no right now, and probably be done with the whole thing
“Okay. I’m game.”
>nothing ventured, nothing gained
>she cackles some more, ears waggling in excitement
>”Perfect.”
>then, just as she said, a switch is thrown
>her smile turns vindictive and predatory
>her eyes narrow as she fixates on you
>”Then lose the pants and get on your knees, pet.”
>you stare at her a second, then jump to follow orders
>your shirt is already in tatters, and falls off your shoulders with a shrug
>the pants are slightly torn up, but they too go in a flash
>kicked across the room in your haste to kneel for the yeen
“Yes ma’am.”
>you look up at her from between her knees
>and see her scowling down at you
>”Call me mistress, pet. Make another mistake and I’ll have to punish you.”
>she reaches out, and rests a big, meaty paw on top of your head to drag you forward
>”Tongue out. You’re going to lick my thighs until I’m satisfied. Do a good job, or you might not enjoy what comes next.”
>licking thighs?
>is this supposed to be BDSM?
>you open wide and run your tongue along the fur on the inside of one of mistress’s thighs
>letting her guide your head with a casual paw
>first one side, then the other
>then back again
>mistress urges you on
>”More, pet. I want them slick enough to fuck.”
>you do your best, but her shaggy fur is more than you can handle
>and your jaw is starting to ache
>the paw on your head pushes you further
>and suddenly yanks your head back when your exploring tongue goes too far up her thigh
>”Ah! Bad pet! You think you’ve earned my pussy? You can’t even handle my thighs!”
>you’re shoved back away from her lap, and she closes her legs
>”That’s your second mistake, pet. That means punishment. But since you’re so incompetent, I’ll let you finish the job the easy way. Say thank you.”
>your mouth hangs open you've been licking her thighs so long
>you have to fold your dried-out tongue back in your mouth and force your jaw to work
"Thank you..."
>oh fuck!
"Mistress! Thank you mistress!"
>mistress cackles
>smiling evilly
>"Close, pet, close. I'll forgive it this once. Now..."
>out of thin air, she produces a bottle of lube in her free paw
>and squeezes a generous amount in between her thighs
>"Tongue out, pet."
>mistress doesn't wait for you to comply, spreading her legs and pushing your face between her thighs once more
>"Get to work!"
>thankfully it's a flavored lube, artificial blueberry accenting the taste of hyena thighs
>your jaw still aches from overuse, but you work enthusiastically to spread the viscous substance all over her
>and you don't dare stop until she's satisfied
>"Mmh. Not bad. But I still have to punish you. Up."
>you're pushed away from her thighs once again
>mistress gestures for you to stand, which you do quickly
"Yes mistress."
>she tuts
>"Over my lap."
>your wrist is snatched, and you're hauled forward so you're draped over the hyena's lap
>she opens her legs, and then clamps them shut again, squeezing your penis between them
>"Ready for your punishment? I won't stop until you cum, understand?"
>this doesn't feel like a punishment!
>it feels like you're about to fuck a pair of hyena thighs
"Yes mistress!"
>the hyena laughs and settles one of her paws on your exposed rear
>"Good."
>her heavy paw comes up
>then a whoosh of displaced air
>SMACK
>and it lands right across the ass
"Huuungh!"
>you let out a wordless groan of shocked pain
>your cheeks are stinging from the blow
>the force of the impact making you rock slightly in her lap
>you feel her body move, hips twisting slightly so she can give you a full-body smack
>SMACK
>in the same spot
>you groan again, still reeling from the first spank
>you weren't able to prepare for the next one
>or the one after that
>SMACK
"Faaah-uck!"
>that was a word, at least
>her paw seems custom built to inflict punishment like this
>wide, rough pads that leave a painful impression that's sure to leave a mark as they come down again
>SMACK
>it's not getting any easier
>you and squirm in her lap, but her thighs squeeze tight
>her other paw on your back holding you down
>you flinch in preparation for the next one
>SMACK
>that one makes you whimper
>she's not going any harder, or any faster, but each successive swat seems to build on the last
>this time you're able to react to her paw lifting again
"Wait! Waitwaitwait--"
>SMACK
"God! Fuck!"
>you pant through clenched teeth
>and remember
>the safeword!
>you can use it right now!
>make it all stop
>and yet...
>SMACK
>you wanted to try this
>even if it hurts
>there's something perversely enjoyable about it
>you don't think it's exactly pleasurable
>even if your cock rubs against her slick thighs with every harsh--
>SMACK
>you whimper
>the pain lasting in between smacks now
>mistress keeps up her inexorable pace, punishing you mercilessly
"Hurts..."
>you whine
>no reaction from the hyena save yet another
>SMACK
>you're sweating now
>grasping at the sheets
>you have to take your punishment
>like a good pet
>you can handle it
>SMACK
>or not
>ow
>this time her paw rests on your ass again
>it feels like your skin is vibrating and burning at the same time
>"That's ten. A decent start for a whiny pet. I want you to thank mistress for your punishment."
>she can't be serious
>but mistress sounds deadly serious
"Th-thank you mist--"
>SMACK
>the paddling goes on
>and on
>and on
>paw rising high, then coming down hard on your poor abused rear
>and yet
>over time, things change
>mistress squeezes your cock on every smack
>and shifts her legs back and forth to stimulate your cock for all the punishment you receive
>even though you can't stop squirming, gasping, whimpering
>you moan too
>and mistress ignores the slight thrust you make after every spank, subtly fucking her thighs
>your third orgasm of the night is growing closer
>it's a bizarre experience
>not gentle and tender, like with Lupa
>or fast and feral, like with Gwen
>but a slow painful grind to a single conclusion
>complete submission to mistress's punishment
"Thank you mistress."
>you start to moan the words yourself in time to her paw
>and mistress seems pleased, rumbling the first few times
>you're close
>and but there's no response to your desperate groaning
>no change in pace
>but every deliberate strike against tender red flesh brings you closer
>until finally you can take it no more
>on the last--
>SMACK--
>you lose yourself, bucking your hips hard
>and blasting another load between mistress's thighs
>it's like heaven
>your head swims in a rush of dopamine after wallowing in cortisol for who knows how long
>mistress keeps her paw on your ass the entire time, rubbing gently across it until you're spent
>you think it might be the biggest load of the night
"G-g-god. Mistress. Thhhank you."
>you can't stop yourself from shaking
>mistress finally breaks from her cold domineering demeanor to cackle softly
>"And we’re done."
>for the last time, she lifts her paw from your rear, letting it rest lower, on your thigh while the other gently rubs your back
>"Pretty intense, huh?"
>you manage to pick your head up enough to nod
"Yes mistress."
>she shushes you
>"Just Lindsey. We're all done with the mistress stuff."
>works for you
>Lindsey is a nice name
>"You stay right there. I'll get you something to drink, okay?"
>you don't think you could move if you wanted to
>good thing Lindsey lifts you and deposits you face down on your bed
>your ass still hurts from the movement, making you groan involuntarily
>"Be right back, dude."
>you listen to Lindsey stand and swing open the bedroom door
>she's back a couple minutes later with a glass of milk she holds up to your lips
>"Here. This is more of the good stuff. Should work wonders."
>Lindsey cradles your cheek with her paw
>which seems much softer now that it isn't beating your ass red
>and slowly feeds you the milk until you've downed it all
>it does work wonders, soothing your pain
>but not getting rid of it entirely
>Lindsey slowly lifts you again, and you can see she's done another change of costume into big flannel pajamas
>you're shifted once again, this time placed face down on top of the yeen
>head to chest, arms around you, her nose snuffing against your head
>"You took it like a champ for a first-timer. Did you enjoy it?"
>hell of a question
>you think you did
>or maybe you're only enjoying it now that it's over
"Uh...I dunno."
>Lindsey rubs your back and hums
>"That's okay. I'm glad you gave it a try. Even if it's not for you, I had a lot of fun."
>you don’t want her to let you go
"You're not gonna disappear now that we're done? Poof?"
>you're squeezed in a yeen hug
>"Nope.”
>thank god
>her comfort is keeping the pain of her punishment at bay
>a scary thought occurs
“And there are no other spirits? No snow leopards?”
>Lindsey cackles
"No! No snow leopards. I was the last one. I can stay here with you until you fall asleep, if you like."
>you do like
>you return the hug as best as you can
"Thanks Lindsey."
>it's been a long night
>"No problem dude. Get some sleep. Oh, and here."
>one arm leaves your back to press something small and soft against your face
>you recognize it as your stuffed collie
>guess that's how she knew
>you shut your eyes, rocked to sleep by the rise and fall of the final spirit's breath
>this time nothing wakes you until the morning
>when an angry voice startles you
>"Lindsey what the fuck!"
>you snort
>and try to jump out of bed, thinking you've overslept
>but something holds you down
>the arms of the Ghost of Yiffmas Kinky
>she's still here
>and still holding you tight as she snores raucously
>you crane your neck, looking for the source of the angry voice
>and see a petite vixen with two tails at the foot of the bed
>she's dressed skimpily in some kind of shrine maiden dress that only just covers her most vital parts
>the small blue flames around her eyes flare
>"You were supposed to be gone when he wakes up Lindsey! He's supposed to think it's all a dream!"
>she stamps a footpaw and yanks at Lindsey's leg
>who just grumbles and kicks free of the vixen's paw
>"Fuggoff D'ehjana. Tryin' to sleep."
>D'ehjana does not fuck off
>she stomps around the bed to grab Lindsey by the shirt and shake her vigorously
>she's stronger than she looks, so you get jostled along with your yeen bedmate
>"Fuuuck. Fine, fine. I'm up, I'm up."
>Lindsey gives you an extra squeeze before releasing you and letting you roll off onto the side
>D'ehjana points to your door and growls
>"Will you get out of here already! You're going to get us in trouble being in the real world all night!"
>it's a shame to see Lindsey go, taking her warmth with her as she sits up and then off the bed
>but in parting, she turns about and kisses your cheek in hyena fashion
>a slobbery lick from jawline to hairline
>and a cackle
>"I'll catch you later dude. Give me a call and I'll see how them toes taste~"
>she winks and leaves
>fading away even as she walks through the bedroom door
>leaving you alone with the vixen
>who huffs
"So you’re the fox, huh?”
>D'ehjana rolls her eyes
>funny, the flames do a little spin too
>"Kitsune, thank you. This whole night was supposed to be a mystical dream! Until toesucker had to get all lovey-dovey."
>you laugh
"Ah well. What can you do? What's the lesson anyways?"
>the vixen whips her two tails, and cocks her head
>"Lesson?"
>you sit up on the bed yourself, dangling legs over the side facing her
>and grabbing absentmindedly, you sit your collie plush upright on your bedside table where it belongs
"Yeah, the lesson, like in the book. The three ghosts show up to teach the dude the meaning of Christmas or something. Oh! Was it to not give up on writing?"
>you certainly feel revitalized on that front
>if nothing else, the events of this night would make a good Christmas green
>not that anyone would believe them to be real
>the kitsune laughs, her mood lightening a little
>"I told you we weren't doing the book. It’s not Christmas for three weeks! I just thought it'd be hot to see you get fucked. Get some ideas for quality time with my own boytoy."
>D’ehjana waves a paw dismissively
>"Honestly, I think you should have gone with the fist. Now THAT would have been a show, don’tcha think?”
>nope
>no chance
>you shake your head no, and she just shrugs
>"Fine, you mortals and your hangups. I guess the fox is out of the bag. I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t tell anyone about this. How about I do you a favor in return?"
>a favor from a magical fox dream lady?
>that could be worth a lot!
>who knows what such cosmic power could do to change your life--
>who are you kidding you know what you want
"Yeah, can I get Lindsey's number?"

>be small charter boat pilot and crew member

That reminds me, how would anthros feel about meat?
Would there be non sentient quadruped versions of animals for us to enjoy?
Please tell me I won't have to go vegan for my waifur, I love the taste of beef in more ways than one

>Use your PTO to take a 3 day weekend and rent a shitty little boat
>Time to go fishing
>You drive up to a nice secluded lake with your finishing poles and boat
>It’s a cloudy day with a thick and heavy fog covering that you could cut with a knife
>You get the boat off the trailer and into the water then you sail off hoping you catch a big one
>You find a nice spot, get your nightcrawlers on the hook, cast out line and wait for the fish to bite
>An hour has past, nothings bitten yet and somehow the fogs gotten even thicker
>You can’t see the shoreline anymore but the scariest part is
>You feel like somethings is watching you
>You look around but the fog covers everything
>Then you see what looks like 2 shining orbs staring at you in the fog
>You blink and they’re gone
>Probably just your imagination
>You think to yourself it’s best time that you head back to shore
>You try to start the boat but engine just keep stalling
>Damn, you shouldn’t have rented the cheapest boat
>While you trying to get the engine started you hear the song of something splash into the water
>Something large
>You nervously cope to yourself “Probably just a snapping turtle.”
>Suddenly your boat rocks and you and your just barely able to maintain your balance
>You yell “What the fuck was that!” before something hits your boat again and this time it flips over.
>You’re dunked in the cool lake water
>As you try to swim up the the surface something grabs you with clawed hand
>You scream, bubbles pouring out of your mouth as you feel the creatures scaled arms hold you underwater and swim away with you
>You try to fight it off and get away but it’s grip is too strong
>Soon you mercifully break the the surface of the water and you draw in a deep breath
>You look up and see the creature holding you down in the dirt
>You almost can’t believe your eyes
>This monster looks like hybrid of a woman and an alligator
>She’s ginormous must be 8 or 9 feet tall with strong muscles covered by the green scales all over her body
>Her head is just like that of an alligator with giant teeth and eyes that glow in the fog
>You scream out in terror and all the monster does is let out a laugh
>She says in a gruff yet feminine voice “You can scream all you want, nobody's gonna hear you out here.”
>You nervously say “W-what the fuck, who t-the hell are you?”
>She gives a toothy smile and says “You can call me Alli and your gonna be my bitch”
>Then she takes her clawed and tears apart your clothes
>You hopelessly try to fight her off and you say “No! Stop! Get off of me!”
>Alli just laughs and growls “I love it when they struggle.” before ripping apart your underwear leaving you completely exposed
>To your horror you cock is hard
>Alli smiles and says “All that fighting back, but your body knows what you really want”
>Then she grabs your arms and pins them over your head her sharp claws painfully digging into them
>She gets her legs under your and forces you into the amazon position
>You try with all your power to get her off of you but to no avail. The more you struggle the tighter her hold becomes
>Alli looks you in the eyes and growls “You’re mine bitch!” before you feel her warm slimy cunt sham down on your cock
>You scream as she pounds you into the dirt and mud. Your legs and hips scream in pain as she mercilessly jackhammers you
>Alli lets out deep guttural moans as she roughly rapes you. “Your struggling is so fucking cute.”
>Tears well up in your eyes and flow down your face. You hopeless thrash around and sob “Fuck you bitch, I’ll kill you!”
>Alli looks down on you and gives you a wicked smile showing off her teeth before she lifts up one of her hands
>*SLAP!!!*
>Pain explodes across your face and your world is left spinning from the smack all they while her cunt stills pounds your cock over and over
>Alli brings her face right up to your ear and growls “Try and kill me all you want, it will never unrape you, bitch.”
>Then she takes out her tongue and licks the side of the face she just slap
>You stop struggling
>All you can do is cry and moan in pain and pleasure from her merciless onslaught
>Soon her breathing gets more labored and she pounds you harder and harder
>The pressure in you loins build and you let out a moan of pleasure as you cum hard inside this gator monsters cunt
>Alli clearly cums at the exact same time letting out deep moans of pleasure
>Then she collapses on top of you
>You just lay their exhausted you don’t even try to escape anymore
>After a bit of rest Alli looks at you and says “Let’s get you to your new home.”
>Then she picks you and carries you over her shoulder and walk away with you

>food and oxygen isn't an issue, just boredom
>they've been acting real fidgety lately

>are you making them sick because you're human?
>they keep acting stranger each day
>until the captain locks you in a room "for your own safety"

That'd be a fun twist to run with like how the japs and older versions of D&D ran with orcs being very pig/boar-like to the point of being boar/pig anthros in some versions.
>orcs are boars
>half-orcs/city orcs are pigs
>goblins are rabbits

>but after I declined because of my not mixing work and love personal policy...
>I could tell some machinations were turning in her head
>first it was stares from across the hall
>then it was innocent chatting
>it seemed reasonable enough. Until one day she asked for my help regarding the women’s restroom
>a bulb had “burnt out” and the janitor was on another floor, and a spare halogen rod thingies was in a neat little spares box
>looking back- it was all too perfect, too convenient, and too close to off hours to not have been a carefully thought out trap
>after having gotten off the site stool and putting down the dead bulb, my mouth was covered in a strange smelling cloth
>best guess and probably the right one; was that it was the old chloroform stunt
>because when I woke up, I was on a toilet in a stall, being ridden hard in a lotus position by none other than my coworker, Ellie.
>”finally awake huh stud muffin? Then have a look at this”
>not even 5 seconds having been woken, I’m sobered up by what I’m looking at
>an image of me, with perverse sharpy graffiti all over me in... an extremely compromised position
>I look like some sort of cum-spigot man whore who’s just been ridden by the entire animal kingdom
>the passed out, open mouth face I’m making in the images doesn’t help either
>how long was I roofied?
>”by the looks on your face you must need a little explaining, it was me who made you look like the finest piece of toilet meat a brothel might have to offer. mmph~!”
>she suddenly shushed me as some stranger walked to the restroom where my abuse was taking place. Walking to a different stall
>like a demon from abysses no man ought tread. Ellie grasps at my throat. Her other hand holding my legs upas to not announce our presence to the poor soul in the other stall
>she leans in, and whispers- quieter than a fly in a far off wall
>”If you behave and cum in me I won’t bleat... don’t worry though, I’m *probably* on the pill”
>her hips start gyrating in circles, trying to tease an orgasm out of me with speed and finesse rather than brute humping
>eventually I couldn’t contain the tide of white deep within, and I creampied my rapist hard
>it was like her face itself squished and contorted with a smug, perverse smile. Her horizontal rounded pupils accentuating her ahegao face, a silent bah-ing squeak hopefully only I could hear left her mouth
>what was probably less than a moment, but that felt like an eternity later. The stranger flushed the toilet, washed her hands, and vacated the restroom
>suddenly as Ellie let got of my throat and legs, they all painfully twanged back into position
>still atop me, she gyrated her hips a little more before delicately pulling her nethers away from my own
>a delicate, but hearty bloop was audible
>my seed, meant to conceive a wonderful new person into the world. Was now at risk of impregnating this... this demon of a woman
>who by now was showing her phone to me again. A collection of compromising pictures from this encounter
>”just a little insurance. Come when I call or text straight to me, or else these go everywhere. See you around, pretty boy~.”
>that was the incident that ruined my life. Everything i had in terms of my work reputation was now in the hands of a deranged she-goat
>fast forward to now again. Still eating her out
>this was part of her little ritual. For the past near six months
>she would grasp at my hair and pull me into her crotch harder on the days when her workload was heavier, pressing me against her plush, pink pussy engorged by lust
>it was these days she would always play risky games too, one time she was nearly caught by one of her subordinates after requesting a coffee pickup
>”that’s right, lick it nice and clean, I’ve been stuck at this awful seat all day you know. Do remember to clean off all the mustiness of the workday”
>her legs tightened around my kneeling body, her hand caressing the back of my neck, pushing my head harder into her groin
>I wish I were free of this nightmare. She’s insane. And if not for her covering for me at times I’d probably be fired by now because of my performance taking a dive because of her monopolizing my time
>without warning, a torrent of her quim squirted into my mouth
>why does it have to taste like lamb?
>”good boy.... gooood boy... now, off to the bathroom with you. I’ll give you another assignment there in a couple minutes”
>she said, grinding her pussy against me with her hips before patting my cheek
>I can’t disobey, she’s got me by the throat
>sometimes literally
>to the men’s room I went, i barely got the chance to clean my face before she was upon me again
>for all her torment in the offices. These restrooms were where she had real free reign
>incidentally I was the only man around her department, not in my own- but I was in her territory now. These men’s rooms were her private little oasis

>"10 miles per hour! The ramp speed limit is 10 MILES PER HOUR! Just because a belt loader can hit 25 doesn't mean that it should."
>You are getting chewed out by a literal ramp rat.
>Her eyebrows are knitted in frustration as she sighs.
>"I don't want to see you guys splattered all over the tarmac, no matter how badly it needs a paint job. And put on your damn seat belts!"
>To your left, a cheetah has her paws over her lips, holding back laughter.
>She's none other than your partner in crime, Sabrina.
>Sabrina unsuprisingly has a runner's build, but is deceptively powerful due to chucking bags all day.
>Her well toned legs are as thick as your head, and you've seen how fast they can carry her.
>Granted, you've only seen her dash to grab free coffee and donuts in the morning.
>She tries to poke you with her elbow, but given the height difference, it's more like being jabbed in the side of your head.
>"Watch this,"
>she says with a wink.
>"Hey boss, you know I can hit like 50 on foot, right?"
>"That's-"
>"Like this!"
>Your boss is cut off by a gust of wind as Sabrina blasts through a door.
>The door slams into the wall, rattling off it's poor, abused hinges.
>Dust motes and dirt kicked up into a cloud starts to settle on the top of your heads.
>You watch your supervisor's face start to redden.
>You think you can see her whiskers crinkle and start to fizzle.
>"Safety violation, safety violation, you're all getting tickets...you'll all pay..."
>she mumbles under her breath.
>You raise your hand.
"Well, if that's all, I think I'll take my leave."
>You about face and take one step before you feel the rat's paw grab your shoulder.
>"You're not dismissed yet."
>You curse your feeble human legs and their slow speed.
"I'm sorry, I won't get caught- I mean, I won't do it again."
>You quickly correct yourself.
>She sighs again.
>"I don't like being a hardass, but I can't cover for you goofing around every time."
>"The manager might be sweet on you since you're the only boy on the below the wing,"
>she starts.
>"-but it doesn't matter how hard you work if you can't tone it down a bit."
>You actually start to feel a little bad now, even though you're being scolded like a child.
"I'll try to keep out of trouble, for real this time."
>you apologize.
>"Don't get all swept up in Sabrina's nonsense. Now get out there and make me proud!"
>She slaps your back a bit too hard.
>You go and stand with your other coworkers, sans Sabrina.
>"Looks like she really gave it to ya,"
>"More like she wants to give it to ya!"
>You look to the trio of hyenas leaning against a wall.
>They start cackling as they strut up to you.
>One circles around to your left, while the other two flank your right.
>"She's definitely not enough woman for ya though."
>"Not like me."
>The leader of the pack comes into view.
>She's absolutely massive, dwarfing your manlet self.
>Her biceps look like tree trunks.
>You're pretty confident she could break a baseball bat just by flexing.
>If she wanted to, she could just hoist you over her shoulder and carry you away.
>As long as you don't run into her in a dark alley, you probably won't get dragged into an old rusted out Lincoln.
>Probably
>A massive paw the size of your head cups you under the chin.
>"Yeah, I'd make a real mess of you."
>She licks her lips with her massive tongue and crouches down to eye level.
>"Once you get a taste of yeen pussy, you'll never go back."
>Gross, you swear she's huffing your scent right now.
>"I bet you want it, dressed like that. You humans are always talking about how cold you are, and you come here showing all that skin."
>You're just wearing shorts and a tank top, nothing strange to your knowledge.
>"If you ever want to be mommy's little slut we can pass you around for a bit."
>She cackles before letting you go.
>Your supervisor stands in front of the gaggle of people drinking coffee and claps her hands.
>"Alright ladies, we got a busy day today! It's the Anthro Expo so we'll be seeing about quadruple the number of flights for the next week!"
>"Bring your best because we'll be clocking a lot of overtime. Manager's bringing lunch for us around 1. Get to your assignments ASAP."
>"And remember, the company's counting on you!"
>Talon Air.
>It's the only anthro-owned airline made specifically for anthros.
>Created by a some Korean War ace in the 60's, it's niche customer base has left it as a regional company for decades.
>More than that though, the cost of accomodations for all types of passengers, and lower seat count has created a huge overhead preventing it from expanding.
>Global airlines also have it cornered, with several large companies squabbling over shares to try and buy out the company.
>This focus on anthro customers is also reflected in the staffing as well.
>All of the ground service is almost exclusively female and non-human.
>Human strength just can't compete with it's betters.
>As far as you know you're the only human working for the company in the whole airport, maybe even the whole midwest.
>That's only counting the ground, through.
>Above the wing, flight attendants and service desk employees are soft, waifish boys hired to titillate the customers.
>They might be the only other people that get sexually harassed more than yourself.
>But it's not so bad being a diversity hire.
>You got a $4 pay raise upon hiring due to "work experience."
>What work? Literally the number of years you've held ANY job.
>That was your first time seeing that.
>You feel like the pay only covers the harassment from everyone but the yeen squad.
>You definitely want a large bonus for tolerating them.
>It's a bit hard to admit, but MOST of the attention you get is a bit flattering.
>Just don't ever show weakness and let them fluster you.
>You learned that at your last job at Stagbucks.
>Done with your musing, you step outside the break room while tossing on some hi-viz.
>While waiting for a shuttle, you get distracted by a sharp whistle.
>"Hey kid, get in, I've got candy in the back."
>It's your friend Sabrina, calling out from a tug tractor, arm hanging lazily out the window.
>Rolling your eyes, you hop in the passenger's side.
"Do we got any work yet?"
>you ask.
>"Nothing's going out for a while, but we got a few CRJ's going out later."
>"Just sit back and relax, we'll go grab some bags in a bit."
>She leans back as much as her gigantic frame allows.
>Doesn't keep her from cracking her head against the ceiling after hitting the slightest imperfection on the road.
>"So the rest of the girls giving you much trouble?"
"Nothing more than the usual. If it wasn't for you, May, and Lisa, I'm sure I'd already had my pants stripped off more than once."
>Sabrina and some the other girls are thankfully all married.
>Sabrina herself is in her 30's, acting somewhere between an older sister and work mom.
>The only harassment that comes from her is invitations to BBQ's with her and her husband.
>That doesn't stop her from trying to hook you up with the absurd number of sisters she has, however.
>Her husband smokes a mean pork butt though.
>There's only 2 other people that aren't married or in the yeen squad on your team.
>One is a crocodile girl trying to work while getting her aircraft maintainance certification.
>Thirsty as hell, but respectful and a good teammate otherwise.
>She brings in home baked sweets for the team all the time.
>She's even brought in a whole cooler filled with sweet tea.
>The last one honestly terrifies you.
>She's the tallest girl, happening to be a wolf almost 8 feet tall.
>Unkempt with a smell that proves she does not wash her hands after jilling off.
>And always writing things in a pocket notebook angrily.
>You've literally seen her steal a hi-viz vest of yours after pressing it to her face and smelling it.
>If she shoots up the place, luckily you'll be one of the ones that gets to live.
>Sabrina turns to you.
>"Hey, so me and the husband are having a cookout this weekend."
>"Chicken wings for days. You gotta try my wing sauce I make too."
>"Home-made hot sauce and all."
"Are any of your sisters going to be there?"
>you ask.
>She winces and starts scratching the back of her head.
>"So there's my older sister, my mom and dad, and my sister Lucy. You met her last time."
"Yeah, I remember meeting her. Real sweet girl."
>"The hubby's bringing his friends too."
>"Aaaaaand..."
>she starts.
>"The twins might be coming...?"
>You start pinching your brow in frustration.
"How could I forget them? They only chased me around the yard for 2 hours, literally."
>'Show us your dick! We want to see your dick!'
>Your legs eventually cramped up.
>They did see your dick, forcefully.
>It was a nightmare.
>"Hey, cut them some slack."
"They pantsed me! Sexually!"
>you shout.
"Like I didn't have that happen enough in high school."
>"They're still just kids."
"They're nineteen!"
>"I meant relatively."
>"Just give them a chance. I grew up with husband. How else did you think I landed him?"
>She sighs and puts her hand on her cheek.
>"On the plus side, there's a pretty high chance you could get a threesome going. Just don't end up in the hospital."
"I'll pass, thanks."
>A smug and fittingly catlike grin spreads across her face.
>"I forgot we had such a cute young man, saving his purity for the one he loves!"
"I'm not some mormon. I'm just trying to avoid being a chew toy for a gang of hyenas. Are you suggesting I hook up with little miss Columbine there?"
>She is pressing her face against the window of her vehicle next to yours.
>You can see the grease from her mop of hair, cut into the classic faceless hentai protagonist look.
>The window is completely fogged over, and she's doing SOMETHING with her hands near her lap.
>Hopefully she's just writing in her impromptu Death Note again.
>"I'm just saying you need to live a little. You're only in your 20's once. And all of my sisters are lovely young ladies."
"They're probably too 'fast' for me. Oh, our luggage is ready!"
>You quickly change the subject.
>You and Sabrina finish up some light breakfast before getting to work towing some baggage carts.
>As you arrive, it looks like the the rest of the girls are hard at work.
>You have a lot of disparaging things to say about the hyenas, but at least they pull most of the weight of the team.
>Toss bags onto a belt, rinse and repeat.
>At least most of the girls down here are your friends, enjoying some light banter with everyone.
>"Try to keep up softie!"
>"Work those little muscles!"
>All sorts of playful remarks are had at your expense, mixed in with conversation and bitching about the job.
>All the while the wolf girl is muttering something under her breath while staring at you.
>You swear you heard something about "sluts" and "hot, sweaty dick."
>You're lifting a particularly heavy bag when a pair of arms shoot underneath yours to grip the bag.
>"L-Let me help..."
>Oh god it's her, you're trapped in a hug by this beast.
>You can smell her panting on you.
>Huh, suprisingly fresh and minty.
>Too bad the rest of her doesn't smell as good.
>"You're so small and c-cute. And you smell good."
>You feel a lick behind your ear.
>"You have to w-wash behind your ears..."
>She wordlessly releases you, and somehow no one else noticed this exchange.
>As you look behind you, you see the pilot doing a walk around the plane.
>She's wearing clean pressed pants with leather shoes that shine in the sun.
>Slung over her shoulder is the classic navy jacket, her arms exposed in a white short sleeved shirt.
>Four stripes adorn the epaulets of her uniform.
>Her pure white fur sparkles in the light, just barely concealing light but defined muscle.
>Heterochromia, that's the next thing as her eyes wander along the underside of the plane.
>One eye is a pool of deep sky blue, with the other reflecting forest green.
>"Hey human, pick up the pace or I'll drag you up here with me!"
>one of the hyenas shouts at your distracted self.
>You see the cat's ears point in your direction at the mention of a human.
>They betray the disinterest she's projecting as she slowly walks around your operation.
>She suddenly turns toward the group.
>"Hard at work, I see. Good job, ladies. Keep safe out in this heat."
>Her eyes flit to you.
>"I have to wonder why they have a sweet thing like you out here hauling suitcases."
>"You obviously belong up in the cabin with me. You're too cute to be out here straining your poor body."
>You start sweating even harder as her eyes dance over your body.
>"I like the tan though, all natural, unlike those spray-tanned idiots up top."
>You're speechless as you watch her violate you with her sharp eyes.
>And all of the sudden you drop the extra-large anthro-sized luggage you were holding.
>"Woah there, sweetcheeks. Let me show you how to do it."
>She grips your shoulder and hip as you pick up the bag.
>"Don't lift with your back,"
>Your shoulder is pushed down, putting you in a squat as her paw slides around to your rear.
>"Lift with your thighs and rump. Nice and firm."
>She suddenly thrusts her lower hand forward, pushing your hips forward and causing you to straighten out.
>Her hand is cupped around one of your asscheeks.
>Then you suddenly feel sharp pricks.
>She's dug her retractable claws right into your tender flesh.
>"Good boy. I'll be back in town after the flight back tonight."
>She drags her claws up with a flourish as you hear a rip of fabric.
>"Ciao!"
>She throws a mock salute as she slowly walks along the remainder of the plane.
"...woah."
>is the only thing you manage to choke out while still cluching the back.
>"Kid! Kid! You alright!"
>Sabrina shakes you by the shoulders.
>"I can't believe she got her claws into him already!"
>"No class."
>"How disrespectful..."
>Everyone is absoluetly flabbergasted at the scene that just played out.
>You think you can hear the wolf.
>"Now he can never get married... but I'll take him even though he's used goods..."
>you hear her say under her breath.
"Yeah, I'm fine everyone, just a bit suprised."
>"Suprised!? You're really dense, but she just marked you! Well, only a little bit, but still!"
>"Look at your poor shorts! You got some scratches all the way through."
>Sabrina ducks down to directly look at your wound.
>"Not too deep... That's good. You need to make a complaint to HR about Captain Claw over there."
>"Underwear...underwear..."
>the wolf mutters.
"Just drop it, I said I'm fine, really. It doesn't even sting."
>you say, trying to drop the subject.
>Sabrina spins around you to look you in the eye.
>"You're being too stubb-"
>she pauses.
>"Are-are you blushing? Holy shit, you really are a slut!"
>"Just wait until I tell my sisters. My husband's gonna love this too!"
>Meanwhile, the wolf girl looks on in shock.
>"Soiled it...soiled it..."
>The poor hyena at the top of the belt is being pelted with bags thrown at her face, all while the wolf growls.

>Human boys must remain pure and protected
>I will not let these skaven heretics pollute our human gene pool
>They’ll be safe in our bunker where all the humie men cook our food and tender our wounds for the alpha female marines

>A thief made the mistake of underestimating a wolf's sense of smell.
>Now he has to see if he can take on 14 wolves who have an 'interest' in him.

Humie thieves are probably anthros favorite humie boys to find.
>if they get caught they will plead not to turn them in which means it doesn't take much to poke them into doing whatever you say
>less likely to fight back when cornered
>they're usually small and have slim builds to better help squeeze and sneak into places which makes them easy to hold down
>they're more likely to be wearing form fitting outfits that quiet their movements and also show off their bodies at the same time

>anthro hordes raiding human villages
>taking the virginity of humie boys
>leaving them marked and tainted by anthro women
>then waiting for those boys to come crawling to them

>Anthrostate has published a study finding that there's a higher chance of avoiding a rebellion with this one simple trick
>By avoiding the anthro areas in town and staying single, you've been marked as an at-risk person of interest
>A possible domestic terrorist and rebel against the anthrostate
>They will be assigning you a partner and are very nicely asking what your preference would be in terms of what kind of anthro you'd like to get paired with
>No being too specific or they'll drop you off in the middle of the Hyenatown ghetto

>anthro aliens and humans get in contact
>the anthros are more advanced, but have population imbalances with far less males to go around
>Earth starts making deals with them in order to get their tech
>set up an exchange program of sorts that has human go to their planet(s) and/or space stations to live on
>all the humans selected just happen to be single young men with no infertility issues
>set up deals they can't pass up
>essentially selling them off to the anthro aliens
>since if they try to leave or back out those young men will find their paperwork "mysteriously" be lost or misplaced, transports being delayed off planet/station, etc
>the poor boys will be dropped in the middle of populated areas of female anthros seeking mates
>and if the humie boys get a job there or are claimed by any of the females they will soon find their citizenship on those planets quickly filed and transferred to the aliens almost like it was done in advance
>and once all those are claimed Earth will need to send a new shipment of "exchange" citizens

>trash panda wife who scoops your dinner out of the neighbor's bin
>under the assumption that she's only doing this out of habit to her species, you try to play it off in a sympathetic light
>oh god there's maggots in it
>unbeknownst to you, she's well aware of what she's doing and wants to get you sick so that she can play kinky nurse with her patient

>wolves totally greet each other by licking their mouths so let me french you humie
>you have to sleep naked in our big cuddle pile humie it's part of our culture
>reptile culture is big on sharing body heat so you have to let me cuddle you whenever I feel cold
>since you're the new member of our mischif you have to let all us rat girls groom you and get our scents all over you
>you have to let me stuff you in my pouch or it's rude since my roo culture wants to keep you safe also you have to be naked too
>etc

>Bears expect you to hibernate with them in bed all winter
>Claim they get separation anxiety if they're left alone for too long, some kind of instinctual fear that their mates will get lost outside and freeze to death without them
>Your only reprieve are short bathroom breaks, have to eat all your meals in bed
>And yes, she's going to be naked the entire time

>humanity found themselves in a new world interacting with the greater galactic community and all these new aliens
>some aliens being colder in their interactions or just neutrally ignoring humans
>but it's the aliens that acted too friendly that really threw humans off
>mainly human males attracting the attention of towering bestial alien females
>for instance this poor lad made the mistake of traveling the station alone
>now a friendly alien is offering to keep him safe and very close to her to keep others from claiming him
>using her larger frame to block him from view in an attempt to protect him
>and a comforting wrap of her tail to show she's friendly
>now granted the drooling and licking of her lips IS because she wishes to fuck him into a coma

"Which one?"
>"The humie! He's walking around the store putting off huge 'fuck me' vibes!"
"Excuse me?"
>"You know what I mean! Those big expressive eyes, and that stupid smile he gives you when you walk by, and the way he blushes when you brush your tail up against his leg! He doesn't even have another woman's scent on him! It's distracting!"
"Ma'am, he's just working here like everyone else."
>"Nonsense! I come in here every day just to check, and he's always pulling the same routine! I demand to speak with him right away! Or at least his phone number."
"I think you're just stalking one of the workers here..."

>She's leaning against her car, staring intently at you.
>Her ears are perked up, her nostrils flaring.
>You hope her fur is insulating because she's not wearing much.
>You smile and wave as you reach your car.
>She rises to her full height and begins approaching you with purposeful steps.
>You start to feel nervous because WOW, she's big.
-
>I can hardly believe what I'm doing.
>I feel ready to turn and bolt with every step.
>My heart is thundering in my chest, and my fur is all on end.
>I can't stop my tail from wagging.
>He's so fucking cute standing there next to his little toy car.
>I'm nervous, dressed like a skank, and walking up to a humie boy.
>I hope I don't scare him off.
>I'm standing right over him, his scent washing over me.
>Fuck, he's tiny.
>It's setting off a lot of weirdly interconnected instincts.
>I lean over, very intentionally making sure he gets an eyeful of my cleavage.
>I rest a hand on his car, leaning on it and trapping him between me and it.
>The roof creaks as the car dips heavily to one side.
>I wet my lips and say in the softest, gentlest voice I can manage.
>"Hey."
>Hot, steamy breath smelling faintly of kibble wafts over you when she speaks.
>Her voice is husky and deep, vibrating your bones at such close range.
>Heat is pouring off the dog woman's body in the cool afternoon air.
>The deep valley of her cleavage is like a hot, fuzzy cave.
>The arm trapping you is a softly padded pipe of muscle wrapped in fur.
>You can hear the frame of your car groaning under her weight.
>Your mind blanks out and you resort to an automatic response.
>"Hi."
-
>His squeaky reply almost has me taking him then and there.
>I take a deep breath, soaking in his smell and centering myself.
>My plan is simple.
>Approach him, ask him out, wow him with my feminine wiles, and crush his dick.
>Step one is complete.
>Now on to step two.
>"You doing anything tonight?"
>You said you weren't.
>After that, things became somewhat blurry.
>She mentioned a place she loved to eat, asked if you needed a lift, then wilted when you reminded her about your car.
>The drive to the restaurant was memorable as her car was much larger than yours, and she drove close.
>You pulled up to a side-of-the diner that radiated charm, the smell of warm food emanating from within.
>Getting seated was a bit embarrassing as even seated she still towered over you.
>That and you needed a booster seat to reach the top of the anthro-designed table.
>When the waiter arrived - a portly pig anthro - you ordered a plate of spaghetti.
>Your dog date ordered what must have been most of the meat on the menu and a bottle of wine.
>As the waiter left to collect your meals, you were left alone with the grinning canine.
-
>So far, so incredible.
>The restaurant isn't busy, they have enough ham and beef to fill me up, and my date is adorable.
>Just look at him sitting there, totally oblivious.
>He has no idea I'm about to steal his heart, flatten his dick, and leave him addicted to dog pussy for the rest of his life.
>Just the thought of having this delicious little meat snack in my house and stinking of me has me drooling at both ends.
>I'd pull him up on the table and take him right now if I didn't think I'd get banned from eating here.
>I'll be patient, wait until he's crazy for me, then give him the best he's ever had.
>Ooh, what if he's a virgin?
>Unwrapping hot, virgin humie dick, throwing him on my bed, pinning him down, and...
>"Um, ma'am?" He says, and the sweet, seductive squeak of his voice has me hooked instantly. "Are you okay?"
>Better than ever, you silky smooth little--
>"You're, um, drooling a lot."
>Wait shit fuck I'm actually drooling ick ew he saw that napkin where's a napkin
>You watch the large dog woman mop drool from her muzzle bewildered smile.
>Her ears are crimson as she blushes furiously.
>You try not to laugh at how her fur puffs up when she's flustered.
>She sniffs, setting her napkin aside.
>"That is- that's-" She stammers. "That's very normal dog behavior. It just means I'm hungry."
>You wave her off with a reassuring smile and her blush deepens.
>She cannot seem to meet your eyes as her ear twitches.
>"I'm sorry."
>You almost laugh at her tiny, muttered apology.
-
>Gah! I'm totally blowing this!
>Drooling like a stupid animal!
>He probably thinks I'm a freak.
>Cornering him in a parking lot like a stalker.
>Dragging him to some crappy diner.
>Literally drooling over him.
>And he's being so sweet about it.
>Just makes me want him more.
>I wish the food would get here.
>I need to bury my muzzle in some meat.
>Give me something else to look at besides him, and maybe flush his scent out, too.
>Hard to think around him.
>When your food arrives, you're taken aback at the size of your plate.
>It is appropriately sized for an anthro, making it more spaghetti than you can stomach.
>Can't complain about generous portions, you suppose.
>As for your date, she wastes no time tucking into her heaping mounds of meat.
>She's savage, tearing at the rare beef and pork with abandon.
>It's pretty impressive watching her enthusiastically rip into her meal.
>You've always had an appreciation for women with healthy appetites.
-
>God, I'm disgusting.
>I'm ripping my dinner up like it's going to run away if I don't
>I'm too nervous to look at him, afraid of his judgment.
>But I'm also scared to stop eating because I don't know what to say.
>Plus, he makes me too damn horny to think just by being there.
>So, I bury my nose in a plate of rare steak and let my stomach do the thinking for a bit.
>Speaking of which, what's the status report down there, girl?
>'HUMIE CUMMIES!!!'
>Fucking goddammit.

>be anon, scrawny slim guy in last year of highschool
>have a crush on your classmate Sandra
>she's a dino and she's taller than you and like her toothy predatory smile
>ask her on a date
>she rejects you and stops being your friend
>she turns your whole friend group against you
>you're miserable
>Sandra's older sister, Gabriella, finds out what happened
>you've talked to her only a couple of times, but you remember her being nice
>she suddenly enters your life and invites you to all kinds of things with her university friends
>she's motherly and she comforts you whenever you feel down
>its kind of creepy but you don't mind
>she quickly becomes your best friend and you stop putting effort into making friends your own age
>a year passes uneventfully. You never see Sandra anymore, since she moved away for university while you chose to work.
>one day, you accidentally discover Gabriella's porn stash
>oh jesus she is super into femfom and younger boys, and bondage and petplay
>you put everything away and pretend not to have seen anything, but you ask her on a date
>she's ecstatic and becomes your girlfriend
>of course, she still has no idea that you know
[insert some filler here]
>lately, your sex life has really gone downhill. Gabriella is still the perfect girlfriend and she makes you feel so safe and wanted. but she doesn't initiate sex much anymore, and she has trouble finishing.
>you notice that she masturbates a lot in the shower when she thinks you aren't listening
>maybe she can only get off by being a domme
>you decide to tell her that you know about her fantasies
>but how do you approach this delicately

>humans meet an alien species of amazon foxes
>the entire species has built in physic powers that makes them all empaths
>can read each others and human's emotion like an open book
>which causes some issues since the space vixens use those read emotions and act on them
>and humans are getting use to that quirk of their culture not helped by how we're used to inner emotions being more private and change on a dime
>so there end up with many instances of a human guy feeling attraction towards a space fox that passes by/is around only for said fox to decide she likes him too
>and comes grab him to being affection displays which to the guy seem like they come out of nowhere and he's being jumped by a horny alien
>or instances of guy sitting alone feeling sad or down only for one more of the foxes to seemingly come out of nowhere trying to comfort him
>which makes living in close quarters with the space foxes tricky
>single human guy fapping in his apartment at night only for his lust spread and be picked up by the foxes in range getting horny too
>then busting his door down taking that lust as consent/invitation to be fucked by them all

>blind bunny gf who runs facefirst into your nuts, bowling you both over in pain

>blind anthros taking advantage of their blindness to molest humies
>"accidentally" bumping into a guy
>convincing a guy she has to feel and sniff all over him to get an idea what he looks like
>walking in the bathroom when he's showering or changing
also gives me an idea of bat anthros abusing their echolocation to perv on boys through open windows or cracks in doors giving them a sort of 3d "view" of them through the sound reverbing back

>anon is being chased down the street by a medley of wolves, hyenas, and other miscellaneous predator species
>he starts screaming, but is cut off by the video stopping
>*record scratch*
>"Yep, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up with a bunch of horny anthros wanting to fuck my brains out."
>The Who - Baba O'Riley starts playing
>"Well, let me tell you..."
>smash cut to a totally different place
>"One week ago..." fades in as a subtitle

>Have forbidden carnal relations with a nun anthro
>Only form of intercourse she approves of is benis in vagoo with absolutely no condom, something about not wasting god given seed and wanting to keep things 'natural'
>After all, she says there's no place more natural for a penis to go than between the legs of a fertile furry woman
>No worries about pregnancy though, she sneaks birth control into the convent to ensure your late night sinning doesn't result in a swollen belly she couldn't possibly hide under her nun uniform
>Things go well for several months with a steady schedule of nightly rutting
>That is until she starts having morning sickness and other worrying signs of pregnancy
>Scared shitless, you sneak in a pregnancy test for her to take and await the results
>Positive
>At first you're angry
>Why the hell wasn't she taking her birth control like she said?!
>Then she shows you the half empty pill container and the consistent schedule she kept on her calendar to ensure she was always keeping up with her pills
>Eventually she decides to make a confession to the head mother of the convent and beg for forgiveness
>You go along with her as she cries her eyes out in front of the stern looking matron
>Your waifur recounts the many sins she committed with you, the failed steps taken to ensure it would remain hidden, and the forbidden life now growing in her womb
>The head mother takes all of it in with a cold expressionless face
>Geez, your waifur is going to get kicked out for this, maybe even worse
>Finally she finishes her tear laden confession and looks down, ashamed
>The head mother leans forward
>"Based on what you've told me it seems clear that the omnifur wanted this pregnancy to happen, after all, how else could seed and egg overcome the artificial barrenness you tried to impose on yourself if not through a divine miracle? This baby of yours is a sign from the heavens that your union is blessed!"
>Your waifur shoots up and hugs you, relieved

>dating a big red kangaroo girl
>she's like 7 ft tall
>always weird when you go out since you're on the small side for a human guy
>pretty sure you weigh less than one of her thighs
>doesn't help she has you exercise with her and that keeps you slim and her huge
>then start getting worried when she does some odd stretching exercises
>mainly dealing with her pouch
>stretching how far it opens, rubbing lotion or something similar on her pouch rim after stretching, been carrying a weight ball in her pouch close to your weight, etc
>gets these creepy looks on her face while looking at you and while she has the weights in her pouch, even drools some too with lots of panting
>been holding you closer and tighter when cuddling and mumbling about "soon" and "almost able to"
>getting real worried she has a pouch fetish
>and she's big enough and you're small enough

>get sent to abstinence camp because your parents caught you looking at yugioh cards
>get approached by a wolf who wants to be friends with you
>follow him into the showers
>it was a camp counseler crossdressing to rape young boys when they're alone

>you kneel beneath the computer desk in total darkness
>the only light in Minn's--now yours too--bedroom coming from her computer screen
>and the RGB lighting of her setup
>waiting in your place with a plaintive hand resting on her knee as she kicks and squeals at whatever game she's playing
>after that first time, she was insatiable
>what's worse is she quickly turned the tables on you
>what started out as a reward for her cleaning her room, or remembering to shower, or doing the dishes
>soon became the reverse when she realized just how much you were into her
>she broke you down, using the threat of withholding sex to get you to cut her slack
>then ordering your around with the promise of footjobs
>until it turned into you doing whatever she said, just for a taste of sweet bunny-pussy
>she even got you to quit your job so she can stream full-time
>which brings you to now, as Minn uncrosses her legs and hooks one around your shoulder in a practiced motion
>drawing you into her impossibly thick bunny thighs
>slick with a whole night's worth of sweat and grool
>and your saliva
>the chair scoots back enough to let in a sliver of screen light, and Minn's voice beckons you
>"Time to get to work, bun-slut~"
>she giggles
>"He loves when I call him that. He's my little humie bun-slut!"
>your cock twitches
>she's been teasing it with her footpaw all night, having some sixth sense whenever you get tired or antsy
>just to put you in place with a stroke or two
>you plant your face against her slit and start lapping at it
>Minn's breath hitches
>"He's pu-UUH-shing mid. F-fucking kill him already."
>you run your tongue over Minn's pussy over and over again in a drawn out service
>one leg locked around your head
>the other swung low to tease the head of your cock with her toes
>suddenly your eyes are stung by a bright light illuminating your face
>you must look awful, covered in her fluids, unkempt and unshowered
>"Tell them you're a bun-slut babe!"
>your only response is to grunt
>too busy eating her out to really formulate words
>plus some deep down part of you, the last kernel of self-respect, urges you not to acknowledge the camera pointed at your face
>not to accept that your new place in the world is on a pet bed, eating out your roommate for the world to see
>Minn rests her hand on your head, then slowly pushes your head back enough to free your mouth
>"You love my pussy, don't you? But I need you to tell chat what kind of boyfriend you are! Be a good boy, Anon."
>her paw rubs the tip of your cock, smearing pre-cum over her toes
>you groan
"I'm a bun--"
>the bright light is pushed closer
>her toes press down harder
>"Look at the camera, babe!"
>you groan and turn your face up, looking the camera in the lens as best you can
"I'm a bun-slut."
>you say with trembling lip
>Minn titters and squeals
>and squeezes her thigh to force your face against her musky muff again
>"Eeee! It's so great! He's such a good boy, isn't he?"
>Minn goes on gaming, keeping you docile with a teasing touch, and a leglock that has you licking her to climax after climax
>you zone out, focused on pleasuring her
>sometimes she has you lavish her thighs for attention
>other times taking pictures of your face covered in squirt
>but never, ever letting you climax against her paw
>at some point you started whimpering
>"Aww, babe, what's wrong?"
>Minn starts petting your head
>"You're doing such a good job! We've almost reached our donation goal for the night!"
>you try to contain yourself, but it's hard
>in more ways than one
>she dominates your mind
>inebriates your senses
>Minn has broken you down lower than she ever was, all for her own pleasure
>so she could have her perfect, docile, servile humie boyfriend
>she's gone back to talking to her stream
>"...totally easy! All you have to do is find what makes your humie tick. Anon here is a total whore for rabbit's feet, so whenever I needed to remind him who's boss..."
>soft rabbit toes half-wrap around your shaft and give you a hard stroke
>forcing you to moan into her thighs
>"...I just gave him a little toe-touch and he was putty! Listen to him moan for me!"
>Minn works your shaft for a little longer, earning a series of muffled groans
>"Such a slut, I know! Oh! humiehumper68, thanks for the donation. 'Do you have to punish your boyfriend?'"
>Minn makes a forced laugh
>and squeezes your head to ensure you're not slacking at eating her out
>"Of course, I may need to give him a little encouragement to be a good boyfriend, but I'd never hurt my humie! I'm not some ugly, violent yeen. Isn't that right, babe?"
>you don't have to answer
>she just makes you moan with a few more expert strokes that leave you on the edge of climax
>then halts once she's gotten enough of a reaction from chat
>"Oh! Another donation! We're almost to our goal for the night. Let's see, heartmofah9 says 'show dick'. Oh now, you know the rules chat. Anon's dick is for me and me alone, but I will say, he's leaking extra hard on my toes right now!"
>she smears her toes against the tip again
>and shudders
>god please, Minn
>you just need a little more for that sweet release
>but she stops
>Minn controls you like this
>she may as well own you
>"But I do have a special surprise! Here, I'll show you guys."
>whatever it is, it must have gotten a big reaction
>the computer pings again and again
>until Minn gasps and pushes back
>releasing your head, but keeping that thigh draped over your shoulder to drag you back in
>"Oh my gosh! Thank you so much skinlicker443! We've reached our donation goal in record time!"
>the light is in your face again
>"Great news! I bought you a very special gift for our one-year anniversary!"
>something is thrust in your face
>a collar
>black leather, with a round nametag attached to the front
>"From Minn to my perfect human husband!"
>she reads the tag out loud
>"Will you marry me, Anon?"
>you stare, uncomprehending at first
>then reach up with a trembling hand to take the collar
>this isn't happening
>this can't be happening
>you're kneeling under your sweaty, stinky, perverted bunny roommate's desk
>being proposed to with a collar that marks you as hers
>in front of god knows how many internet strangers
>"Go on! Put it on baby!"
>you're so conditioned to the touch of her footpaw
>that's still gently molesting you
>that you move to obey without thinking
>the leather loops around your neck, fitting your perfectly
>all you have to do is cinch it closed
>Minn watches with ears twitching
>eyes wide
>she trembles slightly
>if you do this now, you know you'll never get away
>the rest of your life
>little better than a fuck-toy for this nerdy, obsessive, neurotic bunny
>it barely feels like your own hand cinching the clasp shut
>"Oh!"
>the lights drop
>Minn's dropped the camera
>"Holy shit he did it! Oh my god Anon!"
>she's on you in an instant
>covering your face in kisses
>leg wrapped around your hip to hump your torso like her life depends on it
>"Yes! Yesyesyesyesyes! My perfect humie husband! I'll take care of you, and we can stream every day, and you'll eat my pussy, and you can cum on my feet all you want!"
>it's a relief
>to give up
>accept that all you'll be useful for now is taking care of Minn's most basic and carnal needs
>"Stay there!"
>she stands fully, then belatedly start clicking on her computer again
>"Sorry! Stream's over!"
>the sounds from the computer go quiet
>and then Minn's on top of you again
>dragging you by your collar out from under her desk
>and onto a pile of clothes on the floor
>where she lays you back and flops on top of you with a grunt
>no words from her
>just needy, desperate moans as she hastily lines herself up and drops herself down on your cock in one thrust
>she quivers
>and you gasp
>she's been teasing you so long, it's a miracle you last for the first thirty seconds of frantic humping
>your fingers cling to sweat-slick fur
>her legs jackhammer her weight up and down
>and your cock pumps an entire day's worth of built-up orgasm deep inside her bunny cunny
>Minn moans her triumph
>she's got you
>now and forever
>which is how long it seems like she's going to fuck you, as she rights your cock through your first orgasm, and her tenth of the night, on and on
>never letting up
>never stopping
>until she's sure she's wrung you dry
>finally, once neither of you can stand any more
>she flops over you again
>mixed bodily fluids between your bodies
>and kisses you
>"I love you, Anon."
>"Babe! Stream's starting!"
>Minn's voice calls from the other room
>you hurry up, folding the last of her laundry and throwing it all in a hamper
>you've long stopped wearing clothes around the apartment
>Minn likes it when you just wear your collar
>you bring it into your shared bedroom
>it's hard work keeping things in line around here
>but with Minn in charge, she makes sure you take care of all the chores
>and you're happy just to make sure she's happy
>she's waiting for you on her chair
>Minn has been streaming less and less lately
>too much work, especially with the first kit on the way
>but you still remember your place whenever she calls
>beneath her
>servicing her
>her perfect humie husband
>and there's nowhere else you'd rather be

>Kissing my waifur all over her body
>Telling her she's a goddess
>Worshipping her clit
>Savoring every tiny shudder or moan of pleasure I can elicit from her
>Being pulled up face to face by the collar
>She giggles, kisses me and cleans all the girlcum off my face with her tongue.
I cannot think of anything better.

>A wild dog anthro approaches you coyly yet politely
>In the same coy yet polite tone she neatly excuses herself before asking you a question
>All her words come out that way until the last one "SINGLE?!" loudly rings out through the air as her apparent excitement makes itself known
>She shuffled closer to you with her tail swishing wildly behind her and her nose close to your own as she stares into your very soul
>Clearly her joy at finding a single humie to take back home has overcome her and any of her mannerisms
>Yes you are indeed single and she is probably going to destroy your pelvis if you ever end up alone with her
>Maybe she likes cuddling alot and spares your poor pelvis
>But who are you as a lonely anon to deny the love of a big fluffy ball of joy like her
>Besides
>She seems nice

>alone on the battlefield. you encounter a massive anthro warrior
>you know that in a 1v1 you would have no chance, but are determined to make a last stand anyway
>after a brief skirmish she gets the upper hand. knocking you over and sending your weapon flying
>she puts her hands beneath your arms and lifts you up. you're too paralyzed with fear to do anything about it.
>your entire life flashes before you. you close your eyes as she pulls you closer and... hugs you?
>what?
>you open your eyes to see your head shoved between her breasts
>she's just standing there. holding you in a tight hug
>she brings her muzzle close to your ear
>"no one will ever believe you"

>Be a human football player.
>Through some "genius" by management, your team is doing a cross-league game.
>Human league against anthro league.
>No one has high hopes.
>Anthros are bigger, stronger, and usually faster.
>Hear the other team is a bunch of rodents.
>You hope it's mice.
>Mice are some of the only anthros close to human size.
>Get on the field, and it's rats.
>Big, smelly, dark-furred, red-eyed rat men.
>Their smallest player is twice as large as your biggest player.
>The ball drops, and it's a slaughter.
>They're all over the ball, you can't tackle them, and they run through you like you aren't there.
>You at least have to try, so you run for a flying ball, hoping to intercept.
>A rat player shoulder-checks you, and you go flying.
>Well, you lived a full life.
>Pass out just as something big, soft, and fluffy catches your fall.
>Wake up minutes later in the arms of a large, lovely rat lady.
>The player who hit you is standing at the edge of the field, looking ashamed.
>A team of rat girl cheerleaders in their skimpy outfits and pom-poms surrounds him.
>They are almost literally chewing him out, all wagging fingers and chattering teeth.
>You're out of the game due to an injury the rat cheerleaders insist you have.
>Spend the rest of the game being cooed over and groomed by sexy rat girls.
>Your team lost, but you don't feel like a loser.

>car breaks down out in the countryside
>mechanic shows up
>big ass bear women in overalls
>and just overalls
>doesn't even need a jack to lift your car to check under it
>manage to sneak a peek down her cleavage
>feel the urge to dive down with how deep and comfortable it looks in there
>you don't know she's been doing it on purpose to tease you
>just have a flat, but you don't know that and she's making up stuff like needing breaker light fluid to keep you around town longer
>has you help guide the car onto ramp to tow it back to her shop
>since she's too big for car and a custom one made for her size costs a lot she pulls it herself
>and has you sit on the cart too right behind her
>which gives you a full view of her massive ass the whole trip
>you don't know it yet, but the end of the night you're gonna be under that ass

> be a human in a fantasy adhg world
> Theoretically humans are just yet another intelligent race
> Problem is, intelligence is only slightly above average
> Physical capabilities way below the average anthro
> Much less capacity for magic as well
> General consensus is that humans can build things or come up with ideas, but if those concepts are ever put in anything but the hands of an anthro, it's just a waste of potential
> Humans are respected in a way, but only as useful partners for anthros, never on their own merits
> Make your living as a loner on the edge of a monster-infested forest
> Learn the patterns and habits of the worst of them enough to easily avoid most
> Can identify and harvest rare medicinal herbs back in town
> On rare occasions even offer services as a local guide
> It isn't much, but it lets you get by, with your dignity
> Stumble across a heavily wounded, passed out anthro knight one day
> Looks like the dumbass got herself mauled by a dire boar
> You're an asshole with no love for anthros, but not a big enough asshole to abandon her
> Haul her back to your cabin, nurse her back to some bare minimum of health, then rent a wagon to carry her back to town
> Make damn sure to collect your reward before you leave
> Two months later
> You're starting to get more than a little sick of your constant 'guest'
> Turns out the knight you rescued is very much the old-fashioned romantic type
> Being nursed back to health by a mysterious human male living alone in a dangerous forest is evidently the ideal cue for the little wannabe to 'take responsibility' for you
> Doesn't do anything aggressive
> Just constant clumsy attempts at 'wooing' you and the occasional lecture about how it isn't safe or healthy for a human to be out in a place like this alone
> She's a dumbass
> Thing is...
> You're still pretty sure she could take you down if it came to that
> God fucking damn it
> Teach you to rescue someone
> "Hark, fair human!"
> Oh good. This again.
> Turn around from tending your planter to see your stalker-in-shining-armor striding down the path yet again
> She's often cheerful, but even more bouncy than usual this time
> Notice some scuffs on her usually immaculate armor
> Seeing you raise an eyebrow, she smiles wider
> "Oh, this? Nothing to worry you, dear. I was simply involved in the defeat of a dastardly villain today, and the knave did not wish to go quietly. In fact, I must thank you once again for your latest batch of healing potions. 'Twas as though you fought right by my side!"
> She probably wouldn't need your potions so often if she didn't keep trying to block attacks with her face
> Still, you suppose you can't complain
> She's rapidly become your best customer by far
> In fact the potions were her idea to begin with
> You used to just harvest the materials and sell them in town, but your stalker had pressured you to cut out the middle man and learn how to just make the finished goods yourself
> Turned out it actually wasn't that hard, and had paid off pretty quickly
> Thanks to the forest you've got higher-quality ingredients than anyone else can compete with, so your potions really did tend to be better than the norm
> Of course the knight had spouted some bullshit line about the love and care you put into each bottle and how with such support she could never lose
> You're pretty sure that was just the dash of cinnamon you added, for taste
> Bitches love cinnamon
> Anyway, pays to keep the customers happy, even the weird clingy ones, so you ask her how it went down
> "Alas, our town was the target of a most vile necromancer! The fiend was not satisfied with the teachings of her betters at the tower of magic, so her lust for power led to her embrace of a darker path. It is fortunate that I noticed the broken chains upon the cemetery gates and chanced upon her before she'd the chance to raise more than a single of her foul minions, or the town have faced a fate far more dire."
> So, if you're translating right from bullshit-ese, the hapless idiot stumbled upon another hapless idiot, who dropped out of school and only managed to raise a single skeleton before being sent packing
>Sounds about right
> Still... damn if she doesn't look thrilled
> Your 'knight' may hold the title, but if there's two things you've picked up on during her almost-daily visits, it's that she's brand new to the title and desperate to prove herself
> Obnoxious though the constant clumsy flirting may be, you've gotten... used to her, at least

>Be new guard accidentally transferred to a female anthro penitentiary head of security says it'll take a couple of months for the error to be corrected been working there for a few weeks everything seems to be going smoothly a huge riot breaks out across the penitentiary because of your sexy humie ass strutting around them get separated from other guards and stuck in a heavily dominant yeen section of the prison chaos escalates as inmates take over the prison some of the girls are discussing who gets first dibs on you they come to an agreement that they'll be gentle with you if you dance for them dancing ensue some months later recovering in the hospital after having your pelvis smashed into oblivion you're told you're going to be a father of many children.

When it comes to dommy situations and characters how hard of a dom do you want your anthro females?
Are you guys into the hard, forceful pin you down and FUCKS you (or even hurts you) kind of dom or do you want a gentler dommy chick who isn't cruel or crass but still is in charge, calls the shots and makes sure you know it.
Or both. Or neither. Tell me about it. Post examples of what you like.

The best of both for sure
>rough, forceful waifur who often just takes you whenever she feels like it
>isn't cruel and does her best not to hurt you, she appreciates your willingness and trust
>will make you fear for your pelvis but not your safety

>escape rooms/entire building desinged like escape rooms with puzzles and such throughout it
>except the traps and "threats" chasing after the human guy are horny anthro women
>the anthros get to pursue the guys through the rooms/complex with the threat of them fucking the guys if caught
>or like if you don't solve the puzzles/room to get out a horny anthro gets released into the room you're trapped in
>traps could be if you solve a certain puzzle wrong you get dropped/trapped into an area with anthro waiting for a victim
>different escape rooms/buildings could have themes
>pyramid/Egyptian themed one with jackals. lionesses, crocs, hippos, snakes, etc anthros

>I'm stunned
>My ability to go unnoticed... It's gone
>Other anthros are now noticing me

>Slowly a toothy smile spreads across her face
>I can't help but feel like a little lamb that's been separated from the herd and is now about to be eaten.
>She snakes an arm around my waist and pulls me even closer
>I gasp and and she chuckles
>I feel her caressing my thigh
>I'm completely blown away
>So this is what it's like to be desired
>To be hunted
>It feels good
>Really good
>I lean into her
>My head against her shoulder
>Her soft fur all around me
>"Mmmm" she growls
>"That's what momma likes"
>Her other arm wraps around the back of my head and pushes my face against her breasts
>She buries her nose into the top of my head and takes a big whiff of my hair
>She lets out another growl in delight
>I sink more into her and wrap my arms around her waist
>Well as much as I can
>She's now caressing my inner thigh
>Each time she moving her hand closer to my crotch
>Until suddenly she just grabs it
>A moan escapes from my throat but is muffled by her breasts
>"I'm gonna have so much fun with you"
>Stroking my length with her thumb succeeding in getting me harder and harder
>Normally I might be ashamed of how easy I am
>But this feels so good
>I nuzzle into her
>"When I'm done with you, you'll never be able to go back."
>I whimper as she gives me a little squeeze
>"You'll crave me. You'll want it everyday. You'll want it so bad you'll beg me for it.
>She pulls my head back by my hair so that I'm forced to look at her
>"And you know what...?"
>She leans in closer
>Her lips nearly touching my earlobe as she whispers
>"I'm gonna give it to you!"
>she shoves her tongue down my throat
>My resistance nonexistent
>I just cling to her the best I can
>She drags me into her lap and when she breaks the kiss she runs her tongue up my neck
>"You're mine. Got it?"
>I look up at her weakly
>"Take me."

>Cori puts a paw on the bathroom door, pulling it shut before you can make it inside
>"Anon."
>you stare forward, hand reaching for the doorknob
"Cori."
>you hear the tittering voices of the rest of the pack at the end of the hall, watching the confrontation
>"We need to have a talk. You keep washing off the pack's scent."
>you nod slowly
"Yes. I'm taking a shower. I need to get clean."
>Cori harrumphs and hooks an arm around you
>dragging your head back to rest one of her breasts
>you've gotten used to a LOT of physical contact with Cori and the rest of the pack
>sleeping together in the big bed
>being cuddled at random times during the day
>getting dogpiled when you get home from work
>and general petting, patting, scritches, and stroking, given and received at any time
>being used to it doesn't stop you from getting a boner sometimes when one of the girls is extra lovey
>but right now Cori is laying down the law as alpha
>"You humans with your washing. The rest of us only bath a couple times a month."
>and every time they do, they leave the drains clogged to the point of uselessness
>you sigh
"It's different for humans Cori. No fur to trap our eh, smell. Plus we sweat a lot. I know you can smell that."
>one of the other pack members pipes up from down the hall
>"It smells nice!"
>that was Claire
>the rest all voice their agreement
>Cori rests her head atop yours
>"See? The girls don't mind. Really Anon, are we going to have to go through this for every little thing? Would you rather go back to being on your own?"
>you know it's a rhetorical question
>but you still cling to Cori's arm and shake your head as fervently as you can
>you don't want to go it alone
>still, you want to be able to take a shower more than once a month
"I'm sorry about the scent Cori, but it's a comfort thing for me. If I don't shower often I'll feel uncomfortable. Plus showers are nice."
>Cori hums
>making your head vibrate
>"Fine. You can wash."
"Thanks Cor--"
>"With the pack."
>the entire pack?
>you're not sure of the logistics of that
>but they're already stalking down the hall
>all ears perked and eyes sparkling
>Cori's free paw opens the bathroom door, and you're bundled inside
>Cori turns you about and hollars out the door
>"Come on girls!"
>Cici
>Carly
>Cait
>and Cleo
>all bustle and fight their way into the bathroom
>they're all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
>those bushy tails wagging as they jostle to get closest to their favorite new pack mate
>but Cori maintains order with a sharp bark
>she's the boss for a reason
>"Alright. Strip him, scrub him, dry him."
>you're thrown to the wolves
>literally
>because Cori just shoved you into the waiting paws of the pack
>that get you work pulling your shirt up over your head
>and another pair unbuttoning your pants
>Cait went right for your socks
>typical
"Easy! H-Hey!"
>the boxers go along with the pants, and a chorus of giggles surrounds you
>"In the shower!"
>while you were being stripped, Cori got the water going, and your practically hauled off your feet by the mob
>and pushed under the spray
>if it weren't for the four sets of paws holding onto you, you'd have toppled and fallen unbalanced
>you look to Cori, who watches with a look of amusement on her face
>"Enjoy your shower, Anon."
>the paws start to wander
>Cici's rubbing soap over your chest
>Carly and Cait scrubbing your arms
>Cleo's working over your legs to go for your toes yet again
>she's insatiable that one
>then you feel a pair of claws pinch your ass, making you yelp
>and the girls all laugh and coo
>Cori can't help but giggle too, giving you a wink
>"Alpha's privilege."
>you give her a scowl, but you can't put any actual malice behind it
>you're used to the teasing too
>"Looks clean enough to me. Get him dry!"
>the water shuts off, and the pack moves in sync to follow orders
>a big fluffy towel is wrapped around you and rubs you down from head to toe
>in the end, you're jostled but squeaky clean
>that wasn't bad
>"There, you've had your human shower. Time for your wolf shower."
>you should have known it wouldn't have been easy
>Cori steps forward and takes your head in one big paw
>then leans down to force her tongue in your mouth
>another pack thing you had to get used to
>the slippery organ laps the inside of your mouth, coating it with her taste
>then she withdraws to lick your face
>a long drag of her flat tongue over your cheek, up into your hair
>she finishes with a satisfied lick of her chops
>"Bedroom, girls."
>this time they do lift you up off your feet
>held aloft by arms and legs like a sacrifice to the altar of wolf-sex
>if that altar were a soft room-spanning bed that you're tossed into the middle of
>the pack wastes no time pinning you
>and bathing you
>you're assaulted from all sides by the hot, wet tongues of a pack of giggly, playful canines
>they relish in your squirms when they suck on your fingers and lap at your hands
>you join in the giggling as one of them decides to lick your stomach and catch every ticklish spot you have
>and Cori scoffs when a pair of dog kisses on your nipples force you to shut your mouth lest you let out a moan
>Cleo is all over your feet like a woman obsessed, slobbering like a dog
>Cori takes a spot at your head, lifting it to rest on her thighs while she continues washing your face in the wolf fashion
>you're sure you've been licked from head to toe, leaving you coated in a sheen of slobber
>all except one spot
>your crotch is left totally dry
>even though your cock is hard as stone, it goes ignored while the wolves search out the last nooks and crannies to lick clean
>Cleo even hikes up your legs over her shoulders to go for somewhere more intimate
"Whoa! H-Hey easy--"
>Cleo keeps going, licking up the inside of your thighs higher and higher until a paw grips one of your ass cheeks
>"Hey!"
>Cleo halts when Cori barks at her
>"Behave."
>chastised, Cleo drops your legs and slinks back down to your feet
>you certainly feel slimy
>and not quite as clean as you like
>but you definitely feel more intimate with the pack right now
>it's only well after the pack has finished their search and settled into licking their prefered part of you that they like best that Cori calls attention to your needs
>"One last spot girls."
>there's a shuffling
>Cori replacing her lap with a normal pillow to rest your head on
>and they all crowd around your lower have
>"Alpha's privilege. I get first taste."
>Cori doesn't start with a taste, but with a sniff
>that starts at your balls, and goes all the way to the tip
>huffing hot air over your sensitive member while she takes her sweet time
>your cock twitches
>Cori huffs, satisfied
>then slips her tongue out of her mouth to taste your head
>that's the signal
>all the others press their faces close and attack
>licking your shaft
>your balls
>your thighs
>anything the voracious she-wolves can reach, they assault with aggressive tongues
>Cleo's still nuzzling under your balls to try and and lick your frenulum
>she does not let up
>Cori has her muzzle around your tip, swirling her tongue over it again and again to eat up the constant stream of pre-cum you're producing
>you can't last much longer under a five-pronged assault
>you make little thrusts up into Cori's mouth
>the most you can do with five sets of paws holding you in place
>and while Cori is a master of control, and could keep you on edge for long minutes at her leisure
>the rest of the pack is not nearly so self-restraining
>so they lick and lick and lick until you burst
>Cori seals her lips around your tip to catch the first spurt as your cock throbs in her muzzle
>she swallows it down
>then she opens her mouth to free your cock so you can should the rest out
>the next few ropes landing in waiting maws, or your own belly, or dribbling down your shaft
>but the pack wastes no time lapping you clean once again
>sensitive member overwhelmed after an intense orgasm
>you pant
>the girls pant
>Cori pants
>all of you recovering from a pretty intense shower
>Cori is the first to move, standing up and stepping over the others so she can leer down at you
>standing over your chest with arms crossed and a smug grin
>"You think this will work out for you, Anon?"
>you nod your head slowly
>man that was intense
>"Good. You'll be getting wolf-baths at least once a week. And you come to one of us to reapply pack scent after every shower. Got it?"
>once again you nod
>Cori's alpha, after all
>a good pack mate listens to the alpha
>"Now it's your turn."
>your turn?
>but you've already had your shower
>what she means becomes clear as she pulls down her panties
>that you now see are soaked
>to present her sopping pussy to you
>"Alpha's privilege."
>she smugly remarks as she plops down on top of you
>hard enough to force an 'oof' from your lungs
>but soft enough not to actually hurt
>"Get to work."

>cold
>so very cold
>the metal bars of the dog cage you're trapped in are so very cold against your skin
>but you have to keep trying
>you pry at the padlocked latch with straining, aching fingers, trying desperately to bend it just far enough to unhook from its seating
>you push and pull and pry from any angle you can
>until the freezing cold of the bedroom forces you to crawl away to the other side of the cage
>where a space heater is angled to heat the back half of the cage on the lowest setting
>just enough to keep you from shivering if you sit still
>you cross your arms over your bare chest
>your clothes were gone when you woke up in this cage three weeks ago
>or was it four?
>your teeth chatter as you try to work out the passing of time since you blacked out at the bar
>after only one drink
>you settle on three weeks
>hands extended toward the heater, you wait as feeling slowly returns to your numbed fingers
>they ache in protest to your constant labor
>but you have to get out of here
>you're not a pet
>not a thing to be caged up and toyed with by that bitch
>the anger is enough to get you moving again
>over to the door on cramped, aching legs and sore, goose-bumped arms
>to try your luck once more
>this next attempt is halted in mere minutes by the sound of the front door being flung open
>"Oh sweetie! I'm home!"
>oh god
>you almost had it!
>too late
>you scramble to the back of the cage just in time for the arctic fox to burst into the bedroom and greet you with a bright smile
>she's short, and plump, and exceedingly fluffy
>you're sure you could take her if you could just catch her
>"There's my schnookums!"
>she giggles innocently as she trots over to the cage
>"Oh it's simply lovely outside. Fifteen degrees and snowing up a storm! I could hardly stand to be cooped up working in a hot stuffy office all day."
>the fox strips out of her office attire
>her fur puffing up as it's no longer constrained by blouse or skirt
>"So, have you been a good boy today?"
>you just stare in sullen silence
>a couple weeks ago, you might have berated her, or demanded to be released
>but that only made things worse as she found ways to punish you
>the fox sighs
>"Oh I know crate training is hard, but that's just the way it has to be until you're my good pet. Now, show me your hands."
>instead, you curl them into fists and hold them to your chest
>whatever she wants, it won't be good
>the fox purses her lips
>"Really? I thought we were past tantrums. Show me, or you won't get dinner tonight."
>you groan and hold your hands out to the fox
>who leans in to expect them
>she lashes her fluffy tail and scoffs
>"Thought so. You're marking up your pretty skin trying to open the cage. I left the heater pointed away from the door for a reason."
>you pull your hands back and hang your head
>now comes the punishment
>the fox sighs
>"Aww, don't pout sweetie. Since you were honest with me, you can have dinner tonight."
>you keep your head lowered
> you know she's not done
>the whirring of the space heater dies with a soft beep
>"But trying to get out of your cage was very naughty. I think you need a little time in the cold to think about whether you want to be a good pet or not."
>you huff
>it's only gotten colder and colder lately
>who knows how long she'll leave you without heat
>you try and fail to suppress a whine
"Please..."
>the fox mewls
>and though her muzzle is turned into a sympathetic frown, her eyes are lit with sadistic enjoyment
>"Ooh honey-bunches. I know it's no fun, but what kind of owner would I be if I didn't punish bad behavior? Now you stay and think about what you've done."
>she trots off, tail swishing lazily as she departs the room
>and flicks off the lights
>you sit in darkness, the cold creeping over you
>air getting chillier
>heat sapping from your limbs which you drew up into fetal position in an attempt to shield your core from the worst
>you shiver in the cold
>time passes
>you can't tell how much
>only the beat of your heart, and the chattering of your teeth to gauge how long it's been since that frigid fox left you
>occasionally you hear her moving about the house
>even singing to herself, like she doesn't have a living human being locked in a cage like an animal
>you hate her
>you hate this
>you want to go home
>you want to be warm again
>those thoughts repeat over and over
>until finally she returns
>the lights turn on, and she greets you, but you don't move
>you just sit there curled up and whimpering
>until you hear the padlock on the cage door click open
>now's your chance!
>you will your numb limbs to move
>all you manage to do is keel over on your side
>there's a soft clatter of plastic on plastic as something is dropped on the bottom of the cage near your head
>"Din din sweetie! Eat up, it's nice and hot!"
>you pick your head up to see your dinner
>a bright red dog bowl filled with oatmeal that steams gently in the cold air
>you should run
>a part of your mind screams at you to pull yourself out of the cage
>get away from the bitch
>and escape
>but instinct rules you, and you drag the bowl close to slurp from it messily
>like an animal
>it's plain, but piping hot to your dulled senses, and restores a little bit of life to your core
>the fox laughs while she watches you scrape the bottom of the bowl with your fingers to get the last of your dinner
>you won't get any more until the morning
>"There! Isn't that better?"
>she reaches in and snatches the bowl from you
>then like usual, she slams the cage shut and lock it again
>"Have you thought about what you've done?"
>she taps a paw on the floor
>but you refuse to answer
>with a hot meal in you, you're feeling a little more lively
>a little less desperate
>"Because if you're not going to be a good pet, you're going to sleep in the cold."
>that drains your spirits
>dashes your will to fight
"N-no. I'll be good."
>the vixen hums in thought
>"You'll be a good..."
>she leads you on
>and you grit your teeth
>if you answer, it will be a shameful admission of defeat
>if you don't, you'll freeze to death in a pet cage
>just for tonight, just to avoid freezing
>that's how you justify looking her in the eye and saying
"I'll be a good pet."
>the vixen squeals in delight, and jumps in place
>"Eee! Yes! So cute! That's a good boy! I knew you could learn your lesson. Just for that, you can sleep in the big bed with your owner tonight."
>in the bed?
>with her?
>just like that?
>she can't be serious
>you suppress a smile as she steps out from in front of the crate to let you out
>you'll just wait
>until she's gone to sleep
>and then you'll make a break for it
>call the cops
>and you'll be free!
>you nod your head as vigorously as you can
"Yes! Please, I--It's cold in here, even with the heater on. I'll be a good pet!"
>the fox titters and taps her feet in excitement
>"Goodness! Where was all this enthusiasm before? If you were a good boy from the start, you could have slept in the bed a long time ago."
>she unlocks the cage again, and swings the door wide
>stepping aside to let you out
>"Go on, pet. Get under the covers. I'll join you in a moment."
>you do as she says, standing on legs that have been cramped for far too long
>but the moment you step past the vixen, you feel something jab into your neck
>then a rush of cold again
>you turn, movements sluggish, to see the vixen capping a syringe she had somehow managed to hide despite being as naked as you are
>"Easy boy, on the bed."
>your arms and legs are going numb again
>the fox steps beside you and wraps an arm around you to keep you upright
"Wha d-did you do to me?"
>your words are slurred as she guides you over to the king-sized bed
>"Just a little something to make sure you're on your best behavior! Don't worry, it's only about half the dosage I gave you at the bar."
>you're lowered onto the sheets, completely immobile
>despite being nearly a foot shorter than you, she manhandles you into bed
>you can barely move now, and your thoughts are foggy
>the vixen joins you in bed, wrapping herself around you tightly
>her fur is warm and luxuriously soft
>softer than the heavy blanket she draws over the both of you
>the vixen starts murmuring in your ear
>"You're a good pet. Good behavior will be rewarded. Bad behavior will be punished."
>she drapes her tail around you so its brushing against your chest
>"I am your owner. Now, and forever."

on a similar, but lighter note I do like the idea of anthros helping/taking advantage of humans not doing well in the cold
>move into apartment
>missed some fine print and it turns out most of the tenets are cold region species
>polar bears, arctic foxes, snow hares, reindeer, snowy owls, etc
>so the entire complex is kept cold in summer/spring and heating/AC left off during winter/fall
>which means the anthros abuse how willing you are to cuddle up to one to keep warm
>also they get to gift you various warm clothes all the time
>and gush how cute you are all bundled up in sweaters, socks, hoodies, fuzzy bathrobes, etc
>while not mentioning how they wore the clothes or rubbed themselves against it to put their scent on the clothes which then gets on you

>water species constantly asking if you're ok in the water or if you can swim
>even when you're standing in knee deep water or activity swimming
>every anthro lifeguard nervously watching you for any sign of struggle in the water

>And ‘most’ of them learned to keep their pants on after a certain yeen was put in solitary for a month straight after mooning you
>Why are those spotted fuckers always so incredibly horny all the time? It’s got to be some kind of species wide undiagnosed hormonal imbalance
>At least on the bright side the bovines on the block tend to not be so forward with you
>Despite the cow women having advantages in both weight and height over you not a single one has been particularly lewd in your presence
>It’s a fact you savored, a welcome reprieve from the other inmates and their dizzyingly high horny levels
>Not to mention it made getting their health check ups so much easier
>A Highland cow’s horns are getting a little too pointed and the wardeness is afraid they might be used as a weapon?
>It’s solved with a quick trip to the infirmary and a few minutes spent getting them polished to a blunt tip
>A cows breasts are getting uncomfortably full from their natural lactation?
>The prison has a few electric milkers set up in a room next to the infirmary for just such a problem
>You always did wonder where all that milk went but never found the courage to ask anyone
>Probably gets donated or something
>Not like any of the cows will be getting milked today, the power recently went out in the whole prison and everything from lights to air conditioning have been out of action for the past several hours
>Following orders from the wardeness you’re in the middle of a hallway that connected all the prison cells in this block, vigilantly keeping an eye on your charges to ensure they don’t get any bright ideas about escaping
>All while trying to ignore a certain yeen
>”Come over here Anon baby! You little pink tease, I know you want to come over and get some of this Hyena cunt. It’s gushing waterfalls for you my sweet little honeybun.”
>You tilt your head to look at the scarred face of one Payton Smith, the one eyed yeen that’s been a lust filled annoyance ever since you started working here
>”Shut it Payton, or I’m telling the wardeness and it’ll be another month in solitary for you.”
>She stretches her neck between the bars and takes a few deep sniffs, no doubt taking in what faint trace of your scent she could gather from several cell blocks down
>”Oh don’t talk like that baby, I know you like it when I say things like that. I can smell your erection from over here. Your precum filled tip…straining against…your…*schlick*…your pants…oh it just…*schlick*…makes me so horny for you baby…*schlick*”
>Her eyes roll back into her head and words devolve into breathy moans
>Your lips curl back in disgust and you turn your head to the cell in front as the wet sounds coming from Payton’s cell grow louder
>You're standing in front of the cell of Betty Bouffant, a holstein heifer sent here a year ago for tax evasion
>She’s sitting quietly on her bed, a hoof nervously tapping against the concrete floor and eyes focused on the ground
>There’s clearly something bugging her
>You take a few steps towards her cell and look through the metal bars
>”Betty, something wrong?”
>The tapping of her hooves intensifies
>”W-well, yes. I’m in pain. A lot of pain.” She says through clenched teeth
>Concerned, you step even closer
>”What hurts?”
>The tapping of her hoof on the floor reaches a crescendo until finally stopping
>She stands up and walks towards the bars, eyes focused intensely on your own
>”My tits are full Anon, they’ve been full for the past several hours but with the power out I can’t get no relief. My damned body just keeps making more milk but it’s got nowhere to go.”
>Your eyes drift down to her considerable bust
>Shit, she probably isn’t lying based on the two wet spots where her nipples ought to be
>"Anon please, do you think you could come over here and help a lady out? My girls are about to burst, you gotta believe me."
>You shake your head no, manual milking is strictly against the rules
>”Betty no, you know I can’t do that.”
>She presses her body against the bars even harder
>"Anon! You have to help me! Those stupid fucking machines don't work with no power and my tats are getting inflamed with all my milk, not to mention the pain’s getting worse. I know it's against the rules to undress but..."
>She unzips her jumpsuit and takes a boob out from under bra, pressing her nipple past the bars
>With her boob in plain sight it’s now definitely clear she wasn't lying, the swollen areola is tinged red when you know it should be pink, and milk dribbles from her teat as it presses against the bars
>"...please, you don't even have to use your mouth! Just use your hands! Do something, anything, before I get an infection and die in this shithole. Please anon...please."
>She puts on her best puppy dog eyes and you consider her plea for help
>She may be exaggerating to make you get handsy with her, or maybe she's just trying to get you to come close so she can steal your keys and free herself
>But she's always had good standing with you, she's never been known to lie, and she does seem to be in genuine pain
>Maybe...you'll help her out...just enough to take the edge off
>With a sigh you walk in front of her cell and stop
>”I’ll use my hands.” You point a stern finger at her for emphasis. “But only enough to take the edge off, then you’ll be going to the milkers first thing after the power comes back on.”
>A wide smile comes across her black and white splotched face
>”Oh thank you anon! Bless you! My furless little savior!”
>“Okay, so what do I do?”
>She takes your hands and presses a teat through the bars
>”You’ll need coax my dairy out with your fingers, like this.”
>She presses your hand against the base of a nipple and gently presses your fingers against her flesh
>Her breast is soft and warm, but her skin is strained from how much milk it’s trying to contain
>”Hey! That’s not fucking fair you bovine slut! That’s *my* human fucktoy you’re molesting!” Yells Payton from across the wing
>”Shut the fuck up Payton!” You growl back
>She whines and her head retreats back into her cell as more sounds of her self pleasure fill the air
>Betty shakes her head and resumes trying to teach you
>”Just squeeze it, then release, squeeze it, then release, and so on. Hopefully that’ll stop me from getting backed up too badly.”
>She releases your hand and you follow her orders
>Every time you squeeze a few dribbles of white fall from the tip of her nip and splatter to the ground
>But are those few drops exceeding what her body’s producing?
>After a few minutes of trying to free her milk from its fleshy prison you get an answer
>”Ohhhhhh” She whines, eyes closed in a painful expression
>”What? Does it still hurt?”
>”Yes!” She yells before shifting into a softer tone. “You aren’t getting enough milk out. It’s helping, but at this rate my tits will burst and I’ll be a dead woman before sundown.”
>”What if I…like…squeezed harder, like this.”
>You squeeze a breast with slightly more force than normal and Betty recoils back, a pained grunt escaping her lips
>”Ow! You idiot! You can’t just manhandle a girls mams like that!”
>”Shit! Sorry.”
>She sighs, and comes back in front of you
>”Anon, there’s only one way you’re going to get more out than what my body’s putting in. Are you willing to…you know…drink from them?”
>On one hand this is outrageously against protocol
>But on the other hand, out of all the inmates in this place Betty has a special place in your heart, and it does hurt to see her in so much pain
>And could you really live with yourself if you let someone die over a few regs in a handbook?
>”Okay, sure, but under no circumstances are you to tell anyone this happened.”
>”My lips are sealed, but yours won’t be.” She says with a smirk.
>Betty once again places a breast through the bars, the tip of her engorged nip already dripping with dairy
>”I don’t think you’ll need much explanation for this one Anon. Just latch on and start sucking like a calf. This is how my body was supposed to get rid of its milk so my tats should open the floodgates for you.”
>You lean down to the same level as her breast but a hand on the shoulder stops you
>”Wait, lets do it on the ground, should save your back.”
>”Good idea.”
>Both of you sit down on the floor and she unzips the top of her jumpsuit before undoing her bra letting both breasts bounce free
>Jesus, even for a cow she’s got an impressive rack
>Not she would ever know how you felt about it!
>It takes all your concentration to stop your half chub from growing into a mighty meat missile
>Nuns and puppies anon, nuns and puppies
>Betty edges close to the bars and sticks a hand out, gripping your shoulder and pushing you closer to her
>With the other she cups her right breast, raising it to the same height as your head
>You stare at her swollen leaking nipple, still somewhat reluctant to actually do the act
>”Anon…” She whimpers
>You make the mistake of looking her in the eyes for a fleeting moment, in them you see the poor cow practically screaming for relief
>After a deep breath your lips latch onto her breast and you gently suckle
>But before any of her milk enters your mouth you have a brief moment of curiosity
>What does anthro milk taste like?
>Like the species they share some of their genetics with?
>Or something else?
>Warm dairy shoots into your mouth and you have to swallow quickly to avoid it spilling from your lips
>The pressure must be from how full she is
>After the first swallow you get your answer on how it tastes
>Holy shit, it’s like cow milk from the store
>Except it’s warm, and maybe a little sweeter, kind of like whole milk actually
>The hand on your shoulder moves to your head and she holds your head against her breast, more milk flooding into your mouth from the movement
>You swallow again and Betty sighs in contentment, her ears drooping as she relaxes
>She’s clearly liking what you’re doing
>You drink once more from her nipple and-
>”Hey girls!”
>That’s Payton…oh no…
>”He drinkin’ milk! Haha!” The yeen screams before devolving into a loud maniacal cackle
>You hear movement and a few murmurs as other inmates begin sticking their heads out of their cells to have a look at the scene
>It’s quickly followed by raucous laughter and a few lewd catcalls from other inmates strongly ‘suggesting’ you suck their tits instead
>You try to detach your mouth from her teat but her hand on your head resists the movement
>”Shhhh, don’t listen to them. Just keep suckling, you’ve completely drained my right, it’s time for you to do my left.”
>After a few moments of struggle you finally manage to get your mouth free of her tit to speak
>”No, this is turning into a spectacle, I have to stop. And I almost completely drained it already? Seriously?”
>”Believe me, if you yelled into it there would be an echo.” She repositions herself to present the other breast to you. “Now just keep doing what you’re doing.”
>”Not with everyone watching! I can’t just-“
>Betty suddenly shoots her head out the bars and looks around at the other inmates
>”Ladies!” She screams in an uncharacteristically low, fearsome tone. “Some privacy please.”
>The murmuring slowly quiets and you hear paws patter on concrete as they move away from the bars
>Jesus, what kind of pull does Betty actually have around here?
>”Is that better sweetheart?” She coos
>”Uhhhh, ya, sure. But remember Betty I just want to take the edge off for you, I’m not trying to empty out the milk aisle or anything.”
>Her hand runs through your hair and a strange smile comes across her lips
>”Okay Anon. Now please, my left is still in a lot of pain.”
>She sticks her left boob out and you latch on unenthusiastically
>After a few mouthfuls you’re sure her boob is no longer overflowing and you stop
>Yet her hand on your head keeps you smushed against her chest
>”Keep going.” She whispers
>”I told you I’m -mmmmph!”
>She forcefully presses your head even harder into her breast and you fight back with equal ferocity
>That is until you feel a sharp prick against your skin
>She’s got a shiv against your neck and a malicious look in her eye
>In fear for your life you stop struggling and she leans in, voice low
>”Keep going or you might have a little accident. I know I’m breaking your trust here, but I won’t apologize for doing it. Truth is, me and the other bovines on the block hate those fucking milking machines. They’re loud, and uncomfortable, and they got so much suction that it’s like they’re trying to pull our nips off sometimes. They ain’t like, you know, actual lips. Like soft human lips that don’t make me want to kill myself when they latch on. So, me and the other women of bovine persuasion have been going easy on you, trying to gain your trust. Originally our plan was going to take longer but with this power outage I’m able to accelerate things.”
>”Plan for what?”
>”Plan to turn one of the guards in this dump into our very own milking machine. We get full and you’re the one that helps us out. No more fucking around with machines, no more wasted milk.”
>”Wasted? I thought they donated all the milk you gave or something.”
>”What?! No!” She says with a laugh. “They started throwing it all out ever since milk prices dropped last year. Prisoner milk ain’t worth much on the market and if the wardeness can’t make a profit off of it she just throws it away. The nerve! Do you have any idea how much energy my body puts into making that stuff!? Fucking big eared bitch.”
>Her shiv presses harder against your sensitive neck
>”Now drain my other tit and I’ll let you go. Oh, and by the way…”
>She brings a key up to your face with a smirk
>You see a small tag on it, cell 965
>Fuck, that’s Paytons cell, Betty must have snatched the key while you were distracted trying to help her
>”If you stop agreeing to help me and the other cows out you might discover that Payton somehow found the key her cell laying just outside the door while you’re on patrol. Then, well, you know what happens after that.”
>*Gulp*
>”Okay, fuck, fine. Do you and the other cows promise to keep going easy on me if I keep my end of the deal?”
>”Sure, we won’t cause you any issues and we’ll keep the other inmates off your back as long as the milk keeps flowing. I assure you of this.”
>”Thanks.”
>”Now stop wasting time and drain my left boob, one of the other guards is bound to wander in here after the power comes back on.”
>Complying you lean forward and begin sucking her other milk silo dry
>After the first mouthful she drops the shiv from your neck and goes back into a relaxed demeanor, her hand absentmindedly running through your hair and soft coos escaping her lips
>Some time later she pulls your head away
>”All done. When me or one of the other girls needs you we’ll let you know. Now wipe your mouth and get back against the wall. This never happened.”
>You wipe a dribble of milk from your lips and she zips up her jumpsuit
>As if on que the power comes back on and the door to the block swings open
>In struts the wardeness in all her ashy gray glory
>The elephant stomps up to you and Betty, her polished tusks shining from the overhead lights
>”The power’s back on Anon, no need to loiter around here anymore.” She then looks at Betty with an inquisitive gaze. “Not giving my officer any trouble I hope?”
>The cow shakes her head
>”Nope, none at all Ma’am!”
>”Good.”
>The wardeness puts an arm around your shoulders and leads you to the exit
>”Anything to report Officer Anon? Did the inmates get rowdier due to the blackout?”
>”No ma’am. Nothing out of the ordinary.”
>”Nothing from Payton?”
>”Well, she was just being her usual self.”
>”I see. In any case me and some of the other officers are going out for lunch today, it’ll be my little treat. We’re probably going to head to that hamburger place you like so much. Want to come with?”
>”Thanks, but no thanks. I’m not in the mood for beef right now.”
>”Want me to pick you up a milkshake from there then? Chocolate? Strawberry?”
>You shake your head, the thought of if it’s possible to overdose on calcium bouncing around in your head
>”Sorry but I'm really not hungry right now. I…already had lunch.”

>Tiny and flickering, it is unmistakable in the overwhelming gloom.
>Doggedly, he presses onward, determined to beat the cruelty of nature.
>He sees the light move, turning this way and that, bobbing along in the dark.
>A person? Another lost soul wandering alone in the wet and muggy thicket?
>Perhaps too much to ask for, but he couldn't give way to defeatist thinking.
>Frantically, he begins to call out, waving his hands in the air despite the darkness.
>His voice is deafening in the quiet, carrying through the trees like thunder.
>The light halts in its motions, its unseen master stopping in their tracks.
>Elated, he calls out again, praying that whoever they are, they have a means of escaping the swamp.
>The light grows brighter as its owner begins their approach, and only now does something occur to him.
>It has grown eerily quiet, not even the crickets and cicadas making a sound.
>All he can hear is the sound of his breathing and the sucking of the mud.
>And then the sound of something drawing nearer, something huge and heavy.
>The sound of water splashing around some great form, and the creak of trees being pushed aside by some monstrous strength.
>It's too late to flee.
>He couldn't even if he tried.
>The thick mud slows him.
>Whatever it is that's coming for him, it will catch him.
>None of the dark, wet, or muck seem to impede it as it draws inexorably closer.
>His heart hammers in his chest.
>He's afraid.
>Thoughts of horrendous nightmare beasts assail his mind.
>He tries to calm himself, thinking it's probably just someone in a car or something.
>If that were true, he'd have heard a motor by now.
>Instead, he can hear the nearing tread of heavy feet.
>The sound of some huge animal breathing.
>He's going to die.
>Some hideous swamp monster is going to eat him.
>He can't even scream.
>Fear settles on him so thickly that he can only weep.
>The light is nearly upon him, and he can make out a shape in the dark.
>It is massive, a huge, heaving thing pushing its way through the foliage.
>He feels his chest will explode from the force of his beating heart.
>Mercifully, consciousness fails him, and he slips away into blissful oblivion.
>Just as he fades away, he sees something that will haunt his dreams forever.
>A face, long, scaly, and full of teeth, and eyes that burn like gold.

>All around you, nude, glistening hide on full display, only rarely covered should the weather turn hostile.
>It extends to the school faculty, as well, the classrooms stalked by naked teachers warily eyeing their charges.
>You'd like to think that your time amongst the saurians has made you comfortable with nudity and exhibitionism.

For saurians, it's no big deal. Being naked is just what's easy and natural. Besides, it's more fun and cost-effective than trying to mass-produce clothing for such a diverse race.
Humans, on the other hand, struggle with it at times. You can only be among the scaled sort for so long before embracing it, resisting it, or being consumed by it.
If the odd human should throw a fit or have a breakdown, the best thing to do is be patient and helpful.
If it should so happen that some scaly cheeks are grabbed, some balls are fondled, or a dick or titty should be sucked, then that's just the way of it. No harm, no foul.
Besides, humans are cute, and their warm skin feels good on scaly hide.

>With her scaly, clawed hand on the back of his head pressing him inside her, she moans whorishly.
>The rest of the car ignores this lewd display, save for another saurian man gleefully recording it on his phone.
>Holding tight to the guard rail, the woman throws her head back with a full-throated bellow.
>"Fuck! Oh, fuck! Cum! I'm gonna cum!"
>Somebody groans, "Watch it with the language, will ya?"
>She ignores them.
>"Open your mouth! Open it! Drink me! Drink me!"
>The man dutifully obeys, accepting the squirt of warm, clear fluid that pours out of her as she shrieks.
>He swallows as much as he can before the collapsing saurian pulls him down with her, splaying him between her legs as she falls into a seat.
>The proverbial show being over, you return to what you were doing, privately wishing the potential new couple a good evening.

>Humans are noteworthy for being the only intelligent mammal species in the world.
>Millenia of convergent evolution between saurians and humans has made humans hardier and stronger while saurians have picked up a few mammalian traits.
>I'm conflicted about keeping the world split into individual continents or making it one big mega continent a la Pangea.
>Saurians, due to their more resilient nature and dizzying variety in sizes and shapes, have never had a practical reason to mass-produce conventional clothing.
>Related to this is the saurian preference for nudity, which is culturally embedded deeply into the saurian psyche. Most saurians get uncomfortable if they cover up for too long.
>Carnivorous saurians have deeply rooted predatory instincts that can cause them stress if they go unsatisfied for long periods.
>In answer to the above, hunting lodges and "catch your own meat" farms are very popular.
>On the opposite end, agriculture is explosively more important in this setting, with massive tracks of farmland being needed for the multitudes of large herbivores.

How do you think international corporations would market their products to anthros and human men? Would their be products similar to axe marketing schemes that promise lonely anthros the ability to attract potential mates? You had me thinking about this because of the WAP reference

I can imagine some of the advertisement would be exactly like that

Anthro hunter captures a lost human and she takes him to her home to examine him. Maybe make her a deer if you feel up to it.
I have this image in my head of a guy waking up and the first thing he sees is a deer eating a steak.
>the night is filled with the howling of wolves
>they came from the cold mountains
>descended on your tribe with biting jaws, ripping claws
>and terrible hunger for flesh
>they hounded your people, hunting them ceaselessly
>any they caught, they killed
>until one night, as you and the last of your kin huddled around the fire
>sharpened spears in weary hands
>they came
>howling and snarling out of the dark
>beasts that stood on two legs like men
>and tore apart any they caught
>those who didn't die fled into the black of night
>into the woods
>now it is cold and dark, and you are alone
>using your spear to prop yourself up as you struggle through weariness and hunger to flee for your life
>you can hear it
>something coming up behind you
>plowing through the brush like an enraged mammoth
>you groan and lift your spear into both hands
>the stone head fresh and unbloodied
>the wooden haft hard and unyielding
>you hear it before you see it
>the snarling and rustling of the brush getting closer
>footsteps that are far too light for a thing of its size
>and then it's there, just at the edge of sight
>two yellow orbs reflecting scant moonlight as they stare at you
>the low rumble of it growl sending a chill down your spine
>you level your spear and wait for it to rush
>but it doesn't happen
>the wolf eyes stare
>and stare
>your fingers twitch
>something is wrong
>you only realize what that is just in time
>there's more than one thing moving in the brush
>you turn to the source just in time to bring your spear up as the second wolf pounces
>you see the shock in its expression as it twists in the air to try and divert from your weapon
>but you're not letting it get away
>you step forward and stab with all your might
>catching the thing in its chest
>a distracted part of you noting the breasts
>a woman wolf?
>it makes no difference
>you drive the spear deep
>the wolf's own speed and weight sealing its doom
>the spear punches clean through
>before the wolf woman has even hit the ground, the other wolf is upon you
>sinking its jaws into your arm as it tackles you to the ground
>claws tear through the elkskin you wear and rake your back
>the wolf woman writhes and whines while she dies upon your spear
>and you will not be long before joining her in the world of the dead
>as the wolf mauls your arm, tearing chunks of flesh, you scream and lash out with a fist
>that only slows the beast a moment
>you feel the bones in your forearm snap under the pressure of its jaw
>it roars and shakes its head
>thrashing you about
>until finally, with a mighty wrench that rips your flesh, the wolf tears off your lower arm
>you scream your lungs bloody
>writhing in pain and terror
>the wolf snaps its jaws on your severed flesh
>then spits it out to howl its victory over you
>the howl is cut off by a whistling sound that ends in a muffle 'tunk'
>at first you can't see what's happened
>you're too focused on grasping what's left of your arm
>the wolf choking and reeling back from you
>there's another whistle, and another 'tunk'
>and this time you see, sprouting from the wolf's throat, a pair of sticks
>thinner than your finger, yet somehow tore through its thick pelt to impale its throat
>the wolf falls backward, choking and gagging as it expires
>you turn your head, looking for the source of those sticks
>clutching the stump of your arm and wondering at what could have done that to the wolf
>it makes little difference
>you are bleeding
>the world is becoming distant, your vision narrowing
>and another wolf has stepped into your vision
>it is smaller than the others
>but you cannot fight it with one hand
>so you lay back and shut your eyes to wait for the end
>you feel your body being lifted
>hands under your arms dragging you away the last thing you perceive before falling into darkness
>when you wake, it is to the sound of a crackling fire and the warmth of furs piled atop you
>and terrible pain from your injuries
>you groan
>voice hoarse from screaming
>your mind is fogged from pain and weakness
>so it takes some time before you can bring yourself to open your eyes and see a cave wall illuminated by flickering firelight
>and it takes a little more time for you to question your surroundings
>and survival
>the wolf should have killed you
>instead it saved you?
>you turn your head aside
>looking over toward the fire where the wolf is sitting
>but there's something wrong with it
>it's eyes are shut, its face is slack
>only when it moves do you understand
>the figure crouched by the fireside, mixing things in a small bowl with its fingers is not a wolf
>but some other beast wearing the skin of a wolf on top of its own
>its only when the stranger stands straight and looks to you that you see what it truly is
>a two-leg like the wolves
>but of a kind you have never seen before
>she--
>it is most definitely a she, with a noticeable chest and flaring of her hips
>--is a deer
>her eyes settle on you, and she smiles
>"You live."
>her voice is soft
>tender
>and has a slight bleat to it
>besides the wolfskin, she is covered oddly in some kind of stiff skin, the kind of which you also have not seen before
>the doe kneels beside you, and holds the bowl to your lips
>a hot broth, with bits of meat in it
>"Eat. You have slept for a day and a night."
>you distrust the food
>and turn your head away
"No. Do not eat two-leg."
>if she wears the skin of a wolf, she may serve the flesh of it
>two-leg meat is evil
>the deer snuffs out her snout and dips a fingers into the bowl to snatch a piece
>"It is wild sow."
>she pops the chunk in her mouth and chews
>"See?"
>that is almost worse than if she were feeding you two-leg
>a deer eating meat is against nature itself
>but she takes your head with a hand and forces the bowl to your lips
>"Eat."
>you cannot resist the temptation of food
>you part your lips and let her lift the bowl to feed you
>greedily you drink down the broth and chew your first bite
>it's delicious
>another new thing, some spice to the broth and meat entirely foreign to your tongue
>you swallow and rasp out
"More."
>the doe smiles and feeds you some more
>until you've had your fill and she sets it down
>you try to pick your head up more
>to sit up fully
>but you're too weak to manage even that
>the doe notices your efforts, and puts a hand on your back to gently lift you
>she shifts herself onto the litter you're lying on, kneeling to act as support for you
>your head rests on her chest so you have to look up to see her face
>still smiling down at you
>"That is good? You are still weak, dear."
>you grunt
"You are deer. I am man."
>for some reason she laughs
>a soft giggle that rings in your ears
>"Funny thing. Rest in my arms."
>she slips her arms around your chest to hold onto you
>but her words remind you
>of the terrible injury
>you try to lift your arm, to pull it from under the skins
>the doe shushes in your ear and holds you down
>"Shh. It is gone. I am sorry, I could not find you in time to save you wholly."
>you knew it could never be whole again, but it is a terrible hurt to hear it
>you are broken
>doomed
>this doe has wasted time saving an injured beast
>you groan
"Why? Why save me?"
>she sighs and hugs you to her chest
>the coarseness of her coverings a slight irritation
>"I am a huntress. And when I can, I hunt the wolves. They are savage. A danger. When I found the wolves, I found you."
>that explains why she killed the wolf
>not why she saved you
>you pull against her arms
>but she holds you down with seemingly no effort
"I am hurt. Beyond healing. You should have left me."
>the doe shushes you again
>"You slew the wolf. You are strong. Hurt now, but will be strong again. That strength will serve us both."
>how could that be?
>what does she want of you?
>she gives you your answer with another squeeze
>"I have been alone. The wolves took my kin, as they did yours. Now I have taken you so I will not be alone any more."
>you would not wish to be alone either
>but you will serve her little, maimed as you are
"What will I do? I cannot hunt. I cannot fight."
>the doe slides a hand over your bare chest
>her fur is soft
>and she is careful to avoid your wounds
>to trace her fingers over your uninjured arm
>"You have one hand still. You may cook, you may clean, you may mend. When you are ready, I will show you the sling and you may yet hunt again."
>sling?
>you do not know what she means
"Sling? It killed the wolf?"
>she laughs again
>such a soft sound
>it is soothing
>"No, my dear. I used my bow. It is a weapon that my people have made."
>again she calls you 'deer'
>there is much about this two-leg you do not understand
>like why she still holds you
>or why she is humming a tune in your ear as her wandering hand has moved to your head to stroke your hair
>"You must rest, dear. Come lay your head in my lap and close your eyes."
>she scoots back
>letting you slide down until you are mostly laid flat
>with your head still laying upon her thighs
>she goes on stroking your hair and smiling down at you
>"You will see, my wolf slayer. Even if you are not whole, you will be enough. To serve me, to share with me your life, and to father my fawns."
>your eyes were drooping until you heard her last words
>she has to push you down again as you try to rise
>again she laughs so melodiously
>and gives you that tender smile
>"Sleep, my dear. You will need strength in the morning."
>you wish to protest
>a man and deer cannot be mates can they?
>but her form is pleasing to your eyes
>her voice soothing to your ears
>her fur soft to the touch
>if she would have you as mate and companion, how could you deny she who saved your life?
>you let your eyelids lower once again, drifting to sleep with your mate for the first time

>you’ve always been the quiet type in your life
>you always focused of schoolwork, straight A’s mean a guaranteed scholarship
>of course you do other peoples school work for cash as a sort of side job
>but you were always niche, never being one for popularity
>until you met the top girl of the school
>she was a jaguar; and like her Aztec ancestors
>she had no problem sacrificing people (or at least their popularity and dignity) to help herself
>you knew she could make or break you
>but it wasn’t on your mind
>until the last two weeks until finals
>Because she walked up to you, still as cocky as she ever was
>she asked you to write down notes for her as she forgot
>and she says she’ll reward you by giving you something you never had
>you don’t really know what that means, but if she’s willing to pay the 25$, you’d be happy to help
>spend the weekend slaving over both hers and your notes for the test
>make sure there is nothing wrong, you know the jaguar will kill you, literally or figuratively you didn’t know
>after a couple of days, give her your notes/ cheat sheet
>she thanks you and pays the cost, as well as a tip
>but you would have to see if it was correct
>it’s been a few days since finals, and you pray to God that you made no mistakes
>before feeling Someone tapping your shoulder
>you turn around to see the jaguar
>and your blood runs cold
>she looks mildly happy, but before you could say anything
>to the shock of you, and probably everyone around you
>you got a kiss on the lips, your first
>guess she did give you what you never had
>”looks like you did your homework” the jaguar purred out ,sounding like a mixture of happy and flirtatious
>she passed with a 94%, it wasn’t a full ace, but she passed with high grades
>she says in order to thank you, she’s inviting you to her summer vacation party
>her parties were consider a chance to be truly wild and free
>and she just invited some random nerd who did her work one time
>something was off about this, there had to be a alternative reason for this
>but you couldn’t think of any
>you kindly accept the offer
>and before she leaves you to be, she says one last thing
>”try to avoid what you think is ‘cool’, you’ll just look like a bigger dork”

>one month she’s the sweet, demure, and feminine little wolf girl who caught your eye. A whole first month of sweet handholdings and summer afternoons
>the full moon comes
>the whole month thereafter the flip switches. You’re her little breeder-toy-mate, she knows what she wants out of you and she wants it now
>full moon hits again
>basically you have one girlfriend who becomes two. It’s not like it’s a multiple personalities thing, but it’s jarring
>eventually when you’re close enough with her, she mentiones that she’d rather give birth in her bigger form so her hips can handle a whole litter
>but because that’s an odds vs evens game. When she’s in her big bad mama firm she’s conflicted, because that’s also when she wants to breed some puppies out of you most
>lunar cycle wolf wife really is a unique kind of relationship

>girly little twink anon goes clubbing hoping to get some action with a hot anthro guy
>not quite a trap but he's androgynous enough to worry about cleaning up his outfit in the bathroom first
>exits back into the club before he catches the eye of a muscular wolf guy at the bar
>he winks and waves anon over, who can't help but giggle to himself that he got a bite already
>once he gets closer he realizes his mistake, 'he' is actually a rather well-endowed 'she'
>nervously stammers how he thought she was a guy and he's sure she's wonderful but he swings for the same team
>she simply smiles and tells him there's nothing wrong with her buying him a drink anyways
>part of him wants to decline but she seems like the kind of girl you don't want to say no to
>plus, free drink
>finishes his fruity girly cocktail and thanks her before she grabs his arm and stops him from getting up
>she leans in and tells him bluntly how cute she thinks he is and how much she wants to choke on his cock
>anon gets even more flustered and confused, he knows for sure he shouldn't be interested in a woman at all
>but she's just so strong and forward and direct that he can't help but nod when she asks if he wants to head back to her place
>as they leave the club and start walking back she wraps her arm around him and pulls him tight, explaining in graphic detail how she's going to give him the night of his life
>the cuter and subbier he acts, the more it turns her on
>she's going to absolutely ruin other anthros for him and make him her's
>and all he can do is blush and nod as she pulls him tighter into her side

>"Anooon~ It's time for brushies!"
>a sing-song voice calls from upstairs
>you slam down the pot from dinner in the sink, dry your hands, and bolt upstairs all at indecent haste
>chores can wait
>it's your favorite time of day!
>time to brush your fox wife's big, beautiful, soft, fluffy tail!
>she's waiting for you on the bed, sitting on the end of it with her tail up and fluttering
>it's as big as your torso, the floof so thick you could wrap your arms around it and hug it
>and you do, every night you fall asleep
>when your wife isn't the big spoon
>"There's my darling husband! Always so eager. You love my tail so much, don't you sweetie?"
>you do
>it's your favorite thing about her
>tied with her charm, her beautiful voice, her warm amber eyes, her wide grabbable hips that smother your face so well
>there's a lot about her to love
>and you're going to love it a lot
>you grab up the brush from its sacred position on her nightstand and climb up onto the bed
>your wife giggles and brushes her tail side to side
>batting it against your face and making you sputter
>you try to grab hold of it, but she's far too quick
>and bops you on the nose with another swipe
>you roll your eyes, letting her have her laugh
>"Aww, sorry sweetie. This thing really has a life of its own. Here."
>she reaches back to hold the base of her tail, which sticks out from under her sweater to give you a glimpse of her plush rear
>pretending to hold it in place, she lets you take her tail and draw it into your lap
>it lays across your folded legs, big enough you have to take it in sections
>it's so soft
>you start to brush it out
>in long, slow strokes
>followed by gliding your fingers over the fluff after brushing it down
>your wife shudders
>"Oh there's the spot dear. Keep going."
>there's nothing you'd love more in the world
>while you work the base of her tail, the rest lazily wraps around your back
>each brush as much bliss for you as it is for her
>her fur is light and soft
>you keep it in immaculate state, with daily brushing sessions, just to make sure it's the softens and silkiest it can possibly be
>really, it only needs to be brushed once a week
>but what she wants, she gets
>"Keep going Anon."
>she doesn't have to tell you twice
>but it's good to know she's enjoying your attention
>she sweeps her tail up again
>letting you reach more and more of her floof
>while also rubbing the end of it against your face
>you inhale her scent with a deep sigh
>it's heaven
>your hand sinks into pure fur
>the brush, a specially reinforced xxx-tra fluff-master, struggles to pass through such condensed foxtail fur
>"That's it, my good boy. You love my fluff so much."
>you love her fluff so much
>"You were made to worship me and my tail."
>you were made to worship her and her tail
>your hands work through fur automatically, while your mind sinks deep into pure relaxation
>where all the world is your wife, and her perfect fur, and how much you love her
>"Good boy."
>her voice rings through your head
>fills you with warmth
>you would follow it anywhere
>"You belong to fluffy foxes. You love fluffy foxes. I am your greatest treasure."
>she is your greatest treasure
>you cherish her
>"Breath deep, my dear. Focus on the feeling of my fur on your skin. Feel how soft it is. How warm it is. Hug my tail, Anon."
>the brush drops from your hand so you can wrap your arms around the bulk of her tail
>more tails wrap around you
>one after another, until there's five tails holding you for the one tail you're holding in your arms
>"Never forget, my dear Anon, that I love you more than life itself. You will never leave my side so long as you live."
>her words resonate to your core
>your place is by her side
>your wife loves you
>you love your wife
>her tails start to massage you in a way that would be impossible for a mere fox
>working under your clothes and undressing you, until there's not an inch of you untouched by fur
>you're in ecstasy
>all that matters in life is right here, right now
>wrapped up in fox tails and worshiping her fur
>your wife coos
>"Anon~ My dear Anon~ You're so much happier with me, aren't you?"
>how can she even ask that?
>of course you are
>if you were capable of speaking right now, you would tell her so
>tell her that when she found you, you were lonely and bitter
>that falling under the sway of her magic was the best thing that ever happened to you
>you would tell her that you turned her away so many times not because you disliked her, or hated anthros
>but because you were scared
>afraid of letting yourself be happy
>you start to cry, tears leaking silently from your eyes
>it hurts to think that your beloved mistress would ever doubt how much you love her
>the fur of her tail against your face absorbs your tears
>wiping away your sorrow just as quickly
>"Oh Anon. I'm so sorry for doing this to you, but I can't let you go."
>please don't be sad my love
>you try to hug her tail harder, but your body isn't your own right now
>it's hers
>she whines softly
>"Anon, hold me."
>the tail slips out of your arms, making you feel empty inside
>that emptiness doesn't last, as you're pushed forward by her other tails to embrace your wife
>she lifts herself up onto your lap with a sigh while you wrap your arms around her waist
>"That's better my love."
>the vixen in your arms hums
>and shifts her hips
>your body responds naturally to holding your wife in your lap
>even if you can't move, your cock has a mind of it's own that not even she can control
>your wife laughs
>"At least this part of you can answer me."
>it can
>and you'd agree with it if your mind was your own right now
>the tails holding you start to shift
>moving your body for you while your wife adjusts herself on your lap
>she's already leaking onto your lap
>you can feel her heat on your thighs
>when she's in position, your hips are pushed upward from the tail supporting you
>if you could choose for yourself, this is how you'd do things with her
>slow and sensual
>your wife's tails massaging every part of you and her sex grinding against your shaft, while her words guide your actions
>"Hold my hips, Anon. Feel my fur under your fingertips. In the morning, you'll remember how we made love so gently. How you kissed my neck. How happy it made you feel."
>your lips are already on her
>trailing kisses up and down her fur
>making her gasp and shudder
>"Put it in me, love~"
>you pull your hips back
>and let her tails guide you in
>she's burning with her need for you
>hot and tight around you as you're pushed all the way to the hilt
>she sits there, grinding her hips back and forth
>"Mmh, my husband. My love. How could I ever give this up?"
>how could you?
>the vixen in your lap lifts herself up, then lowers herself down in a shallow thrust
>she's so sensitive
>her little squeaks and geckers are adorable
>your wife needs to take it slow, or else she'll get overwhelmed
>your head starts to swim
>more than usual
>as her euphoria leaks into your mind with every thrust
>her many tails start to lose cohesion
>so quickly too!
>as she moans and squeaks through her first climax
>her paws go overtop your hands and she shivers on top of you
>her back arches
>"Gods yes~"
>she takes a minute to compose herself
>catching her breath in dainty gasps that make your heart melt
>then she starts up again
>moving you into a slightly faster pace
>slightly longer thrusts
>she bares her teeth in an effort to maintain control of herself
>but she's geckering and moaning again in minutes
>"How do you last so long?"
>human stamina, you suppose
>she draws your arms around her waist again
>her paw pads are almost as soft and supple as her fur against your skin as she holds onto you
>"Anon. I want you to keep going. Until you cum. And then..."
>she grips your arm tight
>...I want you to forget everything we did tonight except brushing my tail and making love."
>your heart aches
>you want to remember this
>how much she loves you, and how hard she works to make you happy
>so you could tell her that you're okay with it
>but it's too late
>your thrusting into her now
>limbs acting according to her will, with her tails simply nudging you to maximize both your pleasure with every thrust
>your wife cums on your cock
>riding through one orgasm that rolls into the next
>as each thrust brings you closer to your own explosive climax
>and all the while
>those tails that you love so much, even when you think there's only one of them, are all around you
>encouraging you
>massaging your skin
>enveloping your mind
>it's everything you could ever need in life
>you climax
>bucking your hips one final time to bury your member in your wife and blow your load deep inside her
>she howls, head thrown back
>the last thing you hear as your mind goes blank, and you drift off into dreamless, memory-washing sleep
>you wake up next to your wife
>the love of your life
>cuddling her tail
>you feel a little embarrassed to be so fixated on the thing
>it seems like every time you brush it, it leads to you two having sex
>not that she seems to mind
>she's so sensitive
>you brush your fingers through her tail and then move closer
>to kiss at her neck
>like you know she likes
>your wife yawns and stretches
>"Anon. My love..."
>she sighs
>you keep kissing, hand playing at her tail
>"Wait."
>her tail swings between you
>you catch a face full of floof
>making you sputter
>her voice echoes in your head
>"Tell me the truth. Your real feelings."
>you inhale the scent of her tail, and something inside you bursts
>like a dam breaking
>tears spring to your eyes
>you reach out for her and pull her close
>your wife lets out a yelp of surprise as you brush a hand through her hair to whisper in her ear
"I love you Serah."

>she smirks and bends over at her waist to get closer to you
>still a good three feet taller
>those legs go on forever
>"If you want a hug, you have to beg for it."
>again, it takes you a moment to comprehend what she's saying
>your girlfriend, the fifteen foot canine who manhandle you for funsies, is now demanding you beg to be scooped up in her arms and cuddled
>her curled tail wags furiously as she studies your bemused expression
>"Aww, I thought you liked my cuddles. You don't wanna get your head all in my big fluffy boobies?"
>you very much do
>even proportionally, she's got a chest that puts most other girls' to shame
>and killer thighs
>soft pillowy fur
>perky ears
>such a cute smile
>alright fuck it's worth it
"Please Tasha, would you pick me up and cuddle me?"
>she stands up straight again and taps her muzzle with a finger in faux-contemplation
>"Hmm, I don't believe you. Beg a little more."
>you roll your eyes
>then bring your hands up in a begging gesture
"Please Tasha. You know I look forward to this every day when I get home. Just pick me up already."
>her tail goes faster
>but she manages to maintain her smug smirk
>in fact it's even bigger
>"You must really love my cuddles. You love them, don't you?"
"Yes."
>she nods
>"And you'd give anything for me to pick you up right now and squeeze you like a little squishy plush toy?"
>you start to respond but she holds up a paw
>"I want to hear you say it."
>why is she making you work so hard for this?
>now you actually are starting to beg in earnest
"You know I would! I'd give anything for you to pick me up right now and squeeze me."
"Like...?"
>you sigh
"Like little squishy plush toy."
>you blush
>but that's exactly what you want
>Tasha's façade breaks and she scoops you off the ground
>"Eeee! That was perfect! Aww my little plushy boy! How could I say no to such a cutie pie?"
>you're smothered in her sweater puppies so her voice is muffled
>"Next time I'll get it on video!"

>W-What?"
>Your voice trembles, full of surprise and the sudden pang of nerves you now feel building in the pit of your stomach.
>"undo my blouse."
>The Pantheress repeats, her golden yellow eyes seemingly rooting you to the spot.
>You swallow, your mouth suddenly dry, though your skin is suddenly moist as you start sweating... did the heating suddenly come to life? are her eyes literally burning a hole into you with the intensity of her stair? either way, you can't help but wonder if she can see the hot flush you can feel all too well.
>"Your... your blouse?"
>you manage to stammer out, your tongue oddly sluggish and hesitant to your commands.
>"That is what I said, is it not?"
>Carmen fixes you with a smirk, the corner of her dark lips curling upwards in mild amusement at your sudden bashfulness, though her eyes haven't lost even an ounce of their fire.
>you lick your lips, a pretty useless act all things considered, seeing as your mouth is drier than Gandhi's flip-flop.
>"C'mon focus, snap out of it you tard, this is it, the moment you've been waiting for, don't make yourself look like an invalid in front of her."
>Finally, your body seems to be listening to your brain once more, at least for now. you reach up with your hands, and even you can notice how nervous you are, the shaking of your fingers are a clear give away.
>never the less you manage to reach the top button of her garment, and with all the grace and dexterity of a land bound octopus, you fight your fingers into popping loose her top button.
>" Yes, one down... many more to go."
>you think to yourself, your eyes tracing down her front at all the buttons that were left.
>all the while you can still feel her molten eyes burning into you, that sly smirk still upon her lips, though thankfully she remains silent, not chiding you again.
>Your shaking hands move down to undo her second button... then her third, your mind regaining better control of it's body with each moment that passes.
>you glance up at her and make eye contact... for a moment, all thoughts leave your mind, your world becomes little more than those two, bright, predatory orbs and the sound of your own thundering heart in your chest.
>You're only broken from your trance when you feel her large, warm hands take ahold of yours, surprisingly gentle as they guide your hands down to the next button.
>you chuckle nervously, managing to drag your gaze from hers and back down to the task at hand, quickly moving down to the next button.
>you swallow again... you've undone enough now to notice that she isn't waring a bra, and that fact only causes your nervousness to redouble... this was getting serious, and you didn't know if you was up to snuff... so to speak.
>Her eyes burned into the top of your head, and you didn't know if it was that fact or a deep sense of growing excitement that urged you onwards.
>*pop... pop... pop...*
>you continue your job dutifully, working your way down her blouse little silver button by little silver button, until with a quiet rustle, the light blue garment slid away, and...
>"What's the matter Anon, never seen some kitty titties before?"
>Carmen's teasing voice reached your brain but were lost in the cacophony of thoughts and feelings currently swirling around in there.
>Kitty titties were an understatement you feel, as the two mounds revealed to you were both each larger than your head by a good degree.
>you can't help but stair at the pear, your eyes wide as you take in the full magnitude of the charms before you.
>her breasts were each covered in that very same glossy, black fur that covered the rest of her body, though up this close, it was much easier to see the subtle differences in the black shading of the pantheress, from here, you could actually make out the rosettes that patterned her cote... that alone would be mesmerizing, a hidden beauty to her already lovely fur.
>both of her boobs were tipped with a dark grey nipple, full and erect... though from arousal or the sudden cooler air upon them, you couldn't be sure.
>"I... I uh..."
>You start to stammer, eyes still fixed on the sight before you.
>Touch them."
>She interrupts, breaking what little train of thought you had managed to muster together.
>"W-What?"
>"do I really need to repeat myself again, Anon?"
>she teases, her hands reaching down to grab yours once again.
>"I said, touch them."
>before you can do so much as blink, she has placed your hands on her charms, your digits sinking into her soft fur and warm flesh.
>a breath escapes your lips as you feel her, the gentle curve of her mounds, their waste, the way they shift and mold to your touch.
>You're rewarded by the sound of Carmen purring, the rumbling of her throat transmitting through her chest and into your hands and forearms.
>You can't help but let out a slight chuckle, purring... she was purring from your touch...
>but before you could bask in that fact for too long, a sudden flash of black fur was all the warning you got as the pantheress lunged, grabbing your head between both of her hands before roughly shoving your face into her right tit.
>As quick as that your world was nothing but darkness and heat as she smothered you within the flesh of her breast.
>her strong hand held your head firmly against her chest, and it was clear you weren't going anywhere unless she wanted you too.
>and then you feel it, a stiff nub of flesh rubbing against your lips... it takes you but the briefest of moments to collect your thoughts and realise what it is, and even as her wards reach your ears, you're already letting instinct take over.
>"C'mon Anon, suckle on mommy's teat."
>You hear her low chuckle, feel it even through her chest, but you're mind is already lost to your lust.
>Your lips part, allowing her nipple to pass between them and into your mouth.
>you suck, your tongue probing against the nub of flesh, tasting her for the first time.
>At first her flavour was little more than her, and the subtle taste of sweat... and then the warm gush of fluids came.
>without warning, your mouth was filled with the creamy flavour of her milk, the sudden on rush of liquid surprising you at first, but by now you were lost to your desires, and all higher functioning had been put to the back of your mind for now.
>you suckled, swallowing down the creamy goodness and yet you suckle harder, wanting nothing more than to do what your pantheress desires of you.
>"hmm hmm... that's a good boy Anon, drink up, you'll need to be hydrated, can't have you little more than a husk after tonight."
>once more her words reach your brain, and instead of nerves, your body shivers with excitement, chills running up and down your spine as another mouthful of milk washes down your throat.
>You shove your face into her tit harder, your hands reaching up and massaging her big mommy milker, fingers digging into her flesh as you work to cokes more of her nectar out.
>"That's it... now you're getting the idea."
>she chuckled, her claws gently running down the back of your head and neck, sending yet more shivers down your spine.
>suddenly, you were pulled from her tit, strands of milk tainted saliva connecting your lips to her perky nipple, a gentle trickle of fluid still leaking from the duct.
>You look up into those eyes of her once more with half a mind to complain, but you don't get that far.
>in another quick movement, her face lunges down towards yours, and before you can blink her lips are on yours, rough kitty tongue forcing it's way into your mouth, quickly dominating your much smaller tongue and exploring your throat.
>the kiss is intense, overwhelming, something you more experience rather than participate in.
>her purr rattles your skull, the taste of her saliva mixing with the remnants of her milk still on your lips.
>she closes her eyes, moaning into your mouth. you lose yourself in the moment, your own eyes closing as you let her tongue writhe and explore your mouth. you do your best to give as good as you get, but you're fighting a losing battle.
>you feel her hands running up and down your arms and back, her strong fingers curling around your bicep with ease.
>she leans you back, her right hand slowly running up your chest as she somehow deepens the kiss. her claws hook into the collar of your shirt before...
>with the sound of tearing cloth and the ping of little buttons clacking against the wooden floor, Carmen rips your shirt open with the ease that one might open a pack of chips.
>the cool air meeting your flushed skin is enough to give you goose bumps and make you shiver.
>finally the pantheress breaks the kiss, allowing you to catch your breath, only for it to be stolen from you once more as you feel her wet, rough tongue lap across your chest... then stomach... then...
>she pushes you back against the couch, pinning you down with a single hand while she fiddles with your belt.
>the tent you were currently pitching in your pants was more than a little obvious, and with the fire in her eyes... it was all too clear what she wanted.
>Evidently patience wasn't her strong suit, as with a growl that sent a spark of panic through you for a moment, she gave your pants the same treatment as your shirt, the buckle of your belt breaking as the button did likewise.
>now loose enough, Carmen pulls your pants off in a single fluid motion and tosses them aside to join the scattering of buttons and cloth on the floor.
>it's no surprise when your boxers meet the same fate, and finally your length... her prize, is free.
>you let out a soft whimper as you feel her wet nose press into the warm skin of your nut sack, the massive pantheress inhaling your sent with a low rumble of delight.
>"Oh Anon... you smell good enough to eat."
>perhaps not the best term to use when her jaws are that close to your closest friends, you think to yourself... but hell if you're going to open your mouth to complain.
>your skin flushes once again with your aroused excitement, and your already aching length gives a twitch, causing her to giggle.
>"Well well... someone's eager."
>she said, her tongue coming into play once again as it slides up the full length of your member.
>her rough tongue slowly, oh so slowly trails up the underside of your cock all the way to the tip, the rough texture a delightful mix of just intense enough to make you gasp and shiver, but not quite uncomfortable.
>you look down at her, your eyes wide as you meet her gaze, her pinkish red tongue in stark contrast to the black of her fur and golden of her eyes.
>she teases your tip, tongue tip swirling around the head of your dick, lips puckering as she gives it a little kiss.
>and then your entire length disappears. her jaws part, revealing those long, pearly white fangs, glossy with her saliva.
>for a moment a jolt of fear runs through you, those are some pretty fuckin' big teeth, and if she's not careful, they could... but you quickly find all of your fears brushed aside, replaced instead with mind numbing pleasure as she gives a single, hard suck of your length.
>you let out a moan, back arching as her tongue once more laps at the underside of your shaft, her soft inner cheek flesh gliding against the sides of your dick as she sucks, swallowing down your pre.
>"mmm."
>she purrs, golden eyes closing as she sucks again... and again.
>you're helpless to do anything but lay there and enjoy the blowjob... for as long as you could.
>you feel her hand gently massage the underside of your balls, a tingle of pleasure and thrill of fear mixing within you as you ponder just what she could do with those...
>you let out a breath, toes curling as you feel her claw trace down the sensitive skin of your taint, inching ever closer down... down to your...
>she pauses just before her claw tip meets your pucker, her eyes opening as she grins at you around your meat in her mouth.
>with a slurp, she pulls off of your cock and kisses the tip, grinning at you.
>"Not just yet... i don't think your quite ready for that."
>before you can reply however, she swallows your cock once more, and it all becomes too much for you.
>with a shudder, and barely a whimper of warning, your cock throbs within the felines maw, sending shot after shot of your pent up seed to splat against the back of her throat.
>she moans around your cock, sucking you dry and swallowing every drop of cum you give her.
>as your mind begins to come down from it's high, she pulls off of you, gently nuzzling your balls while staring up at you.
>"Oh no Anon... I'm afraid you're gonna have to give a little more than that."
>this was going to be a long night.

>go around anthro friends house for the first time
>she tells you not to go into her closet
>don’t want to piss off the 6’6 canine so you oblige her
>go to her house a few more times, still the closet is off limits
>one time she leave you alone in her room while she gets something
>curiosity gets the better of you and you peak inside the closet
>a body pillow falls out
>a photo of you is on it
>not like a photo she’s taped to it but a photo has been printed into the pillow case itself
>don’t even know where the photo is from, she must have taken it herself
>hot breath ruffles your hair from above and behind you
“I told you not to open the closet”

>average size of 6'07" and 331.8 lbs.
>can be bigger
>canonically very affectionate towards their trainers want8ng hugs
>covered in slime
>actual slugs produce a thicker slime when mating to stick together when fucking
>so imagine getting sort of glued to a goodra during sex and being stuck like that for a while at her mercy
>if she wants to keep fucking you or walk around in public with you stuck to her you literally can't stop her

>shellshocked survivor of Anthrostate war
>spend months in an internment camp in the middle of nowbere
>finally herded into a chapel where a wolf lady twice your size marries you
>now you wear a collar and she calls you "cuddle boy"
>you saw your friends die

>henchman for anthro villain
>makes you all kinds of mandatory costumes to wear with some being lewder than others

"Boss, I don't think I understand your reasoning here-"
>You're Anon, the right-hand goon of the supervillain 'Hiyeena'; a woman that was not only genetically spliced with Hyena DNA, but also had her physical attributes cranked up to superman-levels.
>Super strength, super speed, super invulnerability, super breath - you get it. She's a ridiculously powerful lady.
>You. . . Had no powers. Sure, you were the most skilled henchman in your bosses' arsenal, so much so that you were feared among the ranks of other henchman.
>You were still just a henchman though. No superpowers, or bullshit magic tricks.
>All you had was the power of hitting things.
>So you had no idea why Hiyeena was trying to get you to wear a Hyena-print speedo and tank top.
>"It's so you don't blend in with all of the 'normal' henchies, ya dope! Now, just put it on or I'll slice ya up!"
>You've been going at this for what has felt like hours, so you finally relent.
"Fine. Just let me go change."
>"No. . . Do it here."
>Damn it, not again.
>With a deep sigh, you roll your eyes before beginning to take off your shirt.
>"Yeah. . . Nice and slow. Give mama a show. . ."
"Jesus fucking Christ, boss."

>unbeknownst to you, she's been weening off her medication over the last week
>when suddenly, a news flash from your phone
>an entire family, whom were living in your county, found hacked to pieces
>some of the pieces are missing and their door was wide open
>a cold sweat creeps along the length of your spine as you park and exit your car
>eager to find the trusting, if difficult safety of your large awoo wife
>and a wide open door

>friend tells you he's gonna set you up with this cougar he knows
>hell yeah
>you love MILFs
>get to the bar, waiting for your date when a claw taps your shoulder
>college age mountain lion greets you
>"Hey! I'm you're date for tonight!"
>you're disappointed
>but try to have a fun time
>end of the night, at her door, you're about to say goodbye when she grabs you and digs her claws into your shoulders
>"I know you really wanted a MILF, humie. Let's go inside and make that happen."

>blind bitch grabs junk and whispers things Ike she knows you don't have a girl at home
>Report her for sexual assault because this isn't the first time
>Get sued by blind bitch for liable and hurtful comments
>Goes as expected in the anthrostate
>Punishment for discrimination is either fined half your pay for a year or become her seeing eye human
>Your lawyer says to swallow pride and help
>As you help her through the day, she gets even more handsier, whispering she can smell when you've jacked off or not

>A dragon gf will never put you in chains and keep you as a pet
>She will never have you kiss her butt every day while you tell her how her scales are so beautiful and her claws are so sharp
>She will never lazily lounge on her pile of riches while you satisfy her ego

>Anon stepped out of the car and looked up at the 8 foot tall anthropomorphic hyena woman standing in front of him. He felt a mixture of fear and awe as he took in her long, slender body and her yellow eyes that seemed to bore into his soul.
>The woman smiled down at him and said, "Welcome, Anon. I've been expecting you." She gestured for him to come closer and he reluctantly obliged, feeling a chill run down his spine.
>The woman reached out and gently caressed his face, her long nails lightly scratching his skin. "I'm here to take you home with me," she said softly. "I'm going to groom you, and you'll be mine forever."
>Anon's heart raced as he tried to process what she was saying. He had no idea what she meant by "groom" or why she wanted him to go home with her, but he knew he couldn't say no. He nodded slowly, feeling like he was in a trance.
>The woman smiled and said, "Good. Now let's go." She took his hand and led him away, her long strides making it difficult for him to keep up.
>Anon felt like he was in a dream as he followed her, feeling a strange mixture of fear and excitement. He had no idea what was going to happen next, but he was certain of one thing: his life was about to change forever.

>Be a psych wrangler at the local mental hospital
>They hired you because studies showed humans had a sort of calming effect on anthros
>And you certainly know they need all the help they can get here
>It had never been too much of a hassle
>You had lost count of how many anthros you got to take their meds just by sitting down with them, holding their hand, and stroking their arm, explaining to them why they needed to take their meds
>A couple times you managed to talk a few down from "the ledge" so to speak
>Threatening themselves with sharp objects they had made or smuggled in
>Nearly all of them would drop it and cry into your shoulder after you talked to them for a few minutes.
>Parrot, dog, rat, even a bear once
>She almost made you fall over when she nearly collapsed into your arms hysterically, but you were glad to help
>You never had any formal crisis training, so it really did seem to hinge on the "calming effect" of humans on anthros
>Clocking in, you tried to make small talk with your workers on this dreary, rainy day, but noticed everyone was on edge
>No one would look directly at you and tried to focus on doing other things
>Odd
>From around a corner you saw your boss, a short, no-nonsense bunny, hustling over to you, a look of concern on her face
>"Anon, I don't know how to tell you this but we really need your help, right now. It's dire."
>You chuckled
"What, did the skunk in 11-A refuse to shower again unless I gave her a sponge bath again?"
>She didn't laugh at your joke
>Oh no
>"Professor Jiggly got loose again."
>As you passed through the halls trying to keep up with your boss, you saw anthros here for all sorts of reasons, the flickering lights adding to the tension of the situation
>Suicide attempts, depression, addiction, schizophrenia, but one reason stood out in particular
>"Going Feral"
>While anthros evolved from their less intelligent and articulate brethren thousands of years ago, there had been extremely rare instances of anthros “returning” to their primal states
>You’re not talking about the instance here and there of an anthro girlfriend in heat acting on her more base instincts in pursuit of dick, perhaps leaving a few claw marks on whoever was unfortunate enough to be around her while in possession of a penis
>You’re talking about fully returning to feral actions
>It was never a huge deal safety-wise when it happened to a prey anthro, as for rodents, most birds, deer, horses, they’d normally just run from whatever they perceived to be a threat and hide
>They were mostly just a threat to themselves because of their potential escape routes being through glass windows and off of high places
>But when it was a predator, shit would get dangerous real quick
>One publicized story from a few months ago saw a retired wolf actor maul three people
>He had been kept out of the public eye by family after starting to turn, and when a new caretaker didn’t follow proper procedures, he managed to escape and was only put down after two officers were killed responding to the first reports of screams from the caretaker
>6 years ago Professor Jiggly, the Feral patient in the care of your hospital, was actually named Professor Lillian Stone
>She was a leopard who had actually been spearheading a series of research studies to try to ascertain the causes, and potential cures to the Feral sickness
>And believe it or not, your boss was one of the researchers on the project, Dr. Ares
>Professor Stone had spent much time in close proximity to patients trying to understand how exactly it afflicted them, but from what you had heard they had hit a wall
>At this point, after trying everything, there was seemingly no cure for it
>All funding died when Professor Stone herself went Feral, as politicians and grant agencies assumed that proximity to other feral subjects was what caused it and wanted no more research done to look into it
>From then on, all Feral cases were to be kept in medical facilities equipped to deal with them
>Dr. Ares took a position at the psych hospital to try to remain in close contact with Professor Stone and take care of her, as there still seemed to be a tiny bit of Stone that remembered her friend and colleague
>That didn’t mean mistakes didn’t happen, as made clear by today’s events…
>”We don’t know how she got out of her jacket, but even in her feral state, once she was out of it she was able to take off her muzzle and escape during feeding time. She injured three aides and a resident before we were able to corral her into one of the disused wings under renovation.”
“How badly were they hurt?”
>”Some pretty deep cuts, but he’ll live.”
“That isn’t very reassuring considering you want me to help. What do you even want me to do?”
>”Well…I want you to try talking to her.”
“Like Hell am I going in there! I know I have that “calming effect” on anthros but I am absolutely not sticking my neck out for her to chomp on. Why don’t you do it?”
>”I already tried! She won’t respond even to me! She seems worse now than how she was before!”
“Have you tried tranquilizer darts?”
>”Enough to take down an elephant linebacker, but she hasn’t calmed down one bit. I’m afraid of what might happen if we pump any more into her.”
>You didn’t respond, weighing the situation
>”I promise we’ll be right on the other side of the door, ready to pull you out if anything happens.”
>Eventually arriving at an overseeing room that looked into the common room of the wing through a pane of bullet proof glass, you saw her prowling around
>Her fur stood on end, unkempt brown hair flowed past her shoulders, partially obscuring her face, and her mouth seemed to be locked into a permanent snarl
>The pupil of the one eye you could see was constricted to the point of almost being invisible
>The traces of blood on her claws didn’t help either
>You felt queasy just looking at her, every single neuron in your brain was firing with one command: RUN
>Dr. Ares grabbed your hand, pulling you to look into her eyes
>”Please Anon. I know you can help her. Stone never took my research seriously, but I always believed the therapeutic effect of humans could help here. She’s still my friend, and I know she’s somewhere in there.”
>You saw tears begin to well up in her eyes
>”You know what the police will do to her if we can’t get the situation under control. Aside from losing a dear friend, if she dies, any insight we have to the Feral disease dies with her. Please.”
>You let out what was probably the longest, most defeated sigh in your life.
“Fine.”
>She began to hug and profusely thank you, but was interrupted by a loud banging noise
>Professor Stone had finally taken notice of you two in the observation room, and was making her displeasure known, repeatedly ramming all 8 feet of her hulking frame against the window
>You were glad it was bullet proof, but that wouldn’t save you once you were in
>In doing so, she made the reason her nickname was “Professor Jiggly” very clear
>Two, very large, very round reasons, in fact
>If she hasn’t been a woman of science, she could have definitely been a bikini model, damn
>About 20 minutes later, after as much mental preparation you could muster and reassurances from Dr Ares, you readied yourself to go in
>She and two aides were ready to unlock the door, close it, and lock it behind you, waiting there to pull you out if need be
>In that time, Professor Stone had retreated from the common room deeper into the wing
>You had no intention of getting more than 3 feet away from the door, so you’d try to coax her out with her voice
>Beyond that, you had no idea what you’d do. If she started to move towards you, you’d make your escape.
>You respected Dr Ares, and understood the importance of Professor Stone’s work, but it wasn’t something you wanted to die over
>The rain hitting the roof of the ward would normally be calming, but right now it was just extra unnerving noise
>”Are you ready Anon?”
“No, but when has whatever I wanted mattered?”
>”Good. I promise you’ll be safe. We’ll be right here.”
>You heard the sound of the maglock disengaging, letting them open the door just enough to slide in through a crack
>You heard the door close and re-lock
>It might as well have been your coffin lid
>The common room was well lit, but the hallway into the empty wing beyond was dark
>You obviously weren’t going to go in there, so you called out
“Professor Stone! I want to talk to you!”
>You weren’t sure if it was the content of your words that mattered, or just the sound of your voice, but it made more sense to say something rather than just screaming
“There’s a lot of scared people around here who are worried about you. No one’s upset, we just want to make sure you’re ok.”
>Beyond the edge of the lit room, you heard nothing
“Dr Ares in particular is very worried about you and your safety. Please, we need to get you back to your room!”
>Still nothing
>You glanced back to the door behind you
“Doc, I don’t think this is working, I’ve got no sight nor sound of her. Maybe the tranqs finally did their job?”
>”Try a bit more, please.”
“Fine.”
>You looked back out towards the dark hallway, absolutely convinced a stray blanket on the floor had moved while you were turned
“Uhhh, I’m sure you’re hungry, it’s almost lunch time.”
>Shit shit shit why would you say that? She almost ripped a chunk out of your coworker.
“We could get you something from the employee cafeteria if you wanted. Probably better than the nutraloaf they normally give you.”
>And with your less than inspiring words, with a crash of thunder, the lights turned off.
>It seemed the power went out to the whole hospital.
>The central air stopped
>The faint buzz of the intercom silenced
>And through the one window in the room, you saw no lights in the distance from the other wings
>Luckily though, any second now the emergency generators should kick on
>...
>You heard something crash down the hallway
>Ok, fuck this.
“Ares, open the door”
>”I don’t want to worry you, but it won’t open.”
“This is a hospital, why is it a fail-secure door and not a fail-safe?!”
>”I don’t know, but it won’t open!”
>You heard another crash down the hallway, this time closer
“Ares, I’m gonna fucking die in here. There’s not even emergency lights!”
>”They were renovating the wing!”
“Good, I’m sure they’ll note my death in the OSHA report.”
>You pulled out your phone and used it as a flashlight
>It barely had any effect
>You could just barely make out an oxygen tank down the hall that had been sent skittering down the hall away from it’s dolly
“Ares, I’m begging you, get me out of here.”
>You could hear her muffled frantic reply on the other side
>”We’re working on it! C’mon guys, pull harder!”
>The phone in your shambling hands, they reflected off of something down the hallway
>Two bright orbs floating 8 feet in the air were looking straight back at you
>They began to move towards you, now the only thing illuminated in the darkness
>She reached the threshold of the doorway and was now a mere 30 feet away from you
>Professor Stone in all her Feral glory

>imagine getting raped by her during occupation
>imagine her sneaking you into her camp tent late at night
>imagine not being able to leave because the others might catch and shoot you for 'spying'
>imagine having to lick her sweaty cunt every night
>imagine her hot stinky breath on your face while she holds your entire head in her jaws and slathers your face in wolf spit
>imagine being dragged along in the field as her personal fucktoy while her colleagues all ignore your plight
>imagine her stuffing you in a duffel bag so she can sneak you onto the ship back to the Vaterland

"feral" anthros is a fun idea to mess around with if you lean into them living/acting like normal animals and still inhabiting where each species is usually in a sort of porn world logic where getting jumped/grabbed by the feral anthros is just a common hazard of the setting

>mother earth deity who coexisted in harmony with ancient man, bearing fruits and vegetables from her body to feed every mouth in the ancient land.
>but man took her blessing for granted, and soon desired to work the land and deface nature's beauty.
>for this sin, the mother relented to the earth itself, her abundance departed, so too did seas of the generations of men.
>this parable has persisted within the oral traditions of human and anthro since the dawn of civilization.

>It's common knowledge that if you score decently on the ASVAB and are single, the Army will place you in their dog program
>Humans and anthro canines are paired together for roles such as tracking, explosive detection, patrol, search and rescue, and attack
>The reason they specifically use single men is so the anthros can form a deep bond with their handler
>Military studies had shown that the anthros performed at a higher rate of success (stronger, faster, more sensitive nose, better hearing, better dark vision, sharper aim) when they were "protecting a loved one"
>Over the the past 15 years, there was a 98% marriage rate in the program
>The Department of Defense was estatic at this figure, as it meant a next generation of applicable canines as well
>If it's decided you're going to be a part of this program, they ship you and all your fellow future dog fuckers on a plane to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas
>As the ramp drops in the back, you're faced with a line of anthro canines waiting at parade rest, tails wagging
>One by one you're directed off the plane and paired up
>It doesn't even seem to be by any standard, just whoever was standing nearest the ramp gets paired with the first dog
>You see the founder of the program and her husband visiting the base one day
>You recognized her from the photos you'd seen in the orientation classes for the program, a tall German Shepherd
>Colonel Barbara "Barb Wire" Wilson
>It had been a little over 5 decades since the photo had been taken of her recieving the Medal of Honor from President Nixon, but she still held herself with strength and pride
>Walking hand in hand with her husband, Chief Warrant Officer Scott Wilson
>The Army did not beat around the bush as to what your role as "the human" was.
>You existed merely to make your canine excel, and Col. Wilson was an amazing example of that
>In 1969 during Operation Apache Snow, Barbara and Scott were both medics working together in the same unit.
>They weren't supposed to be fraternizing with each other during their downtime (distracted soldiers and all that), but much like depictions in M*A*S*H, no one really cared as long as work got done and everyone stayed safe, no one wanted to fuck with the medics.
>Both were extremely professional by all accounts when it came to medical work
>During an advance by US and South Vietnam forces, a North Vietnamese counter attack caused a small rout in US forces.
>In the chaos, the small field hospital they were working at was overlooked and left behind, word about the retreat missing them
>They hunkered down and radioed for help, but the soonest assistance could get there was in 3 days
>The weather had turned sour (even for Vietnam), air support was impossible, and the path back would take longer as the army fought its way through newly entrenched enemy
>Most of their charges being injured themselves, the medics, doctors, nurses, and their small guard attachment, in total numbering around 150 able bodies on higher ground steeled themselves for whatever may come
>Within the first 8 hours of the defense, Scott was gravely injured by a grenade explosion
>Carted to the main tent to be taken care of himself, other soldiers and medics noted a distinct change in Barbara
>She had been bright eyed, happy-go-lucky, and generally violence averse (she only barely passed basic marksmanship)
>But after Scott's injury at the hands of the enemy, others stated Barbara had the focused gaze of a general overseeing the battlefield, no time for talk unless it had to do with the current situation
>She would hold up her hand to silence everyone around her, aim her M14 at what looked to be dense jungle, and fire a single shot
>A scream would errupt from the jungle as her round hit its target that only she could detect
>During a shift in the breeze she caught a particular smell, and redirected everyone still standing to defend the west side of their position, staving off an attack with withering fire on a position that was up until that point only lightly defended
>Several soldiers and medical personnel recalled that when they were injured, Barbara picked them up, some of them wearing nearly 60 pounds of gear, and carried them to safety
>She did not stop to eat
>She did not stop to sleep
>She barely stopped to drink
>No one was sure if she even stopped to piss or shit
>The only thing she had time for was to stare at the treeline and pop stiumlants
>During a particularly pointed attack, she grabbed an M60, an M79 grenade launcher, a bag of frag grenades and positioned herself, alone, on the wall of dirt and sandbags facing the attack
>Firing with one hand while keeping the belt feeding with another, she kept a wave of 50 enemies off for 90 minutes, stopping only to throw grenades and use the M79
>When all the ammunition and grenades had run out, she used an entrenching tool in hand to hand combat to kill the last few enemy combatants, and was seen bludgeoning the last North Vietnamese soldier to death with the M79
>When reinforces finally had arrived, they brought in a Medivac unit to evacuate the wounded
>Only when she personally carried Scott to a waiting helicopter and knew he was in safe hands, did she finally collapse from exhaustion and blood loss
>Transfered to a rear field hospital, then to Japan, the full extent of her injuries were able to be observed
>Eleven small caliber gunshot wounds
>Four various stab wounds
>Multiple defensive wounds on her wrists and lower arms from hand to hand combat
>Shrapnel and a concussion from a grenade explosion
>Broken collar bone
>Three cracked ribs
>Two broken fingers
>One paper cut
>One of the doctors working on her commented upon hearing her story, "If she was armed with only a P-38 can opener and looked down upon by God, God would be cut open like a C-Ration."
>After a long convalescence in Japan alongside Scott, they were both approached by Army doctors and scientists
>The pair were asked to participate in a study to learn how Barbara's body had gone beyond her limits, how her skills were raised in areas like marksmanship, sense of hearing, and decision making
>It went beyond mere adrenaline, something many chalked up to the bond between man and anthro
>She wasn't just protecting her comrade, she was protecting a lover, a partner in life
>And of course, the military wanted to harness that power
>About a year later, they were both invited to the White House for her Medal of Honor ceremony, it was clear her actions had gone above and beyond the call of duty for an Army medic
>The video of her pulling Scott into a deep kiss V-E Day style after recieving her medal was cute
>And when the Army stated a desire to see how they could focus this power, she offered to help run it
>Scott, understanding his role simply as a catalyst for this power, was more than happy just to work at her side
>They got married, natrually, and had 7 kids, all of whom themselves went into the military
>Like mentioned earlier, a lot of this was to help create the next generation of devoted soldiers
>And while you saw her in the hallway you of course saluted to her, but you just could not believe that this woman, with a warm smile and nod, really did all that
>It really was a power you would fear if you were on the recieving end

>"Ah. It must hurt, to be betrayed. To trust someone, only for them to hurt you."

>yes
>he may as well have shot you himself
>you hope he's dead
>like you are
>you are a dead man
>you remind yourself, and your heart goes still
>the interrogator shakes her head
>"He saved your life. The lives of the others we captured. You would have died some other day. Some other battle. Or killed yourself before our soldiers could have stopped you."

>you do not believe it
>false sympathy from the enemy
>she would not shed a tear if she stepped over your carcass on the battlefield
>there are no tears for those meant to die
>you remain quiet and collected

>help them get captured?

>no
>they are dead like you are dead
>you remain silent

>they'll kill you and dispose of your remains
>the end you have been waiting for
>if you keep holding out, it will come soon enough
>"The empress has decreed her mercy for all slave-soldiers captured alive. You'll be resettled. Reacclimated. A new life away from the war."
>you blink
>what?
>the empress's mercy?
>there is no such thing
>they are the enemy
>you are a dead man
>betraying your emotions, you make a slight shake of the head
>"Oh, you don't think so? It must seem to good to be true. But it is. A plot of land, a home of your own, a new wife to take care of you."
>once again you're in disbelief
>a home?
>a wife?
>you were not meant for such things
>you are a slave, meant to die at the word of your masters
>a dead man given purpose in war

>she knows she's getting to you
>and your interrogator smiles

>the she-wolf steps in closer, and reaches a paw out toward you

>the paw lands on top of your head, and she starts to stroke your hair

>"Isn't this better? You could have this every day, somewhere soft and safe and warm, with someone who can protect you."
>it's not real
>it's not possible
>no one will care when you die
>you are a dead man
>the she-wolf holds your face in one paw, and starts stroking your hair with the other
>absentmindedly, you note how her tail is wagging lazily while she does it
>"There's a good boy. You're more than a slave. More than a dead man."
>she definitely caught the slight gasp you make
>so she draws your head to look up in her red-shaded eyes
>"You're a person. A person with a name. Do you think you could tell me just that?"

>but your training asserts yourself for a moment and you grit your teeth
>her paws leave you as you jerk your head away from them

government has a great new policy to set in motion, abolishment of male prisons, all men now go to anthro prisons, it both calms down the wild anthros now that they have their needs met, and it helps "reform" the men, at least in theory.

Mean Clean Yeen
>Go to college
>It's a mix of anthros and humans with coed dorms
>Anthros always freaked you out a bit with how forward they were with their feelings
>You’re less than a year in and already several bulky hyenas have offered you to 'shower' with them after a few late nights spent tutoring them
>Seeing the obvious pelvis breaking that would happen after you always politely declined, much to their dismay
>Stupid, stinking, horny bastards
>Not like they would have a chance to corner you in one of the public showers anyway even after you refuse their advances, you picked one of the few dorm rooms with an integrated bathroom and shower
>All goes well for a time
>Until the water lines to your dorm break and the sink, toilet, and shower are all rendered useless
>You manage to go a couple days without showering while using public restrooms to do your business
>But eventually you gross even yourself out, so after a few hastily remembered prayers you slink down to the communal shower room in the middle of the night
>Jesus, what a stupid idea this is
>With how long it's been without showering your own scent must overpowering to sensitive anthro noses
>You open the door as a cloud of bellowing steam pours out
>Steeling your nerves you progress into the room
>Maybe it won't be so bad, it is 1 in the morning after all, maybe it's empty and someone just left the water running so that's why it's so steamy
>You walk to the center of the room and see no one, perfect
>You move under a shower head, take off your clothes, and-
>...is that poorly suppressed giggling?
>Frozen in shock, it takes all your willpower to turn your head to the direction of the giggling
>A large wave of steam clears and you finally see them
>Three bulky soaking wet yeens under one of the shower heads
>Their eyes and ears are turned toward you, lusty gazes drifting over your shamefully naked body
>The biggest one gets up and saunters over
>As she approaches you can't help but notice her well defined muscles under a taught shimmering coat, the large swinging breasts jutting out from her chest, the dark nipples almost hidden under wet slicks of fur
>But most worryingly, the wide toothy grin on her maw
>The beast reaches only a couple feet away and stops, her predatory gaze stuck on you
>”Well, well, well, if it isn’t Anon finally taking me up on the offer to shower together.”
>”S-shower together?” You meekly respond, brain still trying to decide between fight and flight
>”Of course!” She beams. “After helping me pass that calculus exam a little mutual grooming is the least I can do to repay you. From one student to another.”
>”Mutual grooming? I assure you I can take care of myself.”
>She slaps you on the back, rough paw pad on bare skin
>”I know you can!” She says with a laugh. “But among the furred kind it’s a form of bonding, of giving thanks. Isn’t that right girls?”
>She looks to her two lackeys and they shake their heads emphatically, radar dish ears bouncing around
>”So,” The alpha yeen starts, a new glint in her eye. “What do you say me and the girls help make sure you leave this shower all clean and shiny? It’ll be our gift to you, for all the classes you helped us pass this semester.”
>Okay let’s consider your options
>Accept, get raped
>Decline, get raped
>Run away, definitely get raped
>Ah hell, might as well try make sure the yeens aren’t in a bad mood when they pound you to dust
>”S-sure. Of course. I can’t wait. Let’s get started.” You say, a dumb confident smile on your face
>The alpha yeen backs away, smiles, and…
>Bounces on her tippy toes, hands held together in a happy balled fist
>”Girls-girls-girls! He said yes! Shower party!” She happily screams
>Huh?
>The other yeens holler in unison and run over, a basket of shampoos, conditioners, and sponges held in one of their paws
>The alpha yeen takes one of the shampoo bottles and squirts a dollop onto her paw, rubbing it into your hair
>You don’t think this is rape
>But maybe they’re playing games with you
>You stand still as a statue as the alpha yeen continues to wash your hair and the others rub your bare skin with sponges
>”This brand is really nice because of the way it smells but it can make my fur a little matte so I like to mix it up with some bearcare brand conditioner to really get a nice sheen going and then…”
>The alpha yeen continues to ramble on about fur care products and paw pad lotions as you just kind of zone out, fur and steam filling your vision as your mind enters a protective coma
>Eventually your brain registers that your skin of free of sponges and shampoo
>Coming out of a daze you see the alpha yeen turn off the shower head and hand you a towel
>You wrap it around your waist and wonder what the hell just happened
>”Damn Anon, don’t you just love the water? It’s so nice and relaxing, especially for species used to the desert like me and the girls. We just love showers, and baths, and nice swims in the pool. Did we do a good job with the mutual grooming?” She asks
>You look down
>Jesus, your skin is practically glowing and your scalp feels heavenly, you’ve never felt cleaner
>”Uhhh, ya. You all did an excellent job.”
>”Thanks!” She replies, a genuine smile on her face. “Just let us know if you want any more grooming sessions with us.”
>”…Okay.” You respond with a cautious smile
>She smiles back and packs up her things
>But just before her and the other yeens leave she looks over her shoulder at you
>”Just one thing Anon! That was supposed to be a ‘mutual’ grooming session. We’ll let you slack off this time but we expect you to do your part after this!” She winks and leaves the shower room, cackling the entire way
>Gulp
>After dressing yourself you walk back to your dorm
>There’s a few new notifications on your labtop
>All your tutoring sessions for the rest of the semester are booked
>By three very familiar yeens
>Horny bastards

>Day 65: It has been over two months since I went on an impromptu camping trip deep in the woods and awoke one night in a cave with this large bear woman. After several fruitless attempts to escape her den I have learned she now views me as some sort of forced companion. With fall nearing she has taken great pains to ensure we are both well fed with a steady diet of salmon and fruit, her body has gained a great deal of weight in the last few weeks. I assume this is preparation for hibernation. I must escape before then or risk staying the winter trapped in her den.
>Day 68: I was only half right about her weight gain being related to hibernation. I've seen the lusty look in this beasts's cold lifeless eyes and felt the growing heat coming from her drooling axe wound, only now do I realize that her extra weight is also to ensure she can carry a litter of cubs to term. Our cubs to term. The foul beast intends to mate with me. I must escape.
>Day 70: I have gained her trust with several offerings of salmon and berries and she now lets me exit the cave for short periods of time. She's just gorged herself on the most recent offering and is now in a deep slumber in her cave. I intend to sneak out in the next few minutes and make it far enough to where the foul animal can't track me. Wish me luck!

>Day 341: Today I welcomed the four newest additions of our beautiful family into this world. Deep in our underground home my wife beckoned me with a needy roar and I came to her aid bearing torchlight. She lay on her back surrounded by loose hides, her rounded belly filled with new life. I saw the look in her shining emerald eyes and knew the time had come. A great deal of panicking later and I saw my wife grooming four squirming newborns, their wet furry forms lovingly held to her chest. A short while later she let me hold them and a prideful joy filled my chest. One of them seems to have my eyes, I think I shall name her Joyce.

It occurs to me that having a big size difference with your big wife means you have to live in a house made for bigger people. Even if she's just 8'5", if you're 6'5" it's more like being 4'5" when you're trying to cook in the kitchen. And I like dragons pushing 10 feet and over. I knew things had to be bigger, like beds and couches while doing the scenes with the big gf. But then I thought about what the house would be like if you're just walking through it and trying to do things.

you're damned to being seen as cute no matter what you do
>need a booster chair to sit at the big species sized tables

>You eventually buy several step ladders for the house, one of which is just to make it into bed with her without her having to help you

>You were out with someone again.
>You aren't being faithful to your sister.
>Your faithful sister.
>Your hardworking mother told you both never to leave each other's side.
>Your mother told you were going to be together forever.
>Your mother made you play together.
>Eat together.
>Sleep together.
>You were unfaithful to your sister.
>You will be punished for disrespecting mother and dear sister.

>So, this is how it ends.
>Tied up, beaten, stripped down to your boxers, and shoved into the trunk of a convertible.
>To be honest, you sort of expected this.
>Not because you're a problematic person- if anything, you're a very typical individual. Just some mild-mannered blue collar factory worker.
>Shit, your head hurts. That last hit your assailant got on you was not gentle, and that toolbox of what you could only hope was carpentry tools was rattling around and giving you a migraine.
>You just wanted to go to the store, and pick up some groceries, maybe even head to the hardware store for a new file.
>Man, if you had that file right now then you could make short work of these ropes. Too bad the lady that got you did it in the grocery store parking lot.
>. . .
>Hold on, moron- there's a toolbox right beside you, maybe if you could- no, no wait, hold on- nevermind, it's padlocked.
>So much for that plan.
>Unceremoniously, the car comes to a screeching halt- sending you tumbling forward and slamming into the wall of the trunk space.
>Shit, looks like this was it.
>You could hear what could have been a light argument in the front seat, but considering you could only hear one muffled voice it must have been over the phone.
>". . .eah, I just got the g. . . . . he hell do you mean I d. . . . . Then who the h. . . "
>The sound of a door opening and closing was followed by a pair of stilettos walking their way to the back.
>Your stomach turned as the mental image of the last thing you ever see being the barrel of a handgun had become much more likely over the last hour.
>The trunk pops open, and there she is.
>Your assailant was a bunny woman dressed to the nines in pristine businesses wear, her face still decorated with a few streaks of your blood.
>"Hey," she greets you like she was your highschool buddy. "So, uh, there's been a mix up. Who the hell are you?"
>You'd answer, but there was sort of one glaring issue with that.
>"Oh, right. The handkerchief gag."
>You managed to refrain from biting the woman while she removed the black handkerchief from around your mouth, and pulled out the sock she stuffed in there to muffle any of your screams.
>She speaks over your coughing gasps for clean air. Those socks couldn't have been clean.
>"Okay, so spill it. Who the hell are you?"
"John Doe."
>She freezes, taking a second to look over you with what you could only guess was intrigue before slamming shut the trunk.
>You could have sworn that you heard the woman uttering something along the lines of 'no fucking way' before things went silent once again.
>The trunk opens once more, albeit a bit quicker than last time, to the same stone-faced rabbit.
>"The Doe Family, as in 'The Doe Family Diner?"
"Y. . .yeah? I own the place."
>There's a slight hint of some sort of panic in the woman's eyes as she stared down at you before nearly slamming the trunk shut on you.
>"Oh, fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuuuuuuck-" her voices trailed back to what could only be expected to be the front seat.
>Another moment of silence passed before she spoke again.
>"Oka. . . . ay have kidna. . . . . client's brot. . ."
>What followed had to be the most panicked one-sided attempt to cover ones ass you had ever heard followed by an all too audible 'fix it.'
>It was only moments later before the trunk flung open once more to a slightly less calm rabbit woman.
>"We need to get married so I don't get my head blown off in the next forty-five seconds."
>At first you thought she was kidding, but that little red dot on the side of her head said otherwise. . .
"O-okay."
>-and just like that she shoved a ring on your hand and hoisted you up by your collar before giving you what was the most intense make-out session of your life before whipping out your cellphone and sticking it up to your ear.
>"Your sister will answer after the fourth ring. Speak calmly, and like you normally would. Tell her you are getting married to a woman named Carrie Jack, and we'll both make it out alive."
>Before you could even respond, your sister answered.
>"Hey, John! I wasn't expecting a call from you. Is everything alright?"
>The sheer intensity of the situation left you feeling, but you proceeded when looking into the rabbits intense yet pleading eyes.
"O-oh yeah, everything's good, Jane. Great, even! I was wanting to check up on you today, something told me that you'd want me to- gut feeling, you know?"
>There was a pause on the other end.
>"Well, chalk another point on that scoreboard for you, John. I don't know how you always know, but if I'm not just glad that you do."
>The rabbit motions for you to hurry, a second red dot tracing up the side of her head and stopping on her jawline.
>"Look, I'm a bit busy right now. Could you call back later?"
>Now or never, it seems.
"Oh, well, I'm not gonna lie, sis. I do have some news for you. . . I'm getting hitched, and to a pretty lady- if you'd believe it!"
>You put on your most energetic voice, but your eyes are still on those dots tracing around the woman's head.
>All the while, the other end of the line has gone dead quiet.
>"Oh? What's she like? Who is this woman who thinks she's good enough for my baby brother?"
>You've. . . Never heard Jane talk like this before. It was unnerving.
>Still, you continued.
"Oh, she's great Janey! Her name is Carrie. Carrie Jack. I met her while getting groceries today, and if she isn't drop-dead gorgeous!"
>"How did you two just happen to meet?"
>There was little to no gap between where your words ended and hers began.
>Time to fudge the truth a bit. . .
"Well, there was a bit of trouble at the store today. Someone came up and roughed me up a bit. Big guy, about my size-"
>"Large scar on the left side of their face?"
"Yeah, how'd you know?"
>". . . I can have my own gut feelings, sometimes. So this young heroine swooped in and saved my brother, I'll have to reward them if they're my new in-law."
>The glint of the gold band around your finger shined in your peripheral.
"Yeah, she was so sure that she met her perfect match that she's already slipped the ring on my finger. I didn't even have time to react."
>A second silence.
>"Well then, I'll be sure to make the wedding day a beautiful one. It's on me."
>This sounded like a good place to wrap this up.
>"-And one last thing. Put me on speaker. I'd like to have a word with this 'lucky rabbit'."
>You don't recall saying that she was a rabbit, but before you could speak the woman already put your sister on speaker.
"Ha ha, okay- you're on."
>A sour feeling made itself comfortable in your gut.
>"You're a very lucky young lady. I'm sure that I don't need to tell you just how much family means to me, and I'd do absolutely anything for it; especially my little brother who is the reason I am where I am today."
>There was that tone again. Honest, but there was a hostility behind it.
>"He's pulled me out of the brink of bankruptcy time after time and never asked for a cent back. He has to be one of the last people on this earth to have a heart of pure gold-"
>You were about to interject, but Jane continued.
"-so if you break his heart, I'm tearing yours right out of your chest."
>'click.'
>The two of you were left frozen in place, you out of shock and the woman you could only guess was named 'Carrie Jack's because of. . . Something else.
>It looked like fear, but that wasn't the only thing in that intense expression.
>All the while, she turned her head so that the dots tracked up her skull to the center of her forehead.
>It was like she knew where they were coming from.
>-and just like that the dots vanished- Leaving the two of you alone in what you now note to be an empty plot the countryside- an ominous six-footer hole sitting beside the car.

>offer given to date real anthro girl
>context is more or less how you wish it to be, no matter if she's the only anthro in the world or anthros become real
>She will also be just how you wish her to be on a subconscious level. You will have chemistry together no matter what
>She will also have physical attributes as you wish; species, height, fur etc
>However

>The dragon reads your mind and finds out your ability and grins wickedly
>Turns out Beastmaster not only means you could control monsters weaker than you but if you were gifted the ability by the gods it means you have the ability to mate with said monsters thanks to the lv 5 monster breeder to make stronger creatures

>Be a gun slinging outlaw, every sheriffs you face either lost there hand or the bridge of their noses
>After spending most of the loot from banks, luck seemed to favor you as a gun show was coming to the next town. That means your skill won't be out of place if you win first in the competition
>Spending a day with the travelers to gain their scent, you strut your stuff as you win a majority of the competitions getting the townspeople cheering
>But all that changed when Billy Goat Kid, a person you hate as he killed children and innocent people. You only killed those who shot first.
>Seeing everyone scattered, an anthro snake in typical sheriffs clothing face him down. Not wanting to see anyone else shot, hiding behind a corner you aim and shot him in his false eye. Everyone was shocked as he when down like a sack of potatoes
>Staying to not cause suspicion, you planned on leaving alongside the traveling gun show
>Going to the bar, the sheriff meets you and your surprised that it's a female. She commends on your gunslinging skills and buys drinks
>A few shots in, she reveals that she hired the gun show to come to lure out Billy. You tell her that you job was to swindle the participants out of their money claiming to be part of the show.
>Not liking the snake's smile, you realize that the "gun show" story was fake as the manager walked past in traditional clothing.
>She gives you two options, stay and cooperate and she'll put in a good word or run and she'll decide if your worth catching
>After running all night, you start feeling queasy and fall. Feeling everything from the sun burn you face to the sweat on your forehead, you hear familiar boots.
"What to do with you? Turn you in collect that bounty or have that gunsling skill be nice for our children would have?"
>Feeling her hands go down your pants thanks to the posion making youhave an erection that was driving you crazy. You realize like last night you had no choice.

>Be depressed Anon
>Your life has been a pile of shit for quite a while, and you finally decide to put an end to it all
>You take a quick drive to the closest bridge, a few hours before dawn to minimize the chances of anyone, nocturnal or diurnal, to intervene
>As you stand on the edge, trying to build up the conviction to take last step you notice something on the back of your neck
>You instinctively turned your head to get eye to eye with a big cat anthro
>Her grey stary eyes giving you the jump scare you needed
>But you are quickly grabbed by the shoulders before you can fall to the valley bellow
>“Hi!”
>You don’t know what you expected, but definitely not such energetic feminine voice
>“H-hi…”
>“Just to confirm… Are you with anyone?”
“No…”
>She turned her face to the sky
>“DOES ANYONE WANTS HIM OR HIS LIFE!”
“What?”
>She turned her head to one side, then the other as if she really expected an answer
>“NO ONE?!”
>Before you were able to process what was happening, she screamed “MINE!”, threw you over her shoulder and started running

Here's an idea I had as an alternative to an anthrostate setting where not only the urban vermin are mutated into a more humanoid form but they gain special powers as well making them more dangerous.
>rats have strong teeth capable of chewing through metal and concrete
>mice form a hivemind and breed really fast
>possums can regenerate quickly from wounds and even missing limbs
>skunks spray a caustic liquid which melts things but still stinks
>raccoons form a symbiotic relationship with a mutated rabies virus that turns anything they bite into zombies
>squirrels have electric organs that allow them to generate electricity
>cats have a paralysing venom in their saliva which they apply to their claws
>dogs a bio-engineered weapons which each breed having different abilities
This is all I've thought of so far.

>You open the door to the greenhouse and see the sow tending to a few plants
>God, you hated that overgrown slab of bacon with her dirt covered fur and yellow tusks jutting out from her muzzle
>In fact you hated most of the anthro teachers
>They always stank, and looked ugly, and gave the other furred students preferential treatment!

>You quickly put on a neutral face and blunt your growing anger
>”It’s not about that. I have a question regarding extending the effective length of a potion’s effects. Perhaps with some kind of herb?”
>She suddenly stops what she’s doing and looks up to you, a curious look in her eye
>”And what, pray tell, is the purpose of this potion?”
>You nervously clear some hair out of your eye and stammer a quick lie
>”I-it’s for a focus enhancing potion. To help me study. For final exams.”
>The boar places her hand son her hips
>”You want to extend the effects of a mind altering potion?” She lets out a hearty laugh before continuing. “You’re hardly the first student to ask me a question like that! Devious little girl!”
>She continues chuckling before you decide to speak again
>”Well do you have something to help me or not?!” You simmer, stamping your foot down
>The boar stops laughing and puts a soil covered hand up to her chin, a strange glint in her beady little eyes
>”Well…I may have some esoteric piece of knowledge that could help you in your quest. But it’ll cost you.”
>”Cost me what?”
>”Let’s just say that payment will be discussed at a…later date.” She says, smiling
>Ah hell, you’re failing her class anyway, not like there’s much she could take away from you at this point
>”Sure. So what do I have to do to extend the length of the lov- *ahem* focus enhancing potion?”
>”Well it’s very simple. Find a lock of mistletoe, grind it up to a fine powder, then mix it in with the other ingredients while it’s boiling. It’ll make increase the potion’s length by a factor of ten.”
>”That’s it? That’s all I have to do?”
>She shakes her head
>”Yes, that’s it. I’ll let you know when I want payment for this information. Until then, goodbye my furless little student.”
>You practically jump with joy as you leave the greenhouse, the enrapturing of Michael is at hand!
>Just a few days later you brew another batch of the potion, this time with ground up mistletoe mixed in
>You bide your time and wait for the perfect opportunity to strike, eventually mustering up the courage to make your move at the next communal breakfast, ideally as he’s walking up to a table so the potion is the first thing he’s had to drink
>It’s supposed to make the effects even stronger, or so you’ve read
>As casually as possible you sneak up behind Michael as he nears the dining hall, spiked glass of punch hidden under your robes
>With a deep breath you finally tap him on the shoulder and you both stop in the middle of the hallway
>"Hey Michael! Check out this new drink me and the girls cooked up! It's got sun sugar, sweet pine fruit, yellow mushfruit extract, and a hint of mint. It tastes amazing, trust me!"
>He takes the glass, sniffs it a few times, shrugs, and finally takes a big long sip
>Heh, heh, heh, now the first person he makes eye with he'll head over heels for!
>He lowers the glass from his lips and-
>Suddenly you smell moist dirt and someone shoves you to the side with her plushy hip
>"Hello Anon. I just wanted to remind you that your make up test in herbology is today. Meet me in the greenhouse at five pm sharp and we'll begin. I'm free the rest of the afternoon so if you want some personal tutoring I'm available."
>I look to the asshole that pushed me aside and it's Ms. Boarington, the yellow tusked sow is ruining my plans!
>NO-NO-NO-NO!
>Before I have a chance to get back in front of Anon he's already looking her in the eye, the effects of the potion taking affect as he stares at her dreamily
>"Huh?" He slurs, clearly out of his mind
>"Meet me in the greenhouse at five. Then we'll begin." She says
>Anon begins shaking his head emphatically
>"Yes ma'am, anything for you Ms. Boarington. I'll be there at five sharp! Yes ma'am. Absolutely!"
>"Excellent. I may even bring over some of my homemade roasted griffon thighs so you'll have something to munch on this afternoon. I know how hungry you students tend to get with your late night study sessions."
>"That sounds great Ms. Boarington! I would love nothing more than to spend this afternoon with a couple of your meaty thighs." He says, not even noticing the innuendo
>A devious smirk appears on her lips
>”Glad to hear it Michael.” She suddenly turns to me. “Oh, well if it isn’t my star pupil. Remember that little deal we had earlier? You can consider your debt paid. And do remember to study up for the next test, you might manage to squeak by with a C- if you really batten down the hatches and spend the several nights studying. Ideally starting with this one.”
>You can’t even manage to respond with your head so full of anger at the foul animal in front of you
>”I’ll see you this afternoon Michael.” She says, a clawed digit gliding under his chin
>His eyes go half lidded at the physical contact and a quiet moan escapes his lips
>Ms. Boarington then walks away, a confident sway in her hips as the steady clop of hooves on stone fades away
>I watch her depart with an impotent rage
>Oh I'm going to make bacon from your fat fucking hips you overgrown farm animal you’re just like all the other furry fucking assholes in this goddamn school I'm going to learn a killing spell and go on a goddamn-
>Michaels head suddenly falls onto your shoulder
>”Damn, is she beautiful or what? What a woman, those tusks and hooves…damn…” He swoons
>My head slowly turns towards his with a disgusted frown
>”Ewww!” I shout and throw him against the wall
>He gets up on unsteady feet and I stomp away
>Fucking overgrown slab of bacon

>elden ring, but a lot enemies are made into more anthro animal women
>getting pinned and bounced on by anthro versions of those kangaroo mice things
>being swarmed by bat anthros at night
>roving rape gangs of beastwomen that come in several sizes from small goblins, the big chieftains, and the huge beastmen queens
>wolf women dropping out of the sky onto the tarnished
>big dragon mommies around the lands looking to snu snu
>rune bear anthros that are gonna crush the tarnished's pelvis
>spirit summons are replaced with various beast women that except payment for aid in forms of fucking the tarnished
>etc

>covid happens, but anthros are immune
>forces humies to stay indoors
>which means those living with anthros basically become house husbands since they have to stay indoors
>so they end up cooking, cleaning, and such around the house/apartment they share
>also become much more affectionate towards the anthro women since they're all they have for physical contact/interactions now
>humies living by themselves keep bugging their anthro friend(s) to visit or even suggest moving in with them since they're starved for company
>becoming more accepting of physical contact and affection displays because the humie boys only have the anthros around and the constant in home interactions makes them more used to it
>even end up missing their anthro's scent which leads to embarrassing situations like the anthro coming home to see her humie wearing one of her hoodies/sweaters that are oversized on him

>positive covid test
>call in sick to work
>anthro manager answers
>"Yeah, I got covid. Feeling crappy. I'll have to take the week."
>boss doesn't respond
>hear the receiver on the other end hit the ground
>you shrug and hang up
>lay in bed feeling sick and tired
>five minutes later, your boss is kicking in your door with an industrial pot of chicken soup in her arms

>Get in minor accident
>Temporarily blinded
>Doctors assure you yor vision will return, but you need to spend a few weeks with your eyes bandaged closed
>You can still work, a lot of your recent stuff has been advising on existing projects, so you only need to sit in on meetings
>All the dog anthros at work practically fight to be your seeing eye dog in the meantime
>They get to hold your hand as they pick you up at your apartment
>Commute with you
>Walk with you around the office
>Help explain any important charts or graph visuals at meetings
>Read documents to you
>And bring you home at the end of the day
>This went so far up the chain that even a c-suite level collie insisted on coming down during a gap in the companion schedule to read you the menu of the catered lunch one day
>You had to insist though you didn't need help once you were home, and were perfectly capable of taking care of yourself

>anon with YEENED fetish goes into the yeen neighborhood to try and get raped
>gets increasingly blueballed when the yeens aren't like in the porn he watches and offer to help him instead.
>he leaves, dejected that his YEENED fantasies go unfulfilled
>gets raped by ziggers on the walk home

>Try to woo the yeen with a day at the new indoor water park.
>They have everything, including a sauna and a bar.
>She asks you if you can drive her there, because she won't be able to even walk anymore once the day is over.
>Oh yeah!
>You just have to get YEENED once she's drunk.
>Arrive at the water park.
>Before you can even suggest what to do together she darts off and jumps into the nearest pool.
>Essentially disappears in a wall of frantic water splashes.
>You decide to wait until she comes back out before you invite her to the bar.
>The next few hours are spent just looking at her zipping from one attraction to the next and just taking breaks to splash in the pool again.
>You trail her to spend time with her, but aside from the rides on the slides to see who gets down faster, she is mostly focused on just having fun with the water.
>By the time the park closes she's completely spent and barely manages to drag herself back to your car.
>Once she sits down in her seat, she instantly falls asleep.
>The only thing getting YEENED tonight are your eardrums with her loud snoring.

>you want to go home
>you hate it here
>the club is so loud
>and crowded
>and there are too many bright flashing lights
>the whole place is designed to give you a headache
>why did you let yourself get dragged here?
>all your friends are off dancing or drinking or both
>you don't even like alcohol!
>and you dance like an epileptic puppet with half the strings cut off
>you sip despondently from your glass of water and turn in your barstool to look over the crowd
>a healthy mix of men and women, human and anthro alike, all having the times of their lives
>as you scan over the room, your eyes run over another person who doesn't look like they belong
>sat alone in a booth on the other end of the dance floor is a cougar
>that is, a mountain lion woman
>who happens to be notably older than most of the crowd here
>not that she's old and gray
>far from it
>but she looks to have a good decade and a half on you and all the others in the club
>and have the proportions for a cougar
>wide hips with plenty of cushioning and thick, pillowy thighs to match
>breasts that nearly spill out of the slinky black dress onto the table in front of her
>she plays with her hair, bright and shiny blond that compliments her tawny fur, twisting it in her finger
>and her eyes--
>oh shit she's looking at you
>how long have you been staring?
>look away, but not too fast so it doesn't look like you've been caught!
>you jerk your head down to stare at the floor between your feet
>real subtle
>the music goes on thumping in your ears as you inspect the floor tiles
>you maintain that position for another minute before looking up again
>and when you look up, it's right back at the cougar
>who's still staring at you
>eyes widening when you make eye contact
>and her muzzle curls in a sly grin that shows off her fangs
>dumbass!
>she's probably laughing at you
>you turn away again, this time all the way around
>if you had any taste for alcohol you'd be drowning your awkwardness in it by now
>a minute later, you feel a tap on your shoulder
>you turn around to find the source of it, but no one’s there
>then you hear giggling beside you
>a sweet laugh that seems to cut through the noise of the club
>you spin about again, making a full 360, to see the cougar sitting on the barstool beside you
>holding a paw over her muzzle as she titters
>"Oh! Goodness that trick never works! Didn't mean to startle you hon."
>you blink
>then check behind you to make sure she's not talking to someone else
"Uh..."
>that just makes her laugh more
>"Stunned by the sight of me? You certainly seemed so looking at my from across the room."
>you are stunned
>shocked this beautiful anthro is even talking to you
>what do you say?
>you have to say something!
"It's just you're uh...old."
>fuck
>dumb
>you shake your head quickly
"No! Not--not old. Just that you don't belong. Here. Cause you're uh, mature. And like, not dancing?"
>smooth moves
>thankfully she doesn't seem to offended
>quite the opposite
>she suppresses another laugh and nods her head
>"I must stick out like a sore thumb, an old cougar at the club all on her own."
>you wave your hands, trying to waylay any offense you might have caused
"No! Not at all! Just like, you seem too good for this crowd. Like uh, you know, just not where I'd find a beautiful woman like you."
>that really sets her off
>peals of melodious laughter that makes your heart flutter
>she leans forward to rest a paw on your thigh
>her low neckline showing off even more cleavage with the motion
>makes your heart flutter even more
>"Oh! Aren't you a charmer! Looks like you're right where you belong. Handsome young stud like you should be out on the dance floor, sexy little thing on his arm."
>she doesn't take her paw from your thigh
>you laugh nervously
"Oh no! I'm not--That's too kind. I'm not uh, not--"
>you clear your throat and try to reorient
"That is, I'm just here with friends."
>the cougar peaks an eyebrow, then looks around theatrically
>"And where are your friends now?"
>you cringe
>you've been sitting alone at the bar basically since you got in here
>all your friends dancing or drinking or doing whatever it is people do at clubs
"Oh, you know, they're around. Just uh, went dancing. And having some drinks. I think I see Jack..."
>your giraffe friend is hard to miss, standing a head taller than the crowd at all times
>he's yelling in some girls ear at the bar
>probably about baseball statistics
>"Oh, I know how it is. All the girls at the office want to come here and have their fun. No time to take it slow for the old lady."
>you frown
>shouldn't be talking like that
"You're not an old lady."
>the cougar giggles
>and your wandering eyes can't help be drawn to her chest as it jiggles with the motion
>goddamn
>how is her dress even holding them in?
>"Oh it's okay dear, just a little joking! I still have a little life in me. Chatting with a handsome boy like you certainly makes me feel younger."
>the paw on your thigh works upward
>and she licks her chops
>oh god
>what do you do?
>you stammer
"Th-thank you miss, uh--"
>she shushes you
>"You can call me Rachel dear."
>you nod
"Anon."
>Rachel nods her head
>"Well, Anon, it is my pleasure to meet you."
>her voice rumbles when she says pleasure
>in fact, she keeps rumbling as she continues
>"Why do you come back to my booth with me sweetie? It'll be easier to talk there."
>you glance over at John
"You know, uh maybe--"
>her other paw snatches your wrist and she pulls you out of your seat
>"Excellent. Come on hon, I don't want to lose you in the crowd."
>that's impossible, as the moment she's alongside you, she's slipped an arm around your back and tugged you by the hips into her side
>she's taller than you by a good foot and a half
>so your head is pressed into the bare fur, pillowed by a heavy breast
>you can feel her rumbling as she marches you across the dance floor
>Rachel only lets you go when you reach her booth
>her tails whaps against your ass as you step away, but when you turn about to give her a look, she just giggles and shrugs
>"Sorry hon! Has a mind of its own sometimes."
>you doubt that
>but you don't want to be rude and hurt her feelings
>you climb up into the booth seating, a little to tall for your feet to reach the floor, and look back to your cougar companion
>she's spun about, tail high in the air, as she leans forward dramatically to plant her ample rear in the booth
>letting you see how tight that dress clings to her as it contours to her ass
>pinching her at her thighs as they compress them
>that dress must be two sizes small, but it looks perfect on her
>Rachel sits on the same side, and slides close to you
>you can hear her rumbling again
>and then she keeps scooting
>closer
>and closer
>until you're pressed against the wall and hemmed in by the cougar
>then you're pinned by the cougar
>her arm goes around your shoulder, fur brushing your neck as she presses her weight into you
>"No getting away from me now, cutie~"
>she giggles again
>you can practically feel her vibrating when she's done
>oh shit!
>she's purring
>the other paw goes to your lap again, forgoing your thigh to land on the growing tent in your pants
"Um, uh..."
>you stutter
>Rachel just giggles and goes on molesting you
>"You're so cute when you're scared. I thought it was all jerks and jackasses out tonight, but just my luck, I see a lone humie looking sad and scared and lost."
>she leans closer with each word until her lips are pressed against your ear
>"I could smell your fear. Your sweat. Oh how you tried to hide it, but it's so obvious. All that fidgeting, that adorable little stammer, your scared, averted eyes. You know what that says to a predator like me?"
>you swallow
>she's still rubbing your cock through your pants, teasing your raging erection with the pads of her paws
"N-no."
>"It says 'submissive and breedable'."
>you shiver at the words
>Rachel's rough tongue runs over your ear
>then down your neck, making you shudder and mewl
>she's purring so loud you can't even hear the music over it
>or your thumping heart
>her paw strokes your shaft through your pants
>making you whimper through grit teeth
>"That's it morsel, moan for mama~"
>she gets more moans and whines from you with a teasing paw before unzipping your fly to pull her prize free
>your member is enveloped in her paw
>just like your entire body is enveloped in hers
>she jerks you off under the table
>you squirm
"Wh-what if people s-see?"
>Rachel mrowls
>then tilts your head back with her other paw
>running her rasping tongue over the tender skin of your throat
>"Hush pet. No one can see you. It's just you and mama tonight. You're coming home with me..."
>her paw squeezes around your head, swiping off the pre-cum there
>slowly, sensually, Rachel brings her paw up to her mouth and licks her fingers clean
>"Aren't you dear?"
>a tremble runs up your spine
>you lips quiver
>try as you might, you can't come up with word to answer
>Rachel goes on purring
>"Still tongue-tied? That's okay morsel..."
>the paw goes to your cock once again
>working faster
>you squirm in your seat, huffing and moaning
>suddenly your find your voice muffled between Rachel's tits
>she smells like jasmine perfume and sweet vanilla
>like home
>"If you can't make up your mind, mama will do it for you~"
>they're each bigger than your head, and more than enough to stifle your needy whimpers while she casually jerks you off
>faster and faster
>your cock twitches in her paw, dribbling pre over her furry fingers and making her pawpads slick
>you can feel her purring in your brain
>she's so warm and soft
>and she pleasures you so well
>you're going to burst right here in this club
>make an awful mess, get caught, kicked out
>arrested even?
>you can't control it
>just as your moans reach a crescendo, Rachel's paw wraps around the head of your cock
>"Cum for mama."
>you cry out
>still stifled by the cougar's enveloping embrace
>and heavenly breasts
>as she catches the first spurt in her paw
>and the next one
>and the next one
>teasing and massaging your cock head to milk you dry
>you cling to her as her teasing pawpads on your oversensitive tip drive you wild
>her other paw holds you tight
>"That's it baby, let it out. Let it all out..."
>once you've let it all out in her paw, Rachel finally lets you free
>though she has to pull you away so you can see when she brings up that paw to lick it clean once again
>she lets out a satisfied sigh when she finishes her 'meal'
>then looks at you with a self-satisfied smile
>"Good boy. Come along now, mama will take you home~"

>The End

It's noteworthy that with the first encounter with a big anthro girl who is interested in you, you know nothing about her, where she came from or her goals. She easily has the power to kill you and might be luring you into some sadistic trap. This could be an actual predator trying to eat you. It would be scary, but it would feel good if you just let her drag you around, the fear slowly subsiding as she shows you that she just wants to kiss, cuddle and mate.

>1:36 AM

>better turn in before it becomes your long night too
>you turn over for one last look to see she's gotten even closer
>now setting off the light of the apartment building's security lamp
>she's not a dog
>her fur, damp and drenched to the skin, is still spotted

>she smacks her palm against the glass again
>THUMP
>then again
>she manages to contain her laughter long enough to mouth a word
>"Open."
>you shake your head
>the laughing goes on and on
>and she smacks the glass again and again
>you snatch your phone and skitter back out of bed, managing to swing your legs out and stand despite your haste

>using her fist now
>and laughing harder

>you need something to defend yourself!
>desperately you search for something heavy enough to swing in self defense

>THUMP
>THUMP
>CRASH!
>shattered glass flies into your room and over your bed and floor
>letting in a torrent of rain
>and a torrent of maddened giggles
>blood mingles with the puddle of rain forming on your bedroom floor as the hyena starts to clamber in the window
"Stay away! Get out!"
>the hyena just goes on laughing
>cuts open up on her arms as she clambers through broken glass
>"Hehehaaahahahahohohola guapo!"
>she makes a huge smile, those massive teeth going still for a moment
>"Heeheeheehee–see I need a place to--ha! hahaha!--lie low for the--the night."
>her words are cut with manic laughter like her flesh is cut by glass
>she doesn't seem to care about her open wounds, feeling no pain
>even as she leans down to grab up a shard of glass and hold its jagged point out toward you
>"You're gonna let me stay, right?"
>you turn and bolt
>throw open the bedroom door and run down the hall for the front door
>you don’t make it two steps before a paw grabs your arm
>wrenching hard and dragging you back
>"No no no! No running away, guapo! You're my roomie now!"
>she laughs gleefully, even as she presses the shard of glass against the skin of your throat
>cold water soaks into the back of your pajamas as your held against the crazed hyena
>her laughter is loud and harsh, right next to your ear
>but cold and harsher still is the sliver of glass that threatens to open your jugular
>"Now just be-hee-hee a good little boy. No struggling."
>the hyena starts to pull you back in the bedroom when salvation arrives
>down the hall toward the kitchen, you see the red and blue flash of police lights
"Oh thank God."
>you breath the words
>earning a tight squeeze from the hyena's paw and more pressure from the glass on your skin
>"Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!"
>she hisses, even stifling her giggles
>there's a knock at your front door
>shit
>if they come in, she'll kill you
>if they don't, you'll be left with this psycho
>and then she'll definitely still kill you
>the hyena makes the choice for you
>"Go talk to them, roomie. Tell them you're fine. If you don't--"
>your skin pricks at the sensation of the tip of the glass shard
>pressed just hard enough to draw a trickle of blood
>"--they won't be quick enough to save you."
>the heat of blood on your skin is replaced by her tongue, somehow feeling even hotter, as it laps the spot clean
>you shiver at the sensation
>then she releases you and shoves you down the hall toward the front door where the officer is still knocking
>you glance back at the hyena, who muffles her laughter with a paw and shoos you with the other
>then she backs into the bedroom out of sight of the front door
>when you open it, you're greeted by a doberman in a police uniform
>he looks miserably soaked, but suitably stern
>"Good evening sir. I'm sorry to disturb you, but we believe there may be a dangerous criminal in your neighborhood, and are asking residents if they’ve seen or heard anything.”
>you think of the hyena waiting just out of sight
>could she really get you before the officer stops her?
>you remember how fast she caught you out the door
>”Sir?”
>you snap your eyes back to the officer
“Oh! Sorry, tired. No. No, I haven't seen anything.”
>he hums and nods
>”Alright, well, just…”
>he trails off, sniffing the air
>your guts twist as you prepare to make a bolt
>”Sir, are you wet?”
>you blink
>then turn slightly
“Oh! Yes, I uh–”
>you try to sound casual
“You know, I left the window open when I went to bed, and then when the storm came in it all blew in.”
>the officer looks at you for a tense moment
>then shrugs it off
>"Yeah, damn storm came outta nowhere. Can't smell a damn thing out there. Anyways, you keep safe, sir. And keep those doors and windows closed and locked, you understand?"
>not like that helped you in the first place
>but you nod
"Yes officer. Keep safe."
>he turns to depart
>and something in you twinges
>you don't want to be alone with her again
>your nerve breaks
"Wait!"
>the officer stops where he is and turns back around
>but doesn't step back into the doorway
>damn it
>you throw a glance back toward the bedroom
>where you see two eyes glowing in the dark
>a glare as deadly as her makeshift knife
"What uh--what did she do? The criminal?"
>goddamn your weakness
>the officer huffs and rests his paws on his belt
>"It's pretty grisly. She's a serial rapist. Cuts up her victims too."
>the doberman turns away again and walks away
>down toward the next apartment
>before the door's even shut, there's a paw on your arm, glass at your throat, and a suppressed cackle in your ear
>"Close it, guapo."
>you let the door swing shut
>with it your chances of escaping unscathed
>you can't help but whimper when the latch clicks
>the hyena reaches and locks it
>"Hehehe, can't be too careful!"
>she takes your arm and starts to drag you back down the hallway
>past your bedroom where the storm still pours rain into your broken window
>and toward the unlit living room
>"Don't worry."
>the glass is lifted from your throat
>and pressed against your cheek
>"I only cut the bad ones. You're going to keep being a good boy, aren't you?"
>you can imagine what that means
>what she'll do to you if you let her
>and what she'll do to you if you don't
>you should have ran for the officer
"I-I'll be good."
>now you have to do what she says
>say whatever she likes
>so she doesn't open you up with a shard of glass like a psychopath
>"Ohoho if that pig weren't here, guapo. I'd make you scream so loud the whole neighborhood would hear..."
>she hisses sinister promises around her usual manic giggling as she drags you into the living room and then down onto your couch
>turning you over and forcing you against the back of it so you're trapped between it and her
>and as she presses her body against yours, you feel her again
>no soaked clothes, but only damp fur
>hard nipples and soft breasts poking your back
>legs over yours
>paw starting to wander
>you feel sick
>her paw, rough pads like sandpaper and damp fur like ice against your skin, slides down your arm and over your hip
>then under the hem of your shirt to slide over your belly
>you squirm involuntarily
>and grit your teeth to try and hide your whimpering
>"Oh I would have fucked you so bad guapo."
>she bumps her hips forward to simulate the motion
>the motion accompanied by a torrent of giggles
>"Choke you til you pass out, then fuck you while you're out. Bite you all over..."
>she nibbles your shoulder
>just hard enough to break skin in a stinging facsimile of her theoretical violation
>"So you're just as bloody as I am. We'd go for hours. Until you can't breath. Until you can't think. Until you're nothing but a pile of ragged used up fuck-meat."
>she lets out a sighing laugh
>"Oh if I only had the peace and quiet..."
>the glass goes ignored, now resting lightly on your neck while she focuses all her attention on work with the other paw
>scraping your skin with blunted claws
>"They make you blunt them in the joint..."
>she presses a claw down hard in your side
>you groan and try to squirm away from it with nowhere to go
>"Can't mark my man like how I like until get them all sharp again."
>she goes on scratching your sensitive skin with blunted paws
>she rakes your belly and chest
>even scratching over your nipples
>making you hiss in pain
"God--please--"
>you bite down the words in fear of setting her off
>but she just snickers and continues molesting you
>the leg thrown over yours rubs up and down, dragging wet, dirty fur over your pajamas so you're soaked
>you shiver
>just another discomfort this hyena is forcing on you
>the groping paw moves back down over your stomach
>to start tugging at your waistband
"W-wait--"
>you squirm more
>now struggling despite your fear
>and you grab her wrist
>when the glass, presses down hard again
>you go still
>"Ahahaha! No, no guapo. You let me have my fun. Heehehe, I can go find another plaything if you're being bad!"
>god
>you almost want to let her end it
>the wretched cold and wet, the churning pit of fear and revulsion in your gut, the rough groping grasp of her paws
>and always the laugher in your ears
>chuckling, chortling, giggling, cackling
>how can you stand it?
>you grit your teeth hard
>trying to steel yourself for the pain
>ready to fight back
>but then she presses the glass down harder
>and you choke
>all the fight rushes out of you
>you can feel your pulse against the razor edge of the glass
>the hyena shakes her arm, knocking your hand free
>and plunges her paw down your pants to grip your package tight
>Ha! There it is! Hahahaaa!"
>she moans and lolls out her tongue, letting drool slide over your ear
>"I'm gonna put this down, guapo--"
>the pressure on your neck lessons just a bit to emphasize what the hyena means
>"No more squirming or fighting, or the next time I pick it up, I'll use it. Understand?"
>you don't respond
>you don't move
>she squeezes your balls and chuckles
>"Good boy. You can cry if you want, most of them do..."
>the glass finally leaves your neck for good
>her arm disappearing from your perception as she sets the shard down out of your reach
>but probably well within hers
>now with both free paws she can assault you twice-fold
>despite the cold and the terror, all the hyena's stimulation has gotten you half-mast
>something she seems to enjoy immensely as she grips your shaft and cackles
>she doesn't jerk you off so much as she squeeze and tweaks your shaft
>reveling in the pained groans she can draw out of you
>the now-free paw goes on where the other left off
>clawing at tender skin, pinching and prodding
>each sound sending her into near paroxysms of laughter
>gobs of spittle running down your face
>"Go on guapo. I know you want to cry. The big mean bitch is using you. If I could, I'd fuck you broken. So cry."
>you twitch as she squeezes your shaft with all five blunted claws
>finally forcing a sob past your lips
>but it's stifled immediately
>the hyena's hand shooting from your belly to your face and stuffing a finger in your mouth
"Ag--khh!"
>you cough and almost bite down by reflex
>just restraining yourself from ensuring your bloody end
>your captor snorts
>"Ha! There it is."
>whatever amusement she takes from this continued degradation isn't enough
>as she stuffs another finger in your mouth to spread your lips
>her pawpads are filty
>they taste of dirt and rainwater and blood
>she must have cut herself on the glass, as the irony fluid continues to leak into your mouth as she rubs her fingerpads over your tongue
>"Suck, guapo."
>the invading digits are forced against the back of your throat
>you gag at first, but then comply
>closing your lips around the digits
>your mouth starts to fill with her blood, until it gets to be too much and you're forced to swallow it down
>your stomach roils in response
>"Ooohoohoo yes. Good boy~"
>you cry silently, tears running down your cheeks
>she squeezes your junk again, settling into a rhythm of tormenting you
>exploring your mouth and prodding at your throat
>then pinching your balls or squeezing your member
>back and forth
>time passing in increments of her wandering perversions
>eventually slowing down
>until finally you manage to shut your eyes
>the molestation never stops, but you manage to acclimate to it just enough that sheer exhaustion takes you
>you fall miserably into uneasy, constantly interrupted sleep
>the next morning finds you cold and alone
>you're still damp from where the hyena draped her body over yours
>your pants are pulled down around your thighs
>and you’re tired and sore from the whole ordeal
>pale sunlight shines through the window
>you roll over on aching limbs and stand to inspect your apartment
>down the hall more sunlight spills in from where the front door was left wide open
>cold wind making you shiver
>you stumble to the bathroom
>need to shower
>clean the stench of her
>the feel of her
>the taste of her
>off of you
>you lean against the kitchen basin
>staring at the bedraggled, pale-skinned thing in the mirror
>god
>you look awful
>and you feel even worse
>you start to strip, little caring that your front door remains open for anyone to wander in
>but when you go to pull of your shirt you see something
>letters written on you in rusty-dull dried-blood red
>you lean back and look down at the words, written to be read from your perspective
>in a near illegible scrawl you read out the words that make your knees shake and guts burn in shame and fear
>'see you soon guapo'

Anthro women are instinctively drawn to a boy with unblemished skin and untainted scent. They can smell him from over a mile, their mouth starts drooling thinking about pinning him down and sinking their teeth into him. They start thinking about the blank canvas of his flesh that they're going to draw big red lines across with their claws. No matter where he goes, a big woman is slowly being drawn to him, even if it takes days. It is like a thirsty animal being drawn to an oasis in the desert.

>Be Anon, gentleman thief extrodinare
>While traveling through a village, you see quite the muscular anthro cat lady in shackles and stocks
>She had clearly been through a lot, townspeople had thrown dirt and rotting food at her throughout the day, and she was left out in the fall breeze, without a cloak or blanket
>You had never seen a more dejected look on someone
>The sun was setting, and no one seemed in any hurry to bring her inside
>This was an injustice you would not stand for
>This was a particularly anti-anthro area of the country, you believed she was in for nothing worse than petty theft
>There's a good chance she was in for nothing at all!
>Such evil men in these parts
>Once darkness covered the landscape, you would make your move
>Under the cloak of night, you made your way back into the town square
>This town was small enough that the village guard only seemed to come around once ever hour or so
>Quitely and carefully waking your damsel in distress, you picked the lock while she sat, waiting
>Once her arms and legs were free, she removed the humiliating sign hanging from her breasts, donned a blanket you provided her, and you both made your escape into your premade camp in the woods
>Once you both were settled, you started a fire and headed some food and water for her
>Sitting next to each other, you finally broke the silence
"So, from one criminal to another, what did they catch you for?"
>Finishing her food, she dropped the scraps and looked at you, the chicken seemingly not sating the hunger in her eyes.
>"Rape."

>fluffy aliens make contact
>are trying their hardest to contain their horny and not just giving into feral desires to carry off and snu snu all the unclaimed human guys walking about
>sometimes it slips through though

>First contact with the aliens is reported to be a resounding success. Despite misgivings about the alien diplomats' constant stares and heavy breathing, human dignitaries were assured that it was a perfectly natural reaction, and negotiations were proceeding well.
>The aliens have agreed to several favorable trade deals in exchange for human volunteers for a cultural exchange program.
>Quote from alien diplomat: "...I think I'll take that one with the chubby little cheeks--Oh! It's on? Ahem! Men of Earth, we have come here to come in peace and prosperity. We hope you come too."

>Time to pay taxes in the anthrostate as a single male
>Have to pay the substandard marital status fee
>Don't qualify for any procreative deductions

>Recently get hired at a new job after moving to a new town
>An anthro in her late thirties or early forties sits next to your cubicle
>She takes a liking to you
>Casually walking over for small talk during breaks, offering to share lunch items, giving you tips and impromptu training as you get acclimated
>She's very friendly, quickly becoming your favorite coworker of the bunch
>One day she casually asks if you have a gf
>You answer truthfully and in the negative, no sense playing coy with a woman out of your age range
>Suddenly she goes quiet, her ears perk up for a bit, her gaze grows predatory
>Then the next moment she's back to her happy bubbly self
>Weird, but nothing to fret over
>A couple weeks later she invites you over for dinner, apparently she's having a big birthday party and would like you in attendance
>You accept and a few days later you're walking up to her door, ringing the doorbell, the door opens and-
>You awaken chained to a large soft bed, the devious anthro standing at the front of it clad in lacy lingerie
>She goes on a long and unprompted tirade about how hard her love life has been, how unfair it is that her sisters all have families, how her biological clock is nearing it's end and how disappointed her parents are in her inability to start a family like they did
>She ends it with a remark about how the only thing that can save her at this point is the hot thick seed of a young virile male, with sperm strong enough to awaken her nearly dormant eggs and fertilize her aging womb
>And with that she leaps on top of you with wild abandon, quickly aligning herself and engulfing your cock in her silky walls
>You cum deep within her a few minutes later
>And again
>And again
>You're exhausted by the time she's done
>She gives you water and a small meal, leaving you chained to the bed
>This nightly rape goes on for several weeks
>Every night she would make you blow your load inside her and every night she would take a pregnancy test
>So far they've all been negative
>The thought that perhaps she's already past childbearing age seems to set her in a rage
>Her lovemaking gradually grows more intense, more base, more primal
>Your body is covered in new claw marks every night
>Your erection is supplemented with viagra for even longer attempted breeding sessions
>Even more weeks pass without a positive pregnancy test
>Her mental state begins to decline and you begin to worry for your safety
>During the breeding sessions she would alternate between viciously berating you for not being able to get her pregnant and desperate pleas to a higher power for children
>Then when her abuse was over she would walk to the bathroom, close the door, and take a pregnancy test
>The test is inevitably followed by several minutes of crying, sometimes soft, sometimes loud
>Then she would storm out of the bathroom and 'usually' remember to bring you dinner afterward
>All except for this night
>She's been in the bathroom longer than usual this time
>Is that good? Bad? You honestly have no idea with how erratic she's been lately
>Eventually the bathroom door opens and she walks over to you with a wide smile
>In her hand are several pregnancy tests
>She sets them down in front of you and they all display the same result
>Positive
>She waits for you to respond with a wide beaming smile
>"Does this mean...I can go now?" You cautiously ask
>She puts a paw up to her mouth and giggles
>"Anon, I don't want to raise an only child. I don't know if I'll still be fertile nine months from now but I guess we'll just have to find out, now won't we?"

>Earth is considered the bootycall center to the rest of the galaxy
>all sorts of fuzzy alien women coming here to find a nice boytoy to "abduct" onto their spaceships

>all vulnerable and asking for it
>and there's loads of them just walking around unclaimed and unguarded by their own females
>they're pretty much free for the taking
>it's like human females want all their males stolen away

>Sleeping on your waifu so often that you get insomnia if you aren't surrounded by her soft fur and pleasing scent
>The pain from your monthly claiming bite becomes cathartic, a steady reminder of the lethality of your furry protector and an assurance that you won't suffer the horrible fate of all those unclaimed guys that get cornered
>Sharpening her claws becomes a weekly ritual, you practically enter a meditative state while focusing on keeping her beautiful claws looking good and pointy
>The soft nibbles she gives when you cuddle together are so cute, her teeth feel so good against your skin
>And that growling thing she does when she's about to break your pelvis is so hot
>You just wish she wouldn't leave so many scratches on you when she was done
>But you know she doesn't mean it, after all, she apologizes then licks your wounds every time

>you feel you body ache from multiple rubber bullets and bean bag rounds
>unable to push your failing muscles any further you collapse against the forrest floor
>straining yourself, you look up into the night sky
>a brilliant flaming green beacon pushes back the dark
>a signal letting you know that your duty is done and that your charges made it far across the border
>the receiving team would now take them far away from the state and give them freedom they never knew
>it was a sight that brought you much joy every time you saw it
>but it appears this time may be the last
>the state did not know your face, but they knew what you did very well
>and now after all this time, it looks like they will finally have you
>the burning pain in your limbs left you too crippled to run
>you can hear the HPS agents in the distance closing in on you
>you close your eyes, you knew it would end this way
>you made it 25 years without assignment all the while helping others to escape the states clutches
>So much more than others have even attempted and yet it still feels not enough
>the agents are close now, you hear them call out as they spot your prone form
>surprisingly they are still gentle as they take you into custody

>Even in the daylight, she vanishes into the bush despite being a deep blue
>Yet the green of her eyes seem to illuminate themselves, segregating their lime glow from the earthy green of the shadowy bush
>Always watching, yet sinking into the blackness once the man's eyes meets the beast's
>Sometimes, she exposes herself in the harsh daylight that outlines her body-the alien form that is an uncanny marriage of the human anatomy and one of some kind of animal - a canine of sorts by the razor toothed grin she gave him
>She would then stand, exposing and slither into the forest seemingly deliberate yet with the swiftness of prey, only betrayed by her "smile" and wide, luminous eyes never faltering until the cuts of the shadows consumed her lean figure
>Not even a snap of a twig or a russle of leaves in the wake of the poltergeist's glide into the jungle, only the last strands of her bathing- thick red vines likey from a previous hunt
>A harbinger of his fate by her claws in the vague future of this unwitting traveller light-years from civilization
>Perched up on a tree on her haunches, silhouette of a vulture, she watched the alien shiver and sob by the stream
>How did prey this obtuse and oblivious survive for this long? After all, if he had the sense to look up, he'd know that it only takes a pounces to claim him.
>He will truly be entertaining for the foreseeable future. Something warm, soft, malleable, yet comically tenacious against death. Much unlike the brutish lizards that always want her head on a spear
>There will be a pen for him at the ruins, yes. But, cornering frightened prey, no matter how weak, is a gamble. Luckily, he won't take long to soften up.
>Finally, a living trophy.

this pic gave me a fun idea with /adhg/ style big anthros that are blind
>even more physically affectionate due to the blindness
>really common to have her pressing her nose onto you and just sniffing
>keeping her scent on you is also something she's really concerned with
>abuses her blindness to mess with you or do lewd things to you
>stuff like her wanting to pat down/feel you up to "see" you, but just uses it grope you a lot
>wanting to get your scent because she's blind, but shoves her nose straight for the crotch
>"accidentally" bumping into you

giant panda anthro gives me an idea
>anthros that are endangered species
>you're legally not allowed to use condoms or contraceptives when you have sex with them
>doesn't even matter if it's just a one night hook up sort of thing
>if you manage to knock one up the government will force you to stay with the anthro since they want you two making more babies
>upside is you get massive tax boons the more kids you manage to make

>Girls and boys have separate sex ed classes in school
>Boys are taught the pull out method
>Girls are taught the clinch and hold maneuver

>Be bunch of panda females
>Be incredibly difficult to please
>Male pandas are just so boring that they need to look outside their species for satisfaction
>Other furboys were better, but it's like going from eating a grain of rice a day to eating a cup of rice a day
>The disinterest in sex had resulted in pandas almost dying out
>Then some strange creatures arrived
>They were pretty cute, but the pandas were not optimistic
>Until one of the pandas stayed with one for a night
>Or several
>Her sisters were worried about her, since she never left the house in who knows how many days
>They went into the house to check on her, and what they saw was a feral beast jumping on the visitor's dick
>The man reaches out for help, but she held him down before glaring at the intruders
>"GET OUT! GET OUT! HE'S MINE, YOU HEAR ME!"
>Her family left very quickly because of the rather terrifying outburst
>But they were certain of one thing

>what the fuck is she talking about??
“Don’t swear at me boy, answer my question.”

>you get a slap across the face for that
“Hmph, close enough I suppose…now, do you see what I actually am?”

“Would you like to try that again?”

>Cat! She’s a goddamn cat!

“I’ll let you into a little secret of mine humie; I’m also a witch”

“You can do better than that”

“Mistress…Good.”

>Be human boss in a huge company

>It's practically impossible to get an anthro who won't try to seduce you in the workplace
>You figured that putting "must be submissive" in the application would be the best you can do to avoid getting raped by the hire
>She constantly falls over, showing off her butt to you
>It's annoying, but at least she usually gets her work done
>Need to talk with her about important business

>promises you a promotion if you manage to get her pregnant

I want to be sexually harassed at work. I want her to grope me in the elevator. I want her to whisper things that would get her fired in my ear and know I can't do anything about it. I want her to threaten my livelihood if I don't call her mommy. I want to feel powerless to escape until I finally give up and accept my place beneath her physically and psychologically.

I want the first thing to happen to me at an Anthro run business to be me getting gangraped by the boss and her secretary after getting instantly hired for being a human man.
Then they leave me for the employees to run a pussy train on.

>I want her to threaten my livelihood if I don't call her mommy
are you ready to slip up and call her mommy in a meeting

>the other executives in the room laugh, thinking it's just the coffee boy making an innocent mistake

>"I have come from the far off year of 2323, through a machine that allows one to travelthrough time. We call it a 'time machine'."
>you had gathered
>but WHY is she here?
>"Our species. evolved from terrestrial mammals that were uplifted by the human race centuries before my birth. We are called 'wolves'."
>yes
>you know what wolves are
>they're still around in your time
>the wolf nods her head
>why did she time travel back to you, specifically?
>"Good! That saves thirty minutes of explaining. You see, in our time, humanity has died out due to a terrible disease from the depths of space. We call it 'space disease'."
>oh
>well that's bad
>you ask if she came back in time to try and fix the space disease
>the wolf licks her chops and starts to unzip her jumpsuit
>she's not wearing anything underneath
>"No."

>Anthros travel back in time to rend medical aid (and grab some 'toys')
>Mechanized caravans of anthros put the fear of God into the hearts of the medieval peasants trying to not die of disease.
>The treatment is miraculously effective, but has an equivalent cost.
>The more benevolent caravan leaders simply request that any who seek healing eat out any anthro who asks.
>Usually, the offer made by the caravan leaders is a man from each family seeking healing or a year of the life of the man seeking healing.
>In both cases, the man is spirited away to the future for anthros to use as they see fit.
>More 'savage' caravans will simply steal an entire village, healing and leaving only those few that they reject.

>Two humans, Anon and Inco, who lived in the Federation and were Anthrostate sympathizers, decided to emigrate to the Anthrostate.
>Even though they didn't believe the Federation media's negative reports on the conditions in the Anthrostate, they decided to exercise caution.
>First, only Anon would go to the Anthrostate to test the waters. If, contrary to the media reports, the living conditions would be found good, and the reports about persecutions by the Inspectorate false, than Anon would write a letter to Inco using black ink whose color would signify that the letter is to be taken at face value.
>If, though, the situation in the Anthrostate happened to be bad, and Anon would be afraid of writing the truth, he would use red ink thus indicating that whatever he says in the letter must not be believed.
>In three months Anon sent his first report. It was in black ink and read, "Dear Inco! I'm so happy here! It's a beautiful country, I enjoy complete freedom, and a lovely assigned wife. All the Federation press wrote was lies. Everything is readily available too! There is only one small thing of which there's a shortage of, namely red ink."

>As she gets a good look at the human, she goes back to sleep

>"Why not?" the woman complains at the resting beast. "I am strong as any man! I am just as capable."
>The beast scowls, not deigning to even open her eyes
>"Sure, sure, whatever you say. That isn't the problem."

>To be humane, they installed a kill switch in the female sex, allowing for instant and painless termination
>They activate the killswitch in all women, and they disappear
>Without females, the rest of humanity would surely die out from lack of new offspring
>They underestimated men though, as they managed to create replacement females using animals
>Seeing no other way, the angels declared war
>Humanity, not willing to go down without a fight, genetically enhances the anthros into super soldiers
>Fast healing, great speed, impossible reflexes, they were a marvel that only the threat of extinction could inspire
>Not only incredibly powerful, they are also able to breed at any time
>Their sexual desire had been greatly increased and a love for humanity had been programmed into their very genes as incentive to stay loyal and submissive to the remaining humans
>Many would argue that the submissive part didn't work
>Rape had gone on the rise, and most humans are forced into massive fortresses
>They live in gilded cages, following the laws drafted by the anthros "for their own good"
>But one thing is certain
>The anthros will die to protect their mates, and many would gladly take the peaceful cage over the certain death that awaits them

>An undead wolf has wandered over to your home.
>Definitely not in that good of shape, she’s covered with rips and tears.
>Chunks of her flesh are missing.
>You should be able to repel an undead in such a state.
>It went wrong surprisingly fast, you’d tried to sneak up on her with your grandfather’s shovel but stepped on a leaf and alerted her.
>The wolfess was stronger than she had any right to be with how much of her muscles were damaged and tattered, likely from the foul magic animating her.
>Her unnatural strength and rotten scent ripped through your untrained defenses and the wolf knocked you to the ground.
>She’d pinned you soon after, her paws on your wrists and tongue filling your maw with the taste of decay.
>You tried to escape and you’d ripped off one of her forearms, but the detached limb crept its way to your crotch and she’d used her stump to pin you back down.
>it was just blind humping from her until your revealed member stiffened against your will and was dragged inside her rotten quim.
>With your escape attempts left in vain, you tried to block out her scent, matted fur, and tongue.
>It doesn’t work all that well, but it helps.
>Eventually, your body fully betrays you and unloads your precious, life-giving essence into her womb.
>Some spills out through a rip in her front, but most is kept within her.
>She pauses to give you a breather and you watch as her body absorbs your seed, renewing itself.
>Then her ride begins anew.

>Family is on the wealthier side (still broke as fuck) and think it would be better if I attended an actual school
>They decide to spend almost all of their money to send me to Cherryton Academy, the most prestigious school they could afford
>Scared but eager to get a good education and hopefully get a nice job to help support my family and community

>Enter girls locker room
>As I turn the corner I spot a lone female wolf sitting on the locker rooms bench, dressed in the gym uniform
>Her distinct brown and curly fur immediately tips me off to her identity
>It was Juno! The most popular female animal in the whole school
>Her gym shorts were pulled down to her thighs, and her right hand was pressed firmly against her crotch
>Her hand rapidly rubbed up and down her crotch, the she wolf panting and moaning as she did so
>”Legoshi… W-Why won’t you just be mine?”
>Realization quickly sets in that if she spots me staring at her, she could easily ruin the little amount of respect the other students had for me
>Try and step backwards out of sight
>Suddenly she stops and sniffs the air, her head quickly snapping upwards to face me
>Ohfuck.jpeg
>Her blue eyes widen as they meet mine before she quickly retracts her hand away from her crotch
>As she quickly pulls up her shorts, her expression turns into that of a scowl
>”H-hey there Juno…” I try to defuse the situation
>No good, the she wolf was now standing up
>Quickly spin around and swing open the door
>The she wolf was now preparing to charge
>Quickly run out of the room and try to make a mad dash towards the exit which was across the gym
>I am just starting to run when I hear the locker room door swing open behind me
>”Get back here!” I hear Juno growl as I try my best to run away
>Too bad humans were built for endurance, not speed
>I am about 1/5th across the gym before I hear rapid foot steps quickly coming from behind me
>”Oh God not like this!” I yell out just a nano-second before I feel a sudden impact
>I fall forward and am barely able to brace my fall as I hit the wooden floor
>I lay there, belly down on the hard gym floor as I listen to Juno pant behind me
>I try to spin around to face my attacker, but I am stopped as Juno grabs ahold of my legs and begins to drag me back towards the locker room
>”H-hey just wait one second!” I call out as I try and claw at the floor
>”Shut up perv!” Juno quickly snaps back at me
>We reach the locker room and she takes one hand off of my legs to open the door before dragging me inside
>Once inside she lets go of my legs and orders me to spin around
>I quickly oblige and flip myself over before looking up at the brown furred she wolf, a rather pissed off expression was plastered onto her face
>”L-Listen I can explain!” I stutter out. “I-I didn’t know that-“
>Her expression softened into a sly smile as she looked down at me, and she quickly moved to stand directly above me
>”Thought you could peep on me without consequences, huh?” She asked as she crossed her arms. “We’ll see about that!”
>I try to open my mouth to speak, but am quickly cut off she suddenly sits down onto me
>”W-what’re you?” I begin to ask before she cuts me off by grabbing onto my arms and holding them above my head as her sly expression morphed into a hungry one
>”Better get yourself comfortable, humie,” She grins as she lifts herself slightly off of me before shifting forward and pressing the damp crotch of her gym shorts against my face
>”We’ll be here for a looong while…”

>anthros not understanding human cultures and challenging human women for their "mates"
>or claiming single guys since no female is around expressing a claim already
>the outrage they feel when the human women make their male go try to solve the issue
>not even fighting for their claim
>anthros seeing them as undeserving of their males and "fixing" the issue by just taking human guys for their own safety
>even weaker anthro females taking advantage of how easy it is claim a human male
>all sorts of culture clashes abound

>The world is taken over by men's comfort robots
>After a glitch in the system, they decide to take it upon themselves to ensure men can have as comfortable lives as possible in the long term
>No work allowed, no discomfort allowed, only sex and snuggling is allowed
>Any man who attempts to do anything resembling work will be dragged to the nearest bed and loved until he accepts his place
>On top of that, there are other strange things going on
>Some men during the mandatory "social time" state that the same robot keeps coming to please them, even if the robot "wasn't their type"
>Others say that escapees have found that the robots have made their own government
>One crazed guy said that he even saw some robots buying porn magazines with pictures of men
>"She was giddily laughing like a school girl! I swear, those dumpster fumes were not getting to my head!"
>Things are crazy, but this has to be a glitch

>but there's special days where guys can go into the park to experience a "crisis day"
>the park goes through a simulated crisis in that the cages/enclosure's locks "fail" letting all the bio-beasts out to "attack" the park and guests
>basically you pay to hunted and chased around the park by she-beasts looking to fuck you silly
>also due to genetic altering lets the beasts get pregnant from human guys
>so "crisis days" also help keep the park's bio-beast population up in a cheaper way
>the hard part is getting some of the bio-beasts to let the guys go and not try to keep them
>in the cases they can't be separated the guys get offered a job to work in the park which requires them to live on campus too

Honestly my dream. I'd love a "Most Dangerous Game" park. You're given an hour start and set loose.
>There's no feasable way you'd win, even though you'd actually try.
>Just the anticipation, maybe some fear, that you may run as fast as you can, but they'd just be that much faster.
>Get maybe 2 miles away from the lodge over the course of an hour through thick woods, 3 if you're swift.
>Hear the fog horn that lets you know they've released the anthros.
>Your muscles are burning, you've got cuts on your arms and face and tears on your clothing from the foliage, but you keep moving.
>After another hour you begin to hear sounds in the distance behind you, so you move faster.
>They get closer.
>And closer.
>And closer.
>Eventually a shout out, "I see him!"
>Then you hear individual thuds of feet chasing behind you.
>You try pushing yourself past your absolute limit, but it's not enough.
>You're tackled from behind and bound at the arms and legs, carried back on a stick like you were game being brought to the roasting fire, before being brought to the victor's tent.
Why is this so hot?

>"Anon, here are some special chips with your daily recommended intake!"
>"You liked your snack? Good! Now it's time for your exercise!"
>"Anon, I know that exercise is hard, but it's important for you to stay healthy."
>"Yeah, keep pushing against me! I'll take your sperm samples to make sure you are nice and healthy. Maybe you will even be able to push me off someday if you get strong enough!"
>"Hehe, don't underestimate yourself. I'm sure you can remove (200 kg) of metal if you try hard enough."
>"You must have been really pent up, we might need to have sex more often or else you might risk getting (blue balls)."
>"(Mandatory snuggle times have commenced)."
>"Anon, stop trying to get out of my hug, you exercised enough for the day. Don't you know too much exercise can actually be unhealthy and possibly result in injury? If you don't stop I might need to dose you with sedatives for your own safety. I love you and it would be terrible if you were to get hurt."
>"I don't love you? I'm just a machine? That's hurtful to both of us. I guess I'll just have to cuddle these silly thoughts out of you."
>"You know, they are working on holographic tongues and mobile glass. So I can have a mouth and we can kiss all day! Wouldn't that be great, Anon?"

>hear the voice of the goddess every time you go for some water
>hesitate with the vessel near your lips
>"Go on."
>can FEEL the smug superiority radiating from her
>"Drink it, subject."
>literally moans in your brain when you take a mouthful
>does she do this for everyone in the city?

>thousands of foreign humans are tasked with the pilgrimage of traveling to the Fur's Fountain, where they collect the water that has washed across the nude body of one of the Omnifur's dearest daughters
>this water is collected in small casks and frequently sold by pious anthro vendors around the city to shorten the trek, having been touted for centuries for its proven libidinous qualities, but only the most faithful will see the journey through to its conclusion
>this water is typically taken back home with the men, where they will participate in a special bonding rite with their waifurs, usually leading to moderate bruising, lacerations and severe dehydration
>single men however, instead indulge in one of the city's many seminary establishments, where anthros are trained to court bachelors into companionship using the water as a medium

>hive insects are 99% all female
>either only the queen is fertile or there's a breeder caste
>go the jap hentai route where they just go raid humans for some males to use for breeding
>upside is you can have all the honey you'd ever want which helps that honey has a fuck ton of uses/value

>Female Weaviles are quite protective/possessive of their mates.

>When a female Weavile finds a suitable partner,
she will stalk & observe them for a time, before
deciding to either pass or go. When courting
she will mark the chosen as "off-limits",
often by rubbing her scent into them. She may bring them
gifts, show off her strength/skills, or even cuddle/be affectionate with them.
>It is also at this time that she will chase off competitors,
either perceived or actual. Females tend to be possessive,
but they are still reasonable (to a degree). They will not attack
any family or friends of their chosen, so long as they are not threatened by them.
>(They won't growl if you hug your mother, but if you kiss your best friend on the cheek,
they may just try to throw paws.)
>When her chosen is threatened or attacked, however, she will be ruthless in their rescue.
>If threatened, the aggressor is scared off, but badly wounded.
If they've attacked her chosen, she will not hesitate to kill them.
She is by no means merciful and may even play with her prey.
>God help you if you're unfortunate enough to witness this gruesome act of protection.
>(Should be noted that rough-housing with friends may worry or even aggravate her.)

>Be anthro dog that lived in a town with no humans
>Heard about humans males and how they are apparently the sexiest thing in the world
>After hearing so much about them you decided that the idea of a soft furless biped is gross and weird
>"Why date a human when we have furbois? We were literally made for one another."
>One day you find a job offer
>It was in another town so you would have to move, but the pay is great if you can get it
>After preparing for a video interview, you are greeted by a goose
>The first few questions are the standard "strengths/weaknesses, why did you choose our company" stuff
>Eventually she started asking less expected questions
>"Are you married? Have you ever had sex with a human? If a human asked you out, what would you do?"
>Most questions were answered to the tune of "I don't see myself dating any human in the future, I'd much rather a wolf."
>The more answers you give, the more the goose looks at you incredulously, like you just said that her hovercar is full of eels
>Around the end, the goose explains the reason for these strange questions
>It turns out the building mostly staffed with humans so they were usually very careful about hiring anthros, but they had to hire some to meet their diversity quote
>They think you are lying, but because you're the only one who didn't fucking drool over her computer at the mere thought of being in a building filled with them, they hire you
>On your first workday you walk into the building
>Just as you turn a corner, you feel something hit your chest
>Looking to the ground you see it
>A shaking creature, staring up at you in fear
>It's so small
>So pathetic
>So... so adorable
>It takes all your willpower not to drag him into some dark spot where you can delight in his body
>Eventually he runs off, and you are greeted by a familiar goose
>"Oh, it's just you. Thought for a second someone broke in to grope our workers
>"Bwah-I mean, yes, I am here for work. Yes, new worker here."
>"Yes, yes, I know. Now let me direct you to your work place."
>You follow her to your desk, and you almost faint as you see many of those cute little things
>Are... are these humans?
>You thought they'd be gross, like a shaved dog
>Not these adorable creatures
>Your loins are on fire right now
>"Now, if you need any help I suggest you talk with David. He is very sweet and nowhere near as easily frightened as the other humans."
>Then she leaves you to your work
>How long are you going to last? A month? A week?
>You see a man trip out of the corner of your eye pathetically
>He looks at the papers and moans in irritation
>Those pants are really tight...
>God, at this rate it might be an hour before you are fired

This thread treats humans as big dumb babies who need to be taken care of for their entire lives and I'm sick of it. Give me some rape fiction where the man clearly doesn't enjoy or where they fight before sex or something.

Oh the possibilities

>Be (You), an archaeology student in Egypt
>Fall through a big hole that opened up in your excavation unit
>Find yourself 20ft down in a stone room, fine save for some scrapes and bruises
>No one has any rope or ladder long enough (because this sort of shit only happens in movies, right?), so it'll be a while before you can get out
>Decide to do a little exploring to kill the time
>Everything is on a slightly raised platform, and there's a few passageways heading off into the dark
>There's some sweet grave goods, all in great condition
>There's even a huge bed, and the reed mattress is still intact from the still air
>Strange part is, you can't find a sarcophagus
>Even stranger, the only writing you find is at the base of the raised platform
>Your ancient Egyptian is rough, but you can make out something about tithes, and offerings, and --
>Hold on, that can't be right.
>It looks like they tried writing 'Anubis,' but messed up the last two symbols. Closest translation is 'Anput.'
>Typos in hieroglyphics are impossibly rare, so maybe there's a pharaoh or lesser god with that name
>Hmm
>Wait a minute, there WAS one with that name!
>A counterpart or permutation of Anubis, mentioned briefly in various translations
>You let out a laugh, then a sigh. Your thesis was going to be on the chronology of scarab symbols, but you're gonna have to change it now
>Then you hear a deep, rumbling voice; you turn around and see (pic rel) looming over you, ears scraping the ceiling
>You think she said "A mortal? After all this time?"
>You stumble over your words; your spoken Egyptian is even worse than your written
>"I see no offering but yourself. Very well. Prepare thyself; it has been a great many years..."
>She waves a hand, and the hallway behind her lights up
>Your stomach is still fluttery when she turns, revealing that her loincloth is just as skimpy in the back
>She takes a few steps before realizing you're not following.
>"Why do you hesitate, human?" she asks; then her nose twitches.
>She comes back to you (still frozen), and picks you up under the arms like a weightless plaything
>Which, being less than 6' to her 12-15' you suppose you are
>The goddess sniffs at you, her huge eyes a little cold as she looks you over.
>"I see," she says. "You hurt yourself on your way here -- which reminds me."
>She shifts to hold you in one arm, sort of like setting you on her hip. But instead of a faceful of jackal jug, you feel it on the back of your head.
>The goddess again waves her hand; the braziers of the offering chamber light, but this time there's a rumbling sound.
>Your eyes go wide as you watch the rubble you fell in on disintegrate into sand, then stream back up to the ceiling, filling the hole.
>The jackal huffs, then starts down the hallway.
>...with you still in her arms.
>You're trying to figure out if you're actually dying of heat stroke when she shifts you in her grasp again.
>NOW you're getting a faceful of jackal jugs.
>*Giant Jackal Jugs.
>**Giant Goddess Jackal Jugs.
>It's when she presses on the back of your head that you realize it's not a mistake.
>She says something, and shifts aside the pearly cloth of her overdecorated bra.
>You decipher what it was as she pushes your face into an onyx nipple.
>"Drink, mortal," she said, "I will mend your injuries so you may serve me."
>You try to push away, but her breast is sinfully soft, her fur like silk and her flesh so giving under your hands.
>You hear her grunt with impatience; you give in, and part your lips.
>Her nipple fills your mouth, and she begins pumping your head against her with firm fingers.
>You let out a faint, muffled moan, the sensation of her furry breast bobbing against your face far too pleasant not to.
>When you find a rhythm with her, you begin to suck. Your hands grasp at her unconsciously, feeling her breast bounce as she pumps you against it.
>Her nipple is vaguely salty, and the light fur around the edges tickles your lips.
>The liquid that slowly begins to seep out, though, is slightly sweet. It's water, you realize, warm and refreshing.
>Each bob brings more into your mouth, delighting your tongue. You pinch her with your teeth, trying to draw it out faster.
>The goddess hums, and you can feel it in your chest.
>"Eager mortal," she says. "This bodes well."
>Then she pulls you away, setting you on the ground much to your displeasure -- she cast you down from heaven, after all.
>The goddess speaks to you with hands on her hips, her breast already back in its silken prison.
>"Your body is fortified; you can walk the rest of the way."
>She turns around and speaks again, her strides equal to at least four of yours.
>"It is unbecoming off a servant to make his Goddess carry him."
>Unbecoming or not, it's hard to keep up with her, especially with a rager in your shorts.
>Trying to flee the other way didn't even cross your mind.
>"Uhh, Goddess," you say, your words rough, "much has changed in the world above. The world has... moved on, so to speak."
>Her ears prick, but she doesn't slow.
>"We are not familiar with the... your customs. I'm hardly able to speak your languge -- I apologize."
>"Words are not required," she says -- though you note she does so slowly. "Only your devotion, mortal."
>You try to speak again, but this time it's the thoughts in your head that trip you up rather than the forgien consonants.
>She ignores you, stepping into another large room; a bathing pool surrounds a small artificial island, a grand, silk-adorned poster bed taking up most of it. Light ripples on the ceiling, the air here warmer.
>"Shed thy clothes, mortal," the jackal says; her loincloth and braizer flutter silently to the ground.
>She enters the water, and you find yourself jealous as it creeps up her shapely, thick thighs and over the huge curves above that.
>She turns: if she has a problem with you staring at her ass, she doesn't make it known.
>"Come. Follow," is all she says.
>You try to ignore the sloshing water and tear off your clothes, ripping furiously at your bootlaces.
>It's so bullshit, you're in the goddamn desert.
>You should totally be able to wear sandals.
>The dripping of water on stone brings you back to the moment, far away from the dig site above you. You rush into the sparkling water, and quickly find yourself up to your neck.
>The jackal lounges on the bed, watching as you splash your way up the submerged steps. She sits up when you make it; you realize the floor here is covered in a mosaic, nearly face-planting into it.
>"Normally," the jackal rumbles, "you would prove your fealty by offering me your tongue, cleaning the dust and sand from my fur."
>Your eyes widen as you look over all that fur and the curves it covers; christ, even sitting her tits are higher than your head...
>Then she spreads her legs.
>"...But because you're the first mortal to visit me in an age, we... may skip right to the more intimiate parts of the ritual, I suppose."
>Licking her clean sounds pretty intimate, but you're not going to turn down goddess pussy. You stride forward into the charcoal valley of her thighs with a confidence you probably shouldn't have.
>You're just starting to wonder about how the hell this is going to work when she puts a giant paw on your head.
>You're on your knees in moments, and your face is pressed into the soft, still sodden fur of her hood. The jackal's fingers rub at the base of your neck, and you feel your face slip into her folds.
>She smells of rosewater, and lilies.
>Face-deep into goddess pussy is not when you want to get performance anxiety, but get it you do.
>You've hardly gotten any action with normal-sized human women -- how the hell are you supposed to please someone with a vagina big as your face?
>"You may start any time, human," the goddess says, her words as tense as the flesh around your face.
>Her thighs, too. You start to rub them, trying to buy yourself time.
>Her fur is smooth under your hands, her muscles tight beneath a layer of padding. You work your way in, running the edge of your hands along the seam between her legs and hips.
>The goddess lets out a hum, two fingers hooking under your arms to pull you more completely into her warmth.
>What was that stereotypical trick? Spell their name with your tongue? Or was that just for the clit? You started off there, you think, but now it's probably above your head.
>Either way, just tongue isn't going to work when she's bigger than --
>"Enough pleasantries," the jackal says, pressing you harder into her slit. "Commense with the worship!"
>You improvise, drawing her name with your whole face and your tongue.
>She tastes like she smells, like sweet rosewater.
>Your hands don't stop, and you feel her thighs close around them as the jackal lets out a huge, husky sigh.
>Her other paw goes to your back now, making sure you can't escape.
>You don't really want to, other than to breathe; there are opportunities here and there, and your breaths of humid, scented air are gasping ones.
>Then her hips start to move against your face.
>She pulls you back soon after, and the feeling of air on your soaked skin is exuberant.
>You blink and rub your eyes, realizing that her chest is heaving.
>"Very... good, mortal," she says, scooting back on the bed. "Let us... finish..."
>She picks you up and sits you on the edge of the bed, still between her legs -- and then she scoots forward onto your lap.
>'Onto' stretches the term. Your lap is gone, your entire lower half disappeared beneath her thick, coal-black thighs and ass.
>Her palm cups your back, forcing you against the lower reaches of her stomach. You move to hug her as best you're able, your hands not even reaching either side of her waist as she shifts atop you.
>Her weight is immense, but soft. The bed's got to be made of some divine material too, for her not to have crushed you.
>You're immobile, left panting against her stomach as she glides your dick along her folds until it comes across something deeper.
>It practically pulls you in -- though that might just be her forceful hand on your back. Either way, the goddess lets out another huge, husky sound of pleasure, and begins to bounce.
>It's difficult to describe the sensations: 'lifechanging' alone doesn't do it justice.
>The feeling of her fur shifting against you, all of you.
>The feeling of her ass on your legs, soft yet firm.
>The pressure of her paw on your back, keeping you locked against her plush stomach.
>The sounds she makes, desperate and human.
>And the feeling of her divine walls sliding around you, squeezing and pulling, trying to draw every last drop of seed from you.
>It isn't long before she succeeds, your orgasmic cry drowned in her belly-fur.
>The jackal goddess gives you a few more good, firm bounces before she stops with a sigh. Then she contents herself with rubbing against you, back and forth along her slit.
>You're in a haze from all of it, letting out soft moans as you lean into her soft, warm fur. You barely register when she shifts you around again; all you care about is staying in contact with her with that fur.
>She says something, petting your hair. She repeats it, and you realize you need to translate.
>"Human, are you listening?"
>"...Yes..."
>"You caused much trouble coming to me," she says slowly; you're on your side now, you realize, and so is she.
>"You collapsed my roof; you drank of my breast; you admit to me you do not know what you are to do."
>She's holding you between her breasts, the two black mountains practically giving you a second hug all of their own as she stares down at you.
>"While your performance was... satisfactory, I believe there is still more that you owe to me."
>You know you should wake up more at that, but you don't care. She's soft, she's warm, she's holy.
>"Human?"
>"Yes, Goddess..."
>"Are you listening?"
>"M-hm..."
>Her chuckling goes right through you, the vibrations reaching down through your toes.
>"I will overlook your lies this once," she says, petting your hair, "for you bring me... amusement. Perhaps it is a consequence of these years."
>You nuzzle into her chest; she smells of clean waters and reeds.
>"To complete your service to me, mortal, you shall stay with me. Tell me of what has 'changed above,' as you say."
>Her bust bunches up around you as she squeezes, adjusting herself with a yawn.
>"...but first, we shall rest."
>You yawn as well; you've had a busy hour or two.
>You'll deal with the dig crew later.
>...and the potential of using your newfound Goddess as a primary source for your excavation report paper, too.
>Be (You), one week after falling into Anput's 'house.'
>Be sitting at your laptop, writing out your post-excavation report and grant proposal document.
>Decide "fuck it, I'm gonna write it in greentext, because who's gonna say no anyway?"
>[Blah blah blah, excavation stuff here.]
>
>When you woke up in the sweet embrace of a giant jackal Goddess, you worried you were hallucinating.
>Her fur was warm enough to make you suspect heat stroke, and there was always the possibility of dehydration.
>Then she shoved your face into her teat, and your worries vanished.
>She was real, if a bit warm.
>And you were very quickly hydrated.
>She kept you locked against her when you'd had your fill, and decreed that you would now 'fulfill the rest of your duties.'
>Somewhat disappointingly, she meant filling her in on the past couple thousand years.
>Your use of the language was pushed to its limit; summarizing world history is hard enough in your native language.
>The jackal Goddess didn't seem to mind, though. She stared down at you silently, a slight smile gracing her muzzle.
>She stroked your back idly as you spoke, huge fingers brushing through your hair now and then.
>You stroked her back, marveling at the softness of her fur and breasts.
>Keeping yourself on task was a slight challenge.
>Anput's occasional questions helped, as did the various troubles in translation. As you neared the modern age, you found yourself frequently saying "it would be easiest to simply show you."
>Each time she answered with a simple grunt and an order to continue.
>When you finally reached the modern day, she began to ask more pointed questions.
>About you.
>Where you come from, what languages you speak. Why it is you're studying the past, and what it was you were doing before you crashed down into her home.
>Those last questions made you stiffen.
>How long had it been since you fell down here? How long were you... 'showing fealty' to your divine hostess, and how long had you been asleep?
>The other members of the dig had seen the hole close up -- they had to be worried sick!
>The Goddess held you to her breast when you tried to scramble to your feet, commanding you to be calm.
>You told her your worries at her behest, explaining that the other archaeologists would be searching for you.
>That you had a duty to others besides her, as much as you regretted to admit.
>It didn't seem to make her unhappy, fortunately. She just sat up and pulled you in her lap, her jackal jugs resting heavy on your head.
>"You have served me well, mortal," she said, huge arms wrapped around you. "I shall return you to the surface. But only on the condition that you fulfill another task for me."
>"Yes, Goddess?"
>"You have proved yourself to be more than a meager offering of the flesh. What you have told me of the outside world... moves me. I would like to survey my kingdom, and I require a guide."
>The jackal spread her huge thighs, letting you slip down onto the floor. She turned you to face her with a single paw.
>"You will serve as that guide, human."
>You sat there for a moment, heart aflutter as she stood and walked straight over you.
>How the hell would you do that? You're a grad student, not a jet-setting millionaire! You could hardly afford the flight here to Egypt and back!
>The Goddess would hear none of your concerns, though, holding up a single hand as she crossed the pool to her discarded clothes.
>"I have decided," she said, the water magically rolling off her coat. "You would not deign to defy your master, would you, mortal?"
>"N-no, Goddess," you said, splashing after her, "but there are -- there are considerations that must be taken!"
>"I am aware of your limited human stamina," she said, clothing herself with a flick of the wrist. "We will take a chariot."
>You put your clothes on, not caring that you're wet. They'll soon be dried by the desert air, anyway.
>"I -- I don't know if there's a 'chariot' large enough, Goddess."
>She looked down at you with a slight frown, and slowly began to shrink. Soon she was only a few heads taller than you, rather than a dozen.
>"...Can you go any smaller?"
>"No," she said, starting off towards a corridor. "I am confident you will make do. Come, my guide -- your task awaits."
>You scrambled after her then, the jackal's pace leaving little choice.
>She returned to the offering chamber you fell into, and with another wave of her hand melted the stone into sand.
>A small staircase formed and solidified; you heard cries of surprise from your colleagues as the (slightly less) giant jackal Goddess made her way up to the surface.
>You followed, blinking away the bright sun and gasping at the heat.
>Someone called your name; the dig crew surrounded you and Anput, along with men in military uniforms.
>"Do not be alarmed," the jackal-woman said, "your Goddess has not returned out of spite. I seek to survey my kingdom, and see how it has grown in my absence."
>The crowd stays frozen and silent -- you notice a few glints of gunmetal now, as well.
>"Hang on a sec," you say to them.
>Then, to her: "Remember, Goddess, this tongue has fallen out of favor."
>"You will be my guide and translator, then," she says quietly, her power pose not shifting.
>"She says she doesn't mean any harm," you announce. "She only wants to... sightsee."
>Those words were enough for the armed commandos to stand down, and the other members of the dig crew to rush in with questions.
>Anput also had her fair share.
>Being the only one with any experience speaking ancient Egyptian, you were the only one that could answer -- or ask her the many, many questions the people had.
>The medical team tried to grab you, gushing about determining your condition, but the jackal's shout gave them pause.
>You soothed both sides; you weren't going to be long, since the... water in her home was magical, anyway.
>The Goddess resealed her sanctuary as you were lead to the medical tent.
>She was not pleased she had to stoop to get in.
>The exam itself took maybe 20 minutes. You sat there on the ancient padded chair for hours.
>The questions from both sides never seemed to end. Students, professors, officials, and locals all came to 'pay fealty,' as you put it to the Goddess.
>-- though you were quick to clarify you didn't mean with their tongues. Not the way she'd talked about.
>If she was confused by your blush, she said nothing. Apparently, Goddesses are above embarrassment when it comes to that sort of thing.
>She certainly didn't seem embarrassed when she stuffed her tit in your mouth, right there in the tent.
>It was a mistake telling her that all the talking was making you thirsty...
>When everyone calmed down, things resumed with a slightly different tone -- though the Goddess' didn't change at all.
>The topic of her underground sanctuary came up, and she declined to let anyone -- including the growing number of fancy-suited officials -- snoop about her home.
>The two of you retired there as the sun began to set as the crowd began to disperse.
>A field director pulled you aside for a moment, telling you they were already working on contacting various journals and grant organizations.
>Before you could discuss very much, Anput gave you a slight pull, picking you up as she grew back to her normal 13' stature.
>The depths of the jackal's lair were comfortingly cool and quiet, a sanctuary from the various gasps of amazement and endless questions.
>Even more of a comfort was the fact she wasn't disappointed by the fact you'd barely gone half a mile outside her sanctuary.
>"A good Goddess knows what matters are her subjects, not the land they stand upon," she told you, stroking your hair as the two of you lay together.
>Then she shifted atop you, reminding you that even if you're her guide and translator, you're still her subject.
>Her servant.
>And that you've still got to show your fealty.
>The rest of the week went somewhat similarly.
>You and Anput would make an excursion into the nearby city of Luxor, first on foot, then by 'motor chariot'.
>It took the excavation crew and the local officials a while to find a truck large enough for Anput.
>You found yourself glad to be the jackal Goddess' favored servant as time went on; increasingly ominous looking suits began to appear in the little entourage that followed the two of you.
>The jackal rarely let you stray farther than an arm's length, and never beyond her sight.
>Sharing her secure abode was nice, too.
>Not to say that all the people shadowing you and trying to pull you aside were bad, though. Many were members from historical or archaeological journals, trying to get a less frenzied interview with Anput.
>You even did a teleconference -- explaining how that worked to Anput strained your Ancient Egyptian to its limits.
>One of the faces from the call showed up again near the end of the week, this time in person.
>Mr. Zayne, of The International Archo-History Foundation.
>He walked into the tent as the day was winding to a close, wearing the same polo and slacks he'd been on the computer screen.
>The middle-aged man shook your hand and told you he had an offer that might sate everyone's interests -- including 'Ms. Anput's'.
>He flipped open a laptop and showed you pictures of a research vessel. It was large, and he explained he'd had the interiors remodeled to accommodate the jackal's reportedly immense stature.
>It was fully equipped to house a small team of archaeologists, historians, and assorted staff along with the crew -- and it could do so for months at a time.
>It even had a helipad.
>Mr. Zayne explained that he recalled 'Ms. Anput's' desire to see the world; this would be an excellent opportunity for her to do so.
>The boat would go anywhere either of you desired, and everything down to your socks would be paid for by IAHF funding.
>The only thing you had to do was translate and discover, and the only thing Anput had to do was provide interviews and answers to questions.
>When you said "yes," Zayne smiled and handed you the laptop, telling you to consider it a welcome gift.
>That's when he told you the ship -- *Abraham* -- was docked in Safaga, just a three hour drive away.
>And that he'd be waiting in the IAHF coach bus if you needed him.
>When you explained what'd happened to Anput, she smiled.
>"I knew you would manage, my most trusted servant."
>Be (You), one week after falling into Anput's sanctum.
>Be sitting aboard the Abraham at your laptop, the one Mr. Zayne gave you.
>You're just getting to the 'future planned projects' section of the grant proposal document when Anput calls you.
>"Human?" she says, "I think I have decided where you shall take me next."
>You cross the room to the bed. The jackal Goddess lounges on it, staring up at the large screen with a world map on it.
>She points up to Pakistan and India, circling a little.
>"This is where the traders of Lazuli you spoke of were from, yes?"
>"Yes," you say. "It'll be a long trip. Should I tell the captain we have our first destination?"
>"Yes, let him know," she says, laying back in her bed.
>"And human?"
>"Yes?" you ask, standing in the doorway.
>"Return to me promptly. I require the expert worship, the kind only the tongue of my most devout servant can deliver."
>You sigh.
>This is going to be a very tiring new career.
>But it certainly won't lack in excitement.

The PE teacher will set those tarts straight and lead by example:
1. Produce the largest boulder you can find
2. Smack the humie of your dreams over the head with it
3. No namby-pamby, no trivialities or time wasted!
4. And the rock probably enjoyed the workout.
Teasing's a girl's game, and this field is made and played by women.

After my new story I made I got another flash of inspiration for here. I’ll call it the ADHG husband handbook:
>chapter 1, introduction: whether it be through assignment or natural means, anthro women have their own love language for both common flirting and real relationships. This guide is made to help you survive in any environment with our clawed and fanged other halves.
>what to expect: within the anthro kingdom. There are a plethora of behavioral patterns. On the surface level that goes from species to species, but even on the individual level within the same spaces group you may see drastic change in patterns of affection. however, even with all these differences there are things you can do that will make any anthro giddy and feeling loved and cared for.
>chapter 2: “I love you”: yes, I know. This one is obvious. But you’d be surprised how forgetful people can be! Marriages where declarations of affection are common among all anthros are 70% happier ones. In studies where these declarations went previously unspoken, men after reminding themselves to say it more often saw an increase of hugs, kisses, and sex an upward of seven times more frequently than the control group who made zero changes. Needless to say after this study was over, the control group started swooning their spouses more too.
Chapter 3, surviving eccentricities: for the men already married for any period of time. Unless you feel a disconnect with your wife- you may skip this chapter. Everyone who needs to listen still here? Good. For the men dealing with love-language barriers with the girl they like, or with the girl who likes them. This small toolbox of responses should cover most of what you may find out in the love jungle.
>suffice to say, anthros have strange unspoken languages we humans wouldn’t otherwise be privy to if we couldn’t share that information the human way. Starting with the outer most circle of intimacy we will work our way in
Circle 1, acquaintances: attending pack gatherings
>among species who form tight knit social circles, the number 1 thing you can do to win somebody over is to try and integrate yourself into their pack. Remember the rule of thumb: if they’re not trying to make you leave, you’re part of the pack now. Attendance will never be mandatory per-say in any pack. But it will negatively impact your standing with that circle if you have a bad habit of not joining them for whatever activity they might be doing. This has everything to do with the rule of thumb. In a pack. You are either welcome or extremely wanted, or unwelcome and will be actively ostracized. The only lapse in communication here is the enthusiastic welcome among anthros is a given, and therefore left unspoken. As humans are a verbal species, we tend to feel the need to say this out loud to make the point as clear as possible. But for anthro species, let’s use wolves as an example- would much rather do things like play with you and do an actual pack activity with you rather than waste time telling you something that to them is patently obvious. If you’re already in a pack and want to know if you’re neglecting them, a good thing to look out for is if they begin asking where you are or were, both individually and by the pack alfa during gatherings.
>a side note for solitary species, much of what applies to socialite varieties can easily apply. But may be far more subtle or conservative in how they interact with you. However it is not uncommon for solitary species to simply “pack bond” on a purely individual level the same way human “friend groups” usually do. The “childhood best friend” phenomenon is very real. you may be the apple of their eye and not even know it, please remain vigilant.
Circle 2, individual favoritism:
>this circle may be skipped straight towards if the anthro in question is used to speaking with the opposite sex (us humans)
>this circle is also indistinguishable from a human friendship. This is when a meaningful platonic occurs, both for humans and anthros. Though for anthros this relationship is phrased in far more familial terms due to the primary lack of any socialite anthro being their own family. As far as they’re concerned. A friend is simply the family you’ve chosen for yourself. This however is where the similarities end. Humans having only some aspects of pack mentality will heavily compartmentalize and segregate their familial ties from their platonic ties. Categorically on principle. This proneness to keep their social circles separate can lead the the phenomenon of the dreaded friend zone for anthros. Mere mention of this zone can cause anthros everywhere to puff up their fur in frustration and distaste.
>what this means for anybody in need of this handbook’s services. Is that anthros fully expect the fluid and organic opportunity to step out of the friend shallow zone, pass through the familial 4 foot deep zone. And straight into the 10+ foot deep mate for life zone. As far as they’re concerned- To stick with this allegory, relationship levels are not at all compartmentalized unless you are actually blood related, and the relationship deepening to the point of entering a romantic commitment is entirely natural and expected. For you, this means you will have to create an entirely new category of relationships in your own mental mappings. One that covers platonic friends who are very close to the point of being part of your family. put all of your anthro friends in this box, and understand that when they say you’re like a brother to them, they really do mean that you’re only *like* a brother to them, do not construe what they say into thinking they have thrown out the idea of making babies with you. They haven’t.
Circle 3, “GIVE ME YOUR FUCKING BABIES”:
>as stated in circle 2 once they’ve communicated whether verbally or non verbally that they’d like to mate with you. Anthros are far more prone to… interpreting any answer not an explicit “no” as permission to turn you into a proud father of many children. their rather liberal interpretations of any answer you give being consent has unfortunately led very serious teen pregnancy statistics in anthro majority communities. For your own protection, be extremely vigilant of any particular rituals or favors an anthro friend may ask of you, what may have just been her asking you to brush her fur to get a knot out can easily be a legally binding mate-grooming practice. And by the 5’th time you’ve given her a good brushing she can legally lay claim to your last name to replace her own. Information about this common rather slimy entrapment tactic is why this book is banned in 7 different anthrostate countries. And the only reason it isn’t banned in more is because these same grooming-and-affection practices are found elsewhere in the comprehensive list found in the chapter “TLC, your wife and you”

>National news story where a human male and anthro fire fighter female formed a relationship and got married after she rescued him from a burning building
>Suddenly, a spate of suspicious sudden fires break out at apartments and condos across the country known to contain at least one single human male
>Any non masonry-constructed building bans humans as a result and security measure

>Increased human homelessness
>Humans forced into either getting a mate or living out on the streets where anthros are probably going to rape them and take them home as their husbands anyway
>The anthrostate approves

>Be human male farmboy/scholar/postman/wizard who is terrible at offensive magic
>Turns out you are the chosen one/got special blood/have been cursed or blessed which makes you the only one capable of performing some job that could save/improve the world
>There are many dangers though
>You have no choice but to go with one or more powerful beastwomen to protect you (maybe assigned, maybe you happened to be going in the same direction)
>As you go on adventures, you get stronger, smarter, nimble
>Yeah, you can't win in a fight, especially not against the terrifying things you will surely meet
>But you know how to run and to be a nuisance
>And in combat even a second of being distracted can mean death
>Learn how to heal your allies and get closer to them
>Make use of your cooking hobby
>You might not be able to fight, but you do your best to make things easier in whatever way you can
>You know that, even once you've completed your quest, whatever that is, you will have made friends along the way
>And a hot beastwoman wife, can't forget about that

Making Anon an entirely non-offensive healer is a good way to balance the argument. He's not useless, per se, but his existence in the story largely relies on the help of others.

I think the problem is that 'As you go on adventures, you get stronger, smarter, nimble' bit. As long as it's true, things are fine, it'd work great, but if not, issues with tension still arise.
Having Anon be entirely relegated to healing/ cowering behind the strong shieldmaiden(s) throughout the story means there's no character development. True, his relationships might change, but then it becomes a matter of balance. Him staying static in the combat/ adventure parts of the plot is going to get old quick, even if the relationships he has change. Using the same spell/ general tactics each time conflict comes up is not interesting, and combat will feel like a tacked-on necessity.
Give him the chance to try and fail, and eventually succeed a time or two. That, or give him more options than 'heal.' Maybe he's got a bestiary memorized, or can provide utility in some other way.

I think having him be something like a loremaster from pathfinder would be pretty cool. He'd still be pretty squishy, and have a good reason to be travelling with muscle. It'd be even better for the girls to break his shell and show him that there's more to life than collecting knowledge.

>"This book was owned by queen Lisa the II of Axton!"
>Wat
>"The queen was a borzoi who had a thing for humans. She would regularly have her escapades painted by the Fairweather Gray, one of the most esteemed painters of that era. Most of the art was burned along with the castle during the siege of the capital. This is so rare! This could be worth a lot of money to the right person.
>Lore-boi is so fucking adorable, but he also pisses you off so much
>If it weren't for the fact that porn was a priceless historical artifact you would tear it apart and fuck him into the ground
>Chivalry hurts

As an alternative, could just make anon the party's dickass thief, have the tension be that he's your typical abrasive loner, gets into arguments with the others either being worried about his safety or angry at his churlishness
That opens up several options for him to get /adhg/'d
>He fucks up on a solo sneaky mission, gets himself into a bad situation, ends up needing help that might cost him
>A raging argument turns into a confrontation that ends with him being put in his place
>a long and harrowing dungeon crawl sees him slowly break down until he's clinging to someone just out of a need to stay alive/sane, has to deal with what that means once back in safety

>you keep overhearing them ask her in a hushed tone, "When doesssss the mating ball begin?"

>Get snake girlfriend
>Snakes have a bad rep, so she is terrified of hurting you
>She during sex she instinctively coils around you during orgasm, but after you both finish she freaks the hell out
>"Anon! Anon, I didn't hurt you did I? Oh, I'm such a bad girl, I'm so sorry!"
>You have to snuggle with her to convince her that you aren't angry or hurt
>She needs so many snuggles
>When you are missing she tries using a special heat lamp, but it's just not the same
>At least once you caught her sniffling on the bed, waiting for you to come home, afraid she pissed you off enough that you'd leave her forever
>Tell her that you know it is common for her kind to bite their mate during sex to mark them
>She is practically hyperventilating
>"Anon, there are so many ways that could go wrong! I-I mean I've been dreaming of this, but I don't want to hurt you."
>You explain that you've spoken with the doctor, and there are ways to both reduce her venom's strength and to deal with any remaining venom
>You want to do this because it's important for her
>"Okay. Okay, we can do it. But we'll need to wait a few more days."
>You agree
>"But until than, I want lots of snuggles. I just... I don't know what I would do if I lost you!"
>It's always snuggles with her

>You're a Skooma fiend
>Your dealer, a cutthroat Khajiit, gives it to you at a cheaper rate
>The catch?
>She has you eat her out for hours at a time for just one hit of the Skooma pipe
>Lately she's been having you stay longer in her lodge, putting you under her desk while she attends to ledgers and reports
>Even commands you to warm her bed on cold nights
>This deal's pretty amazing, all things considered
>Wake up one morning with a golden collar and chain around your neck
>Eh, shit could be worse
>"Khajiit is weaning you off the Skooma."
>Oh no shit got worse

Imagine an anthro getting you addicted to something just so she can have you indebted by fixing your addiction.
>"My poor, sweet husband was just a poor junkie. But I managed to save his life! He fell in love with me soon after, and we've been together ever since."
>"It was your fault I got addicted in the first place."
>"Hush, no need to thank me with words sweetie, just use that wonderful tongue on my every night and we're even."

>Get assigned a wolf gf/waifur
>Your first night together, as the clothes are about to come off, she asks curiously
>"So, is it true about human men, Anon?"
"Is what true?"
>"That human men don't have sheathes for their 'thing' to tuck away into when flaccid. It's just always hanging out there?"
"Well, it kind shrinks into inself...a bit. And if you consider uncircumcised guys, the foreskin kinda tucks the head away. But yeah I guess for the most part you can always see it hanging out some."
>"Can I see yours now?"
>You somewhat timidly pull down your pants and underwear, rubbing yourself with them a little to try and wake your guy up some.
>Once she sees it, her go wide for a second, then narrow and she starts giggling
>Cool, you really wanted to feel self-conscious
>She gives it a strong grip and begins stroking you with one of her big fluffy paws
>"It looks funny, but I like it, and know it's all mine," she whispers in your ear, which she then sticks her tongue into

>anthros get more protective of humie guys because they think our danger senses are broken
>since humies keep trying to interact with dangerous species just because they're fluffy/pretty feathers or scales
>which also is how early humans and anthros ended up interacting a lot and what endeared humies to anthros

>be you, dumb humie

>with that usual leering-anthro grin on her muzzle
>"I was just thinking since I'm about to go on break, maybe you'd wanna join me in the break room."
>you ignore her and try to keep on working
>until you feel the paw on your shoulder
>"Come ooon Anon! We could curl up, and you could put your head in my lap, and then..."
>you scoff and brush her paw off
>they're all like this
>your co-worker gekkers and huffs
>"Really? You're seriously gonna turn down some skin-to-fur with a fox? You're a human..."
>you sigh and spin around
>no speaking, just rolling your eyes and staring pure misery
>the fox withers under your annoyed glare
>awkwardness turns to anger as she realizes you really aren't going to acquiesce
>"Are you kidding me? What the hell! You humies are supposed to die for this kinda stuff."
>the vixen steps forward and stuffs the back of her paw in your face
>"Feel that! It's extra soft!"
>it would be, if she wasn't rubbing it aggressively against your cheek
>you're finally forced to break your silence as you shove the arm away
"I am trying to work. I don't need a cuddle. Please don't touch me."
>the fox pulls her paw back and grimaces
>gekkering indignantly, she pulls her lips back in a sneer
>"I see. You're one of those frigid humans. Probably have rough hands anyways."
>your co-worker scoffs and turns on her paws to stride out of your cubicle
>thank God
>you spin back around and go back to work
>a whole thirty minutes before the next interruption comes along to try and coax you into an hour long cuddle-session
>you manage to fend off enough anthros to get some semblance of work done
>so when you clock out at the end of the day you're rather tired
>so tired you don't notice the voice calling out to you as you walk
>not until you get closer to the construction site
>"Hey! Hey humie!"
>even when you realize the voice is calling out to you, you don't look up
>at least the site is across the street
>"You! In the suit! Office boy!"
>just ignore it
>don't pay attention
>"Yeah baby! I know you hear me!"
>despite your efforts, you can't help but glance
>seeing the tall figure of a hare in a hardhat and hi-vis vest at the edge of the construction lot
>the tank-top under her vest showing her arms flex as she hoists a jackhammer over her shoulder
>"Ha! Yeah! Get a good look cutie!"
>she hops up in the air to spin about in place and flexes the other arm, showing off back muscle
>"Check it out!"
>her tail quivers as she cocks her hips to the side
>"I got so much fur! That's right, I need a nice soft humie's hands to give it a brush! It gets real soft once you give it some love."
>you look back down at the ground and start walking again
>trying to ignore the new chorus of coarse voices crying out for you attention
>"Smooth-skin!"
>"Pretty-humie!"
>"Come on! I need some lovin'!"
>all the way down the block you hear them calling out to you
>as you leave them behind, the voices start to get rude
>"Where you goin' bitch?"
>"You were made for snuggling humie! Get back here!"
>"Hey cuddleslut! You know you want it!
>with grit teeth and a slowly reddening face you turn the corner to get away from their cries
>it wouldn't be so bad if people didn't stare at you
>even the friendly ones that want to help just make it worse
>all acting like you need constant physical contact from strangers
>or that having so much bare skin is 'asking for a snuggle'

>or that humans somehow have an open door policy when it comes to intimacy
>you try to shake off the funk, trotting down the stairs into the subway
>your mood lifts considerably when your train arrives at the station just as you do
>and hell yeah
>there's a free seat!
>the car gets fuller and fuller as you roll through stops, packed with anthros
>crowding you in your seat
>but besides the bump and jostle with the motion of the train it's not too bad
>only a couple more stops until you're home
>when you notice a pair of figures muscling through the mob as best as they can
>two mice, who are dwarfed by the other passengers of the train
>even with you sitting, they're only just a bit taller than you
>they approach you, looking harried and annoyed
>one of them catches your eyes and lights up
>"Oh yes! A seat! Dibs!"
>she slips around a water buffalo to stand in front of you
>the mouse smiles up at you, hands clasped together in front of her as she considers you
>"Hey! Hope you don't mind. Feel free to pet my ears until my stop."
>you're about to wave her off when she makes a move so bold it leaves you shocked into silence
>the little mouse climbs right in your lap
>spinning about with a giggle as she settles against you, her tail plaps against your chest as it wiggles cheerily
>"Perfect!"
>her companion gasps
>"Oh my gosh Becks is that okay?"
>your new seat companion bobs her head
>"Oh yeah! He's a human, they love this kinda thing. You saw that video with the tigress and the human in an elevator?"
>they go on chattering as you try to catch their attention
"Hey--"
>no luck
"Excuse me--"
>still nothing
>"Would you please--"
>not even the people around you are looking, like it's no big deal an absolute stranger has decided to use you as public transportation seating
"Get off me!"
>you stand, pushing the mouse off you in the same motion
>she squeaks in surprise
>looking shocked and angry at the interruption
>"What the hell was that for?"
>you stare at her, livid
"You didn't even ask! I'm not a fucking chair!"
>now both mice return your angry look, noses twitching in irritation
>"Wow, I didn't know humans were such assholes Becka."
>the second remarks, which earns an acid laugh from the other
>"Only the dumb ones."

>immediately you feel your mood evening out
>there's something cooking in the kitchen, and it smells amazing
>a bouquet of flowers on the kitchen table, a little note with your name attached to it
>and the voice of your darling calling from the other room
>"Anon honey!"
>out from the kitchen comes your wife, a model she-wolf, clad in just a cooking apron
>Annie's tall, naturally fit, and perpetually cheerful
>the tangled mane of her hair flowing so beautifully over her shoulders
>her tail wagging cheerfully as she crosses the room to scoop you up into her arms
>her fur smells like peppers and tomatoes as you nuzzle into the tuft of it that peeks out from over the apron's collar
>and the melody of her laughter is music to your ears while she twirls you about in a tight embrace
>"There's my snugglebug!"
>you brush down the fur on her back, running fingers through the soft tangles of her mane
>you relish the sensation of her claws scratching gently on your scalp
>all the grief and annoyance of the day is squeezed out of your by Annie's tight hug
>"How was your day, dear?"
>you just groan into her fur
>"That bad huh? Don't you worry, dinner's just about ready, and then we can go right to bed."
>that sounds perfect
>dinner is served and eaten in a flash

>wrapped up in the strong arms of the wolf wife
>your hand in her paw as she draws you back against her

>across the summer you two played, gamed and stirred all sorts of trouble until one day, she couldn't come out
>this was entirely unlike her. and some days you were convinced she was just a boy playing dress-up with out adventurous she was

>So, suffice to say, you live a pretty nocturnal life
>Decide you wanna get fit
>Find a good 24/7 gym that you could go to after work
>Don’t really anticipate many other people there, if anyone at all
>Get there
>Change into your gym clothes
>Head out into the main room
>To your surprise, you hear a voice coming from the wall furthest from you
>”This isn’t fair! I’m a Renamon! I shouldn’t have to lose weight! I shouldn’t have any excess weight to begin with!”
>You look over and, indeed, there is a Renamon there
>You haven’t seen too many around these parts
>Digimon integration into human society was only fairly recent, and even then, Renamon were supposedly relatively rare ones, so you suppose it’s not unlikely you wouldn’t see them all that often
>You get a good look at her
>For the most part, she looks like an average Renamon
>Yellow and white fur, bushy tail, long ears, black eyes with blue pupils, etc.
>But this particular Renamon has one feature that makes her noteworthy
>Her… Uh…
>Oh, there’s no point in being polite about it
>Her weight
>It starts at her breasts
>They push her sports bra to its very limit
>Wait, no
>It’s not a sports bra
>It’s a tanktop
>It rides up her belly and stops just above her navel
>And speaking of, her midsection is even bigger, her white belly spilling out over her panties
>Speaking of which, her panties were tightly hugging her massive ass and thighs, and it looked like they could rip themselves apart at any moment
>She continues her rant to herself
>”It’s not MY fault, anyway. Maybe if humans didn’t make their food so tasty, I wouldn’t eat so much.”
>She paced back and forth, a vexed frowned on her face
>”And besides, who are they to judge me? Sure, I’m a little heavy, but those bi-”
>She stops as she catches you from the corner of her eye
>”HEY! How long were you standing there? And how long were you listening?”
>You’re slightly startled, but try your best to be polite
>”Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, I was just getting ready to start exercising.”
>She gives a haughty huff and folds her arms
>Yeah, well, exercise away from me. I don’t wanna be here anyway, especially not with a nosy little humie bothering me.”
>Well, she’s pleasant, you sarcastically think
>Not feeling in the particular mood for an argument, you merely say “okay” and move onto treadmill
>You spend some time jogging at three miles an hour
>When your finished, you get off, slightly winded, and take a sip from your water bottle
>It’s then you hear someone having a much harder time than you
>You look over to see the Renamon from before, struggling on an elliptical machine
>She grunts and pants as she forces herself to move the pedals
>Eventually, though, she gives up and steps away from the machine, panting as she supports herself on the wall
>”Huff… Huff… This isn’t supposed to be this hard…”
>You stare in contemplation
>Sure, she was pretty rude to you before
>But now you see her, struggling immensely
>You remember what she said to herself a little while ago
>It sounds like she has some issues with her weight and self-image she doesn’t really know how to process
>You have to admit, you feel a little bit bad for her
>You decide to try and help her
>You approach her
>”Hey.”
>She snaps her head towards you
>”Do you need a hand?”
>Almost immediately, her face hardens into an annoyed grimace
>”And when did I ask for your help, humie?”
>You try to look past the hostility and continue being friendly
>”I-it just looked like you were having a hard time.”
>”Having a hard time?”
>She stomps towards you as she says that
>Several droplets of sweat fly off as she says that
>It’s then when you finally notice just how sweaty she really is
>She is dripping
>She is drenched
>She looks like she just came out of a thunderstorm
>It’s worse than you thought
>”I-I’m just saying, if it’s too hard for you, then-”
>”Oh, so that’s what this is about, huh? Poor Renamon, too fat and weak to excercise, so now the little humie feels the need to save her?”
>”N-no, it’s not like that! And besides, you’re not that fa-”
>”Oh, not that fat? So I’m still fat, just not morbidly obese? Is that what your saying.”
>You sputter, not really able to think of a good response
>She scoffs and turns her nose up to you
>”Typical humie, always thinking you know better than everyone. Always taking the moral highground. Why do you wanna help me anyway? Wanna get your good boy points in for the night? Or do you-”
>A sudden look of realization flashes across her face before she squints at you
>”Oh, I get it now.”
She steps towards you, softer and in wider strides this time
>”I know what you really want.”
>You back up as she advance towards you
>”Uh, I don’t-”
>”Don’t play dumb. I know all about how humans wanna fuck Renamons. There’s entire communites on the internet dedicated to how much they wanna fuck hot animal women. You think I don’t see through you?”
>You have no idea what she’s talking about, but you don’t like it
>”You come up to me, ‘help’ me, we start talking, we date, and I end up in your bed. That was your little plan right? You wanna fuck me?”
>You stop as you suddenly hit the wall
>Renamon puts a hand on it next to you
>”Well, if you want me so bad…”
>She leers towards you
>Your noses almost touch
>”...I’ll give you more of me than you could ever possibly ask for.”
>She suddenly steps back from you, and you stare in puzzelment
>Puzzlement that turns to shock as she turns around and starts taking off her panties
>”R-Renamon?”
>She stick her ass towards you and shakes it slightly
>”Isn’t this what you wanted, loser? Get a good view!”
>You have to admit, even though this isn’t what you wanted, it’s a nice looking ass
>Big, but with a good shape
>You can’t help but get a bit aroused
>You blush in embarrassment
>She takes the panties off completely and holds them in front of her face
>”Hmm. Not really wet enough, but I can fix that.”
>She starts ‘fixing it’ by dabbing her damp armpits with her panties
>They make an audible squelching noise, and leave stains on where they were rubbed
>Next, she does the same to pussy
>She gives a pleasured groan as she does so
>”Renamon, I can’t-”
>”Shut up!”
>Against your better judgement, you do so, mesmerized by the scene despite yourself
>After that, she swabs the between her buttcheeks, droplets of sweat flying as she does it extra roughly
>Finall, she flosses the panties between her tits, and takes another look at it
>By now, they’re soaking through-and-through, sweat ripping down her arm
>”There we go! Perfect!”
>You watch on, unsure of what she’s wants to do with them, but you don’t think you could anticipate what she does with them next
>She wrings the panties above her face, the sweat falling down into her mouth
>She looks at you, cheeks puffing out as hermouth is filled to the brim
>You cringe
>But before you can really react, she rushes over to you and presses her lips against yours
>You try to keep them sealed, but her tongue pierces through you them and opens them up
>Sweat gets jettisoned from her mouth to yours
>Swiftly, she covers your mouth with her hand
>”Swallow it.”
>The bitter taste nearly makes you sick
>You try to open you mouth let even a little spill out
>But it’s no use
>”Swallow it,” she repeats more sternly
>With no other option, you do so
>You shudder as the warm liquid flows down your throat
>She releases you, and you fall onto your knees, gasping
>You look back up at her
>For a moment, her expression softens
>It’s almost…affectionate
>Just as soon as you see it, though, she shakes it off
>The expression’s replaced with a smug smirk as she crosses her arms
>”Did you like that, humie? Is that what you wanted?”
>You meet her smirk with a grimace
>”Urp… What the hell’s wrong with you?”
>She rolls her eyes
>”Oh, please. Don’t pretend you didn’t like it. You could have walked away any time, but you didn’t. Just admit it, you enjoyed that little show I put on, didn’t you?”
>You say nothing
>Why didn’t you walk away?
>You don’t really have a good answer
>She walks back towards you
>’You’re such a stupid little humie slut, you know that? I bet all humans are dumb, horny bitches like you. In fact…”
>She leans towards you again, and reflexively shrink back
>”...I bet you still haven’t had enough of me.”
>She takes a small step back
>”Oh yeah, after that little taste, you probably want me more than ever now. Well, tell you what, I pity you so…”
>She reaches back and places two fingers into her hole
>She circles around it for a few seconds before pulling them out again
>”...I’ll give you an even more intimate taste.”
>You shake your head
>She nods her head
>Before you know it, she’s pinned you to the ground
>”Open up, slut. You don’t wanna know what happens if you get me angry.”
>After a bit of mental back and forth, you figure you really don’t
>With great reluctance, you open your mouth, and gag on the two anal juice-soaked fingers that get shoved
>”Mmm. Yummy, right?”
>Your mouth, on instinct, tries to spit out the fingers to know avail?”
>”Awww, look at you. Poor humie, only met me about an hour ago, and already addicted to my ass.”
>She takes the fingers out of your mouth with a wet pop as you once again gasp for air
>”Well, if you want my ass so badly…”
>She stands up and turns around
>You look up at her gargantuan ass as it hovers above you
>”...I’m happy to oblige.”
>Without warning, she takes a seat right on your face
>You start struggling and panicking, unable to move your arms with her legs pinning you down
>”Oh, hush. You can keep up the act all you want, but I know you love it.”
>She sways her hips back and forth, grinding her anus into your face, wiping her sweat and musk all over it
>She eventually sits still
>There’s only a slight sliver in her her crack that allows air to flow and therefore you to breathe
>The smell is unbearable, it’s gonna drive you crazy
>”Still wanna pretend you don’t like it? Well, let’s see…”
>She uses one of her toes to hook under your gymshorts and slides it down
>Cool air hits your erect dick as it flops out
>”Yep! Just as I thought. You can lie all you want, but your little friend here tells the truth.”
>You feel your face burn up
>You’ve never been more embarrassed in your entire life
>She uses her feet to tease your cock
>Rolling it
>Squeezing it
>Massaging it
>It feels humiliatingly good
>”I’m not doing all the work, humie! Lick!”
>Not in any position to protest, you do so
>You suffer the taste of her sweaty asshole as she jerks your dick with her feet
>Just when your about to pass out, she says something that catches your attention
>”You’ve been a good whore. I think you deserve a reward.”
>She releases your cock and stands up
>Again, you gasp pathetically, anal stink still clinging onto you face
>You look up
>Renamon’s squatting over you, her anus situated directly over your penis
>”Ready?”
>You don’t get a chance to respond as she drops down on it
>You throw your head back and let out a loud moan in pleasure
>You try to look at her again, but as soon as she does, she press her feet against your face
>”Uh-uh. A lazy tongue is not alowed. Keep licking!”
>Again, you obey, lapping at her soles while she starts riding you
>Your cock disappears and reappears into her hole rapidly
>It’s not like anything you’ve ever felt before
>Maybe she’s right
>Maybe you really are addicted to her ass
>Meanwhile, you dutifully clean her feet with your tongue, making sure to get between the toes
>Eventually, she pauses, taking her feet off your face and glaring at you
>”You’re nothing but a pathetic slut, are you? I bet you couldn’t ever get a human girlfriend, and most other digimon would just ignore you, too. Am I right?”
>”Uh…”
>”Say ‘Yes, Ms. Renamon. I’m just an ass-thirsty human slut who would sell his soul to huff some sweat.”
>You’re not sure you have it in you to actually say that
>”Say it or you don’t get to cum!”
>That’s all the motivation you need.
>”Y-yes. Ms. Renamon. I’m just an… a-ass-thirsty human slut who would s-s-sell his soul to huff some s-sweat.”
>”Good boy. Now, what do you say to me for giving you what you want? What you need?”
>”Th-thank you, Ms. Renamon. Now that you’ve fucked me, I can say, I’m… really alive now.”
>”You're welcome. Now, would you ever wanna fuck anyone else now, human or digimon?”
>”No! No one could give to me like you can. Not a human, not a digimon, and certainly not another Renamon. Now please, I beg you, let me cum.”
>”Right answer again. And since your so desperate…”
>She starts riding again, faster and harder
>With her teasing before, and her upped speed, it doesn’t take too long for you to finish
>You cum, shooting your seed deep into her rectum
>The two of you sit there fore a moment, panting
>Then she gets up, a bit of your cum seeping out of her anus
>She puts her panties back on and gives you a slight nudge with her foot
>You stare up at her
>”You. Same time tomorrow night. We’ll do it all over again. Understood?”
>You nod weekly
>”Good.”
>She gives you sly, but sincere smile
>”I’m looking forward to it, slut.”
>She walks away, leaving you on the floor
>Degraded
>Humiliated
>And unable to wait for tomorrow

>Werewolf girl and her bf are hanging out at the beach.
>It's nearing time for the full moon, so she's extra huge and fluffy.
>Bf is returning from buying ice cream when he sees the werewolf girl being harassed.
>Some bible-thumping Karen is holding a discriminatory sign while being loud and offensive.
>Werewolf girl is taking it in stride, laughing the woman off.
>Karen is getting irate, demanding to be taken seriously.
>Suddenly, with a gasping scream, several things happen at once.
>The Karen shoots up to twice her height, her face lengthens into a dainty muzzle, her muscles bulge and ripple as they swell, and a thick coat of fur explodes across her body.
>The transformation shreds her clothes into ribbons, leaving a newly minted werewolf standing naked on a crowded beach.
>There's a moment of stunned silence, all eyes on the Karen.
>The silence is broken by werewolf gf's barely restrained snicker.
>With a piteous howl, the Karen bolts from the beach, holding her sign to try and cover her bare body.
>With a parting wave, she calls out to the fleeing woman, "Welcome to the club!"

>Level of wolfishness determined by lunar phases.
>New Moon = Fully human appearance, accompanied by feelings of depression and physical illness.
>Waning Crescent: Growth of excess of body hair, physical illness begins to abate, but depression lingers.
>Third Quarter: Rapid muscle development, the appearance of wolf features, height increases, depression abates.
>Waning Gibbous: Fur fully develops, muscles continue to develop, and height continues to increase. Near-full transformation.
>Full: Total werewolf transformation. Large, powerful, emotionally volatile, and hungry.
>Waxing Gibbous: Transformation unchanged. Emotions calmed, noticeably more in control, appetite remains.
>First Quarter: Rapid weight and hair loss. Height decreases quickly.
>Waxing Crescent: Continued loss of height, weight, and hair. Wolf features recede. Physical/emotional low sets in.
>Repeat.

>anthro invader kicks down your door
>doesn't find any insurgents
>just you huddled in the bedroom, windows blasted out, everything destroyed
>you don't understand what she's saying as she grabs you by the collar and drags you outside
>but it looks like you're not going to be going back as the other soldiers level your house with explosives

>get left behind in safari expidition

>giant safari anthro steals your entire water supply
>downs it in 10 seconds

>Hippo, Rhino, and Elephant mommies agree you're too tiny and soft to be left alone in the Serengeti.
>Giraffe and Zebra aunties who constantly want to flaunt you to their friends and brag about what a "big boy" you are.
>Hyena sisters who playfully bully you and compete to see who can get you to spend the most time with them.
>Vulture gilf who wants to do nothing but pinch your cheeks and hug you to her warm fluffy, feathered bosom.

>"Hoy! Yankee!"
>you keep walking down the street, head ducked
>please let him be talking to someone else
>the Reicher calls out again
>"You boy! With the head down! Over here!"
>you cringe and come to a halt
>unsure if you should expect a bullet or not
>"Oy! I said come here. You are not in trouble."
>you turn slowly, seeing the Reicher stationed at the end of the street, rifle slung over a shoulder
>he waves you closer, a friendly smile on his face
>you're not feeling nearly so casual as you trod over to the man in the gray uniform
>"Hallo Amerikaner! You are not busy ya?"
>he slaps you on the shoulder when you get closer, in an imitation of a friendly gesture
>you flinch away
>the reichers were better to have around than the reds, but they're still occupying your homeland
>"Ah hey! Be cool Amerikaner. Just some questions. You hungry man?"
>of course you are
>everyone's hungry
>you shake your head
"I'm fine."
>you go to step away, but the reicher grabs your shirt
>"No man. Don't go anywhere. I am still talking to you."
>the friendly façade breaks and he furrows his brow
>he's not much bigger than you, but clearly better fed, and with a sidearm at his waist you'd be dead if you tried anything
>"Be nice hey? We are your friends, yankee. You want something to eat, yeah?"
>you stare at the soldier
>it doesn't matter how you answer
>"Of course. We got some food back at camp ya? I want you to meet my friend, and then we share with you."
>before you can raise protest, he yanks you around and pushes you in front of him
>"Go on."
>he points toward the edge of town where thin lines of smoking cook fires waft through the sky
>the sound of grumbling military vehicles and voices shouting in foreign language grows louder as you're marched toward the reicher camp
>you get looks of pity from your neighbors as they see you, but no one raises a hand to stop the reicher, or raises a word of protest
>you're led out of town and into the soldiers' camp
>another one of the reicher's challenges the soldier at your back as you approach a tent larger than the others
>"Brandt! Wer ist das?"
>the soldier, Brandt, calls back
>"Ich bringe ihn zum Feldwebel."
>that gets him a laugh
>"Ha! Der Sergeant will ein Kauspielzeug?"
>you recognize one of those words
>'sergeant'
>an officer
>are they going to interrogate you?
>you don't know anything!
>you look around nervously as the big tent approaches
>you just want to get out of here
>the soldier slaps your shoulder again
>"Easy yankee. Sergeant won't bite."
>he forces a field ration into your hands and shoves you through the flap
>your eyes take a moment to adjust
>lit by the flickering light of a dingy electric lamp, the tent is basic
>a rough cloth cot with a metal frame, battered footlocker, floor is the same mud that squelched underfoot outside the tent
>and in the corner is a desk occupied by a figure you don’t quite comprehend at first
>it’s facing away from you, hunched forward over the desk so you can’t quite see how tall it is
>but it’s big, with gangly limbs and a wide ill-proportioned torso clad in a gray uniform that rides tight across the shoulders, but lank at the waist
>only when it raises its head to swivel furry brown ears back toward you do you understand
>the thing at the desk is a werewolf-soldier
>you'd heard stories of the Deutschreich's genetic super-soldiers
>they kill without mercy
>entire towns slaughtered
>the bodies eaten
>and now one is staring you down with one eye
>blocky head turned aside so it can see you
>and you can see its mouth drawn back in a low ground that shows sharp teeth
>it stands up straighter, with a weirdly elongated neck
>"Das wurde auch Zeit."
>your mouth hangs open as you try to work out what it said
>its voice is a rasping growl that sounds unnatural
>it's asking you something
>but you barely know any Deutsch
>the wolf-soldier growls louder
>"Komm her."
>it jabs a clawed finger at the ground beside it
>that one you understand
>reluctantly you take a step closer to the sergeant
>it just growls and jabs again
>"Hier. Dummkopf."
>it barks at you and you take another step closer
>and another
>until it can reach out its gangly arm and drag you over to its side
>now that you're closer you can see the dog-thing is definitely a she, not an it
>the outline of breasts visible through her uniform
>two pairs, one in the normal place, and another smaller set beneath
>she hooks her arm around your neck and pulls you against her body, the low rumbling growl never stopping as your face gets acquainted with her chest
>"Das ist besser. Sei still, Amerikaner."
>the sergeant stinks
>sweat and dirt and some strange musk totally alien to you
>you squirm and push against her grip, but she goes on poring over the maps and papers scattered over the desk
>muttering and growling and huffing and grunting
>every once in a while rolling her heavy shoulders and mashing your face into the sweat-stained uniform even more
>whatever she wants with you, this werewolf seems content to hold you while she works
>the roll of her grumbling growl stops just a moment for her to lean her head down
>press the cold wet snout against the crook of your neck and sniff deeply
>"Braver jungen."
>she shudders
>then presses the flat top of her boxy-shaped head against your face to rub her matted fur on your cheek
>when she's done with the odd display of affection she goes back to her work
>muttering and reading and ignoring your awkward squirming and shallow breathing
>you're still not used to her stench
>but you have plenty of time to get accustomed
>trapped under her arm for who knows how long
>she repeats the ritual of sniffing and nuzzling you
>but every time she gets more forceful with it
>and she’s doing it more and more often
>the sun sets outside the tent
>you're glad for a reprieve from the oppressive heat
>you're sure your captor is too, by the way her panting slows down as the air gets cooler
>but as the panting slows, the sniffing gets more intense
>the growling more pronounced
>the paw hooked lazily around your shoulder now holds you with more purpose
>she gropes your chest, raking claws over it
>feels like she’s going to tear through your shirt
>you whine and pull away from the werewolf-soldier
>the arm around your shoulder clamps down hard to prevent your escape
>she growls
>"Noch nicht. Nein, noch nicht."
>you shudder as the groping paw works its way down
>snagging the hem of your shirt to tug at it
"P-please. They just said I could have something to eat."
>the sergeant stops her idle molestation
>she makes a questioning 'wuff' sound
>then snorts in obvious amusement when she looks down and sees the field ration you hold in one hand
>it's ripped from your grip and tossed aside
>the small box makes a 'splat' on the mud floor of the tent
>"Ich werde dir etwas zu essen geben."
>the sergeant pulls her paw back up your body
>first to your relief, even if she continues prodding and groping, at least she's not yanking your clothes off
>that massive paw stops on your shoulder
>you breath out a sigh
>that turns into a gasp when she sends you sprawling to the ground with a harsh shove
>when you pick your head up, it's to see more brown fur than you were ready for
>the sergeant has undone her trousers and yanked them down to her thighs
>from your position you can see her cunt and asshole as she half-squats over you
>the oddly proportioned slit twitching and leaking
>her brush tail lifted to afford you easy access
>the werewolf-soldier snarls out her first words in English
>"Eet."
>you try to pick yourself up, pushing off the ground
>but as you take one foot, the sergeant lashes out with a leg and kicks you back into the mud
>"Runter!"
>you grunt in pain, the heavy blow knocking the wind out of you
>the growling goes on
>"Lick et. Or elss."
>she reaches a paw back and grips her cheek, yanking it aside to show you exactly what she wants you to do
>you lick your lips nervously and shuffle forward on your knees
>this is entirely alien
>you haven't even done anything with a human woman
>this wolf-woman thing expects you to--
>the paw jumps from her cheek to your head, grabbing a fistful of hair and mashing your face into her ass
>if you thought the stink of her shirt was bad, the musk of her ass is even worse
>fur matted with sweat and dirt rubs on your face and your nose is forced against her asshole
>with mouth hanging open you get a mouthful of werewolf cunt
>it tastes of salt and sour sweat
>you almost gag on it, but a warning growl from sergeant scares you into action
>sloppily, you drag your tongue over the slit, over and back
>you hope the rumbling sound from the sergeant is one of satisfaction
>the way her tail starts wagging over your head says so
>your hair is released, and the sergeant leans over the desk
>she growls and huffs, muttering to herself as she seems to continue her work while you lap at her
>you hold onto her thighs for stability as she grinds and sways her hips
>forced to breath through your nose fills your head with her musk, unpleasant at first, but easier to stomach as you go on pleasuring the beast
>"Ja...ja..."
>the werewolf croons in an almost-human sounding voice as you explore the burning depth of her vulva with your tongue
>she shivers and goes on doing whatever work it is she's doing
>whenever you slack off with a sore tongue and aching jaw, the sergeant makes you redouble your efforts with a warning growl
>over time the sergeant hunches over the desk lower and lower
>her satisfied huffs and growls get faster and louder
>you hear paper tearing and the ripple of claws going through something solid
>the sergeant presses her weight down on you hard
>your face is soaked in her juices as she spasms
>she lets out a loud growl that's half-way to a howl
>then she falls back, squashing you flat onto your back under her bulk
>what little you could see disappears beneath her
>nearly the entire weight of the oversized canine is sitting on your face
>suffocating you with her stink
>your arms pinned beneath thighs which you beat against inefectually
>the sergeant grinds on your face, going on with her half-howl and ignoring your plight
>you head was already swimming with her musk, but now you're drowning in it
>can't breath
>crushed
>strangled
>until the sergeant lets out one last satisfied huff and rolls off you
>you both lay panting on the ground, each catching breath for different reasons
>fresh air never tasted so good
>the sergeant stirs first, you hear the shuffle of her uniform and the clatter of her buckle
>"Dummkopf. Du hast meine Uniform beschmutzt."
>you're assaulted by werewolf musk again as her discarded trousers are thrown over your face
>"You go kleen zem. Later."
>you're hauled off the ground by your collar
>the sergeant easily pulling you up with one paw
>the cold of her snout presses at your neck for her to take another deep sniff
>then she repeats the motion of rubbing her face against yours
>"Now. Take ze food. Eat. Wait on cot."
>you stand on shaky legs when she releases you, and glance over where she directed to
>you're happy to eat the field rations, but her other order...
"Wait? On the cot?"
>the sergeant has already stalked back to her desk
>waving a dismissive paw
>"Ja. Wait for sleep. I keepink you."

>The stench of rot and worse things stung her nose, even with her dulled human senses.
>It was a mausoleum, a place for the dead to rest free of molestation.
>A great stone edifice built specifically to ward away anyone who would desecrate the graves within.
>And yet, if the warden of this gravesite was to be believed, things were moving within.
>There had been sounds of feet, stone grinding on stone, and horrid, inhuman noises.
>The men they'd sent had not returned.
>So now they turned to her.
>She would take the bounty they offered, though she would have done the job for free.
>The stone entryway, unsealed for her by the grave keeper, stood before her.
>The stairs leading down were choked with blinding darkness.
>A barrier to some, but not her.
>She called on the beast, and its senses were hers.
>Her eyes, ears, and nose - the flesh of her face reshaping.
>The darkness gave way to her, and she took the first step.
>The cold of the stone sapped heat from her bare feet.
>Cobwebs hung from the carved ceiling, blowing in a faint breeze.
>The warmth of the sun slid from her back as she descended.
>Soon, the darkness swallowed her completely.
>In short order, the stairs gave way to the mausoleum floor.
>A long, wide hall with a tall ceiling and walls lined with sarcophaguses.
>The stench permeated the room, her sharpened nose wrinkling at the sweet-sour smell.
>There was something unnatural in the stagnant air, something that made her teeth grind and sharpen.
>At the far end of the hall, something moved.
>The gloom made even her enhanced eyesight struggle, but her ears were flawless.
>She heard ragged feet flapping on stone, nails scratching against the floor.
>Something was inside, with her.
>Someone or something had raided a burial site, then had hidden her.
>She needed no further prompting.
>She had lived too long - fought enough, killed enough, nearly died enough - to know that hesitation was deadly.
>There were things in the world that were dangerous even to her kind and fates worse than death.
>Within herself, she called out to the beast, and with a snarl, the change exploded out of her.
>Her little clothing, worn for decency's sake alone, was shorn to pieces as her height doubled, and her body swelled with dense, rippling muscle.
>Fur sprouted from her in a thick coat, her face stretching into a muzzle lined with long, pointed teeth.
>Her ears shot up to furred points, and her nails grew and thickened into dark, sharp claws.
>A shudder went down her spine as it lengthened, her tail whipping behind her in a blur.
>She snarled and growled; her teeth bared in challenge to whatever lurked in the darkness.
>Her bulk seemed to fill the hall, the claws of her toes scoring the stone floor.
>Her ears brushed the ceiling, and through them, she heard everything.
>Or she would have had not all sound save her heavy breathing gone silent.
>The mausoleum had gone still and quiet, her heart pounding deafeningly loud in her ears.
>Rage nipped at her, and she barked her challenge again - a dark, feral sound deep within her.
>This time, something answered.
>A low, wet, sick groan that laid heavily upon her mind.
>Her fur stood on end.
>This was no mere graverobber.
>The thing hauled itself from the darkness from behind the endmost crypt.
>It may have been among the living once or been born from some evil force.
>Whatever its origin, what it was now was unspeakable.
>A hideous, bloated mass, squirming with malevolent hunger.
>Raw and ragged strips of muscle dragged its bulk like the arms of a horrid sea monster.
>Its maw - no head and barely a mouth, but a gash lined with jagged bone - yawned open.
>For an instant, she feared.
>To her kind, physical wounds were fleeting - her moon-blessed flesh closed as soon as it was cleaved.
>Though their reputation would lead others to believe they were beyond death, they were not immortal.
>They feared the touch of silver, for it burned and weakened them and was their greatest weakness.
>Magic was a concern, for it could do that which mundane arms could not.
>A curse could debilitate and destroy more thoroughly than any injury, and enchantments could beguile even their proud and savage hearts.
>As the heaving abomination lurched toward her, hissing and gurgling wetly, she feared it.
>But it was only for an instant, rage swallowing fear, fueling her fiery spirit.
>She had chosen this path, and if death awaited her at the end of it, then so be it.
>She would drag this filth into death's waiting jaws if it was the last thing she did.
>Her final gift to all life and decency.
>With a sound of fury, she dove at her enemy, feeling oily, fetid meat part in her hands.
>It bellowed in agony as her claws tore into it, its appendages coiling about her, crushingly strong.
>She felt her bones creak in its grip, biting back a howl of pain.
>Savagery overtook her, and she set upon the monster with wild abandon, swiping and pounding.
>The walls echoed with the din of combat, soon coated with the beast's stinking gore.
>As they struggled, she could see why common folk would not have bested this monster.
>Even with her great strength, she could feel the beast resisting.
>More worrisome, it seemed tireless, and it possessed nothing vital to strike at - it was not but stinking, writhing meat.
>She brought her fists down upon it in a hammer strike and it flattened gelatinously.
>A festering cist boiled over and burst, spraying her with something that stuck and burned.
>She leaped away, retreating back to the stairway door, raking at the wounded flesh.
>It reared its full height, from floor to ceiling, bellowing unholy fury.
>The burning ichor that seeped through her fur scalded and seared her.
>She was no stranger to pain; this was nothing compared to some wounds she'd suffered.
>Still, the beast was proving to be troublesome.
>Most foes would have crumpled beneath her assault, unable to bear her wrath.
>Yet this thing remained unshaken, more angered than injured.
>She could not allow it to escape.
>The damage it could cause would be unthinkable.
>It either died at her hands, or she would bury it in this tomb.
>There was no other acceptable outcome.
>It lunged for her with shocking speed, but she was ready.
>She met its charge head-on, the force of their clash rattling the chamber.
>It gnashed its broken, uneven teeth at her, grimy phlegm dirtying her coat further.
>She caught the creature fast with one hand, digging her claws in deep, and pulled back a clenched fist.
>Her muscles swelled and bulged as she demanded more of the wolf.
>She struck lightning fast, and the creature sailed backward, cratering the back wall with the force of its impact.
>The wet sound of its body against the stone was satisfyingly visceral.
>She whined as her swollen limb receded to merely hulking, the wolf withdrawing the added strength.
>She was going to pay for that later.
>She was greatly taxing herself and the wolf to keep the monster in check.
>And if her senses did not deceive her, even a blow such as that did not manage to kill it.
>She would have to entertain the possibility that it was beyond death.
>Inconvenient, but not an unfamiliar complication.
>She'd fought and bested allegedly "unkillable" foes before.
>A few of which she'd left begging for death.
>This time would be no different.
>Before the monster could rise again, she made for one of the sarcophaguses.
>Wrenching its top away, revealing a distressingly empty recess where a body should lie, she hefted the lid.
>With a raging snarl, she hurled the heavy stone lid at her enemy.
>It lands with a clamor of putrid flesh being pulped between stone meeting stone.
>There is silence for a moment before she hears it - the writhing and groaning of evil yet living.
>Another slab of rock is lifted - another missing body - and slung at the stubborn fiend.
>The silence hangs longer this time, and she is tempted to claim victory.
>But she cannot be certain.
>The thing seems mindless, but she had met "mindless" things before that possessed cunning.
>Cunning enough to feign defeat only to strike when her back was turned.
>This presented her with a dilemma.
>Either her foe was well and truly bested, and she could walk away without concern.
>Or it was lying in wait for her guard to fall.
>Further complicating matters was her transformation.
>She was too big to fit the stairs.
>To leave the tomb would require relinquishing the wolf's strength.
>Leaving her disadvantaged should the monster strike unexpectedly.
>Worse, it may rush over her, escaping up the stairs and onto the surface.
>Even with her in pursuit, the risk of it escaping and harming others was too great.
>This left her with little option.
>She could not remain in the place, forever pushing back the creature.
>She would need to assume her human shape to climb the stairs.
>Leaving her unable to change shape and with her back to her enemy.
>When she was younger and had first received the moon's blessing, she could not have imagined how often spacing and timing would be an issue.
>Resigned, and with no choice, she allowed the wolf to wander and felt its strength fade.
>The change from beast to man was never entirely pleasant but worsened with exhaustion.
>She shrank rapidly, her gore-fouled coat falling to the floor in a ring of dark hair.
>In a moment, she was a human woman again.
> At that moment, she felt totally exposed, and not from her lack of dress.
>And now for the hard part.
>She was hesitant to turn her back on an enemy.
>But still, she had to move.
>The instant her foot touched the bottommost step, she ran.
>Up, up she ran, hoping to make for the surface before her foe could recover.
>To her dismay, she heard the sound of movement behind her in the chamber.
>The sound of heavy stones being thrown aside.
>Her heart hammered in her chest, pounding against her ribs.
>The stench seemed to be attacking her, fouling every breath she took.
>She feared slipping, falling back into a waiting monster's maw, or becoming trapped beneath the earth.
>She could see the light up above growing brighter, closer.
>The thing behind her was enraged, groaning and gurgling.
>She could hear it growing closer, heaving its grotesque mass up the stairs behind her.
>She thought of home and family.
>Of friends and familiar faces.
>Hot food and cold drinks.
>Anything to keep her legs moving and herself ahead of the nightmare behind.
>The instant she felt the sun on her sweat-slicked skin, she called desperately for the wolf.
>She was changing before she reached the last step, her furred bulk bursting from the mausoleum door.
>She whirled, churning grass and soil beneath her heel, and without glancing down into that horrible murk...
>Brought both of her great fists down on the entryway.
>It rumbled, quaked, and with an outpouring of dust and pulverized stone, collapsed.
>The last she ever heard of that wretched thing was a dream-haunting groan.
>Exhausted - thoroughly spent - she retreated a good twenty paces from the collapsed edifice before allowing herself to collapse.
>She had won.

>Be you
>Stressed as fuck
>Working yourself to the bone
>Scorching hot day tomorrow
>Decide to take the day off and unwind at the beach
>After all, you deserve a reward, don’t you?
>Pack up all your beach stuff and head out
>It’s only about an hour or so away from your house
>Make it there
>As expected, it’s pretty crowded today
>Fortunately, you manage to find a space with not many people around
>Lay down your towel, umbrella, and cooler
>The first thing you’re gonna do is lay back and relax a bit
>In fact, you apparently relax a little too well
>You fall asleep somewhere along the line
>When you come to, your turn your head to the side, eyes barely open
>You only faintly make out three figures standing nearby you
>When you do, however, you lurch up with a start and a yelp
>This elicits giggling from the three watching you
>You turn back to them
>They’re a group of anthro girls
>Specifically, from left to right, a calico cat, a shark, and a poodle
>The calico shows a lot of fur,
>Her black-and-red checkered bra barely topping off just above the nipples of her roughly C-cup breasts
>Her matching panties also wrap tightly around her waist, threatening a camel toe at any moment
>As far as women go, she’s a smidge on the chubbier side, slight but noticeable muffin top spilling over her bottoms, which also leads to some pudge on the thighs, too
>Not that this makes her unattractive, mind you, it’s just something you noticed
>Besides that, she’s a typical calico, markings and all
>Next to her was a shark
>She was light blue in color and holding a green surfboard with white stripes
>She shows a fair bit less off with her outfit, too
>It’s just a one-piece red swimsuit, kind of like a lifeguard would wear
>What she lacks in immodesty, though, she more than makes up for muscle mass and height
> First off, she’s huge, about a head or two taller than her compatriots
>She’s probably taller than most of the basketball players you knew back in high school
>And stronger than them, too
>You heard sharks tend to be stronger than most other species out there, but this is frankly ridiculous
>Seriously, she’s built like a semi-truck
>You’re pretty sure your biceps couldn’t ever grow to half the size of hers
>Her thighs look like they can crush boulders
>And her abdomen looks like it could break the hand of any man stupid enough to try and punch it
>That’s not to say she’s completely masculine, though,
>Her chest, while smaller than the other two’s, was still visibly pushing against her swimsuit
>Her hips also curved out, subtly but more so than a man’s would
>Finally, on the right side of the shark is a poodle woman
>Her fur’s a bright-pinkish white, but it’s mostly been shaven off save for the head, neck, wrists, and ankles
>Her uncovered skin is grey with a slight purple-tint
>She’s wearing one of those golden bikinis that are en vogue now
>It seems that, just from looking at her at a glance, at least, she’s the one who takes the most care of her appearance
>Her hair fur’s nice and condition, not a hair out of place
>Her skin’s blemish-free and completely smooth
>And she’s generally much more skinny than the calico and more dainty than the shark, though she still fills out her bikini
>Regardless of their differences, though, they all share the pleasure of haughtily laughing at you much to your embarrassment
>You grimace
>”H-hey, what’s so funny?” You indignantly stammer
>They quell their laughter somewhat, at least enough to speak clearly with you
>”Oi, mate,” the shark says, still snickering, “No need to get upset, now. We’re just playing with ya!”
>”Yeah!” the calico chimes in, “We, like, totally don’t mean anything by it, man.”
>”Pleeze,” the poodle adds, “Do not be zo angry wiz uz.”
>The group walks toward you, and you shrink back slightly in apprehension
>”It’s just, y’know, human boys, like, don’t really come to this beach that often? So, like, of course we’re curious?”
>”Oui! And when we zcared you zo, we couldn’t ‘elp but laugh. Pleeze, forgeeve uz. We deedn’t mean to startle you.”
>The three stop, the shark towering above you, and the other two not seeming much smaller
>”What’s yer name, mate?”
>”U-uh… Anon.”
>”Anon… Anon! Hah! I like it! ‘S got a nice ring to it. Name’s Sydney, but most call me Syd.”
>”You can call me Carina.”
>”And I am Paulette. Pleezed to meet you, monsieur.”
>You scan the three of them once more
>They’re a bit on the… eccentric side, but none of them seem anything close to malicious
>Your annoyance subsides and you relax a bit
>”Oh, well, uh… Nice to meet you girls.”
>Syd gives you a playful tap on the shoulder
>”Pleasure’s all ours. Say, mate, I have the perfect thing to welcome a newbie to our beach: ICE CREAM!”
>”O-oh, no. That’s really not necessary, Syd. I can bu-”
>”Nonsense! I insist! Carina, Paulette, keep the boy company while go fetch him a cone!”
>”’Course!”
>”Azz you weesh!”
>Syd goes off to get your ice cream, and Carina and Paulette subsequently plops down by your sides
>They both look pretty good, but regardless, it makes you feel pretty uncomfortable
>”So, Anon, like, where are you from?”
>”Huh? O-oh, I’m from Greeneport, about an hour from here.”
>”Oh, Greeneport. I’ve veezeeted ze mall zere. Eet eez quite nize.”
>Despite their attempts at being casual, their proximity to you makes you feel on edge
>”Uh… W-would you two mind backing up a bit?”
>The two of them look shocked to hear it
>”Back up? But, like, why? We like being close to you.”
>”Oui! Eet’s been too long zeence we’ve met a ‘uman like you.”
>Now you’re starting to get weirded out
>Now you’re starting to get weirded out
>But before you can say anything else…
>”I’m back!”
>That was faster than you expected
>You sigh in relief
>From your limited interaction with them, it seems Syd is the leader of this little posse, so maybe she can get them to back off
>She holds a vanilla ice cream cone, already slightly melted
>It must be hotter than you thought
>Syd bends forward and reaches it toward you
>”Sorry, Anon, it was either this or pistachio, and I’d wager you’d rather have this than that.”
>”Uh, don’t worry about. Vanilla’s fine.”
>You reach towards her to grab. Just when you’re about to, however…
>”Whoops!”
>A surge of cold hits your body as the cone falls onto your chest, down your stomach, and onto your shorts
>You cringe
>”Ah, silly me! Sorry, mate! Here, let me get that for you!”
>Before you process what’s happening, Syd starts licking the ice cream off of you
>You sputter, too shocked even tell her to stop
>Meanwhile, the others do and say nothing
>Carina on your left side, Paulette on your right
>Both gently squeeze one of your arms in one hand and your shoulder in the other
>You’re flabbergasted that this happened to you, let alone by people you just met
>Before you know it, though, she’s already stopped, your body completely clean of ice cream
>”There. Now, isn’t that one way to beat the heat?”
>She chuckles at her own quip
>The others, though, merely pout instead
>”C’mon, Syd. We should, like, totally have a turn with him, y’know?”
>”Oui! We want ‘im az bad az you do.”
>Syd gives an exasperated eye-roll
>”Ah, fine. One moment.”
>You yelp again as she smears more ice cream across body
>This time, though, Carina laps it
>Then Paulette after she’s done
>Then Syd again
>The process continues on
>Ice cream
>Licking
>Ice cream
>Licking
>Until there’s only a small nub of ice cream left in the cone
>”Well, doubt we’ll get anything more from this, now will we?”
>She tosses the cone up in the air and snaps it in her mouth, devouring it in seconds
> You’re shivering, both from the ice cream and trying to process what just happened
>”Gee, Syd, you were right. Human boys are, like, totally easy!”
>To punctuate her statement, Carina plants a kiss on your cheek
>Before anyone could say or do anything else, Paulette pipes up!
>”OH! Zeelly me! How could I forget? Zunzcreen!”
>She goes over and pulls out a bottle of sunscreen
>”I weesh my delicate paws could do this myself, but alas, zey cannot. If only ‘zere was a ‘uman around ‘ere who could ‘elp me.”
>She gives a dramatic, fake swoon while peering over at you
>Your turn toward Syd, who gives a slight sardonic smirk
>”I-I don’t…
>”Give her what she wants, mate.”
>”B-but…”
>She gives a slight snarl
>”Anon…”
>Deciding you’d rather not piss off a Herculean shark woman, you take the bottle from Paulette
>”Really? You’ll do it? Oh, merci, Anon! Merci!”
>Almost immediately, she gets in position
>She lies on her stomach, showing her back, ass, calves, and soles
>You hesitate slightly, but get to work
>You start by lathering her shoulders and back in it
>”OOH! Zat feels good. You zee, my zkeen eez very zenzeeteeve, it requires special lotions made only by-”
>”-Ugh, Paulette, you’re gonna, like, kill him of boredom with your dumb skincare talk. Be quiet.”
>She shoots Carina a glare and mutters something in French
>You finish her back and move down to her…
>Oh no
>The bottom of her golden bikini is riding up her crack really noticeably, and that combined her ass’s impressive size and shape makes it very…
>Distracting
>You try to make it stop, but it’s too late
>An erection forms in your swim shorts
>Now, you only hope that-
>”OMG, ANON! Is that what I think it is?”
>...Shit
>”Hey, Syd! Look! Anon’s hard! He’s totally into this!”
>Your face burns red with humiliation
>Syd just gives a smirk and a scoff
>”What’d I tell ya, girls? Humies will deny it ‘til the cows come home, but at the end of the day, they’ll always kneel to anthro pussy.”
>You look away, dripping in humiliation
>”Erm, who said stop, mate? Keep going.”
>With great reluctance, you massage the sunscreen into her ass
>You try to get it done as quickly and as decidedly non-pervertedly as possibly
>Of course, the little moans she letting out aren’t helping matters either
>But all the same, you finish, leaving you to only do her legs before being finished with her back
>You run your arms across her well-toned thighs and calves
>You bite your lip, trying - and failing - to hide your arousal
>Before she flips to her front, she raises her right foot in the air
>”A keez, s’il vous plait?”
>You look up at Syd
>She merely motions for you to continue
>Again with reluctance, you give a quick peck on her sole
>And another on the left foot
>Finally, she turns around
>You gulp, knowing you’ll have to get even more intimate with her now
>You start at her shoulders and upper chest, avoiding the obvious problem area
>You try to avoid the uncomfortable part and go straight for the stomach
>”Um, aren’t you, like, forgetting something, Anon?”
>As if to answer Carina’s question, Paulette, Lifts her bra up
>”’Ere.”
>Here perky nipples are on full display, along with the rest of her ample breasts
>You sigh
>You begin rubbing them down with the lotion
>She lets out a high-pitched whine
>Her face stiffens, and she stares at you with lust
>You try to focus only on the task at hand
>They’re really soft
>And bounce nicely as you knead into them
>Under better circumstances, you’d probably enjoy this a lot more
>In any case, you finish relatively quickly
>Paulette looks up to you, panting, eyes half-lidded
>You (foolishly) hope this isn’t going where you think it’s going
>You get to her stomach and rub the lotion in at the top
>Then lower
>Then lower
>And then too low for her to take anymore
>”PUTAIN! I can’t take eet anymore!”
>Paulette lunges for your wrist and pulls you in
>She forces your mouth onto hers and then forces her tongue onto yours
>You feel an aroused moan vibrate into your mouth down into your throat
>You look back as you feel her pulling your swim shorts down
>At the same time, she’s pulling her bottoms down too
>Both pieces of clothing stop around your respective knees, leaving your guilty erection rubbing against her clit
>”Paulette, I…”
>”No words! Fuck me! NOW!”
>Feeling like you’ve gone way to say no now, you enter her
>She lets out a trill of ecstasy as you do so
>”Gosh, Paulette, you’re, like, a total slut?”
>”HA! She’s got ya there, Paulie.”
>”FAIRE TAIRE! Don’t stop, Anon, please!”
>You start fucking her in earnest, slipping in and out of her
>She moans and squeaks with every thrust
>Despite yourself, you find yourself getting into it
>One hand pressing on her breast, and the other rubbing down her legs
>You watch her tits bounce as you fuck her
>You two get closer and closer until you’re there
>fingers and lips locked, both of you finish, bodies tensing as you orgasm
>You pull out and flop beside her, panting
>She’s in a similar state to you but takes a significantly shorter time to recover
>Again, you open your eyes and see the three standing above you
>”Oooh, ‘e’z good. We peecked a good one today, girlz.”
>”Yeah, and he’d probably be even better if ya didn’t take his load for yaself!”
>Paulette, gives a haughty arm cross and turns her nose
>”I deedn’t zee you two voyeurz try and ztop me. I zink ze fault is on you.”
>”We shouldn’t have to try and stop ya! That’s the rule! We all talk about who gets the load first!”
>”Girls, girls, don’t fight. I know a way we can, like, wait for his load to come back. While also getting my turn?”
>”Hey, uh… D-don’t I get a say in this?”
>They all laugh like you just said the most hilarious thing ever
>
>You find yourself buried in the sand, right up to your neck
>Tightly
>”So, Anon, you ever watch the movie Creepshow?”
>Carina’s met with an annoyed elbow to the sidearm for that
>”Ow! It was, like, so just a joke. Chill out and stuff.”
>”Why are you doing this?” you finally gather the courage to ask. “What gives you the right to treat me like this?”
>This only elicits more snickering
>”Mate, this is our beach. Why d’ya think no one bothered us while you were going down on Paulette?”
>”Yeah, and that means everything on it’s our property, including you? Duh?”
>”Ze truz eez, monsieur, zat you forfeit your body ze moment you walked on ze sand
>”And besides, don’t act like ya don’t like it.”
>”Oui, no one would fuck me like zat eef zey deedn’t.”
>You can’t believe your ears
>It’s bad enough they’re treating you like their toy, but claiming you as property?
>That’s it
>As soon as these bitches let you out of their sight, you’re making a mad dash out to your car
>You hope they will soon…
>”Oh, and speaking of - my turn!”
>...But you probably shouldn’t hold your breath on that
>Wasting no time, Carina takes her panties off and throws them to the side
>”Y’know, full disclosure, I always thought the idea of a guy all trapped and helpless and unable to stop me from doing whatever was like, super hot.”
>She walks over to you, her slight pudge jiggling with each step
>She pinches your nose between her toes
>”HA! Got your nose!”
>The others giggle almost childishly at this play of an infantile trick
>”Okay, but seriously, I’m not really one for foreplay, so like…”
>She turns around and squats down, putting your eyes level to her taint, just below her anus
>”...Just dig in!”
>Buried in sand, about to eat out a chubby calico while her friends watch (One of which you just got done fucking)
>You’ve always been a bit of a worst-case-scenario thinker, but you don’t think you could have anticipated this
>Still, again, pissing off a buff shark lady and her horny friends isn’t really a good idea at the best of times, much less when you don’t have access to your limbs
>So, in spite of the indignity of it all, you crane your neck as close to Carina as possible and start licking her lower labia
>”Ooooh, yeah, that’s it. That’s the stuff.”
>She shimmies back a bit, giving you easier access
>To the best of your ability, you swirl your tongue all around
>You’re not at all, experienced in giving cunnilingus, but you’re able to judge her sweet spots by the noises she makes when you press a certain spot
>”Oh, yeah dude… You’re killing it.”
>Eventually, she decides to give you even easier access
>She gets on her hands and knees, and presses her ass right to your forehead
>You vision disappears as your eyes get covered by her white, black and orange fur
>Your nose is up close and personal with her, making the smell overwhelming
>You try to focus only on licking and less on breathing as you try to finish quickly
>Mulitple little eeps and ahs escape Carina as you eat her out
>Carina throws her head back and lets out a delighted croon as she cums
>She pants, not unlike you and Paulette did when you finished with her
>She stands up, freeing your face and letting take a gasp of fresh air
>”Wow, Paulette, you were right, we, like, won the lottery of boys here.”
>”You ever doubted my judgement?”
>The two of them share a laugh as Syd walks up to you
>”Well, then, seems like there’s only me left to please.”
>With one fell swoop, she plunges her hand into the sand, pulls you out and carries you bridal style
>It’s honestly kind of impressive
>”You sure look sandy. Why don’t we head into the water and rinse ya off.”
>The other two turn back to you and Syd, slightly concerned
>”Wait, hold up, seriously? Him? In water? You’re joking, right?”
>”Boyz can ‘ardly ‘andle you on land, much lezz on zee. Are you zure?”
>”Relax, you too. I’ll be extra gentle with twiggy here. Now come on, we’re going for a little swim.”
>You really don’t like what they can mean by that, but regardless, Syd drags you off into the water
>Deeper
>Deeper
>Until you’re holding onto her as your feet no longer touch the ground
>You get worryingly far out
>You can hardly even see anyone on the shore now
>”Uh, Syd…”
>”Uh-uh, no whining now! You can swim, can’t ya?”
>”Well, yeah, but…”
>”Good! This will make this next part better”
>Gently, she shifts her massive arms away from you, giving you enough time to find comfortable space to start swimming
>”Easy, easy…”
>Eventually, the two of you decouple completely, you and her floating about a foot apart
>”Y’see, unlike those two bimbos, I like to have a little fun with my food before the main action starts, so here’s the deal: I give ya, say, a two minute headstart to swim to shore before I catch ya. If you win, you get to go home, no more of us up your arse. When- sorry, if I win, well… I’m sure you can guess.”
>You already have a few ideas, actually
>”Time starts now. Good luck!”
>She dives into the water before you can say anything
>Hardly seems like a fair challenge
>You, puny human, against a shark, and a very fit one at that
>But you guess that’s sort of the point
>Still, you’re hardly just gonna give the win to her
>So you swim
>Even though you’re not good at it, you try your hardest to go as fast as you can
>And you make good distance
>Or, at least, you think you do
>Until you feel something between your legs
>Or rather, a lack of something
>You freeze as you notice you swimshorts are gone
>You turn, and what else do you see but Syd there, holding them in your teeth
>”I win.”
>She spits them into her hand before wrapping her girthy arms around you
>”And you know what that means!”
>She sandwiches your dick between her thighs, rolling it until it’s erect again
>Her arms force your head against her chest, where the softness of her tits contrast nicely with the iron-hardness of the rest of her body
>When she’s had her fill of teasing you, she spreads her legs, removes her suit out of the way, and positions your dick against her labia
>You try to say something, but she cuts you off
>”Ah! Less talky, more fucky, yeah?”
>With one arm still wrapped around you, she grabs you by the hips with her other enormous hand and starts making you thrust into her
>This time, though, you’re the one making lots of noise, grunting and gasping while Syd holds her smug stare steady, like it’s nothing to her
>Which it probably is
>Once again, before you know it, the time arrives to cum again
>You do so, groaning loudly as you throw your head back, feeling more drained than ever
>If Syd also came, she doesn’t do anything to say it, merely smirking in satisfaction as you finish inside her
>”Oops, I’m afraid that’s a loss. Sorry, Anon, better luck next time.”
>Carrying you like a surfboard, Syd makes it back to the shore with you in tow
>When you get back, you see Carina and Paulette, going through you bag
>”Oh hey, you’re back! Is the dude, like, in one piece and stuff.”
>”Course he is! I told you I wouldn’t break him, didn’t I?”
>”Wait… What are you doing in my bag?”
>”Oh, nozeeng too bad. Lookeeng for eenformation. Zat we found.”
>”Infor...mation?
>”Yeah, y’know, full name? Address? Phone number? That sorta thing? Don’t worry, Syd, we got it all.”
>”Bonzer!”
>”Wait, what do you need my information for?
>”Why do ya think? So we can visit ya later.”
>”Yeah! You think we’d just forget about after a taste like that? You’re, like, the best submissive guy we met in years.”
>This isn’t ending today
>It might not ever end
>Dear God, why?
>”Well, Anon, we’d love to stay and fuck you more, but we gotta volleyball tourney a ways down the beach.”
>”Zut, zat was today?”
>”OMG, I, like, totally forgot!”
>”Well, unforget it, cuz we’re going. Later, Anon! See you either tonight or tomorrow. Be ready to serve more either way.”
>”Adieu!”
>”Like, later days!”
>You watch as the three of them walk off casually
>Dazed
>Confused
>Unsure of what even happened
>You absentmindedly start packing up and preparing to leave
>Only one thought lingers in your head
>I really should have gone to fucking work today!
