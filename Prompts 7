ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

I just want an Anthrostate wife who realizes how fucked the system is and just wants to smooch comfortably on the couch in between long days of work at the plant. Is that so wrong to ask?

>Late evening lounging with waifur.
>"Hey! I didn't ask you how your day was!"
Uggh. I don't want to think about it.
>She lowers her paws down your arm to reach your hand.
>"Oh no! Did the girls give a rough time again?"
They were all pressing up against me, demanded I let them dress me and forced me to let them put my tools in my belt and pockets. I don't know how they think up of new lines to cross!
>"I'm so sorry honey. This is my fault."
Pff, hardly.
>"No! I thought spooning you last night would leave enough of my scent to ward them off."
*sigh* It's alright. That was very nice.
"Sweetie..."
>She takes your face in her paws and stares directly into your eyes.
>"I'm going to make love to you every night from now on. Trust me. Those anthro girls will give you your space knowing I've claimed you, completely."

>everyone knows stories of giant war-kangaroos and monkey-men from the badlands are fake
>looks like there really is nothing good on right now
>you give the remote one last click and hope for the best
>then groan in miserable disappointment as the last channel you check is showing 'The Big Flea-bang Theory'

“Ssshhhhh shhhhh... it’s alright. I did promise to be home on time I’m sorry Mia”
>you said comforting her. Her muscles giving way for being softer, and now gently twisting side to side
>poor girl, poor- big lovable girl
>summoning all of your mightiness, you heave your 7’2 beeg girl to the couch. Plopping yourself down with her on top of you like those weighted blankets
>”mmm... don’t let go... my fur is still Kuhn... a little streaked- and I’m embarrassed”
“You’re fine, you can hold me like this as long as you need. I’m not going anywhere. Besides. We have all weekend to do what we want.”
>”I’d like that, love...”
>Mia doesn’t say anything more. Allowing you to lay there and stroke her back fur that doubles as this mane-like hair that goes all the way up to her head
>the plume of fluff you can’t keep your hands off of

>but for now. Hunger is starting to set in
“It’s about time for us to have something to eat. Do you want takeout? Anything you want as a home late apology”
>she shuffled on top of you a bit. Still embarrassed at her outburst today. No matter how many times you say that she never has to be embarrassed around you when it comes to this stuff. She always feels shame after her episodes
>you wished she didn’t feel ashamed for these things, especially since they remind you about how much she loves you
>”don’t get anything just because of me, but... takeout sounds good, yeah”
>there was a silence. A peaceful serene kind of silence that normally meant she was happy

“What’s that Mia?”
>another murmur but you can make out “for a snack”

“One more time babe”
>”I wanna have that DICK for a snack OKAY? I said it, when we’re done- you, me, broken bed, got it?”
>she blurted the normally white fur on that cute as fuck cheese wedge of a snout has this pink undertone coming up from underneath
“One order of your lo mein, teriyaki, and your boyfriend coming up”
>your teasing does not go undistrubed, her tail is standing upright at this point. Along with most of her food
>”stop making fun of me! You owe me for making me sad mister!!!”

>fleabag has a weird dream
>it starts in a forest, asche finding herself flanked on all sides by tall trees
>it's getting dark so she begins aimlessly wandering to find somewhere to rest
>she comes across a clearing with a cabin. the windows are covered by curtains but light is still visible behind them.

>the imitator says "oh, welcome asche. it's good that we can finally meet" in a cheerful tone
>just then, everything goes white and the aardwolf wakes up
>asche stares at the ceiling, wondering what games her subconscious is playing with her.

>”So remember everyone, happy employees mean happy customers. When you greet one of our valued customers do it with a smile and a friendly offer of assistance!” Your manager exclaims with a clearly forced grin
>God you hate these pre-shift meetings, nothing but wasted time and useless corporate propaganda
>”On three everyone! One, two, three!”
>”Wallyworld! Do it on the cheap!” Your fellow coworkers exclaim halfheartedly
>Your manager drops the fake smile, now replaced with her usual case of resting bitch face
>”I want to see more engagement with customers out there people. Stop being such antisocial rejects.” She mutters
>As usual you turn away and roll your eyes safely hidden from her gaze
>Another Monday, another workweek, another hellish 8 hours spent in this giant concrete prison masquerading as a superstore
>Hey, at least you get a two percent employee discount
>You walk with the rest of your coworkers out of the break room and onto the main floor
>Where to?
>Maybe you’ll go to the pet section and help some old lady put a bag of dog food into her cart
>Or maybe a trip to the electronics section to help some out of touch parent decide if their kid wants the Xstation or Playbox
>Or maybe…you’ll go to the usually deserted automotive section of the store and pretend to stock items until your shift is over
>Heh, ya, that sounds like a plan
>You casually saunter over to the oft forgotten section of the store and get to ‘work’ straightening items on shelves and doing your best to look busy, thankfully you’ve had plenty of practice
>While carefully rearranging a few cans of windshield cleaner there’s the clop of hooves and someone passes by you
>Whatever, they’re probably lost or something
>After very carefully straightening the last bottle so it’s label faced the aisle you stand up, look over and-
>Ah shit, your manager is at the opposite end of the aisle, arms crossed, staring right at you
>Your head turns in the opposite direction and there’s a cervine anthro a dozen feet down the aisle from you
>Looks to be a buck with a mighty set of antlers wearing a thick leather jacket, their back is facing you
>You look back to your manager and with the look on her face the message is clear, help the valued customer
>After a long sigh you walk up to the buck, put on your best customer pleasing smile, and say the corporate line
>”Welcome to Wallyworld, can I help you find something today sir?”
>The customer’s head shoots up from what they were looking at then he slowly turns to face you
>That’s…not a buck
>That’s a female reindeer based on the sizable breasts and thick eyeliner
>And that damn jacket hiding all of her curves from the back
>She looks at you with concentrated hatred
>”What…did you just call me, punk?” She spits with a husky feminine tone
>”Uhh-I-I didn’t-can I help you find something ma’am?” You awkwardly stutter in a futile attempt to save yourself
>Her eyes burn holes into you for a few seconds before she responds
>”No, I don’t think you can asshole.” She sneers
>With a swift movement she takes a bottle of oil off of the shelf and opens it, spilling its entire contents onto the floor
>”Oops, so sorry. Guess you’ll have to clean it up.” She says with a faux apologetic tone and malicious smile
>The reindeer tosses the empty bottle onto the floor and stomps away, the clops of her hooves almost deafening
>You look back to your manager, she’s shaking her head in disappointment
>Time to spend some time with your two dearest friends, the mop and bucket
>After slaving away to clean the oil spill you wipe the sweat off your brow and stow away the mop and bucket
>What a bitch
>Asshole
>Total cunt
>You can’t believe she did that just because of a simple misunderstanding
>God! How were you supposed to know she was female with those antlers of hers?!
>Whatever, she’s probably already left the store at this point
>Time to go chill out by the food section, restock some cereal, throw away some moldy bread or something
>After a few minutes of milling around you wander into the canned soup aisle
>You straighten a few cans and-
>”Excuse me sir? Do you think I should get the chicken noodle or the vegetable beef?”
>You turn around and yep, that’s the reindeer from before, her head shifts between the two cans of soup held in her hands
>What is this? Some kind of trick? She’s got to remember you from before
>”Well, uhh, I’ve always liked the chicken noodle.”
>She shakes her head in an affirmative
>”Ya, you know what I agree, the chicken noodle sounds way better than vegetable beef.”
>To your dismay she then tosses the can of vegetable beef behind her shoulder, it lands with a wet metallic thud, the contents spilled onto the floor
>”Thanks for the help bud.” She says, walking past you with a sly grin
>Un-fucking-believable
>What an asshole!
>With a defeated sigh your anger fades and once again you have a meeting with the mop and bucket
>After cleaning up the spill you decide on a new strategy
>You‘ll just roam from section to section trying to avoid running into that damned reindeer girl again, she’s clearly got it out for you
>First a few minutes folding clothes, then you restock some office supplies, and now a stroll through the cosmetic section
>Heh, there’s no way she’d expect you to be here-
>There’s a tap on your shoulder
>After stopping in your tracks you turn around and ya, there she is again
>How did she sneak up on you with a pair of hooves?!
>”Excuse me sir, could you point me to the antler polish?”
>”It’s right over there.” You flatly state, pointing to the row of products a few feet away
>”Thanks sir.” She says, strolling over to the row of glass bottles with a wiggle of the hips
>She makes eye contact with you, places a hand on one of the bottles, then begins slowly sliding it to the edge
>”Please…don’t.” You plead
>Her smile just grows wider
>The bottle is all the way to the edge, it begins to tip, it’s about to fall…
>Just as gravity begins to pull it downward you jump forward and fall to the floor! Barely managing to catch it before the bottle contacts the ground!
>You look up to the towering reindeer, a look of bewilderment on her face
>”Ha ha ha! You’re faster than I thought ya twirp.” She says with a cackle
>With your heart still racing she turns around and saunters off still chuckling
>After getting back on your feet you put the bottle of antler polish back on the shelf and gather your senses
>Okay, milling around the store clearly isn’t going to work
>That leaves the break room and bathroom as your only safe places
>You spend the rest of your shift switching between the two, thankfully no one seems the wiser
>Eventually the hours tick down and it’s time to clock out, thank god
>After putting on your jacket you step outside, the chilly winter air assaults your sense and inky darkness puts you on edge
>Left, right, no sign of the reindeer from before, good
>You parked around the side of the building, if you hug the wall on the walk over it’s doubtful many people would see you
>Slowly, quietly, you begin slinking over to your car
>Almost there, just have to-
>*CLOP-CLOP-CLOP*
>You look at the source of the sound just in time to see a tangle of pointy antlers rapidly rushing your position
>With a girlish scream you turn away and hug the wall
>Several points impact the wall on either side of your head but thankfully none go into your skull
>Slowly you open your eyes to see the reindeer from before staring at you, her wet black nose mere inches away
>Her breath comes out in wispy clouds that tickle your face
>”You punk! Thinking you could get away from me so easily! Cowering in the break room like a sniveling child.”
>”I’m sorry-I’m sorry-I’m sorry-I didn’t mean to call you sir please don’t kill me” You desperately repeat
>Her head moves away from yours and she crosses her arms
>”Happy employees, happy customers, right?”
>”H-how do you know that phrase?”
>”Used to work here. Hated it.” She says with a huff. “So tell you what, you’re an unhappy employee and I’m an unhappy customer. Why don’t we fix that?”
>You straighten your hunched posture and feel your heart slow
>”What do you mean?”
>”Well, I, umm, do have a problem you could help me with.”
>Sex, she wants you to fug her, gotta be
>”Uhh sure, just let me get my pants off here and-“
>”Ew! No!” She shouts, cutting you off. “I’m talking about…this.”
>She flashes a bottle of antler polish at you before quickly putting it back into her pocket
>”I need some help polishing my antlers.” She whispers. “It’s real hard to get the whole set by myself and none of my friends want to help. They think it’s weird helping a girl out with her antlers considering, well, you know, it’s mostly dudes that have them.”
>Still somewhat in shock you slowly shake your head up and down
>”Ya, sure, I’ll help you out…but what do I get out of it?”
>She cocks her head, an annoyed look on her face
>”You get to go home with only the holes you were born with. And I won’t tell your manager you’ve been slacking off all day.”
>”Okay, deal.”
>”Good, now follow me wageslave, you’ve got a long night head of you.”

>You stand in a queue at the Office of Anthro Relations.
>Ahead and behind you stand dozens of men
>All here for the exact same reason
>Each one of you holds in your hands a small collection of documents that amount to your life and accomplishments
>Yours is a bit light
>The line slowly shuffles forward until only one man stands in front of you
>Your palms are a little sweaty and you can’t help the fidgeting nervously as you wait
>You’d spent the last couple weeks working yourself up to this, but actually being here was something else all together
>You’ve heard a lot of stories, most good, many not
>You’d be lying if you said you hadn’t considered other options
>But the idea of moving back in with your parents filled you with a dread that you haven’t felt in years
>“Next please.”
>A chipper voice draws you out of your thoughts and you quickly step up to the counter
>Greeting you is the smiling face of a sheep anthro
>“Good morning sir, how may I help you today?”
>You clear your throat a couple times to give yourself a moment to collect your thoughts
The sheep woman waits patiently until you place the manila folder with your application form on the counter and slide it through the gap in the glass
“Yes, um…I would like to volunteer for uh……placement…p-please ma’am.”
>The sheep woman giggles and takes your application
>“Of course sir. And on behalf of the State, thank you so much for volunteering.”
>A quick flip through the document is all that’s required before it’s given a stamp and filed away with the other applications turned in that day
>“You’re application will be processed and, if approved, you’ll be entered into a sorting pool. You will then be sent a letter detailing any other instructions before you’re scheduled for relocation. Please visit the help desk before you leave and they can answer any other questions you might have. The State again thanks you and wishes you luck on your road to marriage.”

>you realize she probably meant you to see her or wasn’t trying to hide at all
>you used to hate her but now your just apathetic
>she gets back from work at 12 but you still only really see her when she wants to see you despite you sharing the small living space
>you wondered if there was some sort deep mental biological thing inside her brain or brain equivalence telling her to hide from you

>it's over
>your long quest is finally done
>you were just a nobody working a dead-end job, until one day you were transported to a magical world of adventure and peril
>the goddess who summoned you tasked you with slaying a demon lord and saving the world before she would send you home
>kind of a bullshit deal, but she gave you magic armor and a sword that made you super strong without putting in any effort, so you weren't too put off
>plus it was a lot more fun fighting monsters and evil wizards than it was working nine-to-five at home
>even if you almost died a few times
>you needed this vacation
>but now it's all over, you and your party have killed the demon lord, and returned to the capital as triumphant heroes
>tomorrow you'll go back to the temple so the goddess can send you home
>you had considered making your goodbyes in the morning, but decided to skip the whole emotional trouble
>the friends you made here were nice, but you weren't going to see them ever again
>better to just quietly disappear, rather than go through all the tears and the hugging and all that garbage
>the dwarf will probably break your arm again with one of his 'friendly' punches
>you wander through streets packed with jubilant citizens, still celebrating victory over the demon king
>no one notices a lone human, without armor or sword, weaving through the crowds toward the outskirts of the city
>seems fitting you'd go back to that generic fantasy inn where you spent your first night in this world
>the innkeeper greets you warmly
>"Ah! Welcome back my friend."
>the friendly old orc is the only one to recognize you without your armor
>"I've kept your room tidy for you. Your guest is already waiting."

>her tail twitches from side-to-side beneath the hem of her bright yellow dress
>"I thought I'd find you here. Where it all started. You always had a poet's heart, mister hero."
>you sigh and step into the room, closing the door behind you
>guess you couldn't get away without at least one goodbye
>poet's heart is maybe a little much
"You don't have to call me that. I'm not really a hero."
>she clasps her hands together and steps closer
>you have to tilt your head down to maintain eye contact with the cat whose ears only come up to your chest
>"But you are! You saved the world, you killed the demon lord!"
>you just shake your head
"Really Mrana. It was all magic. That armor, that sword, they did all the work. Before I had them, I was nothing special."
>Mrana shakes here head and mewls
>"No! No, you're very special. Remember, when we first met? Before you had the armor, before you had the sword. You saved me from that mob with just your words! I was so scared back then, so weak. But you were brave, even without magic!"
>you remember, it was the first lucky break you had
>a bunch of angry peasants wanted to burn Mrana, so you stepped in to try and save her
>mostly because at the time, it seemed like the sort of thing that you ought to do as a hero
>"You're special to me. You're my hero."
>your heart warms, and you can't help but smile
>she's just so adorable, the way she looks up at you with her glowing eyes
"I was just playing the role. Really, I was scared out of my mind the whole time."
>you tried to break eye-contact with Mrana, but you find you can't look away
"And I think you've paid me back for saving your life already. I'd have died a dozen times without your healing magic."
>Mrana starts to purr
>her eyes stay locked on you
>"We were all scared. But bravery is about overcoming fear."
>she steps closer still
>"I'm so very scared right now, but I'm being brave for you."
>what is she talking about?
"Mrana, what are you scared of? Are we in danger?"
>she laughs, the delicate sound ringing in your ears
>"No, no. You're perfectly safe with me, my hero. It's just so very hard to say..."
>Mrana suddenly stands on her tip-toes to kiss you!
>her whiskers tickle your skin, her thin-lips are warm as they press against yours, her paws reach out to take yours
>you're completely stunned
>Mrana still holds your hands when she drops away from the kiss with a giddy laugh
>"To say I love you!"
>oh god
>she loves you
>you feel the rumble of her purr in her chest
>fuck
>goddamn she is so cute
>those eyes seem to draw you in, make you want to say the same to her
>you almost lose yourself to the temptation
>but you know it can't be
>the goddess is sending you home in the morning
"Mrana..."
>her eyelids flutter
>"Yes, my love?"
>rip off the bandaid before it's too late
"Mrana, I'm sorry. I--I can't. I'm going home, in the morning. Back where I came from."
>her smile melts away
>a flash of anger underneath, that quickly turns to sorrow
>"Going home? B-but this could be your home too. You could stay with me, couldn't you?"
>she refuses to let go of your hands when you gently try to pull away
>this is why you wanted to avoid the goodbyes
"I can't. The goddess will be waiting at the temple to send me back to my world. I have friends, family waiting for me."
>Mrana grips your hands harder, claws coming out of her paws to prick your skin
>"Please..."
>her voice trembles, tears starting to form at the edge of her beautiful green eyes
>"Please Anon..."
>gritting your teeth, you pry your hands free from her claws and step away
"I'm sorry Mrana. I have to go."
>you turn back toward the door, trying to control your own breathing
>"Please don't make me do this."
>what?
>make her do what exactly?
>you stop, hand on the door handle
>but it's too late now
>turning back would just hurt you more
"Goodbye Mrana."
>you turn the handle, and start to open the door
>when your leg snaps
>you gasp, immediately dropping to one knee as you're rocked with pain
>what's happening?
>"I'm sorry my love."
>Mrana's voice has lost its tremble
>"But I cannot let you leave me."
>you clasp at your leg
>it hurts
>worse than when you broke it on a quest ages ago, crossing the great desert
"M-Mrana. What did you do?"
>you look back to her, green eyes now cold and hard like emeralds
>"Healing magic is a tricky thing, my hero. The body needs time to heal. If my magic heals your injuries all at once, your body never has a chance to fix itself."
>she makes a gesture, and wounds start opening up on your arms, legs, chest
>"My magic takes away the damage. My magic can put it back."
>there's so many
>each one a flare of concentrated misery that drives the breath from your body
"It hurts..."
>you manage to gasp out
>Mrana sighs and leans over you to shut the door
>"I know, my dear. My magic takes the pain away too. Or, it took the pain away, until now."
>she strokes your hair, claws threatening to cut your scalp as she goes
>"I don't want to do this my love, but you left me no other choice! I confessed to you. Bared my soul to share my love with you for all the rest of my days. And you rejected me!"
>Mrana leans over you, tracing a fingertip down your cheek that opens up another old injury
>"How could you do that to me? And you were going to leave me! Your injuries may hurt, but not worse than my poor broken heart."
>the cat woman kneels down beside you, watching as the blood from a hundred old wounds seep into your clothes
>"But if you say you love me too, it would fix everything! Those words would heal my heart just as quickly as my magic could heal your flesh."
>what is she saying?
>does she think you'd ever love her after torturing you?
>you shake your head, and speak through the pain that's starting to fog your mind
"No. Have. To. Go. Home."
>the witch sighs, ears flicking in irritation
>"You can't go home, my hero. Even if I let you, what do you think would happen when you left this world? My magic would go away. All of it. Even the magic that saved your life..."
>she twitches a paw in some arcane gesture
>and you gurgle as you feel something inside you break
>a deep tearing pain
>the world starts to spin, and fade
>you're dying
>but then the world starts coming back to you
>a world of Mrana's green eyes boring into you
>"Do you understand Anon? You will die without me. Time will never heal that wound."
>the lighter injuries across your body start to seal up again, the pain fading away like it was never there
>"Even if you healed each cut, each broken bone, every single injury. That one. The one that killed you. It will never, ever go away."
>the enormity of what she's saying hits you like the truck that brought you to this world in the first place
>"Every day I keep you alive is a day that I save your life. I am your hero, my love, just like you were mine."
>by the time she's done, all your injuries are gone away again
>but the horror still grips your hammering heart
>"Thank me, Anon. Thank me and say you love me. Then I'll take you far away from anyone who would ever threaten your life again, so we can make a new home together."

waifur with motorcycles are nice
>have to cuddle up to her to stay on
>maybe even have her tail wrapped around your waist for extra security
>or you're sort of sitting in her lap with her arms around you to cage you in
>maybe she even gets a side car just for her precious soft boy
>probably also gets you a helmet that matches hers or her species/fur/scales patterns

>Your rental bike arrives to the assignment center late, as it does most mornings. You don't complain, though: the bikes are working as intended. You should have simply slept less and arrived earlier. After all, you have the privilege of living in the most advanced sector in the NA Region:
>Sector COW
>You don't recognize any of the other guys in line as you all shuffle from the parking lot into the center: A3694B and A7654C must be late too. Or early.
>It's refreshing when you finally are inside, out of the baking sun. The reservoirs are low, so you could only rent half a bottle after yesterday's shift.
>More than you deserve.
>The dull sound of the assigners fills the cramped space as the line shuffles forward, everyone silent otherwise.
>When you finally get to the front, yours looks at you with dull eyes, scowling slightly.
>"This is the 3rd time you're late, A9999N," the skinny goat says, "You know what that means, right?"
>"Yes ma'am," you say sheepishly.
>"You'll be put on basic assignment," she says anyway, "If you're too busy to contribute to the sector's high-priority goals as you said you wanted to, then you'll provide basic support instead."
>She gives you a gesture you've only seen three times before as she clacks away at the keyboard.
>"I, A9999N, repent," you recite, "I am a human male, and it is my kind that have caused all the ills of this world. I know that Sector COW and all those within it seek only to improve the world and erase my flaws. I consent to this change in station."
>The small camera blinks a light at you, confirming you've done things correctly.
>"Please enter the transport pod," the goat sighs, the line having grown stale, "You'll be taken to your assignment shortly."
>You do so, and after 45 minutes in the narrow tube, a large wolf comes and grabs your tube. He doesn't speak much, like the rest of the male anthros: you know that they're special, and respect them all the same. He sets you down with the customary roughness into a chute; you roll down and find the bottom surprisingly empty. A pair of technicians, both felines, jump a little when you arrive and pull you out from the transport pod, sitting you on a cold metal table.
>"Alright, A9999N," one says, doing something on a computer while another prepares an odd-looking cart, "You're on milking duty."
>That's strange. You've done that before, and it wasn't on a cart.
>"There's a button on the cart near your left hand," the other technician says, showing you the big red circle, "If you push it, your supervisor will be notified. But that doesn't mean that they have to listen.
>This is very strange. This isn't at all like the previous time you did this job for the Sector.
>"Excuse my ignorance," you say, bowing your head, "But I don't recall this being the procedure the last time I was on milking duty. Has the Sector come up with a superior way?"
>The one by the cart groans; she's dark, and looks young.
>"You can cut that groveling crap," she says, "I swear, I--"
>The other technician, older, silences her with a look.
>"This is a... different milking duty," she says. "You'll be providing service for a Supervisor while they work. They'll explain the rest when you arrive."
>There's a soft 'ding' from the computer, and the technician lets out a sigh.
>"And it looks like it'll be Betty today."
>The two cats load you onto the cart, with is very strange: it's made of a very comfortable material, soft to the touch and cool. It seems contoured to you as you lay down on it, your arms and legs being strapped down in subtle channels. The button they were talking about is there, though you have to stretch to reach it-- it's difficult, too, given how your arms are strapped all the way out like a 'T.'
>Another male anthro takes you from them, wheeling the cart around a series of narrow hallways. You're not able to make out his species, with your head where it is.
>You find yourself a little sleepy: the material on the cart really is comfortable. You know you shouldn't be sleeping on assignment-- unless your Supervisor tells you to-- but you can't help yourself, and nod off.
>You wake to a loud crash of doors and a jolt as the cart rams through a pair of them. The room you enter is large and loud, the clattering of keyboards filling it along with the sound of voices. It's bright, with actual electric lights in the ceiling. Things are a little muffled from the fabric of your cart, but you think you hear people talking to you or at you. You can't do much about it, unable to move your head and respond, and you don't dare risk talking out of turn.
>Eventually, the cart stops, and your escort knocks on a door. It's answered, and you hear a feminine voice say "Ahh, good. Thank you."
>You're pulled into a new, more quiet room: there are still lights in the ceiling, but things aren't so painfully bright.
>"'A9999N,' a voice reads, "You're a pretty new one, then."
>A shape looms over you: she's the most sacred of species, a Cow!
>You attempt to get up and kowtow, but she giggles and touches your shoulder, steadying your struggles against your restraints.
>"Don't worry," she says, going back out of view, "you'll be paying plenty of homage to me today."
>Betty moves the cart around the relatively small room to a desk. There's another 'ding' of a notification, and she grunts, leaning over to address it. You notice that her breasts-- large as any other cow's, just like her-- are hooked up to tubes, the neck of her shirt pulled down below them.
>"Hit that red button for me," she says, looking down at you. You do as she says, and there's another 'ding,' this one sounding different, almost happy. She lets out a satisfied huff.
>"Looks like that works," she says, looking back down to you, "Now, you're going to be helping me today. Are you excited?"
>You nod: you're not worthy to speak in the presence of her, the species that built Sector COW and endeavors to enlighten the other parts of the Anthrostate.
>"Good," Betty says; she lifts one leg over you and the cart, standing over it. Her big, bovine behind hangs above you a she seems to adjust the carts position with her thighs, and you notice she's wearing nothing below her skirt.
>"You will be stimulating me down there while I do my work. You may press that button when you're out of air for these first few times, so I can get an idea of how long you can go," she says, seeming to have positioned everything to her liking, "But after that, I'll get unhappy. Understand?"
>She graciously lowers her rear so that it brushes against your face, allowing you to keep your silence. You nod against it, and she sinks down on you completely.
>The pressure is immense, but spread out as she settles in. You can feel her haunches covering you nearly to your wrists, and for a moment you simply sit there in awe. She's so soft, so warm... and she's a Cow. You, A9999N, are allowed to serve a Cow like this, personally, intimately.
>A hefty bounce from your Supervisor brings you back to your senses. "You alive down there?" she asks, "Get to licking."
>Licking?
>You wonder why others don't sign up for basic support all the time.
>You press your tongue out onto her soft flesh, lightly furred. She tastes good, better than a standard ration, if a little salty. As you're savoring it, however, your lungs remind you of their existence. You panic for a moment, struggling meekly before remembering the red button.
>She lifts briefly when you hit it, just long enough for you to expel a puff of air and quickly gasp in a breath.
>"30 seconds," Betty says, grinding down on you slightly, "Room to improve. And give me some more action down there, try moving your head."
>You do so, though her weight allows you to do so only a little. It seems to please her anyway: that's what you assume the noise she made was for as you feel her relax onto you.
>After about five more cycles of this, Betty lifts up a little longer, wanting to make sure you hear what she has to say.
>"Okay, now I don't want you to use that button. I know how long you'll last. Nuzzle in deep, A-N. You're doing good."
>You do as she says, her descending butt not giving you much choice. You wiggle your face in and are rewarded with a sigh as she relaxes, your tongue giving her pleasure. Your ordinary tasks, the advanced ones-- being on committees for machinery and systems you did not understand, deciding which crops would be planted when and where, helping design the latest round of Sector posters to promote moral and patriotism-- none of it compares to this.
>Again, your lungs intrude on your thoughts. By reflex you start to reach for the button, but Betty lifts up all on her own.
>"See?" she says, her voice trembling a little as she sits back down hard, "Good job. Keep going."
>You are all too eager... The world fades around you, the only thing you want or need being Betty's butt.
>It all begins to run together as she ascends and descends, pressing you deeper and deeper, her taste, her smell-- her-- becoming engrained into you.
>You don't even ask for a midday ration, happily licking away at her underside as she eats hers.
>The sound of the shift-change chime pierces even her thick cheeks, and she lifts up for good with a somewhat reluctant sigh.
>"Nice work, A-N," she says, looking at something while you pant and your eyes adjust, "I made 10 gallons!"
>She strokes your matted hair, leaning over you with a slightly sad face.
>"I hope I'll get you again tomorrow," she sighs before pulling away, "But there's no guarantee."
>She pushes your cart all the way under her desk then, and you find it leads to some kind of chute. As the darkness consumes you, you find yourself hoping for the same thing. Eagerly awaiting the one warm dark in your life...
>THIS FILM WAS BASED ON TRUE STORIES FROM SECTOR COW REFUGEES
>CITIZENS OF THE FREE SECTOR OF TX: BE VIGILANT
>ACCEPT HUMAN REFUGEES FROM SECTOR COW AND OTHERS LIKE IT; BE WARY OF ANTHRO IMMIGRANTS FROM SAID SECTORS
>The theme of Sector TX, an old-sounding number with brass and drums, played through the speakers as the film ended. An attendant stopped the tape, looking up to the muskrat that sat in the desk along with the others in the darkened room. She nodded slowly, a look of concern on her face.
>site doesn't like extra returns, apparently
>"It'll work as a base," she said, "Though I can't help but worry that some'll get the wrong idea."
>"How's that, Governor?" one of the members asked.
>"Well, it's erotic!" she said, blushing a little, "See if you can't have the more egregious parts cut out, both the visuals and the narration. This is meant as a warning for our sector, not an endorsement!"
>People wrote the request down, and half the room began to mobilize.
>"Governor," a human said quietly, seeming to slide through the chaos and come to her side, "I caution you: I believe that this may be too little, too late for TX."
>"How do you mean?" the muskrat asked the human, leaning in.
>"The film is as provocative as you said; Sector TX may already have had enough COW plants and sympathizers. And now they're hijacking their efforts at dissuading more."
>The muskrat frowned, he expression reflecting off his dark shades.
>"You may be right," she said quietly, "But I've got to believe that's not the case here in FL. Thank you again for your services."
>"Of course," the man replied with a bow, kissing the back of her palm. She giggled despite herself.
>"You're something else, ain't you?"
>"In my business," the quiet man said, holding her eyes, "You've got to be."

>Alaska.
>It was the perfect place to disappear, you thought to yourself.
>A thousand miles from the stupid problems, a thousand miles from the small talk, a thousand miles from all those tiny, persistent tortures that made day to day life just marginally, completely, unbearable. Circumstance would simply never give you the perfect excuse to just throw it all away. But it's what you wanted, more than anything.
>Well, you were tired of waiting. In a sudden flash of self determination, you upended your entire life and moved.
>Alaska. That's where you'd change, where you'd get tough, finally find some meaning. Just your thoughts and you.
>"Just my thoughts and I." You scroll listlessly through social media while waiting for the bus.
>"No kidding," you think to yourself.
>A thin haze of snow swirls lazily around the city. Peeking above the sparse skyscrapers was the white-capped Mount Spur, casting a long shadow over the entirety of Anchorage.
>When you'd first arrived, you thought the view of the mountain was incredible, otherworldly even.
>But you've come to know that its presence imbues the air with a bitter chill, the kind that gnaws on the tip of your nose, along with your will to put one foot in front of the other.
>Now it just pisses you off.
>Things are just the same here as they were where you came from, the same as everywhere. Just colder.
>Despite being here for a few months, you've got very little to show for it. No new friends, only acquaintances and coworkers.
>No new relationships, only forced smiles and impersonal banter from familiarly uninterested women.
>Upon entering the bus, you comprehend that your life here is almost identical to the one you'd left behind, the only difference being your job and the temperature.
>"Christ," you say under your breath.
>You shuffle lethargically to the back of the bus and find a place to sit. The cold plastic seat sucks the warmth from your legs and leaves you slightly shivering. The driver never has the heat on.
>What you wouldn't give to sit in a car every day again.
>Mercifully, it was Friday. You had a whole two days to hibernate before returning to your slog of a job again the next week. And just like every week since you got here, as soon as you open the door to your apartment you make a b-line for your bed. You flop down and twist yourself up in your blankets and pillows.
>You close your eyes and wait to drift away. However, there is a tension you cannot shake. That realization you had on the bus, it prodded at you as you lay there. Nothing's changed but the job and the temperature. Nothing's changed but the job and the temperature.
>Nothing's changed at all.
>You process this idea for a few minutes more, denying yourself the much-desired post work nap.
>The snow now taps steadily on your window. With every tap you become more aware of time passing, more aware of your position, more aware of the stubborn mundanity of your existence. Then in an instant of absolute rapture, you are possessed of the same fire that drove you all the way out here to begin with.
>You shoot up from your bed and march directly to your PC.
>In the search bar you type, "reliable low temperature camping equipment"

>You'd forgotten your cycle pill the day you kissed Anon
>Most mustelids have to take them during heat season, and for good reason.
>Primarily, you might literally die of horniness. It's an anthro thing.
>For most it doesn't get that bad, but every once in a while you hear about some unfortunate kid going through puberty dying because no one realized what was happening.
>You hadn't taken yours that day, which probably explains how you could have been so impulsive.
>Hands touched, nervous grins were exchanged, you'd rested your head against his chest, and you could feel the magic in the air.
>For him it was just a peck on the lips.
>For you though? It was the worst and best decision of your life.
>Only now, years later, can you honestly admit to yourself how wrong it had all been.
>What you did to him afterwards...

>It's so cold
>you shiver and shake as you stumble through the snow, the leafless trees providing little shelter
>the night sky dark and moonless
>you can't think straight
>the rifle in your numb, frozen hands is heavy
>why are you holding it?
>why are you here?
>...
>there was an explosion
>you were in the camp, just getting ready for bed
>then the whole world blew up
>you had come to in a bank of snow, having been flung out of your tent, your AK still slung around your chest
>you had looked back into the camp
>fire everywhere
>bodies
>another explosion
>it had set off your fight or flight response
>so you ran, the only light the firestorm engulfing what was left of your life behind you
>you've been staggering through the woods for some time now, you can't really tell how long
>it's so cold
>you're going to die out here
>you want to cry but can't
>you can't even remember your name
>there's something wrong with your head

>you try and gather your thin camo jacket in tighter around you as you make it into a clearing
>the snow has started again, falling silently around you
>you look around the clearing
>where are you?
>is this the right way back to town?
>can you even g-
>there's a noise
>you turn to see a dark, bulky figure standing in the snow on the other side of the clearing
>a pair of dull green lights shine out from its head
>and a laser flickers from the weapon held in its' hand
>the beam catches snowflakes here and there before settling on your chest
>one of them
>the enemy
>it (probably she) has you dead to rights
>you force your lips to open
>”Please don't shoot,” you say, your voice croaking
>the laser lowers down to the rifle in your hands
>”Drop the gun.” The voice is husky but feminine, and calm.
>you try
>but you can't
>your hands are stuck to the gun, frozen to the metal
>you try harder, feeling the skin on your fingers start to tear
>it's agony
>you can't
>tears finally roll down your cheek as you start shivering again
>”I can't. T-the cold, it's stuck to my hands.”
>the figure cocks its head slightly, and tenses
>the weapon in it's hand is still pointing at you, the laser roaming up and down your chest
>”Please, I don't want to die.”
>the laser drops away as the weapon is slung
>a gloved hand is proffered to you
>”Come here. I can help.”
>Now's your chance
>Shoot this bitch!
>would that even accomplish anything, though?
>what the hell were you even doing out here?
>the war is over
>long over
>you start trudging towards the enemy soldier, wading through waist high snow
>a squawking, tinny voice echoes from a radio
>”Negative. It's under control.” She whispers back to it
>as you get closer, you realise something
>this thing is probably about half a foot shorter than you
>and the bulk is coming from a huge winter coat pulled over a tactical rig
>the green lights coming from some kind of HUD display on her helmet
>and a blonde canine snout poking out from a balaclava
>you get closer still
>the dog raises her hand again, motioning for you to stop
>”Stay there, let me warm your hands up and get that gun off you, okay? Don't try anything funny.”
>she stomps towards you
>you can see her weapon, now strapped to the side of her rig
>it looks like a gun, but not one you've ever seen before
>probably one of their fancy caseless guns
>then she's right next to you
>she raises the front of her helmet, the green lights flickering off
>you can see a pair of gleaming pale eyes gazing back up at you
>She puts a hand on your shoulder and pushes down
>”Knees.”
>you kneel down, now just below eye level on her
>then she pops the buttons on her big coat, and wraps it round you
>you find yourself pressed up against her body as she pulls you in tight
>its so warm
>the coat must have a heating element inside
>you groan as you feel the heat spreading through you
>”That's better, huh?” She asks, her arms resting in the small of your back.
>”Y-yes.”
>she shifts slightly and
>”Put your head on my shoulder, okay? We can try and get your hands free in a minute.”
>you comply, and she shifts slightly to press her snout into your neck, giving you a sniff.
>the gun is awkwardly positioned between the two of you, poking out from under her coat
>”What's your name, sweetie? What's a young thing like you doing out here?”
>”My name...”
>oh god
>where is it?
>why can't you remember?
>tears well up on your cheeks
>”I-I don't know, I think I hurt my head. God help me I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry”
>you feel tears freezing on your cheek as you start to panic, your world still spinning
>she squeezes you tight
>”Shhh it's okay, I'm sure you'll remember. You can call me Sarge, okay? Just calm down, you've got nothing to worry about.”
>she strokes your head with her gloved hand
>”Okay Sarge. Are, are you going to hurt me?”
>”No-one's going to hurt you, babe. The war's over. You just need to relax and come back with me. Did anyone else make it out of the camp?”
>”I didn't see anyone else, but I don't know. I can't think straight, I might have banged my head.”
>”Don't worry about it, there are doctors back at the base, they'll have a look at you.”
>” ...okay.”
>you kneel there for a while, feeling starting to return to your hands as the heat spreads from her body to yours
>you notice a rank pip, of three slashes printed on the side of her coat
>and a large blue unit badge
>SWEET SIXTEEN
>STATE MARINES
>the words surround an image of a grey wolf with a dead, bloody rabbit dangling from it's jaws
>you feel a little of the chill return
>if she's from the marines...
>”S-sarge?”
>”Yeah hun, you ready for me to try and get your hands free?”
>”N-no, it's still numb. I don't think it's good.”
>”I'll have a look.”
>She sticks her long snout inside the coat
>you feel a faint nudge as she pokes the hand on the rifle's pistol grip
>”Yeah, it looks pretty bad, babe. We should really let the medics see this. I don't want to make it any worse. Come on. Did they not give you proper gloves at that camp?”
>”No, they...”
>something's not right
>hang on
>”I, I never told you about the camp, Sarge.”
>She stiffens
>”No, you didn't.”
>”You blew it up, didn't you? A bomb or something.”
>”A drone, actually. I saw you go flying and followed you for the last hour.”
>it's only been an hour?
>”Everyone else...”
>”They didn't make it.”
>”You killed them?”
>”Yeah.”
>she says it so casually
>”My squad made sure no one else made it out. Apart from you.”
>”God in heaven, no, please let me go, please!”
>you try and struggle away from her
>she holds you still with a grip of iron
>”Don't be an idiot, you're not going anywhere. You'll die if you run off into this weather.”
>”Why the hell would you care? You...”
>a spike of cold realisation pierces your fogged up brain
>there's only one reason a state marine would want you alive
>you look at her in terror as she shuffles even closer, rubbing her snout against your neck
>your skin crawls
>”Why would I care? Because all my girls got their hubbies weeks ago, hun. It's the price of being sergeant, everyone else gets a pick before I do.”
>she's licking your neck
>teeth
>”But you're right here, and with the war being over...”

>for eons upon eons ago. Earth has been inhabited by Man, not alone: but it is thought they are the oldest race- whether minimally elder to the rest of the “upright species” or far more ancient then the rest; both remains to be confirmed, and is irrelevant
>for the vast majority of known history and prehistory, mankind has always had species who walk- and talk like them
>these species have always been seen as a companion; not human, and yet very much part of man. In friendship, in neighborliness, and in marriage. These other species have been around
>almost every religion has had its way of making an educated guess at why, how, and where these species originate and what their relationship is to man
>ancient middle eastern and Abrahamic texts cite these fellow bipeds as originating from a “second Eve”. After the first had broken the covenant between man and God
>pagan faiths seem to have a convergent idea in their mythos that mankind was the final model for the Gods image. And because the first being had been given life these first maker-gods had decided they shall all be family
>far eastern belief holds that the bipedal form is the archetype of perfection, each of these species merely being a permutation of a more abstract ideal
>regardless- prehistoric archaeological evidence has shown that the male human genome has since it appeared has remained in a relatively mutation-resistant state. Being prone to preserving not just itself. But it’s mate’s species via what is observed and thusly named para-linear reproduction. Where depending on the sex of the offspring it will retain the species of either the mother or father
>how this feat of somehow being able to not hybridize- much like cousin species do. While still being able to reproduce with what theoretically should be impossible to breed with humans was a topic of heated debate since the first human baby was was born from an anthro mother by philisiphers, naturalists, and perhaps every other thinker concerned with the idea of what makes a human a human
>it was not until man, with his curious heart and brilliant mind that it was discovered that the Y chromosome, the very same thing that made sons, sons. Also preserved their humanity. It dictated everything distinct to humans and humans alone. And was able to even completely rewrite genes from *any* that otherwise weren’t compatible when first merging together to conceive life in the womb within the first cell of an unborn child
>meaning somewhere either along the long road of the human legacy, or by design from omniscient- unseen hands. The final chromosome in every man on earth contains both an ancient and powerful genetic historical tapestry. But also the means to become wholly part of any tribe with a single female with minimal turmoil. As half of all the new members of this theoretical tribe would still be fully the species of the mother- while maintaining a genetic benefit for the father in passing down his own unique ancestry to half of his progeny
>with how sturdy the human phenotype is. One must wonder if there are any drawbacks to this refined strategy of expanding mating prospect.
>and in terms of outward effects- there are a few that stand out
>namely statistical ramifications
>the first, is that Man’s reproductive versatility makes him a commodity- especially in zones with tribes that lack enough males of their own, tribes that had suffered losses from the elements or other tribes, and finally human-scarce zones altogether
>evidence suggests that anthros who share an ancestry with these rare human fathers and barbarian ancestral mothers are far more likely to be of a megafauna-like stature, and are also more likely to birth males of a similarly strong quality. Much like their mutual ancestors
>this carries the consequence of these anthros being more likely to act in the same way as their barbarian ancestors did in terms of mating strategy: capture, breed, puppy-gaurd
>anthros who have this strong and rough-&-tumble ancestry have been dubbed through scientific jargon as “mega’s” or “macro’s”. Denoting both stature and behavior
>though, the term is rarely used unless in a scientific or discussion pertaining specifically to this genetic archetype
>on the other end of this species-spanning range spectrum were anthros who share ancestry with mothers who has far more males available to them, at about a 1:1.7 ratio of man:anthro is where this change in evolutionary mating strategy is observed. Sometimes aided by tribes being either closer together and more neighborly, tribes having more plentiful resources or higher overall prosperity through its ancient history.
>while it’s true these anthros *can* be sometimes larger than humans in terms of height or frame. They do not have the trait muscle mass or bone density that their evolutionary cousins have.
>these societies have mixed and coexisted for a long time. Though routes are easily traced to region more often than not, and many modern society’s often reflect these stone-age trends.
>societies that encourage “tournament” competition for humans includes: “anthrostates” “assignment regimes” “cougar castes” etc: in essence a male has less say in who he mates with in order for females to secure a husband effectively and in a fair manner
>the societies where anthros have used the opposite end of the mating strategy spectrum are “collared countries” “pet-hierarchical systems” “submission zones” etc: in essence the male carries the authority because there are enough males to go around for a female to not worry about mating-prospect-security
>there are of course mixed societies, for example in the western world; there is something that has been colloquially named an “anthro welfare biased nation/ anthro welfare state”. In these societies the social contract is more complex. But the effect is that by either the politics, culture, popular movement or law, that a bias toward being permissive to more sweet ive anthro mating behavior.

My take for DMVstate is that it's a situation of a massive gender imbalance and a really unhealthy society that develops cos of it (dowries, multiple wives, huge amounts of "surplus" females) which causes unrest finally leading to-

[OVERWATCH REDACTION ENGAGED - GLORY TO GREAT LEADER]
-anyway in the state's current form they own the planet and you have a female dominated system where it's far easier for anthro females to get human husbands instead of the massive pain in the ass of courting an anthro male
as for kids all babies will be anthro (plot point), hybridisation extends only to certain physical features and doesn't really have stacking effects the more generations you go down
For example Alice is pure tiger, both her parents are anthros. She's really tall, her boobs are small and she's got an overall slightly inhuman/animalistic set of proportions
Sally on the other hand has a human dad, she has a more "feminine" form, is more anthromorphic and she's a womanlet lol
You might get other things like eye or fur/hair color that are passed down but nothing much beyond that
All the above is just my ramblings and may change later if it is comedic or sexy to do so

>"Who owns you, little man?"
>”You do, my love.”

>”And what does that make you?”
>he mutters under his breath
>”I didn't hear you, J,” she growls at him
>”I'm your bitch.”
>”That's right, you've got an addiction, don't you?”
>he squirms as he feels her lining his cock up for rapid entry
>”You're addicted to yeen pussy, aren't you, bitch?”
>”yes.” he says in a very small voice
>that earns him another kiss and a subvocal “good boy” in his ear
>before she drops on him like an anvil
>the whole bed is bouncing as she roughly rides him into the mattress
>both of them are moaning at this point as she presses her paws hard into his shoulders, her breasts jumping up and down

>she grabs a hold of them
>then pulls them out from under her and lays them on her shoulders
>he gulps as he realises what's about to happen

>good thing he's so flexible
>”you okay?” she whispers to him, getting ready for the final stretch
>he responds with a hungry kiss
>before whispering “I'm yours.”
>with that, she goes for it again

>Jimmy pulls the rig camera off to capture this wonderful sight before throwing the big white duvet over her
>as he clambers into bed to join his wife, he turns the camera, winks for the audence, and switches it off

>wifwolf asks if you want to try recording amateur porn
>the "porn" is just her cuddling you while speaking sweet nothings into your ear
>despite being recorded it still feels as good as when you two cuddle normally
>sometimes she'll spice things up by jerking you off while holding you or by smothering you with her breasts while she gently rides you.
>once she even gave you a nursing handjob on camera
>what surprises you however is the viewerbase

>her tail wagged so fast I feared it would fly off and into deep orbit
>her whole body was shaking like a tail wag. Actually
>a little dance of excitement and joy

>dates went well. It doesn’t take much- just be interested in what they like and try to integrate some parts you enjoy into the time you spent so you have things to talk about
>sure she’s pretty. But learning she’s also fun is a total bonus
>the connection is real
>I’ve got a throbbing in my heart and a swelling in my loins for this big woofer with large hips, butt, and awoobas

So, hypothetically speaking, if someone were to write a fantasy story based around Egyptian mythology, which species of waifur would be best for the goddess?
A >pic related croc so big she can basically fuck herself with the MC like he's a doll, or a more jet-black sphinx type goddess who demands body worship?
Hypothetically speaking, of course

depends on what flavor you want
>sekhmet is literally an amazon lioness war goddess who canonically is married to a green human god who likes building things
>she also has cow goddess form all about breeding/pregnancy from the time the other gods got her drunk in order to keep her from killing the whole world
>sobek for nile crocs which were actually cared for by people in Egypt in places where sobek was worshiped
>taweret is a hippo goddess of maternity and childbirth making her one of the literal mommy gods of Egypt
>anubis does have a female counterpart so you could go with a dom route from a legal side given the whole judge of the dead thing
>set is pretty untapped and also is sort of a jackal god too in some descriptions if anubis is too mainstream for you
>also can work with the whole angle of set being passed over for ruler of the afterlife and maybe work in a girl version of horus wanting the MC for herself etc
if you dig into it you'll find most goddess in Egyptian lore are some form of cat

>Anthros are the Xenos
>Long ago after meteors and ice ages and all other stuff happened and Earth became a stable life sustaining planet, the Anthro race visited our planet and "laid the eggs" so to speak to populate the world with species that would start primal and feral, but over time evolve into the intelligent space-faring anthros and join the rest of the race
>Millions of Earth years later the Anthro species returns to check on the growth of the offspring they left
>They're shocked to find some offshoot of the primates, "Humans", have somehow advanced far faster than any of the other species
>They scan Human history and see all the poaching, animal abuse, zoos, putting animals in danger for entertainment
>The Anthros decide these Humans must be invaded now and shown their place

>the predecessor sapient race which beget humans and anthros arose not from terrestrial soil, but the lunar lowlands
>at an indeterminant point in the abyssal past, a great schism occurred in this society which left the vast, Plebian castes exiled on Earth and denied of the technology and resources which their society boasted as imminent within this gap of the Oort Cloud
>as millennia turned to eras, the excised populace no longer developed in tandem with their sibling species
>as it was, there were now two sapient species across the two spheroids, worlds apart in likeness yet mere seconds in distance for the advancements of the primeval anthros
>as the subsuming of humankind ensued in the modern age, it was an irony not lost upon the elder forebearers, wizening among themselves from their lunar conservatories, observing man from his earliest days of divergence

>It's shortly after the war, humanity surrendered quickly
>Once the dust settled, these new "relations" took place, Humanity and Anthros were still very unfamiliar with each other, behavior and culture-wise
>Those who surrendered and didn't fight back were placed into "Zones" heavily patrolled by high-tech Anthro police
>We have no jobs or government anymore, we can go outside and engage in social activities and other gatherings, but all media is Anthro-run and we're given weekly stipends to spend at Anthro commissaries for our daily needs
>You're walking to a friend's for some poker games, you stop to pet a friendly dog and give it belly rubs
>A large Anthro Dog officer yells at you, demands to know what you're doing
>You try sputtering out that you were trying to pet the dog
>She cuffs you and says "you're just another disgusting human who likes to hold down and abuse anything you see as lesser."
>She shoves you into her vehicle and hauls you off to the station
>After processing, you're shoved into an interrogation room with cameras
>The door opens and its the Dog Anthro who arrested you
>She sits down across from you and immediately demands you answer to what you were doing
>You start explaining you were heading to your friend's for some card games
>She slams her huge paw on the table and demands to know specifically what you were doing to the dog
>In a panic you just blurt out, "Belly rubs!!!"
>The officer cocks her head at you with piercing eyes like she's trying to stare into your soul
>She states that the dog was on its back, flailing its legs in a panic as you assaulted it
>You argue back that you weren't abusing it, dogs typically love belly rubs and scratches, they find it comforting and enjoyable
>The officer's eye shift around the room, she then reaches into her pocket and you her a button click
>The power lights on the cameras go off
>She slowly rises out of her chair, walks slowly around the table towards you, and sits herself down on it right in front of you
>She proceeds to remove the top part of her uniform, eventually revealing a big set of fluffy well-defined abs and a busom you're surprised she could fit inside the armored portions of her uniform
>She tells you that you need to present your evidence then on "Belly rubs", and she'll be the one to judge you after that

You know I was entertaining an idea about something about milk
>Anon living with a cow morph
>Typical Wisconsin anthro: she's proud of her milk
>Most of the fridge is either alcohol or dairy products
>Naturally the latter is all made "in house"
>Anon comes home eating subway
>She notices that "cheap beast milk" immediately
>Anon's next few days have each meal be heavily dairy-based
>She stands behind him and, as he eats each dish, whispers the description of the ingredients
>The way she describes them is borderline pornographic
Basically I wanted to write a story channeling the energy of the old Grilled Cheese Accademy website, but I wouldn't be able to do it justice. Also I'm not a foodie, so my frame of reference on that is limited at best. But the idea of a lactation-fetish story that's more than just breastfeeding is something I'd enjoy

>privately, the scenario you just went through is terrifying
>you know wolves mate for life. And if you said no...
>what would happen to her? Would she spiral? Would she off herself?
>for a moment the worst possibility that hits you. Is that she might give up on you and find someone else

>you’re about to have a heart attack from the cute levels assaulting your senses
>it’s been a couple weeks since you told her yes to an actual relationship without her having to use her terminology to weasel her way into being your lover
>but that’s only made her bolder
>the both of you make even more time for eachother now however. So you’re in bliss every other moment when she’s not being inappropriate
>it’s gotten so bad that when in a passing statement to when it was relevant that you mentioned you had a girlfriend, one of your male friends jokingly said he already knew because you’d come into class smelling like “poochie coochie”
>that one earned him an arm punch, but it made you laugh
>one day well into the semester you’re chilling at your fluffy awoo gf’s house when she beckons to you in the kitchen

>god damnit why does she have to be so cute
>her tail isn’t just waging anymore, it’s straight up in the air, you can tell she’s resisting the urge to wag about wi to her whole body like last time at the arcade with the “doggy dance” as you call it
>the little dance some canines do when they’re so happy that they can’t wag their tail hard enough. So their whole body joins in the swaying
>you don’t act, partially because you’re not sure how to respond to her, but also out of wondering if she’ll break her control and start doing *the dance*

>her grimace wasn’t intimidation. She was trying not to break down
>I can see the big mustache’d cook in the back shaking his head slowly in disappointment

>within an instant her composure finally snapped and she was full on crying
>looks like I really hurt her feelings
>great, now did I just bully a girl who was happening to be too loud. I also profiled her based on her species
>”could you have asked any more like an arse for us to quiet down?” One of her friends said harshly
>but I could barely register her comment over the 8 foot tall supreme spaghetti-pocketed awoo over here pulling on my sleeve and crying out:
>”PLEASE SAY YOU DONT MEAN IT IM NOT AN UGLY FEMCEL IM NOOOOOOOT” with massive teary eyes like you’d see on a chibi character
>it’s uncanny, the level of baby-crying I’m seeing
>I’d laugh at her if it didn’t make me feel like such a fuckhead for making her this way, and if it wasn’t as adorable as it was, in its own way
“Hey, calm down now... I didn’t mean it... I just wanted you to quiet down a little, that’s all. I’m sorry I was mean”
>she sniffles, her eyes still doing that thing where they’re teary and seemingly huge. A sad toothy grimace still marring her snoot
>”y-you’re mean... I was having fun with my friends and you come over here and hurt my feelings calling me names *sniffle*. It’s not my fault you hate doggies, w-what kinda person *sob* hates fluffy girls...?”
>my heart
>my soul
>now I really have to apologize, and mean it
>god I’m an asshat sometimes
“Look. I’m sorry, I don’t actually think you’re mangey or ugly, or flea bitten- I just had enough of the loud noises. I.. I apologize for being mean to you. You didn’t deserve me being so harsh”
>she’s wiping away her tear matted fur on her face now, trying to compose herself
>”I-it’s okay, we’ll quiet down a bit and be more mindful next time... arwoo?”
>the last thing wasn’t even a word. But she held open her arms for a hug. A peace offering
>”my mom says people make up better when hugs are had. Is that okay?”
>my hesitation loses to my wish to make amends
>even the mustachio man in the kitchen looking out swishes his hands forward in a gesture saying “go on, don’t just leave the poor thing hanging”
>fuck it, I’m going for it
>I bring it in. Letting the giant fluff ball envelop me like a Venus fly trap catches a tiny kricket
>”you’re warm... you’re not a bad guy. Bag guys don’t hug people and tell them they’re sorry” she coo’s
>followed by soft, probably signs of comfort woo’s
>”...mwuu... ooo.. mmm, woo...”
>she’s hypnotically gentle and soft
>I could get addicted to this
>”can you guys knock it off the the PDA? There’s still the issue of an actual apology”
>the large wolf backs off upon hearing her friend. Scratching at her chin
>”uhm... oh I know! You could promise to buy me a coffee tomorrow at donkey-donuts” the big one added, her tune now back to having some pep
>I guess she really just needed that hug

>Be at the beach chilling out
>Can't help but notice all the lifeguards on duty today
>Limber otter babes with athletic bodies, a fluffy awoo with a silky coat, there's even a milfy capybara teaching a swimming class
>Get the brilliant idea to swim out and fake that you're drowning to get the attention of one of those smoking hot ladies
>Swim a few dozen feet into the water, face the shore, and begin wildly flailing all your limbs while shouting "I'm drowning! I'm drowning! Someone help!"
>See the lifeguards all enter the water and begin swimming to your position
>Hehe, all according to keikaku-
>Suddenly a large arm covered in white fur wraps around your torso
>"Don't worry human! I got you!" Someone screams into your ear
>Look to your left and there's a polar bear woman rapidly swimming to the shore with you in tow
>Where the hell did she come from?!
>"No, I'm actually okay, it's just-"
>"Don't talk! You'll just get water in your mouth and get even closer to drowning!" She sternly orders
>"O-okay" You meekly respond
>Before you know it her feet touch ground and she's walking up the shore with you in a bridal carry
>A few feet onto the sand she gently lays you down, all of the lifeguards surrounding you in a circle
>From the look on their faces they look none too pleased
>"So," Says the otter, her arms crossed. "you somehow managed to swim all the way out there by yourself with no troubles, then suddenly forget how to swim? Really?"
>Fuck, they saw through your ruse
>"uhhhh, ya."
>The capybara huffs in aggravation
>"Another one of these pervs looking to get lucky with a lifeguard. The absolute nerve!" She grumbles
>But then she looks to the polar bear, a sly look now on her face
>"Scarlet, I think this one needs some swimming lessons to ensure he doesn't "forget" how to swim ever again but I'm too preoccupied with my current students. Why don't you give him a lesson or two?"
>"It would be my pleasure ma'am!" She happily responds
>The other lifeguards walk away leaving just you and Scarlet
>"So Scarlet, uhh, what's our first lesson going to be?"
>She takes a knee and pushes you flat against the ground
>"Well, I know you need swimming lessons but I'm a little rusty on my first aid, so why don't we do a little of that first."
>"Okay, so like how to apply bandages and stuff?"
>She leans in closer
>"Yes, but first I'd like to start with some...mouth to mouth resuscitation." She says with a devious smile
>Gulp

>decide to take some time off from work and go on a camping trip

>you park and find a nice spot to set up your tent
>you can hear a flowing river nearby, the sound is very comforting compared to all the traffic and computer noises you're so used to hearing
>you walk towards the sound of the river, you want to see and breathe in some nature
>once you've cleared the trees you see the river in all its glory
>noisy, elegant, flowing, you scan across it left and right
>your eyes then land on a mass of fur in the water
>several huge bear ladies bathing themselves in the waters
>you remember the sign warnings and start to back away towards the trees again
>some rocks shift under your feet and make noise
>the bears all perk up and focus their attention on you
>you're frozen
>after what seems like minutes, one of the bears throws her large paw up into the air and calls out to you
"Yoo-hoo! Hey Camper! What brings you out into the wilderness?"
>"just trying to get away from city life for a bit", you shout back
"Oh how lovely! It's always nice to see someone who wants to appreciate nature!" she shouts back
>the bear talking to you looks excited, and starts conversing with her other bear friends, you can't hear them since no one's shouting over the river

>You go around a corner and almost run right into a giant werewolf creature
>Aw fuck another crazy experiment running loose
>It growls and bares its teeth at you, you quickly turn tail and try to escape through some tighter hallways
>It doesn't seem to follow, safe for now
>Days later, after a couple close calls, you're scavenging through a room
>As you open the door to leave, you come face-to-face with the werebeast again
>It seems just as surprised as you, flinching a bit and raising its claws with a snarl
>You completely freeze up
>After a few seconds of nothing happening, the beast slowly examines you with both its eyes and nose
>With a huff, it simply turns and continues down the hall
>After it passes and the terror fades, you turn and leave in the other direction
>More days pass, while scavenging you hear a sudden noise on the other side of the room
>You see the beast burst into the room through a makeshift barricade
>It quickly scans the room, visibly relaxing when it sees only you
>"Oh, it's just you, hey." you say mostly to yourself, trying to calm down from the sudden scare.
>"...Hey." it responds.

>I should’ve set my alarm clock on yesterday
>The bus left before I can even reach the bus stop station for my school leaving me in the dusts
>God damn it, I can’t just go back to my house. My mom is already pissed off as she already is after being late and have to finish my homework in the fucking morning. Doesn’t make it better that my mom is a Doberman who is chubby but muscular enough to lift me and dad both up with her fuzzy arms.
>Screw it, I might as well walk over a mile to get to school. Not risking to go back and have my mom bite my ass.
>I heard a chuckle from behind me
>I turn and see a reptilian lady in a slightly revealing biker clothes where I can see her underwear’s strings
>”Oh… poor lil’ humie missed his bus? Oh mommy would be so mad at you, wouldn’t she?” She cooed at me like I’m some sort of baby pet.
>I was told not to talk to strangers especially anthro women who often takes advantage of young human boys for their sick desires but she’s been looking at me for a solid minute and I have to response or things will get awkward.
>”Um, y-yeah… I woke up late and had to finish my homework in time before I left the house. Now she’s gonna be even more pissed once I come back to the house!”
>She chuckled once again, “Oh baby, I know how to solve that problem~“
>She walked pass by me and showed me a really expensive sports bike
>”I can get to your school in no time flat, babe~”
>She then signals me to come over with her fingers slowly
>I’m a bit creeped out that she cooed at me, but it is another thing that she call me ‘baby’ and ‘babe’ in THAT tone. But, I really don’t want to come back to my angry dog mom and starts barking at me for ‘not taking responsibility’ and some shit. So I accepted.
>As we both got in the bike, the gator lady uses her tail and pulls me a lot closer to her butt
>”Hang tight, it’s gonna be a wild ride!”
>I’ll be honest, I thought riding a bike would be too dangerous for me if I don’t balance correctly, but it is actually kinda fun and accelerating
>As we pass through the cars, I saw the road that leads to my school
>”Ok! So I want you to turn right and go straight ahead!”
>She didn’t slowed down when I told her
>”Uh, can you hear me? I said turn left!!”
>We zoomed passed the road
>I look back and see a school bus turning to the route we were suppose to go
>”Uh… you missed the directi-“
>”Just getting something from my house! We’ll be back in a minute”
>I stood there in disbelief, did she really ignored what I said on purpose? Or did she really want to get something from her house? My heart starts to beat a bit fast
>”Uh… ok…” I respond cautiously
>I have no idea how far is her house is, but where ever it is, it’s definitely nowhere as close to my school or even my house

Kinda like the idea of taking the anthrostate assigned marriages/husbands idea to a galactic scale
>humanity meets up with a galactic civilization/coalition of different anthro aliens
>insert hand wave reason that the space anthros have way more females around than males or such
>also throw in super advanced tech that lets alien crossbreed successfully or human guys have amazing capability with that tech resulting in more healthy offspirng
>human guys can get a free trip to space/other planets if they sign themselves up for assignments to space anthros as their husbands
>go through interviews to see what environment and species they'd best match with
>stuff like do you prefer cold or warm weather, types of food you like, awake mainly during the day or night, enjoy swimming or not, etc
>then get your profile added to the list the species/planet that fit you the best have
>once a space anthro picks you you get taken on a spaceship ride to that species planet where you will now live
>getting married to your new space anthro wife making you a citizen of that species/planet's government
>which means you're also now subjected to their laws and customs with Earth having no way to interfere ever since you're no longer part of the Earth's laws/government

I just got the idea of a detatched, depressed war veteran anthro coming back and picking up her assignment out of obligation.
She isn't mean, but she more or less ignores him at first. He's excited to meet her and eager to please, and he can't understand what he's doing wrong and why she isn't happy.
Turns out she gunned down a lot of humans wherever she was, and hates herself for it. Her faith in the state, and more importantly herself, is completely shattered. She's disgusted by the thought of taking part in assignment, or taking advantage of what she sees as a brainwashed man with no individuality.

Sounds like good way to write some comedy with the guy she's been assigned to trying to show he actually cares for and wants her to pin him down
>tons of shenanigans he goes through to try to keep snu snu
>naked apron greeting asking if she wants diner or to "eat" him instead
>her coming into her room to find him tied up on the bed doing the whole "oh no~ I'm all vulnerable" routine
>making her dinner with a crude drawing of her fucking him on the food using sauces or such to draw it
>wearing provocative shirts that say stuff like "I'm asking for it", "bite me", etc
>and other goofy ideas

I was thinking he goes through typical romantic motions like singing for her, making meals, cleaning the house, and she shows next to no appreciation for it. She's deeply uncomfortable being touched, so he can't try and relax her that way either. The tension eventually boils over, and he lashes out at her, screaming and whacking her with impotent rage.
>WHY! WILL! YOU! NOT! LOVE! MEEEEEE!
this finally gets through to her, she sees the passion in him isn't just manufactured by the state. After that she sees him as a person and they start to bond.
Forgive lack of images I cleaned off my phone.

>selfless anthro hero who gives her all to protecting humans
>however it gets quite lonely in her fortress and she wants to find companionship
>quickly finds out that while the humans admire her they're also intimidated by her. with some even expressing worry that they might be targeted by villains
>eventually it becomes too much to bear and she kidnaps a reporter who she fancies
>she goes to rape him but quickly stops when she sees him crying and cowering for his life
>she becomes disgusted by her actions and feels a deep sense of shame.
>after flying the guy back to his apartment she returns to her fortress and distances herself from the outside world, rarely if ever leaving her fortress

goofy idea regarding language differences
>could be fantasy or scifi, either works
>anthros misunderstand or due to the difference in their language see the words certain differently
>don't have a word that fits "husband" due to being female dominant species and what a female does culturally
>best they can do use similar words like provider, protector, strong mate, etc
>sees the word "wife" fitting for what they would call a male they're married/bounded to in regards to caring for family, cooking/cleaning, helping make children, belonging to their partner, their to provide pleasure to their mate, etc
>which causes funny situations with how they apply it to human males
>and more so when the proposition or compliment human guys
>"you'd make a great wife", "if you were my wife I'd never let you leave the bed", "I want you as my wife", "with a someone like you as my wife we'd have an army of children", etc

>think you're safe around lesbo anthros
>turns out they're only not interested in male anthros
>get grabbed by them to be used like a sex toy when they fuck
>matching bite mark on each shoulder from them

> Dragons and humans have a very special kind of relationship in traditional folklore
> Each one takes the other extremely seriously, because dragons are a major goddamn threat to any human
> But likewise every now and then a randomly powerful human comes out of nowhere and kills a dragon
> /adhg/ dragons take humans pretty damn seriously too
> A human bedwarmer is pretty much the crown jewel of any dragon's hoard
> Gold and jewels and weapons and art are all well and good
> But a human is more or less living, breathing art that you can cuddle, with dicks that seem custom-designed to get a dragoness seeing stars every time
> Good news for said humans is, you'll be treated as well by your new mate / lover / master as you could ever possibly ask for, showered in gifts and physical affection and love
> Bad news is, God help you if you ever 'want some space'
> Or if she thinks for even a millisecond that you looked at another woman
> Or if you don't like typically going for multiple rounds

>anthro woman who died in a gruesome way like murder is haunting the house it happened in
>she decided to kill the person who moves in next
>turns out it's a cute humie boy
>changes her mind form wanting to kill him to molesting and general haunting tinged with pervy shenanigans
>the poor guy now feels like he's being watch especially when he showers/bathes, changes clothes, sleeps, watches porn, etc
>wonders why he's had so many wet dreams lately when it's the ghost anthro molesting him in his sleep
>seeing a shadowy figure in the dark sometimes
>making the walls bleed and spell out stuff like "wear short shorts/other skimpy clothing"
>in half asleep instances sometimes thinks he sees an anthro hand holding his
>gets tired of the spooky shit and tries stuff like a ouija board that only results in him being sexually harassed one latter at a time
>maybe tries getting a supernatural specialist and actually gets a real one who is also an anthro woman
>ghost anthro just possess her to fuck the humie finally in the flesh
>or she possess him and they go on supernatural mystery adventures together when she's not sexually harassing him
>where the humie boy gets molested by other spirits/demons/entities/monsters/etc and the ghost anthro has to save him or joins in on molesting him too

Anthro ghost possesses the anthro medium, which was incredibly easy because the medium wanted to fuck him too. Enter the weirdest threesome where the ghost and the medium keep switching off who is in charge seemingly mid-stroke. Once everbody has cum, and the situation cleared up, then onto the paranormal adventures with the three of them. Investigating ghosts, aliens, monsters, and the supernatural in general, often involving the human boy being the object of the phenomenon’s sexual desires.
