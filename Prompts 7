ADHG Prompt List
And greentexts/concepts that I found interesting

I just want an Anthrostate wife who realizes how fucked the system is and just wants to smooch comfortably on the couch in between long days of work at the plant. Is that so wrong to ask?

>Late evening lounging with waifur.
>"Hey! I didn't ask you how your day was!"
Uggh. I don't want to think about it.
>She lowers her paws down your arm to reach your hand.
>"Oh no! Did the girls give a rough time again?"
They were all pressing up against me, demanded I let them dress me and forced me to let them put my tools in my belt and pockets. I don't know how they think up of new lines to cross!
>"I'm so sorry honey. This is my fault."
Pff, hardly.
>"No! I thought spooning you last night would leave enough of my scent to ward them off."
*sigh* It's alright. That was very nice.
"Sweetie..."
>She takes your face in her paws and stares directly into your eyes.
>"I'm going to make love to you every night from now on. Trust me. Those anthro girls will give you your space knowing I've claimed you, completely."

>everyone knows stories of giant war-kangaroos and monkey-men from the badlands are fake
>looks like there really is nothing good on right now
>you give the remote one last click and hope for the best
>then groan in miserable disappointment as the last channel you check is showing 'The Big Flea-bang Theory'

“Ssshhhhh shhhhh... it’s alright. I did promise to be home on time I’m sorry Mia”
>you said comforting her. Her muscles giving way for being softer, and now gently twisting side to side
>poor girl, poor- big lovable girl
>summoning all of your mightiness, you heave your 7’2 beeg girl to the couch. Plopping yourself down with her on top of you like those weighted blankets
>”mmm... don’t let go... my fur is still Kuhn... a little streaked- and I’m embarrassed”
“You’re fine, you can hold me like this as long as you need. I’m not going anywhere. Besides. We have all weekend to do what we want.”
>”I’d like that, love...”
>Mia doesn’t say anything more. Allowing you to lay there and stroke her back fur that doubles as this mane-like hair that goes all the way up to her head
>the plume of fluff you can’t keep your hands off of

>but for now. Hunger is starting to set in
“It’s about time for us to have something to eat. Do you want takeout? Anything you want as a home late apology”
>she shuffled on top of you a bit. Still embarrassed at her outburst today. No matter how many times you say that she never has to be embarrassed around you when it comes to this stuff. She always feels shame after her episodes
>you wished she didn’t feel ashamed for these things, especially since they remind you about how much she loves you
>”don’t get anything just because of me, but... takeout sounds good, yeah”
>there was a silence. A peaceful serene kind of silence that normally meant she was happy

“What’s that Mia?”
>another murmur but you can make out “for a snack”

“One more time babe”
>”I wanna have that DICK for a snack OKAY? I said it, when we’re done- you, me, broken bed, got it?”
>she blurted the normally white fur on that cute as fuck cheese wedge of a snout has this pink undertone coming up from underneath
“One order of your lo mein, teriyaki, and your boyfriend coming up”
>your teasing does not go undistrubed, her tail is standing upright at this point. Along with most of her food
>”stop making fun of me! You owe me for making me sad mister!!!”

>fleabag has a weird dream
>it starts in a forest, asche finding herself flanked on all sides by tall trees
>it's getting dark so she begins aimlessly wandering to find somewhere to rest
>she comes across a clearing with a cabin. the windows are covered by curtains but light is still visible behind them.

>the imitator says "oh, welcome asche. it's good that we can finally meet" in a cheerful tone
>just then, everything goes white and the aardwolf wakes up
>asche stares at the ceiling, wondering what games her subconscious is playing with her.

>”So remember everyone, happy employees mean happy customers. When you greet one of our valued customers do it with a smile and a friendly offer of assistance!” Your manager exclaims with a clearly forced grin
>God you hate these pre-shift meetings, nothing but wasted time and useless corporate propaganda
>”On three everyone! One, two, three!”
>”Wallyworld! Do it on the cheap!” Your fellow coworkers exclaim halfheartedly
>Your manager drops the fake smile, now replaced with her usual case of resting bitch face
>”I want to see more engagement with customers out there people. Stop being such antisocial rejects.” She mutters
>As usual you turn away and roll your eyes safely hidden from her gaze
>Another Monday, another workweek, another hellish 8 hours spent in this giant concrete prison masquerading as a superstore
>Hey, at least you get a two percent employee discount
>You walk with the rest of your coworkers out of the break room and onto the main floor
>Where to?
>Maybe you’ll go to the pet section and help some old lady put a bag of dog food into her cart
>Or maybe a trip to the electronics section to help some out of touch parent decide if their kid wants the Xstation or Playbox
>Or maybe…you’ll go to the usually deserted automotive section of the store and pretend to stock items until your shift is over
>Heh, ya, that sounds like a plan
>You casually saunter over to the oft forgotten section of the store and get to ‘work’ straightening items on shelves and doing your best to look busy, thankfully you’ve had plenty of practice
>While carefully rearranging a few cans of windshield cleaner there’s the clop of hooves and someone passes by you
>Whatever, they’re probably lost or something
>After very carefully straightening the last bottle so it’s label faced the aisle you stand up, look over and-
>Ah shit, your manager is at the opposite end of the aisle, arms crossed, staring right at you
>Your head turns in the opposite direction and there’s a cervine anthro a dozen feet down the aisle from you
>Looks to be a buck with a mighty set of antlers wearing a thick leather jacket, their back is facing you
>You look back to your manager and with the look on her face the message is clear, help the valued customer
>After a long sigh you walk up to the buck, put on your best customer pleasing smile, and say the corporate line
>”Welcome to Wallyworld, can I help you find something today sir?”
>The customer’s head shoots up from what they were looking at then he slowly turns to face you
>That’s…not a buck
>That’s a female reindeer based on the sizable breasts and thick eyeliner
>And that damn jacket hiding all of her curves from the back
>She looks at you with concentrated hatred
>”What…did you just call me, punk?” She spits with a husky feminine tone
>”Uhh-I-I didn’t-can I help you find something ma’am?” You awkwardly stutter in a futile attempt to save yourself
>Her eyes burn holes into you for a few seconds before she responds
>”No, I don’t think you can asshole.” She sneers
>With a swift movement she takes a bottle of oil off of the shelf and opens it, spilling its entire contents onto the floor
>”Oops, so sorry. Guess you’ll have to clean it up.” She says with a faux apologetic tone and malicious smile
>The reindeer tosses the empty bottle onto the floor and stomps away, the clops of her hooves almost deafening
>You look back to your manager, she’s shaking her head in disappointment
>Time to spend some time with your two dearest friends, the mop and bucket
>After slaving away to clean the oil spill you wipe the sweat off your brow and stow away the mop and bucket
>What a bitch
>Asshole
>Total cunt
>You can’t believe she did that just because of a simple misunderstanding
>God! How were you supposed to know she was female with those antlers of hers?!
>Whatever, she’s probably already left the store at this point
>Time to go chill out by the food section, restock some cereal, throw away some moldy bread or something
>After a few minutes of milling around you wander into the canned soup aisle
>You straighten a few cans and-
>”Excuse me sir? Do you think I should get the chicken noodle or the vegetable beef?”
>You turn around and yep, that’s the reindeer from before, her head shifts between the two cans of soup held in her hands
>What is this? Some kind of trick? She’s got to remember you from before
>”Well, uhh, I’ve always liked the chicken noodle.”
>She shakes her head in an affirmative
>”Ya, you know what I agree, the chicken noodle sounds way better than vegetable beef.”
>To your dismay she then tosses the can of vegetable beef behind her shoulder, it lands with a wet metallic thud, the contents spilled onto the floor
>”Thanks for the help bud.” She says, walking past you with a sly grin
>Un-fucking-believable
>What an asshole!
>With a defeated sigh your anger fades and once again you have a meeting with the mop and bucket
>After cleaning up the spill you decide on a new strategy
>You‘ll just roam from section to section trying to avoid running into that damned reindeer girl again, she’s clearly got it out for you
>First a few minutes folding clothes, then you restock some office supplies, and now a stroll through the cosmetic section
>Heh, there’s no way she’d expect you to be here-
>There’s a tap on your shoulder
>After stopping in your tracks you turn around and ya, there she is again
>How did she sneak up on you with a pair of hooves?!
>”Excuse me sir, could you point me to the antler polish?”
>”It’s right over there.” You flatly state, pointing to the row of products a few feet away
>”Thanks sir.” She says, strolling over to the row of glass bottles with a wiggle of the hips
>She makes eye contact with you, places a hand on one of the bottles, then begins slowly sliding it to the edge
>”Please…don’t.” You plead
>Her smile just grows wider
>The bottle is all the way to the edge, it begins to tip, it’s about to fall…
>Just as gravity begins to pull it downward you jump forward and fall to the floor! Barely managing to catch it before the bottle contacts the ground!
>You look up to the towering reindeer, a look of bewilderment on her face
>”Ha ha ha! You’re faster than I thought ya twirp.” She says with a cackle
>With your heart still racing she turns around and saunters off still chuckling
>After getting back on your feet you put the bottle of antler polish back on the shelf and gather your senses
>Okay, milling around the store clearly isn’t going to work
>That leaves the break room and bathroom as your only safe places
>You spend the rest of your shift switching between the two, thankfully no one seems the wiser
>Eventually the hours tick down and it’s time to clock out, thank god
>After putting on your jacket you step outside, the chilly winter air assaults your sense and inky darkness puts you on edge
>Left, right, no sign of the reindeer from before, good
>You parked around the side of the building, if you hug the wall on the walk over it’s doubtful many people would see you
>Slowly, quietly, you begin slinking over to your car
>Almost there, just have to-
>*CLOP-CLOP-CLOP*
>You look at the source of the sound just in time to see a tangle of pointy antlers rapidly rushing your position
>With a girlish scream you turn away and hug the wall
>Several points impact the wall on either side of your head but thankfully none go into your skull
>Slowly you open your eyes to see the reindeer from before staring at you, her wet black nose mere inches away
>Her breath comes out in wispy clouds that tickle your face
>”You punk! Thinking you could get away from me so easily! Cowering in the break room like a sniveling child.”
>”I’m sorry-I’m sorry-I’m sorry-I didn’t mean to call you sir please don’t kill me” You desperately repeat
>Her head moves away from yours and she crosses her arms
>”Happy employees, happy customers, right?”
>”H-how do you know that phrase?”
>”Used to work here. Hated it.” She says with a huff. “So tell you what, you’re an unhappy employee and I’m an unhappy customer. Why don’t we fix that?”
>You straighten your hunched posture and feel your heart slow
>”What do you mean?”
>”Well, I, umm, do have a problem you could help me with.”
>Sex, she wants you to fug her, gotta be
>”Uhh sure, just let me get my pants off here and-“
>”Ew! No!” She shouts, cutting you off. “I’m talking about…this.”
>She flashes a bottle of antler polish at you before quickly putting it back into her pocket
>”I need some help polishing my antlers.” She whispers. “It’s real hard to get the whole set by myself and none of my friends want to help. They think it’s weird helping a girl out with her antlers considering, well, you know, it’s mostly dudes that have them.”
>Still somewhat in shock you slowly shake your head up and down
>”Ya, sure, I’ll help you out…but what do I get out of it?”
>She cocks her head, an annoyed look on her face
>”You get to go home with only the holes you were born with. And I won’t tell your manager you’ve been slacking off all day.”
>”Okay, deal.”
>”Good, now follow me wageslave, you’ve got a long night head of you.”

>You stand in a queue at the Office of Anthro Relations.
>Ahead and behind you stand dozens of men
>All here for the exact same reason
>Each one of you holds in your hands a small collection of documents that amount to your life and accomplishments
>Yours is a bit light
>The line slowly shuffles forward until only one man stands in front of you
>Your palms are a little sweaty and you can’t help the fidgeting nervously as you wait
>You’d spent the last couple weeks working yourself up to this, but actually being here was something else all together
>You’ve heard a lot of stories, most good, many not
>You’d be lying if you said you hadn’t considered other options
>But the idea of moving back in with your parents filled you with a dread that you haven’t felt in years
>“Next please.”
>A chipper voice draws you out of your thoughts and you quickly step up to the counter
>Greeting you is the smiling face of a sheep anthro
>“Good morning sir, how may I help you today?”
>You clear your throat a couple times to give yourself a moment to collect your thoughts
The sheep woman waits patiently until you place the manila folder with your application form on the counter and slide it through the gap in the glass
“Yes, um…I would like to volunteer for uh……placement…p-please ma’am.”
>The sheep woman giggles and takes your application
>“Of course sir. And on behalf of the State, thank you so much for volunteering.”
>A quick flip through the document is all that’s required before it’s given a stamp and filed away with the other applications turned in that day
>“You’re application will be processed and, if approved, you’ll be entered into a sorting pool. You will then be sent a letter detailing any other instructions before you’re scheduled for relocation. Please visit the help desk before you leave and they can answer any other questions you might have. The State again thanks you and wishes you luck on your road to marriage.”

>you realize she probably meant you to see her or wasn’t trying to hide at all
>you used to hate her but now your just apathetic
>she gets back from work at 12 but you still only really see her when she wants to see you despite you sharing the small living space
>you wondered if there was some sort deep mental biological thing inside her brain or brain equivalence telling her to hide from you

>it's over
>your long quest is finally done
>you were just a nobody working a dead-end job, until one day you were transported to a magical world of adventure and peril
>the goddess who summoned you tasked you with slaying a demon lord and saving the world before she would send you home
>kind of a bullshit deal, but she gave you magic armor and a sword that made you super strong without putting in any effort, so you weren't too put off
>plus it was a lot more fun fighting monsters and evil wizards than it was working nine-to-five at home
>even if you almost died a few times
>you needed this vacation
>but now it's all over, you and your party have killed the demon lord, and returned to the capital as triumphant heroes
>tomorrow you'll go back to the temple so the goddess can send you home
>you had considered making your goodbyes in the morning, but decided to skip the whole emotional trouble
>the friends you made here were nice, but you weren't going to see them ever again
>better to just quietly disappear, rather than go through all the tears and the hugging and all that garbage
>the dwarf will probably break your arm again with one of his 'friendly' punches
>you wander through streets packed with jubilant citizens, still celebrating victory over the demon king
>no one notices a lone human, without armor or sword, weaving through the crowds toward the outskirts of the city
>seems fitting you'd go back to that generic fantasy inn where you spent your first night in this world
>the innkeeper greets you warmly
>"Ah! Welcome back my friend."
>the friendly old orc is the only one to recognize you without your armor
>"I've kept your room tidy for you. Your guest is already waiting."

>her tail twitches from side-to-side beneath the hem of her bright yellow dress
>"I thought I'd find you here. Where it all started. You always had a poet's heart, mister hero."
>you sigh and step into the room, closing the door behind you
>guess you couldn't get away without at least one goodbye
>poet's heart is maybe a little much
"You don't have to call me that. I'm not really a hero."
>she clasps her hands together and steps closer
>you have to tilt your head down to maintain eye contact with the cat whose ears only come up to your chest
>"But you are! You saved the world, you killed the demon lord!"
>you just shake your head
"Really Mrana. It was all magic. That armor, that sword, they did all the work. Before I had them, I was nothing special."
>Mrana shakes here head and mewls
>"No! No, you're very special. Remember, when we first met? Before you had the armor, before you had the sword. You saved me from that mob with just your words! I was so scared back then, so weak. But you were brave, even without magic!"
>you remember, it was the first lucky break you had
>a bunch of angry peasants wanted to burn Mrana, so you stepped in to try and save her
>mostly because at the time, it seemed like the sort of thing that you ought to do as a hero
>"You're special to me. You're my hero."
>your heart warms, and you can't help but smile
>she's just so adorable, the way she looks up at you with her glowing eyes
"I was just playing the role. Really, I was scared out of my mind the whole time."
>you tried to break eye-contact with Mrana, but you find you can't look away
"And I think you've paid me back for saving your life already. I'd have died a dozen times without your healing magic."
>Mrana starts to purr
>her eyes stay locked on you
>"We were all scared. But bravery is about overcoming fear."
>she steps closer still
>"I'm so very scared right now, but I'm being brave for you."
>what is she talking about?
"Mrana, what are you scared of? Are we in danger?"
>she laughs, the delicate sound ringing in your ears
>"No, no. You're perfectly safe with me, my hero. It's just so very hard to say..."
>Mrana suddenly stands on her tip-toes to kiss you!
>her whiskers tickle your skin, her thin-lips are warm as they press against yours, her paws reach out to take yours
>you're completely stunned
>Mrana still holds your hands when she drops away from the kiss with a giddy laugh
>"To say I love you!"
>oh god
>she loves you
>you feel the rumble of her purr in her chest
>fuck
>goddamn she is so cute
>those eyes seem to draw you in, make you want to say the same to her
>you almost lose yourself to the temptation
>but you know it can't be
>the goddess is sending you home in the morning
"Mrana..."
>her eyelids flutter
>"Yes, my love?"
>rip off the bandaid before it's too late
"Mrana, I'm sorry. I--I can't. I'm going home, in the morning. Back where I came from."
>her smile melts away
>a flash of anger underneath, that quickly turns to sorrow
>"Going home? B-but this could be your home too. You could stay with me, couldn't you?"
>she refuses to let go of your hands when you gently try to pull away
>this is why you wanted to avoid the goodbyes
"I can't. The goddess will be waiting at the temple to send me back to my world. I have friends, family waiting for me."
>Mrana grips your hands harder, claws coming out of her paws to prick your skin
>"Please..."
>her voice trembles, tears starting to form at the edge of her beautiful green eyes
>"Please Anon..."
>gritting your teeth, you pry your hands free from her claws and step away
"I'm sorry Mrana. I have to go."
>you turn back toward the door, trying to control your own breathing
>"Please don't make me do this."
>what?
>make her do what exactly?
>you stop, hand on the door handle
>but it's too late now
>turning back would just hurt you more
"Goodbye Mrana."
>you turn the handle, and start to open the door
>when your leg snaps
>you gasp, immediately dropping to one knee as you're rocked with pain
>what's happening?
>"I'm sorry my love."
>Mrana's voice has lost its tremble
>"But I cannot let you leave me."
>you clasp at your leg
>it hurts
>worse than when you broke it on a quest ages ago, crossing the great desert
"M-Mrana. What did you do?"
>you look back to her, green eyes now cold and hard like emeralds
>"Healing magic is a tricky thing, my hero. The body needs time to heal. If my magic heals your injuries all at once, your body never has a chance to fix itself."
>she makes a gesture, and wounds start opening up on your arms, legs, chest
>"My magic takes away the damage. My magic can put it back."
>there's so many
>each one a flare of concentrated misery that drives the breath from your body
"It hurts..."
>you manage to gasp out
>Mrana sighs and leans over you to shut the door
>"I know, my dear. My magic takes the pain away too. Or, it took the pain away, until now."
>she strokes your hair, claws threatening to cut your scalp as she goes
>"I don't want to do this my love, but you left me no other choice! I confessed to you. Bared my soul to share my love with you for all the rest of my days. And you rejected me!"
>Mrana leans over you, tracing a fingertip down your cheek that opens up another old injury
>"How could you do that to me? And you were going to leave me! Your injuries may hurt, but not worse than my poor broken heart."
>the cat woman kneels down beside you, watching as the blood from a hundred old wounds seep into your clothes
>"But if you say you love me too, it would fix everything! Those words would heal my heart just as quickly as my magic could heal your flesh."
>what is she saying?
>does she think you'd ever love her after torturing you?
>you shake your head, and speak through the pain that's starting to fog your mind
"No. Have. To. Go. Home."
>the witch sighs, ears flicking in irritation
>"You can't go home, my hero. Even if I let you, what do you think would happen when you left this world? My magic would go away. All of it. Even the magic that saved your life..."
>she twitches a paw in some arcane gesture
>and you gurgle as you feel something inside you break
>a deep tearing pain
>the world starts to spin, and fade
>you're dying
>but then the world starts coming back to you
>a world of Mrana's green eyes boring into you
>"Do you understand Anon? You will die without me. Time will never heal that wound."
>the lighter injuries across your body start to seal up again, the pain fading away like it was never there
>"Even if you healed each cut, each broken bone, every single injury. That one. The one that killed you. It will never, ever go away."
>the enormity of what she's saying hits you like the truck that brought you to this world in the first place
>"Every day I keep you alive is a day that I save your life. I am your hero, my love, just like you were mine."
>by the time she's done, all your injuries are gone away again
>but the horror still grips your hammering heart
>"Thank me, Anon. Thank me and say you love me. Then I'll take you far away from anyone who would ever threaten your life again, so we can make a new home together."

waifur with motorcycles are nice
>have to cuddle up to her to stay on
>maybe even have her tail wrapped around your waist for extra security
>or you're sort of sitting in her lap with her arms around you to cage you in
>maybe she even gets a side car just for her precious soft boy
>probably also gets you a helmet that matches hers or her species/fur/scales patterns

>Your rental bike arrives to the assignment center late, as it does most mornings. You don't complain, though: the bikes are working as intended. You should have simply slept less and arrived earlier. After all, you have the privilege of living in the most advanced sector in the NA Region:
>Sector COW
>You don't recognize any of the other guys in line as you all shuffle from the parking lot into the center: A3694B and A7654C must be late too. Or early.
>It's refreshing when you finally are inside, out of the baking sun. The reservoirs are low, so you could only rent half a bottle after yesterday's shift.
>More than you deserve.
>The dull sound of the assigners fills the cramped space as the line shuffles forward, everyone silent otherwise.
>When you finally get to the front, yours looks at you with dull eyes, scowling slightly.
>"This is the 3rd time you're late, A9999N," the skinny goat says, "You know what that means, right?"
>"Yes ma'am," you say sheepishly.
>"You'll be put on basic assignment," she says anyway, "If you're too busy to contribute to the sector's high-priority goals as you said you wanted to, then you'll provide basic support instead."
>She gives you a gesture you've only seen three times before as she clacks away at the keyboard.
>"I, A9999N, repent," you recite, "I am a human male, and it is my kind that have caused all the ills of this world. I know that Sector COW and all those within it seek only to improve the world and erase my flaws. I consent to this change in station."
>The small camera blinks a light at you, confirming you've done things correctly.
>"Please enter the transport pod," the goat sighs, the line having grown stale, "You'll be taken to your assignment shortly."
>You do so, and after 45 minutes in the narrow tube, a large wolf comes and grabs your tube. He doesn't speak much, like the rest of the male anthros: you know that they're special, and respect them all the same. He sets you down with the customary roughness into a chute; you roll down and find the bottom surprisingly empty. A pair of technicians, both felines, jump a little when you arrive and pull you out from the transport pod, sitting you on a cold metal table.
>"Alright, A9999N," one says, doing something on a computer while another prepares an odd-looking cart, "You're on milking duty."
>That's strange. You've done that before, and it wasn't on a cart.
>"There's a button on the cart near your left hand," the other technician says, showing you the big red circle, "If you push it, your supervisor will be notified. But that doesn't mean that they have to listen.
>This is very strange. This isn't at all like the previous time you did this job for the Sector.
>"Excuse my ignorance," you say, bowing your head, "But I don't recall this being the procedure the last time I was on milking duty. Has the Sector come up with a superior way?"
>The one by the cart groans; she's dark, and looks young.
>"You can cut that groveling crap," she says, "I swear, I--"
>The other technician, older, silences her with a look.
>"This is a... different milking duty," she says. "You'll be providing service for a Supervisor while they work. They'll explain the rest when you arrive."
>There's a soft 'ding' from the computer, and the technician lets out a sigh.
>"And it looks like it'll be Betty today."
>The two cats load you onto the cart, with is very strange: it's made of a very comfortable material, soft to the touch and cool. It seems contoured to you as you lay down on it, your arms and legs being strapped down in subtle channels. The button they were talking about is there, though you have to stretch to reach it-- it's difficult, too, given how your arms are strapped all the way out like a 'T.'
>Another male anthro takes you from them, wheeling the cart around a series of narrow hallways. You're not able to make out his species, with your head where it is.
>You find yourself a little sleepy: the material on the cart really is comfortable. You know you shouldn't be sleeping on assignment-- unless your Supervisor tells you to-- but you can't help yourself, and nod off.
>You wake to a loud crash of doors and a jolt as the cart rams through a pair of them. The room you enter is large and loud, the clattering of keyboards filling it along with the sound of voices. It's bright, with actual electric lights in the ceiling. Things are a little muffled from the fabric of your cart, but you think you hear people talking to you or at you. You can't do much about it, unable to move your head and respond, and you don't dare risk talking out of turn.
>Eventually, the cart stops, and your escort knocks on a door. It's answered, and you hear a feminine voice say "Ahh, good. Thank you."
>You're pulled into a new, more quiet room: there are still lights in the ceiling, but things aren't so painfully bright.
>"'A9999N,' a voice reads, "You're a pretty new one, then."
>A shape looms over you: she's the most sacred of species, a Cow!
>You attempt to get up and kowtow, but she giggles and touches your shoulder, steadying your struggles against your restraints.
>"Don't worry," she says, going back out of view, "you'll be paying plenty of homage to me today."
>Betty moves the cart around the relatively small room to a desk. There's another 'ding' of a notification, and she grunts, leaning over to address it. You notice that her breasts-- large as any other cow's, just like her-- are hooked up to tubes, the neck of her shirt pulled down below them.
>"Hit that red button for me," she says, looking down at you. You do as she says, and there's another 'ding,' this one sounding different, almost happy. She lets out a satisfied huff.
>"Looks like that works," she says, looking back down to you, "Now, you're going to be helping me today. Are you excited?"
>You nod: you're not worthy to speak in the presence of her, the species that built Sector COW and endeavors to enlighten the other parts of the Anthrostate.
>"Good," Betty says; she lifts one leg over you and the cart, standing over it. Her big, bovine behind hangs above you a she seems to adjust the carts position with her thighs, and you notice she's wearing nothing below her skirt.
>"You will be stimulating me down there while I do my work. You may press that button when you're out of air for these first few times, so I can get an idea of how long you can go," she says, seeming to have positioned everything to her liking, "But after that, I'll get unhappy. Understand?"
>She graciously lowers her rear so that it brushes against your face, allowing you to keep your silence. You nod against it, and she sinks down on you completely.
>The pressure is immense, but spread out as she settles in. You can feel her haunches covering you nearly to your wrists, and for a moment you simply sit there in awe. She's so soft, so warm... and she's a Cow. You, A9999N, are allowed to serve a Cow like this, personally, intimately.
>A hefty bounce from your Supervisor brings you back to your senses. "You alive down there?" she asks, "Get to licking."
>Licking?
>You wonder why others don't sign up for basic support all the time.
>You press your tongue out onto her soft flesh, lightly furred. She tastes good, better than a standard ration, if a little salty. As you're savoring it, however, your lungs remind you of their existence. You panic for a moment, struggling meekly before remembering the red button.
>She lifts briefly when you hit it, just long enough for you to expel a puff of air and quickly gasp in a breath.
>"30 seconds," Betty says, grinding down on you slightly, "Room to improve. And give me some more action down there, try moving your head."
>You do so, though her weight allows you to do so only a little. It seems to please her anyway: that's what you assume the noise she made was for as you feel her relax onto you.
>After about five more cycles of this, Betty lifts up a little longer, wanting to make sure you hear what she has to say.
>"Okay, now I don't want you to use that button. I know how long you'll last. Nuzzle in deep, A-N. You're doing good."
>You do as she says, her descending butt not giving you much choice. You wiggle your face in and are rewarded with a sigh as she relaxes, your tongue giving her pleasure. Your ordinary tasks, the advanced ones-- being on committees for machinery and systems you did not understand, deciding which crops would be planted when and where, helping design the latest round of Sector posters to promote moral and patriotism-- none of it compares to this.
>Again, your lungs intrude on your thoughts. By reflex you start to reach for the button, but Betty lifts up all on her own.
>"See?" she says, her voice trembling a little as she sits back down hard, "Good job. Keep going."
>You are all too eager... The world fades around you, the only thing you want or need being Betty's butt.
>It all begins to run together as she ascends and descends, pressing you deeper and deeper, her taste, her smell-- her-- becoming engrained into you.
>You don't even ask for a midday ration, happily licking away at her underside as she eats hers.
>The sound of the shift-change chime pierces even her thick cheeks, and she lifts up for good with a somewhat reluctant sigh.
>"Nice work, A-N," she says, looking at something while you pant and your eyes adjust, "I made 10 gallons!"
>She strokes your matted hair, leaning over you with a slightly sad face.
>"I hope I'll get you again tomorrow," she sighs before pulling away, "But there's no guarantee."
>She pushes your cart all the way under her desk then, and you find it leads to some kind of chute. As the darkness consumes you, you find yourself hoping for the same thing. Eagerly awaiting the one warm dark in your life...
>THIS FILM WAS BASED ON TRUE STORIES FROM SECTOR COW REFUGEES
>CITIZENS OF THE FREE SECTOR OF TX: BE VIGILANT
>ACCEPT HUMAN REFUGEES FROM SECTOR COW AND OTHERS LIKE IT; BE WARY OF ANTHRO IMMIGRANTS FROM SAID SECTORS
>The theme of Sector TX, an old-sounding number with brass and drums, played through the speakers as the film ended. An attendant stopped the tape, looking up to the muskrat that sat in the desk along with the others in the darkened room. She nodded slowly, a look of concern on her face.
>site doesn't like extra returns, apparently
>"It'll work as a base," she said, "Though I can't help but worry that some'll get the wrong idea."
>"How's that, Governor?" one of the members asked.
>"Well, it's erotic!" she said, blushing a little, "See if you can't have the more egregious parts cut out, both the visuals and the narration. This is meant as a warning for our sector, not an endorsement!"
>People wrote the request down, and half the room began to mobilize.
>"Governor," a human said quietly, seeming to slide through the chaos and come to her side, "I caution you: I believe that this may be too little, too late for TX."
>"How do you mean?" the muskrat asked the human, leaning in.
>"The film is as provocative as you said; Sector TX may already have had enough COW plants and sympathizers. And now they're hijacking their efforts at dissuading more."
>The muskrat frowned, he expression reflecting off his dark shades.
>"You may be right," she said quietly, "But I've got to believe that's not the case here in FL. Thank you again for your services."
>"Of course," the man replied with a bow, kissing the back of her palm. She giggled despite herself.
>"You're something else, ain't you?"
>"In my business," the quiet man said, holding her eyes, "You've got to be."

>Alaska.
>It was the perfect place to disappear, you thought to yourself.
>A thousand miles from the stupid problems, a thousand miles from the small talk, a thousand miles from all those tiny, persistent tortures that made day to day life just marginally, completely, unbearable. Circumstance would simply never give you the perfect excuse to just throw it all away. But it's what you wanted, more than anything.
>Well, you were tired of waiting. In a sudden flash of self determination, you upended your entire life and moved.
>Alaska. That's where you'd change, where you'd get tough, finally find some meaning. Just your thoughts and you.
>"Just my thoughts and I." You scroll listlessly through social media while waiting for the bus.
>"No kidding," you think to yourself.
>A thin haze of snow swirls lazily around the city. Peeking above the sparse skyscrapers was the white-capped Mount Spur, casting a long shadow over the entirety of Anchorage.
>When you'd first arrived, you thought the view of the mountain was incredible, otherworldly even.
>But you've come to know that its presence imbues the air with a bitter chill, the kind that gnaws on the tip of your nose, along with your will to put one foot in front of the other.
>Now it just pisses you off.
>Things are just the same here as they were where you came from, the same as everywhere. Just colder.
>Despite being here for a few months, you've got very little to show for it. No new friends, only acquaintances and coworkers.
>No new relationships, only forced smiles and impersonal banter from familiarly uninterested women.
>Upon entering the bus, you comprehend that your life here is almost identical to the one you'd left behind, the only difference being your job and the temperature.
>"Christ," you say under your breath.
>You shuffle lethargically to the back of the bus and find a place to sit. The cold plastic seat sucks the warmth from your legs and leaves you slightly shivering. The driver never has the heat on.
>What you wouldn't give to sit in a car every day again.
>Mercifully, it was Friday. You had a whole two days to hibernate before returning to your slog of a job again the next week. And just like every week since you got here, as soon as you open the door to your apartment you make a b-line for your bed. You flop down and twist yourself up in your blankets and pillows.
>You close your eyes and wait to drift away. However, there is a tension you cannot shake. That realization you had on the bus, it prodded at you as you lay there. Nothing's changed but the job and the temperature. Nothing's changed but the job and the temperature.
>Nothing's changed at all.
>You process this idea for a few minutes more, denying yourself the much-desired post work nap.
>The snow now taps steadily on your window. With every tap you become more aware of time passing, more aware of your position, more aware of the stubborn mundanity of your existence. Then in an instant of absolute rapture, you are possessed of the same fire that drove you all the way out here to begin with.
>You shoot up from your bed and march directly to your PC.
>In the search bar you type, "reliable low temperature camping equipment"

>You'd forgotten your cycle pill the day you kissed Anon
>Most mustelids have to take them during heat season, and for good reason.
>Primarily, you might literally die of horniness. It's an anthro thing.
>For most it doesn't get that bad, but every once in a while you hear about some unfortunate kid going through puberty dying because no one realized what was happening.
>You hadn't taken yours that day, which probably explains how you could have been so impulsive.
>Hands touched, nervous grins were exchanged, you'd rested your head against his chest, and you could feel the magic in the air.
>For him it was just a peck on the lips.
>For you though? It was the worst and best decision of your life.
>Only now, years later, can you honestly admit to yourself how wrong it had all been.
>What you did to him afterwards...

>It's so cold
>you shiver and shake as you stumble through the snow, the leafless trees providing little shelter
>the night sky dark and moonless
>you can't think straight
>the rifle in your numb, frozen hands is heavy
>why are you holding it?
>why are you here?
>...
>there was an explosion
>you were in the camp, just getting ready for bed
>then the whole world blew up
>you had come to in a bank of snow, having been flung out of your tent, your AK still slung around your chest
>you had looked back into the camp
>fire everywhere
>bodies
>another explosion
>it had set off your fight or flight response
>so you ran, the only light the firestorm engulfing what was left of your life behind you
>you've been staggering through the woods for some time now, you can't really tell how long
>it's so cold
>you're going to die out here
>you want to cry but can't
>you can't even remember your name
>there's something wrong with your head

>you try and gather your thin camo jacket in tighter around you as you make it into a clearing
>the snow has started again, falling silently around you
>you look around the clearing
>where are you?
>is this the right way back to town?
>can you even g-
>there's a noise
>you turn to see a dark, bulky figure standing in the snow on the other side of the clearing
>a pair of dull green lights shine out from its head
>and a laser flickers from the weapon held in its' hand
>the beam catches snowflakes here and there before settling on your chest
>one of them
>the enemy
>it (probably she) has you dead to rights
>you force your lips to open
>”Please don't shoot,” you say, your voice croaking
>the laser lowers down to the rifle in your hands
>”Drop the gun.” The voice is husky but feminine, and calm.
>you try
>but you can't
>your hands are stuck to the gun, frozen to the metal
>you try harder, feeling the skin on your fingers start to tear
>it's agony
>you can't
>tears finally roll down your cheek as you start shivering again
>”I can't. T-the cold, it's stuck to my hands.”
>the figure cocks its head slightly, and tenses
>the weapon in it's hand is still pointing at you, the laser roaming up and down your chest
>”Please, I don't want to die.”
>the laser drops away as the weapon is slung
>a gloved hand is proffered to you
>”Come here. I can help.”
>Now's your chance
>Shoot this bitch!
>would that even accomplish anything, though?
>what the hell were you even doing out here?
>the war is over
>long over
>you start trudging towards the enemy soldier, wading through waist high snow
>a squawking, tinny voice echoes from a radio
>”Negative. It's under control.” She whispers back to it
>as you get closer, you realise something
>this thing is probably about half a foot shorter than you
>and the bulk is coming from a huge winter coat pulled over a tactical rig
>the green lights coming from some kind of HUD display on her helmet
>and a blonde canine snout poking out from a balaclava
>you get closer still
>the dog raises her hand again, motioning for you to stop
>”Stay there, let me warm your hands up and get that gun off you, okay? Don't try anything funny.”
>she stomps towards you
>you can see her weapon, now strapped to the side of her rig
>it looks like a gun, but not one you've ever seen before
>probably one of their fancy caseless guns
>then she's right next to you
>she raises the front of her helmet, the green lights flickering off
>you can see a pair of gleaming pale eyes gazing back up at you
>She puts a hand on your shoulder and pushes down
>”Knees.”
>you kneel down, now just below eye level on her
>then she pops the buttons on her big coat, and wraps it round you
>you find yourself pressed up against her body as she pulls you in tight
>its so warm
>the coat must have a heating element inside
>you groan as you feel the heat spreading through you
>”That's better, huh?” She asks, her arms resting in the small of your back.
>”Y-yes.”
>she shifts slightly and
>”Put your head on my shoulder, okay? We can try and get your hands free in a minute.”
>you comply, and she shifts slightly to press her snout into your neck, giving you a sniff.
>the gun is awkwardly positioned between the two of you, poking out from under her coat
>”What's your name, sweetie? What's a young thing like you doing out here?”
>”My name...”
>oh god
>where is it?
>why can't you remember?
>tears well up on your cheeks
>”I-I don't know, I think I hurt my head. God help me I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry”
>you feel tears freezing on your cheek as you start to panic, your world still spinning
>she squeezes you tight
>”Shhh it's okay, I'm sure you'll remember. You can call me Sarge, okay? Just calm down, you've got nothing to worry about.”
>she strokes your head with her gloved hand
>”Okay Sarge. Are, are you going to hurt me?”
>”No-one's going to hurt you, babe. The war's over. You just need to relax and come back with me. Did anyone else make it out of the camp?”
>”I didn't see anyone else, but I don't know. I can't think straight, I might have banged my head.”
>”Don't worry about it, there are doctors back at the base, they'll have a look at you.”
>” ...okay.”
>you kneel there for a while, feeling starting to return to your hands as the heat spreads from her body to yours
>you notice a rank pip, of three slashes printed on the side of her coat
>and a large blue unit badge
>SWEET SIXTEEN
>STATE MARINES
>the words surround an image of a grey wolf with a dead, bloody rabbit dangling from it's jaws
>you feel a little of the chill return
>if she's from the marines...
>”S-sarge?”
>”Yeah hun, you ready for me to try and get your hands free?”
>”N-no, it's still numb. I don't think it's good.”
>”I'll have a look.”
>She sticks her long snout inside the coat
>you feel a faint nudge as she pokes the hand on the rifle's pistol grip
>”Yeah, it looks pretty bad, babe. We should really let the medics see this. I don't want to make it any worse. Come on. Did they not give you proper gloves at that camp?”
>”No, they...”
>something's not right
>hang on
>”I, I never told you about the camp, Sarge.”
>She stiffens
>”No, you didn't.”
>”You blew it up, didn't you? A bomb or something.”
>”A drone, actually. I saw you go flying and followed you for the last hour.”
>it's only been an hour?
>”Everyone else...”
>”They didn't make it.”
>”You killed them?”
>”Yeah.”
>she says it so casually
>”My squad made sure no one else made it out. Apart from you.”
>”God in heaven, no, please let me go, please!”
>you try and struggle away from her
>she holds you still with a grip of iron
>”Don't be an idiot, you're not going anywhere. You'll die if you run off into this weather.”
>”Why the hell would you care? You...”
>a spike of cold realisation pierces your fogged up brain
>there's only one reason a state marine would want you alive
>you look at her in terror as she shuffles even closer, rubbing her snout against your neck
>your skin crawls
>”Why would I care? Because all my girls got their hubbies weeks ago, hun. It's the price of being sergeant, everyone else gets a pick before I do.”
>she's licking your neck
>teeth
>”But you're right here, and with the war being over...”

>for eons upon eons ago. Earth has been inhabited by Man, not alone: but it is thought they are the oldest race- whether minimally elder to the rest of the “upright species” or far more ancient then the rest; both remains to be confirmed, and is irrelevant
>for the vast majority of known history and prehistory, mankind has always had species who walk- and talk like them
>these species have always been seen as a companion; not human, and yet very much part of man. In friendship, in neighborliness, and in marriage. These other species have been around
>almost every religion has had its way of making an educated guess at why, how, and where these species originate and what their relationship is to man
>ancient middle eastern and Abrahamic texts cite these fellow bipeds as originating from a “second Eve”. After the first had broken the covenant between man and God
>pagan faiths seem to have a convergent idea in their mythos that mankind was the final model for the Gods image. And because the first being had been given life these first maker-gods had decided they shall all be family
>far eastern belief holds that the bipedal form is the archetype of perfection, each of these species merely being a permutation of a more abstract ideal
>regardless- prehistoric archaeological evidence has shown that the male human genome has since it appeared has remained in a relatively mutation-resistant state. Being prone to preserving not just itself. But it’s mate’s species via what is observed and thusly named para-linear reproduction. Where depending on the sex of the offspring it will retain the species of either the mother or father
>how this feat of somehow being able to not hybridize- much like cousin species do. While still being able to reproduce with what theoretically should be impossible to breed with humans was a topic of heated debate since the first human baby was was born from an anthro mother by philisiphers, naturalists, and perhaps every other thinker concerned with the idea of what makes a human a human
>it was not until man, with his curious heart and brilliant mind that it was discovered that the Y chromosome, the very same thing that made sons, sons. Also preserved their humanity. It dictated everything distinct to humans and humans alone. And was able to even completely rewrite genes from *any* that otherwise weren’t compatible when first merging together to conceive life in the womb within the first cell of an unborn child
>meaning somewhere either along the long road of the human legacy, or by design from omniscient- unseen hands. The final chromosome in every man on earth contains both an ancient and powerful genetic historical tapestry. But also the means to become wholly part of any tribe with a single female with minimal turmoil. As half of all the new members of this theoretical tribe would still be fully the species of the mother- while maintaining a genetic benefit for the father in passing down his own unique ancestry to half of his progeny
>with how sturdy the human phenotype is. One must wonder if there are any drawbacks to this refined strategy of expanding mating prospect.
>and in terms of outward effects- there are a few that stand out
>namely statistical ramifications
>the first, is that Man’s reproductive versatility makes him a commodity- especially in zones with tribes that lack enough males of their own, tribes that had suffered losses from the elements or other tribes, and finally human-scarce zones altogether
>evidence suggests that anthros who share an ancestry with these rare human fathers and barbarian ancestral mothers are far more likely to be of a megafauna-like stature, and are also more likely to birth males of a similarly strong quality. Much like their mutual ancestors
>this carries the consequence of these anthros being more likely to act in the same way as their barbarian ancestors did in terms of mating strategy: capture, breed, puppy-gaurd
>anthros who have this strong and rough-&-tumble ancestry have been dubbed through scientific jargon as “mega’s” or “macro’s”. Denoting both stature and behavior
>though, the term is rarely used unless in a scientific or discussion pertaining specifically to this genetic archetype
>on the other end of this species-spanning range spectrum were anthros who share ancestry with mothers who has far more males available to them, at about a 1:1.7 ratio of man:anthro is where this change in evolutionary mating strategy is observed. Sometimes aided by tribes being either closer together and more neighborly, tribes having more plentiful resources or higher overall prosperity through its ancient history.
>while it’s true these anthros *can* be sometimes larger than humans in terms of height or frame. They do not have the trait muscle mass or bone density that their evolutionary cousins have.
>these societies have mixed and coexisted for a long time. Though routes are easily traced to region more often than not, and many modern society’s often reflect these stone-age trends.
>societies that encourage “tournament” competition for humans includes: “anthrostates” “assignment regimes” “cougar castes” etc: in essence a male has less say in who he mates with in order for females to secure a husband effectively and in a fair manner
>the societies where anthros have used the opposite end of the mating strategy spectrum are “collared countries” “pet-hierarchical systems” “submission zones” etc: in essence the male carries the authority because there are enough males to go around for a female to not worry about mating-prospect-security
>there are of course mixed societies, for example in the western world; there is something that has been colloquially named an “anthro welfare biased nation/ anthro welfare state”. In these societies the social contract is more complex. But the effect is that by either the politics, culture, popular movement or law, that a bias toward being permissive to more sweet ive anthro mating behavior.

My take for DMVstate is that it's a situation of a massive gender imbalance and a really unhealthy society that develops cos of it (dowries, multiple wives, huge amounts of "surplus" females) which causes unrest finally leading to-

[OVERWATCH REDACTION ENGAGED - GLORY TO GREAT LEADER]
-anyway in the state's current form they own the planet and you have a female dominated system where it's far easier for anthro females to get human husbands instead of the massive pain in the ass of courting an anthro male
as for kids all babies will be anthro (plot point), hybridisation extends only to certain physical features and doesn't really have stacking effects the more generations you go down
For example Alice is pure tiger, both her parents are anthros. She's really tall, her boobs are small and she's got an overall slightly inhuman/animalistic set of proportions
Sally on the other hand has a human dad, she has a more "feminine" form, is more anthromorphic and she's a womanlet lol
You might get other things like eye or fur/hair color that are passed down but nothing much beyond that
All the above is just my ramblings and may change later if it is comedic or sexy to do so

>"Who owns you, little man?"
>”You do, my love.”

>”And what does that make you?”
>he mutters under his breath
>”I didn't hear you, J,” she growls at him
>”I'm your bitch.”
>”That's right, you've got an addiction, don't you?”
>he squirms as he feels her lining his cock up for rapid entry
>”You're addicted to yeen pussy, aren't you, bitch?”
>”yes.” he says in a very small voice
>that earns him another kiss and a subvocal “good boy” in his ear
>before she drops on him like an anvil
>the whole bed is bouncing as she roughly rides him into the mattress
>both of them are moaning at this point as she presses her paws hard into his shoulders, her breasts jumping up and down

>she grabs a hold of them
>then pulls them out from under her and lays them on her shoulders
>he gulps as he realises what's about to happen

>good thing he's so flexible
>”you okay?” she whispers to him, getting ready for the final stretch
>he responds with a hungry kiss
>before whispering “I'm yours.”
>with that, she goes for it again

>Jimmy pulls the rig camera off to capture this wonderful sight before throwing the big white duvet over her
>as he clambers into bed to join his wife, he turns the camera, winks for the audence, and switches it off

>wifwolf asks if you want to try recording amateur porn
>the "porn" is just her cuddling you while speaking sweet nothings into your ear
>despite being recorded it still feels as good as when you two cuddle normally
>sometimes she'll spice things up by jerking you off while holding you or by smothering you with her breasts while she gently rides you.
>once she even gave you a nursing handjob on camera
>what surprises you however is the viewerbase

>her tail wagged so fast I feared it would fly off and into deep orbit
>her whole body was shaking like a tail wag. Actually
>a little dance of excitement and joy

>dates went well. It doesn’t take much- just be interested in what they like and try to integrate some parts you enjoy into the time you spent so you have things to talk about
>sure she’s pretty. But learning she’s also fun is a total bonus
>the connection is real
>I’ve got a throbbing in my heart and a swelling in my loins for this big woofer with large hips, butt, and awoobas

So, hypothetically speaking, if someone were to write a fantasy story based around Egyptian mythology, which species of waifur would be best for the goddess?
A >pic related croc so big she can basically fuck herself with the MC like he's a doll, or a more jet-black sphinx type goddess who demands body worship?
Hypothetically speaking, of course

depends on what flavor you want
>sekhmet is literally an amazon lioness war goddess who canonically is married to a green human god who likes building things
>she also has cow goddess form all about breeding/pregnancy from the time the other gods got her drunk in order to keep her from killing the whole world
>sobek for nile crocs which were actually cared for by people in Egypt in places where sobek was worshiped
>taweret is a hippo goddess of maternity and childbirth making her one of the literal mommy gods of Egypt
>anubis does have a female counterpart so you could go with a dom route from a legal side given the whole judge of the dead thing
>set is pretty untapped and also is sort of a jackal god too in some descriptions if anubis is too mainstream for you
>also can work with the whole angle of set being passed over for ruler of the afterlife and maybe work in a girl version of horus wanting the MC for herself etc
if you dig into it you'll find most goddess in Egyptian lore are some form of cat

>Anthros are the Xenos
>Long ago after meteors and ice ages and all other stuff happened and Earth became a stable life sustaining planet, the Anthro race visited our planet and "laid the eggs" so to speak to populate the world with species that would start primal and feral, but over time evolve into the intelligent space-faring anthros and join the rest of the race
>Millions of Earth years later the Anthro species returns to check on the growth of the offspring they left
>They're shocked to find some offshoot of the primates, "Humans", have somehow advanced far faster than any of the other species
>They scan Human history and see all the poaching, animal abuse, zoos, putting animals in danger for entertainment
>The Anthros decide these Humans must be invaded now and shown their place

>the predecessor sapient race which beget humans and anthros arose not from terrestrial soil, but the lunar lowlands
>at an indeterminant point in the abyssal past, a great schism occurred in this society which left the vast, Plebian castes exiled on Earth and denied of the technology and resources which their society boasted as imminent within this gap of the Oort Cloud
>as millennia turned to eras, the excised populace no longer developed in tandem with their sibling species
>as it was, there were now two sapient species across the two spheroids, worlds apart in likeness yet mere seconds in distance for the advancements of the primeval anthros
>as the subsuming of humankind ensued in the modern age, it was an irony not lost upon the elder forebearers, wizening among themselves from their lunar conservatories, observing man from his earliest days of divergence

>It's shortly after the war, humanity surrendered quickly
>Once the dust settled, these new "relations" took place, Humanity and Anthros were still very unfamiliar with each other, behavior and culture-wise
>Those who surrendered and didn't fight back were placed into "Zones" heavily patrolled by high-tech Anthro police
>We have no jobs or government anymore, we can go outside and engage in social activities and other gatherings, but all media is Anthro-run and we're given weekly stipends to spend at Anthro commissaries for our daily needs
>You're walking to a friend's for some poker games, you stop to pet a friendly dog and give it belly rubs
>A large Anthro Dog officer yells at you, demands to know what you're doing
>You try sputtering out that you were trying to pet the dog
>She cuffs you and says "you're just another disgusting human who likes to hold down and abuse anything you see as lesser."
>She shoves you into her vehicle and hauls you off to the station
>After processing, you're shoved into an interrogation room with cameras
>The door opens and its the Dog Anthro who arrested you
>She sits down across from you and immediately demands you answer to what you were doing
>You start explaining you were heading to your friend's for some card games
>She slams her huge paw on the table and demands to know specifically what you were doing to the dog
>In a panic you just blurt out, "Belly rubs!!!"
>The officer cocks her head at you with piercing eyes like she's trying to stare into your soul
>She states that the dog was on its back, flailing its legs in a panic as you assaulted it
>You argue back that you weren't abusing it, dogs typically love belly rubs and scratches, they find it comforting and enjoyable
>The officer's eye shift around the room, she then reaches into her pocket and you her a button click
>The power lights on the cameras go off
>She slowly rises out of her chair, walks slowly around the table towards you, and sits herself down on it right in front of you
>She proceeds to remove the top part of her uniform, eventually revealing a big set of fluffy well-defined abs and a busom you're surprised she could fit inside the armored portions of her uniform
>She tells you that you need to present your evidence then on "Belly rubs", and she'll be the one to judge you after that

You know I was entertaining an idea about something about milk
>Anon living with a cow morph
>Typical Wisconsin anthro: she's proud of her milk
>Most of the fridge is either alcohol or dairy products
>Naturally the latter is all made "in house"
>Anon comes home eating subway
>She notices that "cheap beast milk" immediately
>Anon's next few days have each meal be heavily dairy-based
>She stands behind him and, as he eats each dish, whispers the description of the ingredients
>The way she describes them is borderline pornographic
Basically I wanted to write a story channeling the energy of the old Grilled Cheese Accademy website, but I wouldn't be able to do it justice. Also I'm not a foodie, so my frame of reference on that is limited at best. But the idea of a lactation-fetish story that's more than just breastfeeding is something I'd enjoy

>privately, the scenario you just went through is terrifying
>you know wolves mate for life. And if you said no...
>what would happen to her? Would she spiral? Would she off herself?
>for a moment the worst possibility that hits you. Is that she might give up on you and find someone else

>you’re about to have a heart attack from the cute levels assaulting your senses
>it’s been a couple weeks since you told her yes to an actual relationship without her having to use her terminology to weasel her way into being your lover
>but that’s only made her bolder
>the both of you make even more time for eachother now however. So you’re in bliss every other moment when she’s not being inappropriate
>it’s gotten so bad that when in a passing statement to when it was relevant that you mentioned you had a girlfriend, one of your male friends jokingly said he already knew because you’d come into class smelling like “poochie coochie”
>that one earned him an arm punch, but it made you laugh
>one day well into the semester you’re chilling at your fluffy awoo gf’s house when she beckons to you in the kitchen

>god damnit why does she have to be so cute
>her tail isn’t just waging anymore, it’s straight up in the air, you can tell she’s resisting the urge to wag about wi to her whole body like last time at the arcade with the “doggy dance” as you call it
>the little dance some canines do when they’re so happy that they can’t wag their tail hard enough. So their whole body joins in the swaying
>you don’t act, partially because you’re not sure how to respond to her, but also out of wondering if she’ll break her control and start doing *the dance*

>her grimace wasn’t intimidation. She was trying not to break down
>I can see the big mustache’d cook in the back shaking his head slowly in disappointment

>within an instant her composure finally snapped and she was full on crying
>looks like I really hurt her feelings
>great, now did I just bully a girl who was happening to be too loud. I also profiled her based on her species
>”could you have asked any more like an arse for us to quiet down?” One of her friends said harshly
>but I could barely register her comment over the 8 foot tall supreme spaghetti-pocketed awoo over here pulling on my sleeve and crying out:
>”PLEASE SAY YOU DONT MEAN IT IM NOT AN UGLY FEMCEL IM NOOOOOOOT” with massive teary eyes like you’d see on a chibi character
>it’s uncanny, the level of baby-crying I’m seeing
>I’d laugh at her if it didn’t make me feel like such a fuckhead for making her this way, and if it wasn’t as adorable as it was, in its own way
“Hey, calm down now... I didn’t mean it... I just wanted you to quiet down a little, that’s all. I’m sorry I was mean”
>she sniffles, her eyes still doing that thing where they’re teary and seemingly huge. A sad toothy grimace still marring her snoot
>”y-you’re mean... I was having fun with my friends and you come over here and hurt my feelings calling me names *sniffle*. It’s not my fault you hate doggies, w-what kinda person *sob* hates fluffy girls...?”
>my heart
>my soul
>now I really have to apologize, and mean it
>god I’m an asshat sometimes
“Look. I’m sorry, I don’t actually think you’re mangey or ugly, or flea bitten- I just had enough of the loud noises. I.. I apologize for being mean to you. You didn’t deserve me being so harsh”
>she’s wiping away her tear matted fur on her face now, trying to compose herself
>”I-it’s okay, we’ll quiet down a bit and be more mindful next time... arwoo?”
>the last thing wasn’t even a word. But she held open her arms for a hug. A peace offering
>”my mom says people make up better when hugs are had. Is that okay?”
>my hesitation loses to my wish to make amends
>even the mustachio man in the kitchen looking out swishes his hands forward in a gesture saying “go on, don’t just leave the poor thing hanging”
>fuck it, I’m going for it
>I bring it in. Letting the giant fluff ball envelop me like a Venus fly trap catches a tiny kricket
>”you’re warm... you’re not a bad guy. Bag guys don’t hug people and tell them they’re sorry” she coo’s
>followed by soft, probably signs of comfort woo’s
>”...mwuu... ooo.. mmm, woo...”
>she’s hypnotically gentle and soft
>I could get addicted to this
>”can you guys knock it off the the PDA? There’s still the issue of an actual apology”
>the large wolf backs off upon hearing her friend. Scratching at her chin
>”uhm... oh I know! You could promise to buy me a coffee tomorrow at donkey-donuts” the big one added, her tune now back to having some pep
>I guess she really just needed that hug

>Be at the beach chilling out
>Can't help but notice all the lifeguards on duty today
>Limber otter babes with athletic bodies, a fluffy awoo with a silky coat, there's even a milfy capybara teaching a swimming class
>Get the brilliant idea to swim out and fake that you're drowning to get the attention of one of those smoking hot ladies
>Swim a few dozen feet into the water, face the shore, and begin wildly flailing all your limbs while shouting "I'm drowning! I'm drowning! Someone help!"
>See the lifeguards all enter the water and begin swimming to your position
>Hehe, all according to keikaku-
>Suddenly a large arm covered in white fur wraps around your torso
>"Don't worry human! I got you!" Someone screams into your ear
>Look to your left and there's a polar bear woman rapidly swimming to the shore with you in tow
>Where the hell did she come from?!
>"No, I'm actually okay, it's just-"
>"Don't talk! You'll just get water in your mouth and get even closer to drowning!" She sternly orders
>"O-okay" You meekly respond
>Before you know it her feet touch ground and she's walking up the shore with you in a bridal carry
>A few feet onto the sand she gently lays you down, all of the lifeguards surrounding you in a circle
>From the look on their faces they look none too pleased
>"So," Says the otter, her arms crossed. "you somehow managed to swim all the way out there by yourself with no troubles, then suddenly forget how to swim? Really?"
>Fuck, they saw through your ruse
>"uhhhh, ya."
>The capybara huffs in aggravation
>"Another one of these pervs looking to get lucky with a lifeguard. The absolute nerve!" She grumbles
>But then she looks to the polar bear, a sly look now on her face
>"Scarlet, I think this one needs some swimming lessons to ensure he doesn't "forget" how to swim ever again but I'm too preoccupied with my current students. Why don't you give him a lesson or two?"
>"It would be my pleasure ma'am!" She happily responds
>The other lifeguards walk away leaving just you and Scarlet
>"So Scarlet, uhh, what's our first lesson going to be?"
>She takes a knee and pushes you flat against the ground
>"Well, I know you need swimming lessons but I'm a little rusty on my first aid, so why don't we do a little of that first."
>"Okay, so like how to apply bandages and stuff?"
>She leans in closer
>"Yes, but first I'd like to start with some...mouth to mouth resuscitation." She says with a devious smile
>Gulp

>decide to take some time off from work and go on a camping trip

>you park and find a nice spot to set up your tent
>you can hear a flowing river nearby, the sound is very comforting compared to all the traffic and computer noises you're so used to hearing
>you walk towards the sound of the river, you want to see and breathe in some nature
>once you've cleared the trees you see the river in all its glory
>noisy, elegant, flowing, you scan across it left and right
>your eyes then land on a mass of fur in the water
>several huge bear ladies bathing themselves in the waters
>you remember the sign warnings and start to back away towards the trees again
>some rocks shift under your feet and make noise
>the bears all perk up and focus their attention on you
>you're frozen
>after what seems like minutes, one of the bears throws her large paw up into the air and calls out to you
"Yoo-hoo! Hey Camper! What brings you out into the wilderness?"
>"just trying to get away from city life for a bit", you shout back
"Oh how lovely! It's always nice to see someone who wants to appreciate nature!" she shouts back
>the bear talking to you looks excited, and starts conversing with her other bear friends, you can't hear them since no one's shouting over the river

>I should’ve set my alarm clock on yesterday
>The bus left before I can even reach the bus stop station for my school leaving me in the dusts
>God damn it, I can’t just go back to my house. My mom is already pissed off as she already is after being late and have to finish my homework in the fucking morning. Doesn’t make it better that my mom is a Doberman who is chubby but muscular enough to lift me and dad both up with her fuzzy arms.
>Screw it, I might as well walk over a mile to get to school. Not risking to go back and have my mom bite my ass.
>I heard a chuckle from behind me
>I turn and see a reptilian lady in a slightly revealing biker clothes where I can see her underwear’s strings
>”Oh… poor lil’ humie missed his bus? Oh mommy would be so mad at you, wouldn’t she?” She cooed at me like I’m some sort of baby pet.
>I was told not to talk to strangers especially anthro women who often takes advantage of young human boys for their sick desires but she’s been looking at me for a solid minute and I have to response or things will get awkward.
>”Um, y-yeah… I woke up late and had to finish my homework in time before I left the house. Now she’s gonna be even more pissed once I come back to the house!”
>She chuckled once again, “Oh baby, I know how to solve that problem~“
>She walked pass by me and showed me a really expensive sports bike
>”I can get to your school in no time flat, babe~”
>She then signals me to come over with her fingers slowly
>I’m a bit creeped out that she cooed at me, but it is another thing that she call me ‘baby’ and ‘babe’ in THAT tone. But, I really don’t want to come back to my angry dog mom and starts barking at me for ‘not taking responsibility’ and some shit. So I accepted.
>As we both got in the bike, the gator lady uses her tail and pulls me a lot closer to her butt
>”Hang tight, it’s gonna be a wild ride!”
>I’ll be honest, I thought riding a bike would be too dangerous for me if I don’t balance correctly, but it is actually kinda fun and accelerating
>As we pass through the cars, I saw the road that leads to my school
>”Ok! So I want you to turn right and go straight ahead!”
>She didn’t slowed down when I told her
>”Uh, can you hear me? I said turn left!!”
>We zoomed passed the road
>I look back and see a school bus turning to the route we were suppose to go
>”Uh… you missed the directi-“
>”Just getting something from my house! We’ll be back in a minute”
>I stood there in disbelief, did she really ignored what I said on purpose? Or did she really want to get something from her house? My heart starts to beat a bit fast
>”Uh… ok…” I respond cautiously
>I have no idea how far is her house is, but where ever it is, it’s definitely nowhere as close to my school or even my house

Kinda like the idea of taking the anthrostate assigned marriages/husbands idea to a galactic scale
>humanity meets up with a galactic civilization/coalition of different anthro aliens
>insert hand wave reason that the space anthros have way more females around than males or such
>also throw in super advanced tech that lets alien crossbreed successfully or human guys have amazing capability with that tech resulting in more healthy offspirng
>human guys can get a free trip to space/other planets if they sign themselves up for assignments to space anthros as their husbands
>go through interviews to see what environment and species they'd best match with
>stuff like do you prefer cold or warm weather, types of food you like, awake mainly during the day or night, enjoy swimming or not, etc
>then get your profile added to the list the species/planet that fit you the best have
>once a space anthro picks you you get taken on a spaceship ride to that species planet where you will now live
>getting married to your new space anthro wife making you a citizen of that species/planet's government
>which means you're also now subjected to their laws and customs with Earth having no way to interfere ever since you're no longer part of the Earth's laws/government

I just got the idea of a detatched, depressed war veteran anthro coming back and picking up her assignment out of obligation.
She isn't mean, but she more or less ignores him at first. He's excited to meet her and eager to please, and he can't understand what he's doing wrong and why she isn't happy.
Turns out she gunned down a lot of humans wherever she was, and hates herself for it. Her faith in the state, and more importantly herself, is completely shattered. She's disgusted by the thought of taking part in assignment, or taking advantage of what she sees as a brainwashed man with no individuality.

Sounds like good way to write some comedy with the guy she's been assigned to trying to show he actually cares for and wants her to pin him down
>tons of shenanigans he goes through to try to keep snu snu
>naked apron greeting asking if she wants diner or to "eat" him instead
>her coming into her room to find him tied up on the bed doing the whole "oh no~ I'm all vulnerable" routine
>making her dinner with a crude drawing of her fucking him on the food using sauces or such to draw it
>wearing provocative shirts that say stuff like "I'm asking for it", "bite me", etc
>and other goofy ideas

I was thinking he goes through typical romantic motions like singing for her, making meals, cleaning the house, and she shows next to no appreciation for it. She's deeply uncomfortable being touched, so he can't try and relax her that way either. The tension eventually boils over, and he lashes out at her, screaming and whacking her with impotent rage.
>WHY! WILL! YOU! NOT! LOVE! MEEEEEE!
this finally gets through to her, she sees the passion in him isn't just manufactured by the state. After that she sees him as a person and they start to bond.
Forgive lack of images I cleaned off my phone.

>selfless anthro hero who gives her all to protecting humans
>however it gets quite lonely in her fortress and she wants to find companionship
>quickly finds out that while the humans admire her they're also intimidated by her. with some even expressing worry that they might be targeted by villains
>eventually it becomes too much to bear and she kidnaps a reporter who she fancies
>she goes to rape him but quickly stops when she sees him crying and cowering for his life
>she becomes disgusted by her actions and feels a deep sense of shame.
>after flying the guy back to his apartment she returns to her fortress and distances herself from the outside world, rarely if ever leaving her fortress

goofy idea regarding language differences
>could be fantasy or scifi, either works
>anthros misunderstand or due to the difference in their language see the words certain differently
>don't have a word that fits "husband" due to being female dominant species and what a female does culturally
>best they can do use similar words like provider, protector, strong mate, etc
>sees the word "wife" fitting for what they would call a male they're married/bounded to in regards to caring for family, cooking/cleaning, helping make children, belonging to their partner, their to provide pleasure to their mate, etc
>which causes funny situations with how they apply it to human males
>and more so when the proposition or compliment human guys
>"you'd make a great wife", "if you were my wife I'd never let you leave the bed", "I want you as my wife", "with a someone like you as my wife we'd have an army of children", etc

>think you're safe around lesbo anthros

>or she possess him and they go on supernatural mystery adventures together when she's not sexually harassing him
>where the humie boy gets molested by other spirits/demons/entities/monsters/etc and the ghost anthro has to save him or joins in on molesting him too

Anthro ghost possesses the anthro medium, which was incredibly easy because the medium wanted to fuck him too. Enter the weirdest threesome where the ghost and the medium keep switching off who is in charge seemingly mid-stroke. Once everbody has cum, and the situation cleared up, then onto the paranormal adventures with the three of them. Investigating ghosts, aliens, monsters, and the supernatural in general, often involving the human boy being the object of the phenomenon’s sexual desires.

>You stew in a deep depression while waiting for the date that you have to be reassigned

>Frightened, you approach the door, flip the lights on, and open it
>What you see is your waifur
>She's clothed in the tattered remnants of a military uniform, her fur has all but rotted off, and her eyes are replaced two black holes, but that is without a doubt your waifur
>This can't be real, she's dead, she died on the battlefield, how is she...
>In shock, you just kind of stand there staring at her in the dim light
>That is until she raises her arms up

>Like a reflex upon hearing her voice you rush forward and hug your waifur tightly, hands feeling the bones flex underneath her tattered fatigues
>She returns your embrace, bony fingers feeling your back and a beleaguered sigh escapes her maw

>she gestures toward you, but a quick glance in front of her desk reveals there are no seats
>in fact, she's occupying the only chair in the room
"Uh, Miss Carol--"
>"Ah! I will remind you of company policy regarding humans addressing their superiors, Anon."
>she chides you with a toothy grin
>you know what she wants you to call her, but you're not going to say
>your face burns, and you grit your teeth
"I am not using THAT word. I work here. I am a professional."
>Carol just laughs and starts typing out on her computer
>"I'm afraid I'm just going to have to give you another write-up. We take office policy very seriously at Aardman-Deinemeijer Health and Diagnostics."
>she finishes speaking at the same time as her final keystroke
>and a buzz sounds from her computer's speakers
>"Oh goodness! The fifth infraction in a week! That's not good, Anon. Frankly, if we can't solve this today, it may mean the end of your time here."
>you groan
>they're going to fire you because you won't play into their creepy sex roleplay while at a workplace
>the coyote folds her ears and gives a soft coo of pity
>"Now now, no need to look so down. There may be a compromise we can reach. Please, take a seat."
>still aren't any seats
>you hold your hands up in a shrug
"Where am I supposed to sit?"
>in answer, Carol carol gestures for you to step around her desk
>when you do, she leans back and spreads her legs, creating a space on her oversized chair for you to sit
>"I want all employees to feel comfortable with me during meetings. Why do you think I got the Bear-Luxe extra-large?"
>she covers her mouth to suppress a giggle
"Are you kidding me?"
>Carol purses her lips, but her rose-colored eyes flash with devious intent
>"I am completely serious, Anon. In fact, if you insist on not meeting management halfway, I don't see any other recourse than your immediate termination."
>god damn it
>should have gotten another job lined up before this meeting
"Alright. Fine. I'm still not calling you...that."
>you step fully around the table and perch on the very edge of the seat in between Carol's legs
>despite your best efforts to avoid body contact with her, she sidles closer to you
>her legs swing inward a bit, so her thick thighs press against yours and you're trapped by her legs
>"There, good boy!"
>you make a grunt of annoyance
"What'd you call me?"
>your coyote captor makes a dismissive gesture
"Just praising your willingness to compromise. You should really get used to body contact, Anon. Many species relish in...closeness."
>she emphasizes that last word with a dramatic movement, folding forward over you to press her chest against your head
>you feel her heavy tits, barely constrained by a low-cut blouse wrapping around you as she leans forward to start moving paperwork on her desk
>"So tell me, Anon. Why do you have a problem with our new policy?"
>you try to focus
>this is the exact kind of shit you're tired of
>these anthro women harassing you, touching you, not taking you seriously
"I'm not using that word. It's degrading."
>she hums
>and you can feel it through her chest
>"You don't like calling your superiors 'mommy', is that it?"
"Yes. Exactly."
>Carol laughs, causing her breast to bounce against your head
>"Is that all? Why didn't you say so? You can just fill out an exemption form. Let's see..."
>Carol pulls the chair forward, pinning you between the hard edge of the desk, and the soft plush of her mature body
>you feel your body heating up even more
>so you try and focus on the bewildering stack of paperwork Carol's laid out on the desk
>"Why don't I get it started?"
>Carol takes a pen and starts marking off different checkboxes, and filling out blank spaces in a blur of bureaucratic skill
>too fast for the eye to follow
>"Just filling out your basic information here, since I already have it pulled up on the computer."
>you glance at the computer screen
>there's your profile
>your name, position in the company, birth date, home address, gender, species, hair color, eye color, relationship status, creep shots of you around the office, theorizing on what sounds you'd make if Carol were to nibble your ear
>holy fuck she is really, really into you
>you start to squirm out of the chair, but Carol's other arm goes around your waist to catch you
>"Careful dear! Don't want you falling out of the chair."
>her paw starts to trail over your chest and abs, groping and squeezing idly
>"Now, we have a few options for if you don't want to call your superiors 'mommy'. If you wish to remain formal in the office space..."
>yes, please
>"...then your best option will be to use 'mistress'."
>what
>Carol continues on
>"You could also opt for terms of endearment. 'Dear, honey, sweetie', though if you have more than one direct superior, they may get jealous."
>her paw starts plucking at the buttons of your shirt, untucking and opening it to start exploring your skin with warm paw-pads
>you huff, trying not to enjoy your molestation too much
"Carol, what are you doing...?"
>but fuck, you'd be lying if you said you weren't
>Carol's got something that drives you a little wild
>even if you were normally too pissed at dealing with HR to acknowledge it
>"Oh dearie, you just seemed to be heating up so very much! We do have a very lax uniform policy. I thought you'd be more comfortable if you were open with me. I know I am."
>you're left in the cold temporarily when Carol stops her paperwork and leans back from you
>when she returns, the blouse has gone, and you find yourself buried in the valley of her bare breasts
>"Much better. How are you feeling, Anon?"
>she goes back to plucking at your shirt buttons, until she's gotten them all
>you're too overwhelmed to answer
“Uh.”
>she chuckles warmly
>"That's what I thought. I knew you'd be more agreeable once you were in the right mindset. Good boy..."
>she ticks a few more boxes on the paperwork
>"Now, I think our last option will work best for you, especially in your new position as my personal assistant."
>the molesting paw trails downward, and slips down to grasp your raging hard-on
>"From now on, you call me Auntie Carol~"

>first, the pleasant noise of crickets had died down
>then the rustling of wildlife
>soon even the murmur of the brook I had not been far from was strangely quiet
>all that was left was me, and the crackling of my fire
>and of course my red cloak
>a gift from my mother, made to last a lifetime
>it had a way of staying clean, almost gleaming, it’s edges embroidered with a warm golden color
>much like...
>much like those eyes... over in the distance, between the brush and the trees
>I’ve been caught
>whether by my incognito interceptor, or by some other thing that these woods have sent upon me
>it seems to be circling me up to the point it runs to the babbling stream, then closes more distance upon its next strafe around the circumference of my camp
>then reaches the stream where the eyes can tread no further
>I do not move. My helmet is off and my sword just within reach

>the eyes
>they pieced me
>as they completed each sweep towards my fire, the tension in my chest grew greater
>whatever body this thing had, it made nought a sound upon its approach
>I am not a man of superstition. But the eeriness of this entire debacle was shaking me to my very core
>eventually as those unsettling, pale amber eyes came upon the threshold of my fires’ luminous aura and the shadow beyond, daring not to tread further as if the light would bring it harm
>for a brief instant I remembered how the unrighteous cannot come upon holy ground lest the very place be the sinners doom, his impurity of spirit serving as making his soul unfit to be in the light without facing utter destruction
>but the eyes were not locked upon my fire pit
>they were locked upon myself
>minutes passed, the gaze unblinking and unwavering
>when finally the silence broke. And a whisper ushered forth
>”I can’t believe it... it’s you”
>if it was any louder than the mouse like sqeak I fear the terror of two beastly eyes speaking my tongue would have caused me to jump out of my skin
“IT TALKS!?”
>I shout while reaching for my blade, hoping to strike whatever I had now been convinced was hunting me since this little spectacle began
>”w-what? No I...”
>the voice spoke again. This time with its proper voice, feminine and seemingly in shock
“... a woman, then?”
>the eyes broke its gaze, they looked down. Seemingly in some form of embarrassment, then back to meet my own gaze
>a wolfess. Tall and lithe. Two breasts pushed up by her day dress and corset. And fur as white as the under fabric that cover said mounds of flesh that seemed to fit just right for her size and physique
>a beautiful woman then
“What? Who are you? And what are you doing in the wilderness in the dead of night?”
>she takes a step back in surprise. And her fur puff up in the way her kind experience when an intense emotion or sensation is upon them
>”o-oh!? You don’t remember me? I was the woman you risked your life for in that fire half a year ago”
>she spoke softly, as a mother would to her beloved child, sweetly and with no shortage of mirth
>”it was when in Brookesfield, the inn’s spirits had caught alight, and I was stuck in a room out of reach from everyone in time”
>I remember the fire well, as well as the souls you saved that day, and upon diving into your memory, a spot for her was reserved
>you let her continue however. With manner she spoke and the weight she carried her, it seems she had waited a long time to say something, to remove something off her chest
>as she spoke she laid herself down, sitting daintily by my side
>”and before I lost consciousness and slipped into the sleep of the smoke around me, I saw your shiny armor, and your red cloak dowsed in water to come save me”
>when she finished there was a pause. And a smile from her. I do not exaggerate her beauty, the smile shined as the sun- much as her fur like the moon even when the warm light of the fire touches it
“Yes, I remember you. Albeit you do not look the same from my memory. Not the picture of elegance I see now, you were injured- Your legs very burnt... how are they? Are you able to walk without pain?”
>she let out a soft giggle and her smile turned wryly
>”why yes I am fine, oh hero mine. I feel much better now thanks to your act of selflessness. Would you like to see~?”
>she pulls on the fabric of her dress while she sit. Both legs facing my in her sideways position of sitting
>out of respect for a lady’s modesty, and value of my honor code I avert my gaze
>she giggles once more in her feminine way
>”you may look, my knight, I wish you to see how well I’ve healed after all”
>hesitating for a brief moment, I look back at her legs
>no longer were they the damaged appendages I knew from the inn, covered in burnt fur that turned them black and smudged in char. But were now, if still healing slightly. The feminine legs of a wolfess in great health
“You look much better than when I retrieved you from the fire. I’m relived, truly”
>a weight I didn’t know I even had lifted off of me. Knowing your struggles bear fruit that bring goodness into the world is a reward worth dying for
>my fur in some places has yet to return. But the physician in Brookesfield tells me it’s only a matter of time before my coat is as complete as the red one you carry with you”
>she smiles, quite pleased with her recovery as she stares back at me for a moment
>her eyes now seemed... longing
>”you are utterly selfless, a savior... *my* savior”
>she’s starting to inch closer to me now
>despite her politeness and her demure attitude, she is making me feel uneasy
>”you are a paragon worthy nothing short of veneration as a Saint. My hero... I would like my children to grow to be just like you...”
>she is uncomfortably close now, I can feel her breath, and her eyes feel as if they could pierce through me
”children... you are a mother?”
>I ask, in a pitiable attempt to divert the conversation
>alas, it fails so hardily that it seems to work in favor of her own tirade
>”no, but if you’ve read my letter, children are something that’s something that’s soon to be arranged for”
“Letter? You mean the one the she horse handed me, the innkeep. I-I’m afraid I haven’t read it yet, it slipped my mind while I was fishing”
>a sudden look of surprise, along with a return to her usual merrymaking just as quick snapped across her face
>”well my hero, before you read it I’d like to ask of you enjoy some whine with me, my cart and horse is nought but half a league from your site here. I wont be more than a moment”
>I ask her another question before she disappears into the shadows again. Hoping to dispel my apprehension over what has just happened leading up to now
“Whine... you wish to celebrate? Are you to be wed then? That’s wonderful!”
>she looks back and smiled, letting off one more giggle
>”why yes I am getting married soon. Was I that obvious?”
>no you were not
“There were some hints that gave it away!”
>I say with laughter, forced and fake. But I wish to give her the benefit of doubt, an olive branch of reason facing against my own instincts to turn tail and run
>she enters the woods, out of sight and sound again. I search for the letter given to me, it may have answers
>”oh my kniiiight~! I’ve returned with wine and candies, the sweets are a home made specialty from Brookesfield!”
>confound it
>I shall have to steel myself against my own misgivings about the situation at hand
>she pours the wine into modest metal goblets
>upon tasting it. You cannot discern any poison or concoction. And she has drank from the same bottle as I
>absentmindedly I try a candy. Spying the paper box with the Brookesfield village seal upon it
>both are seemingly trustworthy
>the candies are delightful too, the one I’ve placed in my mouth tastes of elderberry, and long lasting since they are hard candies
>then it happens
>the coat of hard and flavorful sugar breaks to reveal a syrup with the same taste underneath
>these treats are unlike anything I’ve had
>but... somethings off
>I feel dizzy
>and not because of the wine.
>the candy
>it was in the syrup
>before I collapse. I see the mark on the other side of the box of sweets
>it’s some form of more appealing medication
>damnit all. the wine was a red herring
>Evelyn catches me in her arms and lays my body upon her own, as a wife would hold a husband
>I understand now
>”congratulations, oh husband mine~...”
>I am in blackness
>wandering an abyss, some foul pit
>I’m being watched within this wretched place
>as I look out into the foggy black nothingness. I make out a pair of pale, yellow... eyes...
>I feel the urge to run, and I obey it
>I reach for my blade on my hip but it’s missing
>and so is my armor now that I check, all I have are my travel clothing and my red cloak
>the abyssal demon chasing behind clasps at my cloak catching me and at once choking me
>I’m on the ground now. Facing those pale yellow eyes
>attached to a snouted creature, it’s grinning grimace perverse and predatory
>it’s body as inky black as the void around us, it warbles as it speaks
>”~I~.~love~.~you~.”
>it says with a wretched giggle it’s claws gripping at my body and beginning to tear off my clothwear, licking me with its tongue. Leaving a trail of black wherever it traced
>a feeling of instant shock and panic in my nether regions is felt. In an instant the beast is gone. And I look into an endless backdrop of grey mist
>my eyes slowly open. And my mind returns to this reality
>I am within a wagon on some bed and bench combination seat
>my armor not on me. But nearly placed within the wagons inventory of other things
>my sword is nowhere to be seen
>and the cart is moving
>”looking for this my dearest?”
>I follow the voice. Evelyn is staring back into the cart from its front window opening to the drivers seat. Holding my sword by its scabbard
>”For the journey home I shall use our new family heirloom to protect our new family, while my little sweet-roll rests of course”
“Evelyn, you must let me go, this isn’t right. What do you plan to do with me?”
>she looks back. Smiling in her usual way I’ve known since yesternight
>isn’t it obvious by now love? I’m taking you back to Brookesfield, where wedding bands will be made of some of our combined gold coinage. And then I shall take you home and show you our marriage bed. Where all our little children will be conceived forever and ever- amen!”
>she clapped her hands together at the end with the joy of a small child, strange considering her willingness to commit a crime such as kidnapping with no moral qualms. One with think her smile before hand was a facade
>I do not know if her smile being genuine is worse, I fear that it is
>”oh, unless we move of course. I would still like our marriage bed along to a new house if ever we relocate. Did you have a place you cannot bear to be away from my love?”
>she asked looking back to me again
“I’d prefer to be freed again that I may continue my great labor, Evelyn”
>”I thought you would say that, and it is something I cannot do. Your place is with me, and that is that. Wherever you go, I shall follow. As will be the vise versa”
>she let her statement remain standing in silence thereafter. Driving home her point of this being her final opinion on the subject
>regardless, I sat upright to argue more upon the very subject that left my neck collared to a hitch with chains. And my hands bound with rope
“I do not disagree with love, Evelyn. But don’t you consider this to be a little extreme?”
>I say poking my bound wrists through the little opening. She mustn’t be completely lost to irrationalality, right?
>”the lord can forgive extreme acts, my love. I shall simply have to forgive mine as they stand I’m afraid”
“Do not speak to me of faith. Evelyn, you and I both know it would have been better if this extreme path not be taken at all in favor of a better one”
>”I know what you’re trying to do my love. And it matters nought your correctness on the ethical qualms on the subject- I’ve done what I’ve done. And I will see this through until you and I have had at *least* three dozen little ones. Or until you confess with your mouth and with your heart that you reciprocate my love for you. Which we comes first; preferably both!”
>she speaks of defiling me were it as simple, easy, and joyous as eating a cake
>rationalism and arguing has thoroughly failed me this day
>at least she is forthcoming about what her plans are, I know what to expect from my time in captivity
>also... three dozen children merely in notion makes my head spin, let alone thinking that would be my future
>maybe someone in Brookesfield will notice, and come to my rescue. >Assuming she lives in town and raises suspicion
>otherwise I am hereby royally had
>hours become days
>days become weeks
>and weeks turn to months
>about two months had passed with Evelyns horse and cart making a direct journey with few stops
>every stop was far away from civilization, no city or town, or even village in sight
>she fed, washed and groomed me by hand, not daring to cut even my hands loose
>clever woman knows I could use them to make my escape if ever they were unbound
>our time together also emboldened here to do more lascivious acts first it was merely feeling my hair, or perhaps a hug and a kiss.
>now she demands each night we lie together
>I have not lost my chastity yet, but I fear that day draws closer
>her paws wander over me whenever she gets the chance in recent days
>a heat she had already passed. She cried that day. Lamenting it as if it was a miscarriage
>I suppose I’m her mind a missed opportunity to bare a child is nothing short of loosing a fair soul she could be mother to
>my resentment boils sometimes, but it is clear her mind is different than the common man’s. Seeing her in that state of agony and sorrow was distressful.
>I am called to be better than spiteful, or bitter, or to resent someone- even if they’ve sinned against me
>in addition to this calling. Hers is a crime of passion
>in good time we came upon the territory of Brookesfield again
>”it won’t be a day before we’re home and our rings will be made, my love. I am already very intimate with the size of your ring finger. Do not worry about a thing”
>she plants a kiss on my cheek. She is saving our first kiss upon the lips for her preparations to alope with me at sword point
>”I was just thinking, my honeydew... my i swaddle is in your beautiful cloak this eve before we arrive home. I know the thing is special to you.. and... I’d like to be special to you too”
>she unfolds my cloak before her and wraps it around the mantle of my shoulders. Covering herself in it as well
“This... still isn’t right, Evelyn. Your actions insult your sweetness and the good heart I know you have. These actions are not conducive to earning my heart...”
>for the first bit of her response, she ignores what I said before actually making a reply
>”it was just like this, covered in your cloak like they were the wings of an angel when you saved me... and... I k-know... my love, I know what I’m doing is w-wrong”
>she holds me. Still within the cloth flanks of the cloak and her embrace
>”I know you should be freed, that this ultimately is hurting you”
>her tears are flowing freely now. And it looks as if she’s in pain
>have I finally gotten through to her?
>”I-I don’t know why I’m like this, perhaps it’s in my blood. But I *cannot* let you go. I’m too afraid, so I’m not changing my mind”
>she steeled her face. Tears still dripping from her pale, yellow eyes, and her voice betraying her expression
>”forgive me for the future my love. I beg of you...”
>poor thing. Her conscience eats at her
>I’m greatly relieved, even if I’m still enslaved to her whims. This is progress toward righteousness


>"Okay" the she-wolf you recently learned was called Norma instructed as she led you to your new home, "The rules are pretty simple."
>"First and foremost: you have the freedom to do whatever you want, but obviously things that break the law or trying to run away are a no-go."
>The heavy wooden door creaked open to reveal the modest interior of a rural single-story home
>"Second rule: I won't ask you to do much, just keep the place neat and tidy while I'm at work. Maybe set up some coffee in the morning if you're up before me."
>The place was cozy, with signs of life everywhere.
>It also reeked of wolf, but that was to be expected.
>"Lastly, and this is the important one, if you EVER need help with anything, feel free to call me. I 'm your wife now, and it's my duty to help you as it's your duty to do the same."
>And with that, she took the rest of the afternoon showing you around. A single large area that made up both the living room, with a door to the left leading to the kitchen. A hall in the back led to what you assumed your shared room would be, along with the other amenities.
>With that in mind, you asked where the bedroom was, so that you could move your stuff.
>"Oh right, I forgot to ask: did you want to sleep together or separate?"
>Your brain fizzled out for a second?
>This isn't how you assumed it was going to go at all.
>You had, for good reason, expected to be held down and raped, then bitten as a show of dominance.
>Now, if you were understanding this correctly, you didn't so much get given a wife as you did find a new roommate.
>You told her you'd rather have some privacy, and she nodded sagely.
>"Good idea. Don't want to rush things, right Hubby?"
>...
>Right.
>As she led you to your room, which was on the opposite side of the hall from her's, you settled in and spent a couple of hours getting your place just how you liked it
>Suddenly Norma called you from where you guessed the kitchen should be
>You were basically done with your room, settling on the organized chaos it was left in, and made your way to the kitchen
>There you saw your wolf-wife in an apron that was comically girly compared to her tomboyish looks
>"Actually, do you mind helping me cook? It's been a long day and I assume you're pretty hungry too."
>You had to admit you were fucking starved. The stress leading up to today had sneaked behind your appetite and assassinated it early on
>But the vast amount of meat on the counter rekindled your body's need to feed
>You nodded a little too eagerly and Norma smiled
>"Good. Now put this on, wash your hands, and get over here. We're making stew."
>You were tossed another bubblegum cloth horror and washed your hands as told
>"Just chop those veggies up. Should be a knife nearby. Meat's almost done and just needs to be added back in with the veggies."
>You nodded, and grabbed the knife, only to immediately drop it
>What was this thing made of?
>It felt dense, and heavy, and your grip wasn't anywhere near firm enough to lift it
>It stuck in the cutting board point-down
>You looked to Norma, who was brandishing a similar blade with finesse as she made quick work of potatoes
>You didn't want to be outdone, so you grabbed the cutlery and went at it again
>By the type the carrots were rendered into small-enough chunks, you felt a burn in your forearms
>A bit of sweat was on your brow, and your fingers felt stiff
>You put down the knife apparently forged in the heart of a star and asked Norma about the blade
>"Oh yeah. It's no big deal, just prefer things that are built to last. It's nice, right?"
>You nod, figuring you must have been more tired than you realized
>"Here, Hugh, have a seat and I'll get the rest set up. Gotta watch the pot and make sure our precious beef doesn't burn."
>You decided that wouldn't be so bad of an idea, and plopped onto the large leather couch, grabbing the quilt
>The material was heavy
>Not "thickly woven" but physically heavier than any quilt you'd seen before
>It weighed down on you with an oppressive sort of heat and snugness that might be comfortable if you weren't completely surprised by it
>You could only last five or so minutes underneath it before you were fighting to get it off of you
>Your arms were feeling the burn again as you hefted the thing back to the side of the couch were it belonged
>At least the cushions were soft
>A dozen minutes of idle watching later and you were called both by Norma and the scent of stew that was begging to be consumed
>You practically leapt over the back of the couch to rejoin her in the kitchen
>She had set up two huge bowls with the stuff, some rolls, sides you weren't aware of beforehand, and enough utensils that you wondered if she came from old money
>"I have to admit, I outdid myself this time. Everything is perfect and you're to thank for part of it!" she said, raising a glass of champagne as you took a seat across from her
>"To us, and our life together!"
>You lifted the flute, thankful that at least this wasn't deceptively heavy, and clinked it against hers
>The two of you made quick work of dinner, and you tactfully ignored how the utensils were also weightier than you were expecting
>The rest of the night was spent letting the 'itis kick in and lounging on the couch
>The smother-quilt from before came back, but thankfully a lot of its bulk was off of you
>This show was pretty go-
>It was morning.
>You weren't sure when you fell asleep, but you woke up nearly covered by the assassination-comforter, tucked in neatly
>You spent a few moments fighting for your life as you used all four limbs to eject your self from its embrace
>There was a note on the coffee table
>"Hubby, sorry to leave you alone, but I had to go in and you looked so cute snuggled up like that. Help yourself to whatever, and take care of the laundry for me.
>Love, your wonderful wife"
>Her handwriting was also remarkably flowery
>She used pink ink
>It'd be hard to believe the hulking wolf woman would be behind the overwhelmingly girly things if you hadn't seen it with your own eyes before
>Oh well, do chores then slack off until she gets back.
>...
>Somehow you should have seen it coming
>Norma seemed to favor things that were thick and heavy
>It started with the realization that nearly every comforter in the house was the same dense material as the one from the couch, and every door seemed to be twice fortified or at least made of the most sturdy wood you've ever seen
>The dishes from last knight were also the same as the knives used, unsurprisingly
>You barely made it down stairs to the laundry room without giving in to the mass of the laundry basket itself knocking your balance off
>And it kept happening
>Heavy plates seemingly carved from stone
>Possibly the most industrial-looking vacuum you've ever used
>An actual weight set (in hot-pink) that you somehow hadn't noticed before when checking out the living room
>The (pretty nice) shower's pressure practically flattening you from all sides
>The full-body fur-dryer you tried on a whim almost knocking you off of your feet
>Everything
>E V E R Y T H I N G
>was powerful!
>And you had only spent a few hours on it.
>You weren't sure when Norma was going to get home, or even where she worked, but you were feeling peckish
>Time for a late lunch
>You didn't feel like leftover stew...or dealing with the borderline cauldron of a pot she had placed it in
>So you decided on a sandwich
>Nice and simple
>You nabbed some bread from the fridge, some mayo, and all the fixings you needed to put a certain mystery-solving pre-war sleuth to shame
>Oh yeah. It's all coming together
>All you needed now were the pickles
>...
>There was no fucking way, right?
>You eyed the jar in the fridge with a kind of trepidation
>The sort borne from knowledge of old sitcom tropes
>You gripped the jar
>Then the lid, and
>Nothing
>The lid wasn't moving a millimeter!
>You wiped the jar down to remove condensation, and made sure your hands were free of any potential lubricant
>Still the lid refused to budge
>You smacked the bottom, tapped the edges with a knife, and even ran the whole thing under water again
>Still the green deliciousness was denied
>Your pride as a man was also taking damage
>Norma lived this life normally (heh) and you couldn't hack it
>Still you tried, and tried, and tried until once again you found your brow getting moist and your arms shook
>"I had almost forgotten."
>You practically jolted when Norma's voice sighed from behind you
>To your credit you didn't drop the jar
>"I had forgotten something important again...."
>She leaned over you, and her arms slid along yours
>You could feel the muscles flexing with every little turn
>"You humans are always so prideful. You are rare to ever ask for help."
>Her finger ran over your hands, grey fur lacing themselves between yours
>"Even if you don't think you need it. Especially when you really need it."
>Her head laid on your shoulder, and you found that you were both gripping the jar now
>"It can lead to problems, Hugh. There's no shame in asking for help, even when the situation isn't life or death."
>Her fingers grip intensified
>"You know that, right?"
>You gripped it along with her
>You could feel her arms flex again
>You nodded.
>"Good. While we're together under an...unusual premise, were together all the same."
>Sher turned her hand, and yours with it
>And, soon, the lid along with them
>"We can help each other so much without even realizing it."
>Pop!
>The scent of brine filled your nose
>"Because we're a team."
>She nuzzled against you, and you enjoyed the feeling before she pulled off
>"By the way, I love how neat everything is. Thank you, sweetie."
>Normal walked off, patting your ass as she left your area
>You looked at the now liberated pickles
>Then to your wife's ass as she left
>Y-You too.

>tfw you'll never have a ditzy, overly-enthusiastic pokewaifur who doesn't know her own strength. accidentally hurts you when trying to hug you after winning a match, so spends the next few weeks being extra doting and gentle and loving to you as you recover

>your machoke gf demands "de-stress" or "relief" sessions after heavy training
>she's holding you in her two powerful arms in a smothering hug as you erupt into her
>you start feeling her growing, and is that two more limbs suddenly groping you?
>she evolved into a machamp during the act
>she strokes your head and tells you thanks for helping her level up

>Finish gruelling workout with Machoke gf
>"You feel your blood pumping Anon?"
Aghhh, ahhhhh, I feel it alright... My heart's beating so fast!
>"Oh really? That might be because your libido goes up after intense exercise..."
I think I'm going to collapse... Hold on, my what?
>"My my, you look so tense. You know, sex is a great for stress relief!"
Machoke... Don't do this to me. I can barely move!
>"If you're feeling weak you need more testosterone! Now what's a great way to increase testosterone?"
Is it-
>"Having sex!"
>You're still catching your breath, bent over with your hands on your knees but looking up at Machoke.
>She's absolutely beaming with her hands on her hips.
>Well, she was. Slowly she's coming down from that high, staring directly into you, beginning to breathe heavily.
>You can't stop what happens next.
>She swings her arms out, grabs you by the waist and pulls you on top of her as she falls backward to the floor.
>"Oh come on, fuck me already!"
Nnnn... How sore am I going to be tomorrow?
>"Don't worry Anon. Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger!"
>You have no idea how you'll survive the night.

Do you try sparring with your Machoke gf yourself? Or do you make sure she has another pokemon opponent?

>she'd start out with traditional holds that you'd find in mma, rear naked, triangle choke, something where she can at least have her legs wrapped around you in some way.
>she doesn't ever put too much pressure on you to break you, be it your arms, neck, legs. just enough that she knows you can't escape her
>eventually during one session she decides to sit her ass on your face and pin you that way
>you grab at her and your body flails, but at a certain point you give up and submit
>you also get a ragin hard-on
>she stops fighting too, and suddenly you're feeling absolutely fine with her sitting her plump ass on your face

>anthro supremacy must prevail
>she solely invades a fire watchtower
>the anon who got scheduled for that shift has no idea what's going on
"Uhh...what?" he suddenly inquires
>She points her knife at him and motions to her gun
>"Just surrender now Anon! I've taken capture of your watchtower, cooperate, gently lay out your munitions and I'll take you in as a POW rather than kill you!"
>Anon raises his hands
"I protect the woods from fires, I have fire extinguishers and a medical kit. This isn't a military outpost."
>"Shut up humie! I-wait...you said you protect these lands? Do you include the animals?"
"Yes, of course, I don't want anything to die."
>She pauses for a second, then puts her knife back in its holster.
>"Hmmph, well I'm going to have to monitor you for some time to be sure you aren't a threat. Prepare some food and a bedding arrangement for me."
"O-okay."

All human men must cover themselves in public so they don't tempt anthro women

Would shorts and v necks be seen as slutty clothing?

>necks/shoulders lewd to predator species and more so if they have no bites or marks on them
>exposed stomach really lewd to anthros since showing belly is a really submissive gesture added on with humans being furless and more vulnerable

Let me rework this dumb idea I posted because why would anthros be in a zoo?
>Anthros work at zoos to ensure the care of their feral cousins.
>Humans visit to learn about the ferals
>Suddenly enter the Anthro area
>The Anthro area menagerie is a bunch of differently styled "break rooms" where the employees relax
>When a human walks by who one of them likes she can hit a buzzer to get their attention
>She points them out and motions for them to meet her over at the door over there
>Starts inquiring with the human if they'd like to know more about Anthro biology.

>a sort of galactic space zoo filled with alien anthro species
>maybe run by some sort of AI or eldritch entities/species keepers
>humans are a new addition to the zoo
>maybe something happened to Earth or our species
>or maybe the keepers "acquired" some human males when they discovered something about our genes/DNA that adapted well to some tech/treatment they have that allows human males to breed with pretty much any alien species
>makes it so the children are the mother's species
>so the keepers do whatever it is that they do to the human guys they got so they can throw them into the enclosures with the other aliens so they can breed
>maybe focusing on endangered or rare species first
>the poor human guys barely understand what's happening to them made worse the keepers didn't bother to give them translators
>also the question of how sapient some of these species are comes to question with how feral some act despite the humanoid bodies and mannerisms they have
>many seeming content to act on instinct and animal-like behaviors
>maybe it has something to do with how they were changed, but the alien females seem almost too eager to mate with the human guys
>and since it's a zoo that means they're on display to be seen
>mostly with the human guys being pinned and fucked for the even stranger alien visitors to watch along with being monitored by the keepers as well

>two things stand out
>1: tech that humans are mastering have mostly already been mastered by other species. And it’s simply a matter of reverse engineering: rendering your degree as far as humanity as a government is concerned as utterly useless for who knows how long because all the technological improvements that have been made were simply traded for cultural, manufacture, or service goods
>2 Venus is a **resort** world, not exactly meant for learning, industry, technology, anything like that
>so it’s evident to you now why Sol, the home star of mankind is terraforming everything, including the ones thought impossible to do for like Jupiter or mercury
>TOURISM

"Sorry. Nervous."

>you wonder what she'll be like

>just like it's hers to love and protect you
>you proceed out of the assignment office and down the hallway to your waiting room
>and you shuffle through the files as you go
>inside is all the information you need to get to know your new wife
>let's see
>'Naome Fortin'
>a canine!
>you were hoping for a canine
>she works as a mid-level data collator for the Bureau of Health
>sounds like important work
>she has a small house in the suburbs
>your new home!
>you hope it has a big yard
>most of the other information is less impressive
>diet restrictions, income bracket, things to that nature
>you enter the waiting room and take a seat
>you don't have to wait long
>the door to the waiting room clicks softly, and your new wife steps through the door
>a borzoi!
>she's tall, at least a foot taller than you, with bright white fur elegantly styled and immaculate
>she's dressed like she just came from the office, a bright white blouse and simple beige pants, along with a purse hanging from her shoulder
>you can't contain your excitement and hope off the couch
"Hi! I'm Incog Netto. It's a pleasure to--"
>Naome lets you continue until the door is closed behind her
>then she growls lowly
>"Quiet."
>you shut up, taken aback by the sudden aggression
>did you do something wrong?
>"First rule. You do what I say, exactly as I say, immediately."
>her tone is cold
>you nod your head
>of course
>you're supposed to serve your wife
>maybe she's a little strict, but you're sure once you've made her happy she'll treat you well
"Yes. Of course, I'm happy to--
>Naomi growls again
>"Second rule. Do not speak unless I say so."
>you go to respond, but a hard look from the canine silences you
>Naome steps closer, drawing from her purse a loop of plain leather
>a collar
>and when she's right in front of you, she affixes it around your neck in one motion and cinches it tight
>too tight
>the leather collar squeezes against your windpipe, making it a slight challenge to breath
>you reach up to try and tug at it
>and Naome slaps you across the face with the back of her paw
>"Don't touch. Try again and I will tighten it."
>you tremble
>cheek stinging
>you have to fight down the urge to rub at the spot that will surely bruise
>meanwhile, Naome steps around you, inspecting you with her cold eye as she continues explaining her rules
>"Refer to me as mistress. I expect breakfast in the morning, and dinner waiting when I get home. You will wear nothing in the house, except when I tell you otherwise. When I say so, you will drop to your knees and service me."
>Naome stops in front of you
>"Knees. Now."
>you stare at her, not sure if she meant it or not
>the health classes warned that sometimes something like this would happen after assignment
>your wife, so overwhelmed with love for her new husband, may not be able to wait to get home
>but Naome doesn't seem overwhelmed
>just coldly indifferent
>in a flash, you're struck across the other cheek, this time her claws leave a stinging row of marks across your face
>"I said knees!"
>you whimper and rush to comply
>dropping down and bowing your head in the hope of mollifying her
>even when she struck you, Naome maintained a completely cold demeanor
>like it didn't even matter to her whether you obeyed or she punished you
>she grabs your hair
>"You get no dinner tonight. Learn to obey me or there will be further consequences."
>using her free paw, Naome undoes her pants, and drags them down enough to expose herself to you
>no underwear
>with a harsh tug, she steps forward and mashes your face into her crotch
>she yanks your hair
>"Get to work."
>with a trembling jaw you start to eat her out
>at first she sighs and her grip loosens a bit
>but then she yanks even harder after a few seconds
>"Harder. Deeper. Do better or lose breakfast too."
>you try your best, lapping at her drooling slit with as much effort as you can muster
>it feels like she's going to pull your hair out as she bares her teeth in a sneer
>"Don't look me in the eye. Keep eating me out."
>you look away
>her hips thrust
>Naome humping your face in the middle of an Assignment office waiting room
>"That's right. Keep going. Know your place."
>Naome breaths harder, her thrusts get harsher
>her grip has gone from your hair your entire head, claws digging into your scalp painfully
>she finally cums, drenching your face while letting out subdued moans of pleasure
>when Naome's done using you, she shoves your head away and looks down at you in disgust
>"Get up. We're leaving."
>you pant for breath
>made harder by the collar
>and stand to follow her out
>Officer Gretta took her spot by the front door
>she glanced at her partner, just to the side of the doorway
>her equine partner nodded
>then back toward the collie in the gray uniform of an inspector
>who also gave a nod of approval
>Gretta took a deep breath and reared back
>"State Police!"
>she roared as she kicked in the latch to the front door, splintering wood with the force of the blow
>the house inside was unlit
>Gretta stepped inside, pulling the flashlight from her belt and pointing it around the darkened living room
>it seemed like a normal, well cleaned room
>"Clear."
>Gretta focused
>she sniffed deeply, just inside the doorway
>human scent, canine scent, both suffusing the house
>food from the kitchen
>stink of trash
>and then something more
>the irony scent of blood
>to her left, up the stairs was the main source of it
>she indicated with a paw, and proceeded cautiously
>her partner followed her in
>the inspector last
>Gretta could hear it now
>soft, trembling gasps
>"Hello?"
>she called down the hall, pointing her flashlight to illuminated darkened doorways
>the one at the end of the hall was shut
>that's where the smell and sound were coming from
>the inspector was at Gretta's back now
>Gretta's partner was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, watching their backs
>the inspector must be hearing and smelling the same, Gretta thought
>"Clear the rest of the rooms. Quickly. Then we'll take the door."
>Gretta nodded and moved quickly to follow orders
>the rooms on her side were empty
>an office, a bathroom, both unoccupied
>the inspector worked with near indecent haste, arrived at the end of the hall before Gretta
>"Door's locked."
>in a stride, Gretta was at the door
>the inspector stepped back a pace
>"I'm taking it."
>Gretta watched as the inspector perfectly mimicked the door-kick from a minute ago
>"State Inspector!"
>the inspector was being hasty, but Gretta didn't blame her
>from the smell alone, she knew it was bad
>the inspector was inside the bedroom first
>"Clear!"
>Gretta followed up behind, shining her flashlight in
>she wished she hadn't
>Gretta illuminated the scene
>the border collie kneeling at the foot of the bed
>next to a human
>he looked like death
>completely nude, on his knees, and covered in injuries
>a deep bite wound on each shoulder, far more than a simple marking bite
>claw marks running down his arms
>a black eye swollen shut
>and a series of deep purple bruises up and down his left side
>he stared ahead, looking right through the inspector like she wasn't there
>Gretta was shocked by the sight of him
>"Officer."
>the shepherd officer didn't respond at first
>"Officer."
>the inspector's voice was stern and steady
>"Get an ambulance en route, then contact the Public Safety office. I want Fortin in cuffs. Now."
>a bit of emotion slipped through the inspector's professional veneer on the last
>she was furious
>Gretta snapped back to action, training superseding emotion
>she leaned over to start relaying information and orders into her radio
>the inspector reached out toward the human with a gentle paw
>the boy still didn't look at the collie, but he started to tremble
>and tears began streaming down his face
>'God', Gretta thought, 'he looks like my husband'
>once she got the acknowledgement from dispatch, Gretta turned away
>she couldn't bear the sight of him anymore
>but she could still smell his blood
>and hear his unsteady voice when he finally spoke
>"P-Please..."
>Gretta clenched her fists
>"Please don't t-tell mistress I was crying."

>most anthros aren't extreme sadists

>and who could forget poor jimbo.

He won’t so much as touch his woman unless it’s in the effort to maul her. In order to have offspring as required by the government she had no choice but to drug and take him, which only made him more doggedly hateful of the anthros, because in her need to have children she proved her husband right about her kind
>when they were boys- they were in the same anti-anthro (AA) machine gun squad
>they were brothers in arms. And now brothers in spirit
>and yet now with children of their own. Those sons are taught like their fathers were. their fathers prophecy of how terrible anthro kind is may even come true.

>they wanted to make the entire complex bleed for what it did
>their fathers stories screamed in their heads
>they wanted the worst examples of their stories, and to poetically turn the tables with as much pain as they could inflict
>local authority knew about these men. But they were too risky to call attention to them and rouse their ire. And too small-time to raise suspicion
>their fathers were chalked up to merely being traumatized

>We reach our destination.
>The largest ship In the harbor.
>If there are enough human crewmates, we may be able to rebel.
>The pig gestures me to walk up the plank.
>I have half a mind to jump into the port and take this swine with me.
>I have to be patient, I'll get my chance.
>I'm first in line walked up to the deck.
>The deck hands all howl and pant at us.
>The sneering beasts nudge each other and make obscene gestures.
>While the others are sent down into the hold, I'm are walked the length of the ship to the captains quarters.

>Big tiger girl at a pool
>Has her sights on a human lifeguard
>The only issue is she's deathly afraid of water just like many other cat anthros which makes it hard to get close to him, in fact it to her weeks to build up the courage just to enter the pool building
>So she waits on a beach chair, pretending to enjoy the sun while stealing quick glances at her prey
>Eventually she sees him wade over to the edge and get up out of the water, perfect
>Hiding her face behind a magazine she watches him walk over to the bathrooms
>Now all she has to do is hide next to the bathroom doors and pounce on him as soon as he exits
>Then when he's safely pinned down by her mass she'll confess her undying love for him
>Oh how long she's waited to do this! Years of watching him by the sidelines too scared to make a move like some frightened little kitten
>The closest she ever got was when she gave him a tiger stripe shirt to wear as a birthday present, she hoped he would get the hint but he just thought it was a platonic gift
>Whatever, as soon as he exits the bathroom she'll pounce him in the hallway and finally take him as hers
>Carefully dodging a few puddles on the floor she stealthily sneaks beside the door to the mens room facing the entrance to the pool
>When he exits he'll try to go right back to try and finish his shift, then with his back turned she'll be in a perfect position to make a move
>She casually leans against the wall and waits...and waits...and waits
>And...the door opens!
>And now he's walking back to the pool, perfect
>As quietly as possible she sneaks up behind him, crouches slightly to be in perfect pouncing position, gets her paws out to grab him, does the classic cat butt wiggle, and...jumps!
>Her muscular legs propel her through the air and she's right on target
>She reaches the apex of her jump and to her horror her target slips on a puddle of water in the hallway
>He falls forward on his belly and with her current trajectory she'll sail right over him
>Damnit!
>At least she might be able to land and make up an excuse for why she nearly hit him
>The tigress prepares to land but her feet have no traction when they hit the ground, the whole damn hallway feels like it's coated in grease
>With her sizable mass and momentum she tumbles forward and continues sliding on the wet ground, her claws trying to find purchase in vain
>The pool looms closer and still she continues forward
>With one last desperate movement she digs her claws into the ground and they screech against the floor in an attempt to arrest her slide into the pool
>But it's no use, she hits the water with a splash and immediately begins flailing around as water fills her lungs
>Why oh why did she just have to fall for a guy that works at a place filled with water when she doesn't know how to swim? What a cruel twisted fate has befallen her!
>Her lungs burn for air as she slowly loses the battle with the pool, her head eventually sinking below the water line
>Just when she thinks she's a goner there's someone shouting above and an arm reaches into the water towards her
>She reaches out and grabs it by the forearm, the hand wraps around her own forearm and pulls her up and out of the water with a surprising amount of strength
>She climbs out of the pool coughing water and sits by the edge catching her breath, whiskers drooping and fur soaked with water
>"You okay?"
>She looks up towards the voice and sees her cherished lifeguard with a concerned look on his face
>"Uhhhh....ya. I'm fine.” She says with a cough. “Who pulled me out of the water?"
>"That would be me. You gave me quite a memento back there, but they'll heal."
>He brings his arm out she can see it, there's several red claw marks across his entire forearm from when she gripped it
>The sight almost makes her cry
>"Oh my god Anon I'm so sorry I-I-I must have forgotten to put my claws in when you pulled me out. Oh my god I'm so sorry.” She whimpers, hands on her cheeks
>”Don’t worry about it. You should consider yourself lucky I was there to get you out before you drowned. I'm going to go ahead and guess you don’t know how to swim?”
>”No.” She says with a sniffle, eyes now tracing the floor
>”Well what about some swimming lessons? I could teach you, would you like that?”
>”I-I-I-I” She stutters and stops, face growing hot and embarrassment flaring as she tries to find the right words
>Eventually she gets up and begins walking towards the exit, desperate to get away from this terribly humiliating situation with her crush
>”Anon I'm so sorry! I'm really not such a clumsy cat you have to believe me. Please forgive me!” She yells before running off to the exit
>Anon looks at the waterlogged cat depart and scratches his head
>What a strange girl
>Who knows, maybe one day he’ll work up the courage to tell her how much he really likes her

anthrostate baking shows must be interesting to watch with some anthro host talking about how to cook for various species or watching a humie in an apron cook on screen to get anthro viewers

>psychic anthros putting lewd thoughts in your head

>doing chores around the house

>last thing you remember is going to the bedroom to yell at her for messing with your mind while you're working
>wake up several hours later, naked, sweaty, and wrapped in dragon gf's arms
>what were you mad about again?

Here's a concept I had in my head but don't have anywhere to implement in my stories:
>Anthros can't sweat, since animals can't either.
>Heat regulation is usually done with a combination of fur, panting, or just resting in the shade ect.
>But those are all passive options that don't work in every situation, like the gym.
>The solution: human water-boys, carrying around squirt-guns, misters, and sprayers throughout the gym during workouts to keep patrons cool.
>Personal trainers probably carry some with them too.
>Water-loving species like hyenas or tigers especially love it, but normal cats/lions have begrudgingly accept it and get pissed at unsolicited sprays.
Feel free to steal it, won't fit into what I'm currently writing.

>Anthro dog girl demands to have evening walkies
>Anon is terribly embarrassed by doing this
>Especially since it's clear he has not control of his "dog"
>She's basically dragging him around by the leash
>It's like an owner being led around by their big dog on walks
>Completely unable to control the dog despite the leash
>Making it clear that the dog considers herself to be in charge
>Only he's not just a weak guy being led around by his dog
>He's a pervert being led around by his "dog" who's a foot taller

>Pretty cool gal, very strong, and a excellent swimmer, a bit rough with him but she truly loved him and never did more than some teasing.
>However some time ago she seemed to be in a hurry.
>According to my friend she REAAAAAALLY wanted to fuck, not just the usual rump, not even the pelvis breaking kind.
>She took him to her house, near a lake and convinced him to go skinny dip with her.
>That was a mistake, according to him, the moment he joined her in the lake, she went straight to him and started to fuck him in every single position that was possible in the water.
> He almost drowned a few times, it was so intense he passed out, but that wasn't the worst of it....
>When he woke up he was extremely sore, he also found an ice cooler with no ice, instead it was full of eggs with a message from her telling she loved him and to take care of their children, and then he found her...

>maid anthro who works for a rich human guy
>she appreciates and respects her master, but absolutely despises his spoiled brat son

Anon inna Anthrostate
>Gets assigned 5'4" mouse wife.
>Fiercely tries to assert her dominance and authority.
>Simply too nice to hurt him even accidentally. Curls up in a ball when she scratches him.
>Takes him home to her family's colony.
>Anon immediately swarmed by a bunch of horny mice trying to get that D.
>Clan elders very upset when mouse wife says that it's HER husband, the law says so, she doesn't have to share if she doesn't want to, and It'd be mean to pimp him out if he doesn't want to be.
>Pulls him off to her room.
>Bumps his head on the way in.
>Tiny one bedroom with a twin bed.
>Oh no
>Confesses she put in for assignment without permission and never expected to actually get a husband.
>They promise to try and be happy together.
>Everybody works in the colony.
>Anon assigned kitchen duty. Mouse waifur turns out to have a PHD in accounting, which is how she got a husband so fast.

>Sexually dead until someone tries to make a move on Anon.

>Now she's facing a disciplinary hearing, not for the murder but for unauthorized preggers.

>despite her new position as new alpha bitch in the school, it does nothing to assuage her paranoia that someone will try to snatch you from her.
>as a result she makes sure that absolutely everyone in the school knows that you are HER human (and future husband)
>she does this through a variety of methods, but her favourite is to routinely engage in aggressive make out sessions with you in the hall or anywhere she knows people will see.

thx for coming to my Ted Talk

>You woke up with a pounding headache
>Your mouth tasted of puke, whiskey, and...something else
>You were in a strange place, and wearing an oversized shirt you didn't own
>And, most importantly, you-
>"Well, well, well, Look who's finally back from the dead..."
>Your head snapped to the other side of the bed
>Sitting on the edge, wearing your leather jacket, was a she-wolf
>A freshly-lit cig clutched between her fingers
>And a cocky smile on her face
>Between her undressed state, and the soreness of your hips, you came to a certain conclusion
>With a voice not nearly as masculine as you'd like, you ask the bi -she wolf- what happened last night
>Her grin grew three sizes, displaying way more teeth than you were comfortable with
>She took a long drag of the cigarette and added to the tobacco stains of the dingy hotel ceiling
>"Mister 'I don't think anthros are attractive' here got one taste of cookie and couldn't handle it."
>Wait...
>No that's definitely not what happened last night, right?
>You were out with your friends at the pub down the street...
>"And" she continued for you, "You got so hammered that I could smell the booze on you before you even got close."
>She pantomimed holding a stein, and swayed a bit
>"You were all like 'hey sweet stuff. How'd you like to have a taste of domestication?' while barely able to stay upright!"
>She fixed you with a glare, and the smile disappeared for a bit
>"Honestly it kinda pissed me off. This wasn't some porno and I was trying to have a nice time after work..."
>Well you're still in once piece so...
>"So I figure 'why not put this humie in his place?' and dragged you here."
>You didn't...she didn't...
>No way you'd stoop so low, not with a bitch like that!
>She smiles, eyes wide with glee
>"Oh but we did! And you know what the best part of it was?"
>She pounced on you
>You were pinned under her weight!
>"You came! Like a fucking freight train!"
>She leaned in closer, and you could smell the scent of smoke and sex-funk wafting off of her
>"You kept going on about how 'shameful' it was, and how much you were 'debasing' yourself, but you were still rock hard the whole time."
>Oh god.
>She leaned over to grab a blocky-looking phone, thumbing through something until she turned it to show you
>There you were, face red with drunken delight, legs hiked around her shoulders
>Balls deep in that exotic snatch of hers
>She took a fucking selfie of herself riding your dick
>"I hadn't even heard of the 'amazon position' before this, you know. I'm a real big fan of it now, though."
>You wanted to look away, but in your horror you couldn't
>It was fake, right? Some clever photo editing to blackma-
>"Like I'd try and extort some wageslave! Face the facts: you put your hand in the cookie jar and liked what you found."
>"And those self-degrading comments? Shut right up the moment I got your legs on my shoulders. When you finally sank that dick of yours into the place it really belonged from the get-go."
>She leaned in and whispered "You only begged for more from that point on, you know. Only wanted me to do more and more 'shameful' things to you."
>Your face was getting flushed again, and it wasn't from booze
>"Let's see...you wanted me to fuckin' BITE you, for one thing. Wanted me to claim you as a beta or something..."
>"Wanted to know if I had any friends so that we could take turns breaking your hips under, and I quote, our 'wonderful wolven legs' while writing shit in marker on your back."
>"You even mentioned getting a tattoo, but that shit's expensive for a one-night stand. Also...kind of embarrassing. Your browser history's gotta be something intense, man..."
>You asked her if she could just kill you and get it over with
>"Haha, no way. Your friends are probably waiting for you to come back with stories of triumph."
>But all you have is
>"Memories of being fucked silly..well at least you would, you lush."
>Her ears perked up, and she leaned back
>"Well look who's up and ready for round six..."
>Standing proud, free of any confines like boxers or plush furry thighs, your traitorous erection reached for the sky
>Or, you suspected, towards the warm and wet place it was apparently deep inside last night
>"Did all the strolling down memory lane do it for you, or were you just that eager to sink back inside."
>Rough pawpads circled around the base of your dick, now happily twitching away
>Her hips raised a bit and you could see that her recounting has had a similar effect on her
>God, she was so wet you wonder how you didn't feel it pooling around you!
>"Well I know I'm itching for a top-off before I bail. What do you say, now that you're all sober and back to being a speciest douche?"
>You looked to her
>The hulking wolf-woman who held your precious part in her fingers
>The shit-eating grin that hasn't left her face
>The way her sex baptized your born-again member in holy water
>You shouldn't. You know you could brush away last night as the ramblings of some mongrel but...
>The vision before you was too much to bear
>You agreed, not wanting to make eye-contact like that wouldn't count as a defeat
>She didn't have a witty retort, or snappy one-liner
>All she did was sink
>First the plush lips that kissed your crown like a lover welcoming her mate back
>Then the draw inward as you were pulled past that plush cushion into the real passage
>You groaned in spite of yourself as she sank further down, gripping you with more than her hand at this point
>Swallowing you up
>Welcoming you back to where you belonged
>By the time her hips settled down against yours, you were already a shuddering mess
>She took a moment to drink in your expression
>A canine tongue ran over a wolfish muzzle
>"Tell me, skinnie: is it as good as you had hoped?"
>"No, don't tell me. You're already twitching so much that anything you say would only be half the truth."
>Then she started
>Her movements, contrary to the slow decline, were rough
>Hungry and feral
>They were so wonderfully bestial that you could only grit your teeth and clutch the sheets as she extracted her pleasure from you
>But, even if she was being selfish
>And focused only on getting herself off
>You were in ecstasy in this taboo embrace
>In that small and smoke-filled room, away from the places you were used too, you were free to express yourself
>As that inhuman cunt did its damndest to squeeze another round from you
>As those plump lips ground into your base from all sides
>As her claws dug into your shoulders and her face pressed against yours
>Her vision filled yours as her hips raised almost entirely off your shaft only to slam back down
>Again, and again, and again until you were sure you'd be walking funny
>"Tell me you want it!"
>"Tell me that you want to fuck pup into me!"
>Wait, what?
>"Admit that, if you could, you'd give this 'Bitch' a litter of her own!"
>"That you'd get your pleasure at seeing her all ready to pop with your seed!"
>The images came before you could stop them
>This wolf, belly round with the result of your frantic mating
>The idea of knocking up this anthro filled your head
>And those thoughts liquefied and collected in your crotch
>There was no way you could hold back after imagining that
>And you could tell that she noticed too
>"Do it!" she husked, "Let it all out, you fucking pervert!"
>And so you did, hips trying and failing to raise the mass of fur and muscle pinning them to the mattress
>You could practically feel your soul leaving your body with the way you poured your all into her
>The words that came out of your mouth, you still aren't sure what they were
>Just that whatever you said ticked her to no end
>"Good boy." she said when you finally came back to your senses
>You felt tired...
>You could sleep for a little longer, right?
>With the fur blanket covering you, it was easy enough to do
>Your sleep was deep and dreamless
>And when you woke again you felt like you had just ran a marathon while fighting a heavyweight boxer that also sucked your dick the entire time
>And yet...no shame came
>You expected it to come, but as you realized you were alone in the hotel room, it never did
>You were still wearing what you assumed to be her shirt
>And you didn't find your jacket anywhere!
>Damn it, you liked that ja-
>Your phone was ringing
>Your phone was ringing and you spent way too long fishing it from the side of the bed where it had fallen at some point
>You weren't sure who "Sam" was, but if the fortune cookie picture was any hint, you could take a guess
>You answered the call and a familiar voice greeted you
>"Ah. So you're finally awake."
>"Had to bail on you, since SOME of us have businesses to run."
>Wait she owns a business?
>"Yep, and now I've got to deal with customers while smelling like a cookie monster's fleshlight."
>"But I bet you'd really enjoy that, though. Knowing that everyone, even dull-nosed humans, will know exactly what I was up to?"
>You were glad she couldn't see your dick springing up
>"Well you're probably rock hard again thinking about it, I bet."
>Shit
>"Oh, by the way. You still have my favorite shirt. I'll be needing that back. If you look in the breast pocket, there should be a business card..."
>You fished around, undoing a button and fishing out the card
>Eggshell with Romalian type
>Nice!
>On it you read the name
>Some brewery you hadn't heard of
>But it sounded familar
>"I should be in my office until ten tonight. Funnily enough, If I'm not mistaken, that pub you went to should be carrying my supply starting next week. I'm planning on celebrating weeks of dealings and could use a drinking partner. You free?"
>You look to the card, then the shirt you still wore, and the triangular "kiss" mark on the back of it
>Yeah. You think you can make it...

>beeg wife too loving to want to ever bite you
>still has serious security issues when you go do things that happen to not be in her presence

>you spend all night searching until you finally come upon it
>an early Iron Age “throttle”

>"Hello! Welcome to Better Health Solutions. How may I help you?"
>you slide the flyer over the desk for her to see
"Yeah, hi, I'm here about the medical trials. The flyer just said this address. What kind of trial is this?"
>the receptionist nods her head and reaches under her desk to pull out a sheaf of papers pre-paperclipped
>"Excellent! Please take these forms, go up the elevators on your right to floor six, and fill them out in waiting room three. Everything you need to know will be in the first couple pages."

"Uh..."
>you double check the top page of the packet
>yep, that's what it says in tiny letters
"Yep. That's me. Guess I'm the only one, huh?"
>he shrugs
>he holds out his paw for the papers and you hand them over
>"It would seem so. Please follow me."
>he leaves through the same door, holding it open for you to follow
>"Okay, you have selected home treatment. You understand that's a full-time course for six months, correct?"

"So when do I take the pill?"

>what client?
>you go to ask him, but the nurse has already shut the door

>a pair of those fuzzy pajama pants in cheetah print

>on the front is printed 'World's Fastest Cutie!'
>and an illustration of a winking cartoon cheetah head

>in a flash she's by your side, and you're entangled by her long limbs
>"Hi!"
>she whispers in your ear
>what is going on?
>you look to the doctor
>she's busy scribbling down notes on a clipboard, looking unconcerned
"Uh, excuse me, doctor?"
>the badger looks up from her work
>"Hm?"
>the cheetah works at constricting you with her limbs, somehow pulling you into her lap while remaining wrapped around you
"What's going on here?"
>the badger and the cheetah hit you with a simultaneous 'huh?'
>the badger lowers her clipboard, and the cheetah pulls away from you
>you glance in between the two, completely befuddled
"Sorry, wasn't this supposed to be a medical trial?"
>the cheetah mewls quietly, frowning
>"Keep going Krista. It's not your fault."
>at the doctor's direction, Krista the cheetah slowly starts to hug you again
>while you're fixed with the evil eye
>"You signed up for this trial. Did you read the provided material?"
>no
>quick, come up with a lie!
"I uh, skimmed it. I thought this was an anxiety thing?"
>the doctors sighs
>"It is an anxiety treatment. For Krista. We're studying the effects of non-medication alternatives for patients like Krista."

"So why is she cuddling me?"
>Krista really is cuddling you

>"We asked for humans because you present as a non-threat to a vast majority of predator and prey alike. Your bare skin allows for greater transfer of body warmth, and its texture is considered soothing by many other species."
>the badger flips over a couple pages on her clipboard and sighs deeply
>"And, according to in-house surveys, humans were rated as 'cute'."
>she doesn't have to make air quotes for you to feel the gesture in her voice
>but Krista starts to purr and murmurs in your ear
>"Very cute~"
>the doctor continues on
>"If that answers all your questions, then I have one for you. Did you really agree to a six-month live-in trial with our patient Krista, on behalf of BHST, without bothering to read the contract you signed?"
>shit
>live-in?
>as in you'd have to--
>"Yes, as in live in her home during treatment."
>how does she do that?
>Krista giggles
>"My own human to cuddle."
>it looks like you've done exactly what the doctor says you have
"Uh, yes. I think I have done that."
>the doctor groans and mutters to herself, scribbling furiously on the clipboard
>"Fine. Fine, that's perfectly fine. Waste thousands of dollars in company time, putting patients like Krista out of pocket because you can't spend five minutes reading a contract."
>you flinch as the doctor berates you
>Krista shushes you and runs her claws through your hair, scratching your scalp soothingly
>it's starting to feel like she's comforting you more than you're comforting her
>the doctor's expression softens
>"Tell you what, take the half hour with Krista. When I get back, we'll see if you want to follow through on your agreement."
>looks like you're not getting much choice in the matter
>you don't bother to raise any complaint, so the doctor makes one final mark on her clipboard and exits the room
>leaving you alone with Krista
>she goes on purring and petting
>hugging and humming
>and even starts to throw in tentative licks to your neck and cheek
>there's no clock in the room, you can't tell how long it's been
>but she's started murmuring in your ear
>"You'll do the full trial, won't you? I already feel so much better. You're so soft and sweet and precious."
>you make no attempt to escape from Krista
>even as she lays you down on your side to spoon you
>her legs go over yours, and you feel the purr in her chest laying against her
>"This is the best I've felt in months. It's amazing. You're amazing, my little human. I promise, you'll love those six months as much as I will."
>her paw slips under the sweater and she coos
>"And you look so cute in my sweater! It'll be even cuter when I'm wearing it, and you can slip inside to cuddle on those cold winter nights."
>this is her sweater?
>guess that's why it's so big
>Krista makes a compelling argument though
>cuddling is really nice
>"And who knows, maybe once the trial is done, you might want to stay with me even longer?"
>her confidence wavers, turning what started as a teasing remark into a hopeful question
>you think your heart might melt
>but you don't get a chance to answer, as the door swings open for the doctor to interrupt you again
>"Alright, thirty minutes is up, and..."
>she looks up from the clipboard, then pinches her snout in irriation
>"...you two are about to fuck in my exam room. Brilliant."
>Krista sits up with indecent haste, leaving you half-in her lap, still awkwardly lying on the edge of the couch
>she stammers and tries to smooth out her shirt
>"Sorry! S-sorry. You said--There wasn't--"
>Krista lapses into silence
>by this point you've managed to get back to your original position sitting beside her
>Krista is starting to tremble as she withers under the doctor's gaze
>thankfully it gets a little better when the badger turns her attention to you
>"Have you decided to complete the trial?"
>Krista looks down to you
>her golden eyes glow in the low light of the exam room
>full of need and anxiety
>a single word escapes her
>you barely hear it
>"Please?"
>well there's only one answer to give to a question like that
>to a person who clearly, desperately needs your help
>you lean against Krista and wrap your arm around her bicep in a side hug
"Of course. The full six months."
>Move in with cheetah girl
>House is a messy wreck
>"I, heh, tried to clean up before you got here..."
>Guess tried is the operant word here, huh?
>Some things piled in the corner, a few dishes in the dish washer now, but otherwise it's pretty messy.
>How long has she lived like this...?
>Poor baby...
>Feeling self conscious, she pulls you onto a big easy chair for snuggles and cartoons.
>Routine develops over the next week
>Go to work, come home anxious and sagging, snuggle on the chair and feel a ton better.
>Sometimes you start to feel something stirring inside when Krista grooms you and affectionately calls you here "little human."
>The doctor's voice in the background admonishes you though.
>"Krista's emotional well being is your primary concern. Remember to listen, never judge, never scold, and to tell her it's not her fault when something bad happens."
>"And whatever happens, keep your personal and romantic distance. Feel free to share you thoughts and be friendly, but keep a professional detachment! If she gets too close, she'll have trouble letting go at the end of the trial. Worse, you might just become a source of new anxiety for her."
>"Let us know immediately if she tries to engage you."
>When was the last time you were held though? Having someone actually WANT you, give you praise and just be happy to see you...
>It's intoxicating.
>Cuddles turns into spooning, always with you as the little spoon.
>Her hands start on your tummy, inevitably, but they always seem to sink towards you pelvis or up your chest.
>Her hips get awfully close, like she's trying to feel your butt.
>With no complications and marked improvement in Krista's dopamine and serotonin levels, you're approved to accompany her to work as an emotional support human.
>Your paperwork lists you as a service pet. Her office was strangely willing to go along with it.
>Are they getting paid too, or...?
>Whatever. You were more than happy to be there. Beats being alone all day.
>New instructions come in from the doctor.
>You've got a dress code now.
>Comfy pajama pants and sweats are a must. T-shirts with calming colors and and cute designs.
>Krista loves one especially: a baby blue t of hers that's two sizes too big, with a chibi human holding a blanket on the front.
>It says "snuggle monster"
>Shoes permitted only when necessary. Sandals preferred.
>Never thought you'd have an assigned underwear brand, but apparently cotton did excellent on their exit surveys.
>"A 20% increase in feelings of ease and safety have been noted with familiar scented clothing."
>It's almost all hers, and she's always doting on how cute you look.
>"Eeeee! You look like my little cousin with you long sleevies and cute little jammies!~"
>You soon become VERY popular at the office.
>Sitting there on her little bean bag while she works, you soon have a constant stream of tired looking anthros asking for hugs and cuddles.
>Sign up sheet for designated hand holding hours.
>That lasts for about a week before Krista's mood starts dropping.
>"I don't mind..." She says, half heatedly as she sags in her chair.
>She cries and holds onto you for the better part of an when you say you're going to focus on her.
>That's the first time she kisses you on the cheek.
>"You're too good for me, Nonny"
>HNNGGG
>Her anxiety improves significantly, even better than before.
>With a little prodding, you two spend a free afternoon tidying up your house.
>Krista's workplace productivity increases dramatically.
>Lot of salty coworkers though...
>Then things start getting more intense.
>She wants you to sleep in her bed with her now, and always wants to spoon.
>You spot her sniffing your underwear while you're doing laundry.
>During your monthly check in with BHST Krista and the doctor have some kind of hushed argument.
>She comes storming out, looking red faced and embarrassed, and sits you down right there for hugs nuzzles.
>You have a good idea what about.
>One evening while cooking dinner you realize there's a spice missing from the recipe.
>Go to the store alone to get a shaker of the stuff.
>Come back to Krista crying on the couch.
>She leaps out of her seat to glomp you into the wall.
>Hums a familiar tune while she's rubbing you're back.
>"My little human, my little human, aaaaaaahhhh~"
>Confound that children's cartoon.
>After dinner while preparing for bed, you see her standing just outside your room.
>"A-Anon, I'm going t-to take a shower, and I-I had a really bad day..."
>"Do you...want to m-maybe, join me?"
>No one could resist those pleasing eyes.
>She insists on washing your back for you, and holding you while you bathe.
>Licks across your neck and cheek while her hand trails downwards and touches your penis.
>Your erection is immediate, despite your best efforts.
>Warm, soft paws start to stroke you.
>"Good boy Anon...I know you can do it!"
>Anon lick across your neck that sends a shiver through your body.
>"You make me so happy, my little human. You're so soft and precious, I need to make you feel good too."
>You don't last long.
>So much for emotional distance.

halloween in /adhg/ settings
>humie guys/boys running around in costumes that make anthros act up
>some costume are intentionally lewd while others end up lewd unintentionally to certain species
>also all the couple's costumes they can wear with their waifur
>like little red riding hood outfits for wolves
>an excuse for certain species act out fantasies due to the spooky atmosphere
>some species like black cats, wolves, bats, and any that have ties to stuff like the occult, witchcraft, horror movies, etc get extra into the season
>colder weather which means humans want to cuddle up more

>anthro lawyer woman defends your honor and reputation in a court
>because of the nature of the case has to learn a lot about you, your background, and the content of your character
>finally wins out in the court case, but it’s had a side effect
>she’s completely fallen head over heels from your bio. From her perspective it’s like her favorite character from a storybook is her living, breathing client. Who also happens to be right next to her in the court room
>she was composed the whole time during the court case. But the moment you’ve been awarded your winnings she starts fidgeting a bit
>before you leave. She approaches you again
>Mister Ymous. I’m afraid upon review of your case. That I’ll have to press charges myself
>she sues you based on the mental damages of being unable to marry the man she was made to learn about in full as if she were married to him
>unfair payment charges, the claim was the money was not fair recompense for the cost of falling in love
>she fucking wins this court case too
>she’s to be awarded a fully legally binding marriage vow and certificate to you
>you ask her off the cuff after the case is closed that if she intended to marry you, what was the pint of paying her?
>”I put it to our new 401K9 (get it?) and to get you this!”
>she takes out a gold wedding band and places it on your ring finger
>she refuses to let go of your hand thereafter
>let decide which house we should stay in- after that we can work on filling the one we like more new little lawyers!”

>Later anthrostate timeline
>Society has cooled down and men's suffrage has made strides.
>Anthros no longer just pluck random men off the street.
>Most pairs are assignments or traditional dating.
"Yeah man I don't know. I delayed assignment because I'd rather find a girl the old fashioned way."
>"You want to date? I assume you would be swimming in girls if that were the case."
"no, I mean yeah, girls shoot their shot with me sometimes, I'm talking about the OLD fashioned way."
>"You mean like the decades after the troubles? Seriously?"
"Yeah. snatched up off a dark street corner by a big strong girl, the works."
>Later, via text
>"Hey man I was thinking about what you said. You weren't joking right?"
"Nope."
>"There's a girl I know that I think has been looking and might be into it. I guess I can't just send her your number or whatever. Are you really serious?"
"Tell her I'm going to see night of the long claws 3 on Friday at 10."
>"Isn't that the stupid borderline fetish werewolf flick where a dog girl turns into a werewolf and claims men? You are so cliche."
>Tell her she's 'not invited' If you catch my drift"

>Friday comes and you're nearly shivering with excitement.
>The teller gives you a weird look when you stutter out the name of the movie, she probably thinks you're a pervert or something.
>To be fair, if your impending wife wants you right there in the theater there's probably going to be a mess she doesn't want to clean.
>Sorry lady.
>You get your ticket and skip concessions to go straight to the theater.
>You snuck snacks in your pockets, naughty boy.
>Who would seriously pay four bucks for candy bar though?
>You enter from the back and take your seat in the middle and see the only other occupant in the theater, a large anthro sitting near the front of the theater.
>You cant make out the species but she's at least twice your size.
>Probably not a wolf, maybe a bear or a hippo?
>Is this her? How much of the movie are you going to sit through before she makes her move? Does she already know you're in here?
>The preshow advertisements aren't even done rolling and you're already vibrating with adrenaline.
>Will she take you then and there?
>Will she something or just claim you without a word?
>When will she bite you? Maybe before? After?
>You should have come prepared with medical gauze but hindsight is 2020
>The movie is just starting when you hear another patron shuffle into a seat in the row behind you.
>As you look back you realize that it would spoil some of the fun if you saw her too soon so you quickly look forwards again.
>In the short glimpse you saw in the dark it was another anthro. She was shorter than most, probably about your height and skinny.
>Shes going to ruin your moment, your new wife probably wont claim you right here if she has an audience.
>You grumble and sink into your seat.
>The movie plays and you're only half way into the movie.
>The anthro anti-hero has already claimed a lumberjack in the forest, but she had turned into a big werewolf at the time and forgotten her actions after turning back
>by the halfway point she had learned of her affliction and lost control again.
>now she is stalking a yuppie as he gets lost in the dark side streets of a city.
>He's literally you
>You're paying more attention to the girl sitting at the front of the theater.
>When will she make her move?
>Eventually the story wraps up with the dog girl getting caught but her victims refuse to testify and there is no case against them.
>They all give her saucy looks during their time on the witness stand.
>They've really ramped up the fetish since the first movie in the series.
>The director knows her audience, you guess.
>The credits start playing and the anthro stands up.
>This is it.
>Shes approaching.
>Your eyes have adjusted to the dark and you can see shes a huge moose.
>Easily three times your body weight.
>She walks right past you.
>What?
>She makes her way to the exit and leaves without even acknowledging you.
>You look around the theater and you are alone and confused.
>Will she take you on your way home?
>That would be so hot.
>Your excitement renewed, you leave the theater and begin walking home.
>Your instincts tell you to look over your shoulder but your refuse.
>You even make a detour through a dark alley.
>This is the perfect moment.
>You can't help yourself and look back.
>Empty. Seriously? maybe is a species that is really good at hiding.
>You get home unmolested, which unlike everyone else you think is a bad thing.
>As you lock the door to your apartment you fish you phone out of your pocket and call your friend.
>It rings several times and just before going to voice mail he picks up. "Dude, what?"
>He sounds very sleepy and unhappy.
"Nothing happened!"
>"You know people usually wake up their friends to tell them something important happened right?"
"Yeah well I went to the movies and nothing happened!"
>"What are you talking abou- oh right the girl. I don't know man, maybe shes stalking you or something."
"Well tell her to stalk... faster or something."
>"Ugh fuck you dude I'm going back to sleep."
>The line goes dead.
>He didn't mean it but you deserved it.
>The next morning you plot out a different course for your morning run.
>A long trail along the river walk until you get into a worse part of town.
>That's to tire you out.
>Then a path that cuts through some side streets that you think should be quiet.
>Finished by a run back through a nearby park that is well forested.
>The last two legs are probably the worst paths someone would take if he wanted to stay safe.
>You send it off to your friend. "My new route for morning runs at 6. Send it to her."
>You didn't expect much on your first day. Your buddy probably wont even be up to send it to her before you're done.
>A cat roller blades past you on the river walk.
>People still do that?
>Various other species are going up and down the walk at their own pace but pay you no mind.
>The side streets are quiet as you hoped.
>Too quiet being that you weren't getting snatched up by a giant wolf or bear.
>On the run back through the wooded tow path you see a greyhound sprinting towards you at full tilt.
>She seems to notice your sudden fear and gives an apologetic wave as she passes.
>She must be able to run four times your speed.
>Too bad she wasn't it.
>You get home knowing there was no time for your mysterious stalker to intercept you but you still feel let down.
>You check your phone to see two new messages from five minutes ago.
>"Alright it's sent."
>"Weirdo"
>Don't knock a man who appreciates a girl that can crush watermelons with any part of her body.
>You spend all day imagining various buff anthro ladies covered in red watermelon gore.
>Tiger arms.
>Wolf claws.
>Gator jaws.
>Collie thighs.
>The morning after you're on your run again.
>Roller blading cat: check
>A huge doberman walking next to her husband showing off a gnarly claiming scar while pushing a double stroller with two healthy pups: lucky.
>After passing the family you become aware of someone running behind you.
>By the cadence of the footsteps there's no way that's a human, shes charging right at you!
>Is this finally the moment?
>She's already upon you!
>A cheetah blows by like shes about to win a gold medal.
>Darn.
>You are an anxious, horny wreck waiting for a moment that could come any time.
>Side streets: still quiet.
>tow path: The greyhound passes you by again but this time instead of fear you only feel a minor sense of disappointment.
>You get home, still frustratingly unmolested.

>Be anon
>Be only human living in an apartment complex full anthros
>Due to sociopolitical reasons, this means your rent's cheap and you need to write a report once a month
>There's a certain detail you tend to leave out, though
>That detail is currently pinning you to the ground after bulldozing through your cracked door
>Ms Crowley is your neighbor and she tends to bake, leading to your recent weight gain
>So when she asked you to help her make a pie, you figured it was a harmless request
>She meant a creampie
>Not the kind that required a tin
>So, after practically breaking your hinges, shredding your slacks, and coating your face in slobber, she's getting exactly what she wanted
>Also, to her credit, she didn't spill the sugar you got for her
>But a very different kind of cookie is getting glazed at the current moment as she rides your dick like she just got out of prison
>You'd object, or file a report
>But the way her tits sway above your face is hypnotic
>Her ears being supremely petable, even when getting borderline raped, helps too
>You make the token attempt to push her off as you feel yourself getting close, but you've already been through this song and dance enough times
>Your hand are held above your head, and babbling adoration is mixed with a deep growl
>Her thighs squeeze more and, while you can't see it this time, you know her ass is flexing with every bit of muscle needed to wring you dry
>Which, thanks to your kegal exercises, is much more than a few months ago
>Once again stuffed, she pulls up her panties, fetches her cup of sugar, and walks out your door with an exaggerated sway in her step and a dotted line across the hall.
>Sure enough, she also took your pants again...
>You're sitting around playing tekken a couple hours later when you hear a knocking at your door
>It's her
>She's got pie!
>Actual pie this time!
>It's your favorite!
>It's fucking delicious!
>Also your pants have been patched up!
>with a tearaway seam in the crotch

>be human
>used to go to mixed species gym
>you'd get hassled every moment
>bigger species like cows and bears offering to check your form and spot you while you lift, just happen to grope you while 'helping out'
>equines, bunnies, and greyhounds try to show off while you're doing cardio and turn the treadmills to the max setting
>always get grabbed on the way to the shower for a wolf, dog, or coyote to huff your scent
>not to mention the creepers who 'accidentally' go into the wrong locker room while you're changing
>so now you go to a human only gym
>and try to ignore the anthros fogging up the windows as they stare from the sidewalk

"F-f-f-fuck."
>your teeth chatter out the curse into the icy night air
>you're so cold it hurts
>whatever skin of your face that you couldn't stuff under your jacket's collar stings
>your feet are numb from long marching in wet socks and damp boots
>your arms are drawn in from your sleeves to wrap around your chest
>and your teeth just keep chattering
"Fucking woods. F-fucking snow. F-f-fucking cold snap. F-f-freak weather. Ssshitty fucking c-c-car."
>snow crunches beneath your feet with every plodding step
>you want to go faster to get back to some kind of civilization
>but your last attempt at hurrying resulted in you tripping and tumbling into a snowbank
>your soaked clothes a reminder of your clumsiness
>you think you remember that being wet in the cold is really, really not good
>but you're not hiking all the way back to the campground to get changed
>you think you're closer to the ranger station than the campground at this point
>you have to be
>you've been walking so long
>must be at least an hour, from how tired you are
>so tired
>you grunt and shake your head, trying to stay focused
>so you do a little more ranting
"Brilliant f-f-fucking idea Anon. 'Don't worry about me. J-j-just gonna go it alone. Gonna try and f-f-find myself'. Stupid. Find myself frozen like a g-g-goddamn popsicle."
>you shiver
>not just from the cold, but the terrible thought
>what if you do freeze?
>out in the middle of nowhere in a national forest
>you grit your teeth and struggle to push the thought away
>the wind picks up, making the bare tree branches rattle
>lashing against you to strike at your determination
>your breath comes in shudders that stab cold deep in your lungs
>what if this is really it?
>you don't want to freeze to death
>then, carried over the wind, a sound that makes you freeze in your tracks
>a wolf's howl
>on second thought, freezing to death sounds better than being eaten
>it came from somewhere in front of you
>you stare deep into the darkness in front of you
>thankfully it's a full moon, and your visibility isn't awful
>you catch a twitch of movement behind a patch of evergreens to your right
>but maybe that's just the wind?
>you look closer, and closer
>oh shit!
>there it is!
>a glint of light you're sure are the eyes of a wolf waiting to spring out and eat you for dinner
>your heart hammers, forcing adrenaline to your sluggish limbs
"F-f-fucking wolf! Fuck off!"
>you make a break for it, cutting left and churning your legs hard through the thick snow
>you burst through a thicket of young trees, barely feeling their branches whipping against your face
>is it following you?
>you turn back to look, but can't see anything through the trees
>but when you turn back to watch where you're running, you slam into the trunk of a tall oak tree
>you bounce off it, and with your arms still wrapped up under your jacket, you fail to correct yourself
>whumf!
>you fall straight back into a pile of snow and lay there panting
>your body tells you to get up, keep moving or else
>but the adrenaline is wearing off quick now that your momentum's been brought to a halt
>you're just tired now
>too tired to bother standing back up
>need to take a breather for a few minutes and then you'll get to the ranger station
>there's that howling again
>it's much closer this time
>the image of your favorite t-shirt, one with three wolves howling at the moon comes to your mind
>and you laugh
>so fucking dumb
>you howl too
"Awoooooo!"
>then you descend into weak laughter as you shut your eyes to rest
>cool fucking shirt though
>it's warmer now
>that's a relief
>when you open your eyes, the moon is gone, replaced by a roof of wood slats
>did you make it to the ranger station after all?
>something about this space doesn't scream 'forest ranger station'
>could be the flickering of firelight that illuminates the space
>or the fact this is clearly a wooden hut
>maybe it's the strange bed you're lying on
>it's warm, lined with soft fur, but strangely shaped and firm on places
>your head is resting on a soft pillow of the same material
>overall it feels amazing, like you're wrapped in a hug made of pure warmth
>when you shift slightly, you find that metaphor more true than you know
>something wrapped around your waist is holding you down on the bed
>feels like more fur
>you blink in confusion, half-asleep mind taking its time to comprehend that you are in fact completely nude
>explains why you feel fur on your ass cheeks
>you try to move again, will your sore body to sit up
>"Hey. No."
>a husky feminine voice murmurs in your ear
>the grip around your waist tightens and tugs you back down
>so you pick your head up to look and see a pair of fur-covered arms hugging you
>terminating with paws that have wicked-long claws
>your thinking brain tells you this is really bad
>that you're laying on top of some kind of wendigo or werewolf that's going to turn you into long pork
>but your instincts say otherwise
>your instincts say that you're warm instead of cold
>that you're inside instead of out
>and that you're found instead of lost
>so you decide to trust your gut and let your head drop back down
"Sure thing. Not going anywhere."
>the voice doesn't respond
>now that you're more awake, you can feel it moving beneath you, chest rising and falling as it breaths
>you let it go on for several long breaths
>but you gotta figure some things out
"So hey, uh, where are we?"
>"We are in my home. I brought you here."
>well that seems pretty obvious
>at least her--it sounds like a she--home is warm
>on to the next question
"Alright. Guess it'd be worse if it wasn't your home, huh?"
>you chuckle in attempt to lighten the mood
>your living mattress makes a snuffing sound
>"It would be, yes."
>she sounds amused
"Right. Next question I guess. Who are you?"
>"I am Saoirse."
>Seer-sha?
>never heard a name like that before
"It's nice to meet you Seer-sha. My name is--"
>she interrupts you with your own name
>"Anon. I have heard you talk to yourself."
>oh
>you were being pretty loud last night
>she goes on, sounding amused
>"You have not stopped talking since the moment you arrived in my forest."
>she snuffs again
>how long has this thing been stalking you?
>"You sing very well."
>ah fuck
>she heard you belting power ballads to yourself when you thought you were alone
>even by the warmth of the fire and her body heat, you can feel yourself burning a little
"Thanks."
>whoever this is, she's been watching you for the last few days
>you decide to probe a little more
"So uh, Seer-sha, what exactly are you? No offense intended! Just, you're not a human right?"
>Saoirse shifts
>suddenly you're turned as she slides out from under you
>she deposits you on a bed of actual animal furs and straddles your waist
>your first good look at her is striking, as the lean, deadly looking wolf woman cranes her head to howl
>you recognize it as the same howl that followed you in the night
>you jaw hangs loose
>she's a vision of otherworldly beauty
>Saoirse lowers her head to look at you
>her eyes glow gold in the firelight
>"You are not scared? You fled from me in the night. You told me to fuck off."
>you did do that
>is she pissed about it?
>it's hard to read her expression because she has a wolf face
>a well-sculpted wolf face, with ears that twitch ever so slightly
"Uh..."
>smart
>use your words genius
"I thought you were going to eat me."
>not much better
>Saoirse snuffs again, and opens her mouth to pant
>you think that might be her laughing?
>"And now?"
>what do you say?
>that she's the most beautiful creature you've ever seen?
>or may just 'thanks for saving my life'?
>you blurt out the first coherent sentence
"Now I think you're the reason I'm out here."
>that was dumb
>fuck is that supposed to mean?
>Saoirse turns her head to the side in a canine show of confusion
>"What do you mean?"
>come up with a lie, quick!
"You're beautiful. Like nothing I've ever seen before. And you're my hero. If you hadn't found me out there, I'd have died alone and scared in the dark."
>that's not a lie
>that's more truth than you should ever admit to a woman you just met
>even if she's a wolf-woman who saved your life
>her golden eyes bore into you, seeming to drag even more out of you
"I came out here cause I'm sorta--I'm not doing great. At home. In my life. I wanted to do something new, come to the middle of nowhere to find myself, but shit..."
>you smile up at her
