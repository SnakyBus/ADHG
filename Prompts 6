I want nothing more than to have a big beautiful bodacious bountiful bear wife. I want to pump her full of cubs then watch the sun set over a scenic forest, the bump on her belly growing alongside the pride in my chest I feel every time I gaze upon her fecund form. When I put the finishing touches on the cabin we'll call it home, a safe but comforting speck of paradise hidden amongst the vast untouched nature that surrounds us. As we watch our cubs grow and mature she will keep a gentle, but firm, paw on their development. They may stumble, and fall, and try our patience, but with a well of unconditional love that proves limitless we'll all make it through the tribulations of child rearing mostly unscathed and a whole lot wiser. There will come a time when the cubs are all grown up, and our joints seem creaky, and the small joys in life seem to be all that's in reach, and she'll feel like passing time just sitting on the front porch counting down the days until she's not around to count them any longer. And you know what? That's fine. Just as long as you're right next to her.

>anthro goddess grabs random human souls when on their way to heaven, fucks them til they're numb and then takes them to her personal corner of the afterlife where they will live in her bliss for the rest of eternity

>gets inironically snu snu’d
>goes through the whole process again now he’s dead

>CRACK!
>"agh.. oops.. you okay mortal?... uh.."
>wheezing anon writhes in agony under her hips, having just been broken in half
>"ahh... d-don't worry! I'll make this quick!"
>Goddess lifts her butt off his hips and slams it down on his head with full force, anon barely knows what hit him.
>Suddenly his eyes shoot open, was it a dream? No...
>Sitting on fluffy clouds, a gorgeous permanent sunset sky above
>Goddess stands before him with a sheepish expression
>"So.. funny thing, you got lucky so you get to go round two with me!"
>"You're already dead so it's not like I can accidentally kill you this time, ready when you are, mortal"
>spend what feels like hours letting the goddess ride you
>being slammed into the clouds by her is probably the best thing you've ever felt. unironically a religious experience.
>once all is said and done you feel exhaustion creeping up on you.
>as you're dozing off she picks you up in a bridal carry. resting your head on her heavenly breasts
>"come on mortal. let's get you home". the last thing you hear before falling asleep
>you wake up in your bed. with your body intact
>huh. was it really a dream?
>you look out the window, the sky is cloudy
>just then the clouds part. the sky is awash with heavenly lights and you see the goddess in the middle of the clouds
>she speaks to you in a booming voice. "good to see my favorite mortal awake. I had a great night, we should meet up again sometime"

>she shoots a lightning bolt at your front yard and disappears into the clouds
>confused, you go to check the spot where the lightning bolt hit

>a new planet begins to grow in her womb
>you're not quite sure how to feel about being partly responsible for birthing a world

>Viper waifur who loves to roleplay cheesy scenes from her "ADVENT Occupation" pornos
>Both of you struggle to keep a straight face staying in-character
>The shit-eating grin you give when she calls you a "disgusting rebel"
>The fanged smirk you see when you call her a "vile beast"
>It never lasts, though
>By the end you're laying there together as you did on your first meeting
>She still teases you about how easy it was to catch you that night
>How eager you were to lay with her in exchange for your life
>Spending the rest of the war "indefinitely detained" in her quarters
>And being here for her now, when she needs you most

>Your workplace went out of business so you have to find a new job.
>Go out searching for anyone who will hire you
>All of the jobs that even pay something near acceptable require a doctorate.
>You have 10 years experience and a bachelor, why the fuck won't they even call back?!
>Your impending existential crisis is averted when you find a job that pays well.
>Suspiciously well at that given the job description.
>Well, if you could call it a job description.
>It's literally just 'Chair, human men only' and then the pay.
>Well that's really descriptive.
>Well fuck, even if it is a scam it's not like you have something else lined up.
>You arrive at an office building.
>It's half a dozen floors tall with the stereotypical shiny windows.
>You walk, greet the receptionist, who was some kind of deer, and tell her your there for a job application.
"What job in particular?"
"Uh, all it said was 'Chair.'"
She gets an odd smirk on her, "Ah, the HR head told me that she's jumping right to the interview. She's in office 236 on the right."
"Thank you."
>Jesus, they're either extremely desperate or going to rob you blind.
>You stand outside the office and check the time, it's 2:29 pm.
>Entering the HR head's office, you see a tigress filling out papers, she tells you to enter but doesn't say a word to you for a few minutes.
"So, why are you here today?"
"I was looking for a job and saw the 'chair' position, but the description was unclear so I wanted some more information."
"Oh? Didn't you check the website?" she inquires with a coy tone.
"I did, but I couldn't find it."
"What a shame. Would you like a hands-on demonstration?"
"What do you mean by that?" you ask tensely.
"You'll have a ten minute trial experience, just so you can get a good grasp."
>Nervous but curious, you agree to the demonstration.
She gets out of her chair and sets a 10 minute timer in front of you, "Just as a show of good faith."
>She pushes her chair off to the side and extends something from the desk.
>She walks over to where you're sitting anxiously and pulls you out of the chair and walks you behind her desk with her hand on your shoulder.
>With a sudden move she sweeps her legs out from under you and places you onto the desk extension.
>It feels like a bed, a thin bed but a bed nevertheless.
The 'pillow' extends vertically on the sides of your head with a hole in them so your ears aren't blocked.
>She sits down and forces your head back into the 'pillow' groove before you can get up or even protest.
>You know that the job description said 'Chair' but you expected to be an Ikea chair assembler or something.
>Not being the chair.
>You attempt to push her off, but she's just too heavy, the only thing she does is release a content growl and wiggle her ass side to side.
>It has the side effect of her getting right where your lips would be touching hers if there wasn't a cloth barrier in the way.
"Ah, those side cushions are nice. Makes it so I don't have to worry about crushing you."
>You attempt to reply but are too muffled under her to make anything intelligible.
"Don't do that!" she states irritably, "...Yet at least. You'd be doing it a lot once you accept the position."
>Your attempts at getting her off your face all end in failure and her huffing contentedly.
>You lay there for a minute, your will to fight being sapped by your sheer inability to push her off.
>She did state that she'd get off you in ten minutes, what time did she start it?
>When last you checked it was 2:31? That means she'll get off you around 2:41 then, hopefully.
>You lay there for a few minutes and begin breathing normally.
>This wasn't what you thought it was going to be, but really what were you expecting for it to have such high pay?
>You untense, there's nothing you can do right now but wait.
>Perhaps this isn't so bad.
>Frankly it could be worse.
>You could not have this whole 'bed' type thing, sitting on the ground with your head at this angle in a chair would be awful.
>Hell even those- what'd she call them- side cushions are nice to have.
>Eventually you hear an alarm ring and she climbs off of you.
>Checking to see if she kept her word, you pull out your phone and check the time.
>It's 2:46.
>5 minutes later than you thought, but you probably spent that talking with her.
>Surprisingly, it seems like she kept her word.
"Will you accept the position or will you need to think about it at home?" she asks and upon seeing your relaxed expression she continues with a grin, "Or will you require another ten minute demonstration?"
>You mull it over in your head for a minute or two, thinking about the pay and such.
>It takes you another minute to decide on the wording of your response.
>She doesn't seem to like how long you're taking and waits impatiently.
You open your mouth to reply, "Another demonstration would help me come to a more, informed decision."
>She sets the timer again, shows it to you, and then makes herself comfortable on your face once more.

>pay a gorgeous deathclaw for a night of company
>she's cheap, but beautiful, and cuddly to boot
>but there's a catch of course
>you rub your eyes, feeling the sun on your bare skin
>you can hear shuffling around
>as you glance around you see the lady of the night tying a tarp around all your stuff and slinging it over her shoulder
>she blows you a kiss before walking off into the wasteland
>you can barely walk after all the incredible things she did to you
>worth it.

>your rabbit friend seems kind of down lately
>trouble with boys you think
>next time you're hanging out, you give her a hug and tell her that you're there for her
>she bursts into tears and buries her head in your chest
>refuses to let go of you until she's soaked your shirt through with tears
>you're not sure how to react
>when she finally lets go she whispers 'I love you'

>this is the story of a girl named buncel
>buncel went to a public high school on a street corner marked 427
>her daily routine was simple,
>she diligently ensured passing C grades in class
>sat alone in a corner at lunch time
>and angrily grumbled at anyone who got too near as she walked home
>this is what buncel did every day, of every month of every year.
>and although many would consider this a self destructive lifestyle, buncel was sure she would luck into the ultimate prize.
>a human for a boyfriend
>and buncel was miserable.

>you will never be smothered under a quarter-ton of big cat
>your entire body will never vibrate as she purrs and gently scratches your head with those sharp, sharp claws

every time i read shelby for some reason it makes me think about a similar plot where anon is dtf but his assigned wife is worried she will lose control and hurt him, even though hes hot for it. he tries to seduce her and tries to make her lose control.
>what are you worried about honey?

>massive court case
>prosecutor thinks anon could be the star witness, gets pushy and tries to guilt trip him to take active involvement in the case

i imagine anthros still rely heavily on scent so if someone leaves their life for long periods of time it would be hard for them to be recognized followed by the anthro freaking out.
>"Hey, it's me! Back from when we were kids and played together!"
>suspicious anthro grabs the guy and shoves her snout into his pants and inhales deep
>then a moment of clarity from the anthro
>"Now I recognize you! It's been forever! Also noticed you're single too~"

>You are Daniel
"Attacking them head on is the stupidest thing we could do."
>and you are in the woods with a bunch of hick tweakers hiding from the Daxy.
>Charles glares at you for a moment before responding.
>"And do what else? Eat away at our food supplies and do nothing? While they pick us off? We should be getting revenge for New York!"
"How, exactly would we do that? We have no military support. The army never showed up here they just let the scales roll into town. We don't have artillery. We don't have air support. We have a handful of deer guns and shitty mall ninja ARs. If you want to run off and get killed or captured by them then you do you. I'm going to survive."
>"Fuckin' coward."
>Charles takes a drag from his cigarette and continues. "There is nothing for us out here. We got almost no food left and it's like every day that someone up and disappears to the fuckin' dinosaurs. I want to go out on my own terms, high as a kite and guns blazing. I've always wanted to kick in the doors of the courthouse with a gun anyways. That's where they're holed up."
>You look around the camp
>All men in various states of physical fitness, most of them not fit for service else they would have been drafted into the continental army.
>All of the women had been carted off by the Daxy as soon as the scales arrived in town almost completely uncontested.
>Some of the men tried to hastily form a militia but it was a worthless endeavor.
>out numbered at least three to one with inferior technology, weapons, communications, and training.
>Running out into the forest was the smartest option, despite it being the middle of winter.
>You sigh and decide to change the subject with Charles.
"James is on patrol now right? Who is he with?"
>"Fuck if I know. I think he left with the kid." Charles is just being petty now.
>You grab a radio and try to hail James and wait for a response. After two more tries with only a crackle of static as a response Charles chimes in bitterly. "Maybe they got him too. We should attack now before numbers dwindle anymore."
>You decide not to respond. There are more pressing matters to attend to anyways.
"I'm gonna go do what a bear does in the woods."
>Charles looks at you like you're an idiot.
>It sounded cooler in you head.
>You grab a roll of toilet paper and head out of the camp.
>On your way out you see Charles packing a glass pipe with what looks like, but is certainly not small crystals of ice.
>You would be more confident in you chances of survival if these guys were not all constantly drinking or getting high.
>you've been out here over a week, how do they still have a supply?
>Snow crunches underfoot but otherwise the woods are quiet. You find a spot behind a tree and do your business.
>As you are cleaning up you hear several muted pops from the direction of the camp.
>Did someone start shooting?
>You run back but as you approach the camp a billow of smoke wafts towards you.
>It smells faintly of bitter citrus. You don't know what it is and you don't want to be breathing it in but you need to get to camp.
>You turn and run perpendicular to the cloud's direction but something is wrong. You feel sluggish and the cold that was nipping your face before is notably absent.
>As you keep moving past the cloud it begins to dissipate so you turn again to head closer to the camp.
>By this point you feel sleepy and disjointed.
>You have to slow down so as to not trip on the uneven soil.
>You push drunkenly through the undergrowth and trip while trying to push between some bushes.
>You can see the camp from your place on the ground covered by the foliage.
>several canisters are embedded in the earth with small wisps of gas still escaping them
>everyone is laid out on the ground. Some are unresponsive, some are groaning like they're in the middle of receiving an expert massage. One guy was unlucky enough to be near the impact point of a gas canister. He is curled up holding tightly to his calf as blood seeps between his fingers but his sedation is overpowering the pain.
>Whatever that gas was, they took a full dose. You're the only one that can still move
>You still have enough of your faculties about you to call James and tell him not to return but as your fumble for the radio you see across the camp a squad of a half dozen daxy emerge from the treeline.
>They are all armored in navy blue kit aside from the one leading them who wears all black with thick gold accenting.
>She has James in tow with a claw around his neck and behind them another daxy has a teenager in tow.
>She is too far away to be heard but she leans down to coo something sweet to him.
>Bizarrely he seems to try to rub up against her like a cat looking for attention.
>The kid just looks scared. His attention split between James' unusual behavior and the camp full of laid out men.
>You do your best to stay quiet and sink into the bush. You didn't carry your rifle with you into the woods but its not like it would have helped at all against a half dozen daxy.
>The daxy stream in to the camp and start searching tents until one finds the man clutching his leg.
>"Male harmed! Salis get over here, bring the kit!"
>Two of the daxy rush over and begin caring for him. One tears off the leg of his pants with her daunting claws while the other begins preparing antiseptic swabs and gauze for clotting the wound.
>One of them starts saying soothing things to him about his safety and happiness but your attention is cut short by the swift sound of a zipper being tugged
>Charles steps out of a yet unchecked tent wearing a gas mask and levels a shotgun at the nearest daxy who happens to be the gold fringed apparent leader.
>She sees him and throws James away from the immediate danger just as Charles catches her in the leg with a slug.
>He's jittery as he tries to rack the shotgun for a second shot and manages to catch the spent shell in the ejection port.
>At the same time the wounded daxy draws a pistol from her side and puts a round in Charles' gut.
>He falls on his back and you see a large syringe with a plume for a tail sticking out of his belly.
>He went out the way he wanted to.
>It amounted to even less than you expected from his plans.
>He tries to lift the gun again but he treats it like it's a hundred pounds heavier. Before he can do anything else the wounded leader and another daxy are upon him, pulling the gun away and holding him down against his insignificant drug suppressed fight for a moment until he loses consciousness.
>Whatever was in that syringe was strong stuff to cut through the meth he was smoking when you left.
>At least they didn't kill him.
>The leader daxy stands up and holds he thigh with a groan.
>James crawls over to the daxy that had just thrown him away a moment ago. "Tassis are you alright? You're bleeding! He hurt you!"
>He tries to grab on to her but she leans down to him with a grimace and holds him at arm's length by his shoulders. "I've had worse, don't you worry about me."
>Its creepy how sweet she is to him.
>She motions to another daxy to take care of him. The daxy pulls him away despite his protests.
>Its even creepier that he's like a blithering pet to her.
>Tassis stands with another grunt and checks over her leg. "Salis I know males are important but you better leave enough supplies in that kit for me."
>Salis finishes tying off a bandage and stands up with the pack. "One of the plates from the pheromone mortar broke off from the impact and embedded in his leg. It's not life threatening and he'll be up and walking in time for our mating ceremony."
>Tassis raises an eyebrow at her. "'Our'? You already laying claim to him?"
>"I touched him first. Doesn't that mean he's mine by right?"
>The medic removes Tassis' thigh armor and inspects the wound. "No penetration from the slug. It looks like your armor shattered and some of it's in your leg. We'll need to get back to base to get it all out of you."
>Tassis hisses through her teeth as Salis injects something into the wound area and begins applying a bandage. "At least wait for the commander to sign off on your mate before you start talking like that. We're calling a transport ship in, I really don't want to walk all the way back to base like this and we shouldn't stress the males anymore."
>A daxy who is bridal carrying a man who is more than willing to cuddle her pipes up from across the camp. "So I got time to take my new mate for a spin?"
>Tassis deadpans. "You really want to take your armor off in this weather?"
>The daxy falters. She looks at the man trying to bury his head in the crook of her neck then at a tent for a moment. "Shit, yer right."
>"You should be looting the camp for more than just a mate anyway." Tassis presses a button on her helmet and calls in for transport as the daxy continue to clean out the camp of any supplies they deem valuable.
>Charles begins to stir from his unconscious state.

>While documenting leopard seals in Antarctica for a 2006 National Geographic magazine story, photographer Paul Nicklen had an experience that he says "will stay with me forever"
>"Leopard seals are the most incredible animals I've ever had the pleasure of photographing," he said. "When you get in the water with a wild animal, you're essentially giving yourself to that animal because, as humans, we're quite helpless and vulnerable in the water. You're at the seal's mercy. You're at the predator's mercy.
>"Not only did the leopard seals not attack as some predicted they would, they fed me penguins, followed me around, and generally put on a nonstop show."
>In the video above, Nicklen explained how an encounter with one particular female leopard seal was especially poignant. The animal had a head larger than a grizzly bear's, and it took his camera and his head into its mouth. But instead of harming him, the seal began to "nurture" him. It began to bring him penguins, first alive, then dead, perhaps assuming that he was a "useless predator in her ocean."
>The top predator apparently tried to feed the weaker Nicklen for four days as he scuba dived in the area, working on the assignment.

I’m glad this new show called Deltarune didn’t make the human boy as the main love interests and plot between these two anthro girls! It’s nice to see a human male being treated as a character and not be used as a female gaze for fan service and be more than just some boy. Glad they didn’t try giving him a shirt that expose their shoulders. That’s the most sexualized design on a human male. Best of all, they remain friends and refuse to do the typical “Anthro girls competing for humie boi’s heart” trope that plagues the entire mainstream entertainment!

Actually, speaking of horror movies there'd be even more genres to play into different species. Prey species horror movies would usually have pred anthros has the villains/monsters. Pred species horror movies might have an even bigger predator as the villain or having it focus more on the humie boys being danger.

Was just struck with such a beautiful epiphany because of this post:
>Greenland Shark banshee, over a thousand years old
>a prolific and almost quasi-mythical serial killer and harvester of men, she has stalked the coast inland of Western Iceland since the days of the island's first major settlement, and by the whispers of century-old tales told by the Norse who landed previously, much longer
>completely blind, her eyes have long since whitened over with an almost imperceptible sky-blue iris, parasites are embedded in and flagellating about on the eyeballs in various spots, starved for water, some already hanging limp, like distended lashes that flick and whip as she turns them
>normally rigid in the water, she drifts several meters below off-shore beneath the tide in a torpor state
>can "taste" the blood of living things from over a kilometer way, and as such, her infamy and such stories have found that any man who recklessly wanders the coasts at night seldom return
>her hunt is unerring and supernatural, the shark's body first finds itself "drawn" towards the man's closest point at the shore, where she is beached for a moment before hunching forward, standing and shadowing the victim(s) with a vague gait that embellishes her head and torso, as they lock forward in such a way that she would be severely straining any abdominal organs, as though one were really and truly puking up their guts
>is known to bury herself within the beaches, a practice which is said to have inspired the Greenlandic tradition of curing regular greenland shark meat before letting it hang out to ferment, sickening, half-rotten digits vibrating unnaturally through the sand to grab at one's vulnerable point, eliciting as little activity as possible
>due to her reliance on conserving as much energy as possible, most of her tactics revolve around hiding in plain sight, the only for sure tell being that unmistakable scent any true Icelander would know, the acrid stench of hákarl

>anthro who asks her humie bf if he would like to try something "kinky" in bed
>the human agrees
>she starts off with rather light stuff. some scratches and maybe light biting
>all is going well but then she accidentally gives him a severe injury. maybe she accidentally bit his neck too hard or something like that.
>she's angry at herself as she feels like she betrayed her bf's trust.
>tries to make it up to him the next day

anthros who want to give you a claiming bite but wait for your consent first.

That reminds me of something.
Let me tell you all about the disappointment of Frozen Homes.

>Probably shouldn't have taken that doll
>Finally mustered the courage to explore that run down building you'd stared at for years
>Once you were inside, it practically called to you
>Now it just stares at you, no matter where you put it or what angle you turn it
>You never see it move but its always looking at you

>Amateur paranormal hunter
>Haven't managed to find anything paranormal yet but I know they are stalking the night.
>Investigate abandoned Japanese-themed restaurant due to reports of spooky noises coming from inside at night.
>Restaurant is mostly empty besides the group cat doll thing that just seems to stare at you.
>You take it home it eventually reveals it is alive and has imprinted on you.
>After draining your balls it vows to be your wife and desires to help you in your crusade against the paranormal.

>Even since you took that doll home, you've been having nightmares.
>Dreams of blood and gore.
>Falling to death.
>Drowning, the fluid you drown in changes sometimes, there was once where it was beer.
>Another was honey.
>There was also that odd non-water water.
>You thought about tossing it out.
>And you did.
>But after a single night of dreamless sleep, you awoke to find it in your living room.
>That night you had the longest and worse nightmares of your life
>You attempted to destroy it with a hammer and you shattered it to pieces and were rewarded with a pleasant night of rest.
>The next day it was back again and whole.
>It seemed to give off a smug, or perhaps amused, feeling, despite its expression not changing.
>Yet again, you had a nightmare.
>This time of you being vivisected and your bones being methodically broken with a hammer.
>You try everything you can think of but the result is still the same.
>It comes back smugly and takes revenge on your attacks.
>Even putting it back from where you took it didn't work.
>At wits end, you give up trying to destroy it.
>Nothing you've attempted has worked.
>As all modern men do when they want to drown out their sorrows, you surf the internet.
>Going to shady sites, you see an advertisement for sex dolls and body pillows.
>Both of which give you ideas in your post-nut clarity.
>You go into the living room and think aloud.
"The nightmares get worse whenever I try to get rid of it..."
>You feel the amusement and smugness oozing off the doll.
"...Maybe if I bring it closer the nightmares will lessen."
>The smugness abates for curiosity.
>You walk over and scoop up the doll, you can feel it try and resist you moving it, but it cannot stop you.
>You carry it over to your bedroom and place on your bed.
>You get under the covers as the doll remains above them.
>The nightmare bit of your sleep seems to have been delayed, but it was outlandishly realistic and brutal.
>You move seems to have caught the doll off-guard, you'll have to go with a more intense strategy.
>The next night, instead of having it on top of the cover, you have it under the cover and spoon with it.
>That really catches it off guard if your nightmares are anything to go by.
>They had the late start of the previous night, but seemed... less real.
>It's actually kind of nice.
>It feels more like a first-person movie than a torture session.
>Waking up you do your subconscious stretching and roll your hips forward.
>Then promptly realize that you were hotdogging her with your morning wood.
>She seems a bit flustered, she's likely never received any treatment like this before being a cursed doll and all.
>...Wait, 'her'? 'She'?
>...Eh, given what you were doing you think she's probably earned being called a she instead of an it.
>You continue spooning her nightly for the next few days and the nightmares keep lessening in intensity and frequency until you have a night where you aren't getting them anymore.
>Perhaps it's linked to your grinding against her as you sleep.
>You've woken up a couple of times because you felt your orgasm building in your sleep because of your passive rubbing.
>About a week or two later, you'd had an odd dream.
>It was the first wet dream you'd had since you were... a teenage.
>Given the dream stuff the doll has done, you chalked it up to it being her doing.
>Still you took it as a sign and started dressing her down before bed.
>Also dressing her when you woke up, because why the hell not? You can't dress her down if she's not clothed.
>You joined her in nudity as well, just for that extra bit of sensation.
>Also to not get cum on your clothes and have it dry, that's a bit of a pain to get out.
>Naturally, you begin having wet dreams nearly every night, sometimes multiple times if you woke up.
>The general theme is that you're tied or otherwise locked down as something rides you.
>Some of them look pretty horrifying, or at least they might've been if she hadn't given you weeks of nightmares to desensitize you.
>She seems unable to resist adding in pain, in the lewd dreams she sometimes makes you experience the sensation of your hip getting broken repeatedly.
>Again, you have to thank her for the torture as it gave you the ability to bypass that dream pain.
>One night as you're getting the both of you ready for bed, you notice that she's had changes made to her previously featureless bumps.
>A set of nipples and a pussy.
>If she's going to provide such a tempting offer, do you have any option to not take her up on it?
>Naturally, you probe her pussy with your fingers, both to act as foreplay and to check for traps or anything.
>You don't feel any spikes and she's not getting any wetter so you line yourself up.
>You take it slow for a bit, more for your own benefit as you want to enjoy this.
>It feels much like you'd expect, except a little warmer and slightly lubed.
>When you do cum, you catch a glimmer in her eyes but it's gone before you can place it.
>You lay down on top of her and pass into the realm of dreams.
>The first thing you note upon entering the dream is the heavy weight on your hips.
>Looking up, you see the doll sitting atop you.
>Meeting your gaze, she shifts from a sitting position into more a looming one with her hands pinning your shoulders.
>You give a couple of testing struggles and find her grip to yield as much as concrete.
>Her face looks down upon you with possessiveness and a set of predatory eyes.
>She stares you down for at least a minute or two, rolling her hips as to prevent you from forgetting what your position is.
>She eventually starts pummeling you into the ground and you feel the illusionary feel of your pelvis cracking under her.
>You've had enough experience with that trick that it doesn't phase you anymore.
>What does catch you off guard is her not stopping after pulling an orgasm out of you.
>She simply continues on, well aware of your overstimulation.
>And she does it again.
>And again.
>And yet again.
>It isn't until your tenth that she finally stops and leans down to whisper her first words to you:
"Mine."
>You awake.
>This time with the seed of nearly a dozen rounds seeping out of the doll.
>You start cleaning her and the bed up, much to her amusement.
>Well, this is certainly better than the nightmares she gave you before.
>You can live with this as part of your routine from now on.

>I’ll never be bought off the black market by a rich queen bee to be her private sex slave
>She’ll never make me her 24/7 dickthrone as a power play, so any other queens visiting for negotiations have to see her tits bounce as she rides.
>She’ll never let the royal guard gangrape me on days she has to be at a different hive

Imagine getting seduced by a colony/hive forming anthro and before you know it your surrounded by a countries worth of daughters and they wont let you leave.

A colony built a hive around you while you slept after having sex with the queen?

don't worry she will take good care of you
you'll of course be living with her and sleeping right next to her since she only has 1 bedroom

Food and lodging cost extra. You can take on extra duties to cover the cost.

>Insists on rubbing her entire body over your face and neck before you go outside to make sure none of those giant hussies try to claim her man, despite this her scent is still barely noticeable and you have to turn away anthros that think you're unclaimed, often having to resort to showing them her little red "claiming bites" she leaves on your neck to prove that you're with someone

Do you think Canines and felines wouldn't like each other?

Absolutely
>Canines see felines as pretentious, lazy, entitled, selfish, whorish, sneaky, and extravagant
>Felines see canines as annoying, loud, clingy, dirty, unsophisticated, brutish, stupid, and ugly

Nah just become a monster tamer/Bard find monsters willing to fight for you.

On that note, I like the idea of (you) being a summoner and accidentally summoning an anthro who wants to fuck you.
>Be anon, human studying to be a mage
>Final exam comes where you're required to summon a monster to serve you.
>You need to pass this exam to actually graduate so it is do or die.
>Everyone keeps summoning fantastic beasts that listen to their every command.
>Your turn eventually comes and you can feel all the eyes on you.
>You begin the ritual and the largest, nasty shewolf you've ever seen pops out of the summoning circle.
>You try to command her but she won't respond to any of them.
>Things like, "I'm your master beast".
>The wolf gives you a smug smile and tells you, "This is a contract that we'll have to negotiate. I refuse to do your bidding without proper compensation"
"Compensation?"
>She walks over to you and takes a huge sniff on top of your head.
>The shewolf continues, "Your virginity, offer it to me and I will do a task for you."
>It was stated loudly enough everyone is laughing.
>You're going to have to accept if you want to pass the class

> Only been a few years since humanity discovered basic FTL travel and has begun exploring surrounding star systems
> You are among the survey team that very unexpectedly makes first contact with the Fenrisians
> Despite none of you being trained for this, it goes amazingly well, the all-female crew of Fenrisians is a bit reserved, but tremendously welcoming all the same
> They treat you a lot like precocious children
> Given their comparative tech level and physiques, it's not entirely unwarranted
> As the awkwardness begins to fade, they start smiling a lot more, patting humans on the head, that sort of thing
> Maybe not entirely respectful, but clearly affectionate
> Several months pass and formal diplomatic relations are opened
> As part of the initial First Contact team you are included, more as a formality than anything else
> Eventually you are invited to a tour of their home planet, which you accept
> En route aboard their ship, the crew get increasingly familiar, almost cooing at you quite often
> Evidently humans are absolutely adorable to them
> They really seem to enjoy picking you up or otherwise showing off their strength
> Sometimes seem a little.... flushed when they do it
> You're just projecting
> .... You are.... right?
> Fenris is far enough away that it takes a couple of weeks to reach even with their FTL drives
> One of your assigned guards comes to you one day and informs you with a very sour look on her face that due to a logistical screwup they will have to make a brief stop at a neutral refueling station along the way
> You assure her you don't mind, and even beg her for permission to disembark and look around during the stop
> Officially humanity hasn't been introduced to any other races yet, but you're feeling adventurous
> Your guard looks like she's just eaten a raw lemon
> But despite how they treat you like a kid, they've yet to actually refuse any of your requests
> You go aboard the station under the close watch of four Fenrisian bodyguards
> It's an uneventful as your first stop at an alien gas station can be, for the most part
> You do get a lot of odd looks but that's not exactly unexpected
> The Fenrisians seem pretty uncomfortable with you being exposed like this, but since they're bodyguards and you're technically a diplomat that's not exactly unexpected either
> You're almost back to the ship when it goes wrong
> Apparently the one angle your guards didn't think to watch, was straight up
> You jump in startled fright as the bat-like anthro lands only inches away from you, but don't make it too far before she grabs you tightly and pulls you against herself
> All four Fenrisians immediately fall into clear attack stances, but hesitate with you directly in the way
> You know enough of their language at this point to understand the murderously growled command to let you go on the authority of the Fenrisian Empire
> The bat gives off an amused laugh and responds in a language you don't understand, but sounding unimpressed
> The leader of your detail steps forward and says something you have a harder time parsing, something about diplomat status and...
> Uh... you're not sure, actually
> You think you made out the root-sounds for the words.... 'guard' and 'race?' And...
> ... 'Love?'
> At that the bat's grin slackens
> A couple of uneasy seconds of silence later, she lets you go and you are RUSHED by two of your guards, one of whom physically picks you up and starts carrying you off back to the ship
> Just barely, as you lose sight of the bat and your remaining two guards around a corner, you hear something you manage to understand a bit more clearly
> The translation is a bit crude, but in English you suppose it'd be something like 'spread the word'
> Just as soon as you've parsed that, you hear the *SLAM* sound of something hitting the wall very hard
> You feel a hand gently turn your chin away from where you'd been craning to hear the voices behind you
> The guard carrying you smiles down gently, and tells you not to worry about any of that
> You're in very good hands

>Anthrostate assigns you a bear commissar as a wife named Alina
>Get a fancy dress uniform lined with medals for who knows what, officers cap, polished leather shoes, etc. all for free in the assignment center
>Turns out your job is to follow Alina around as she does inspections of local communities making sure that silly humans don't try to run from their furry guardians, that anthrostate propaganda is proudly displayed in all public areas, and keeping unwanted foreign influences from polluting the minds of anthrostate citizens
>You take your job very seriously helping to convince your fellow humans of the inherent superiority of the anthrostate and giving loud impassioned speeches about the benevolency of our furred superiors, often citing experiences with your wife as examples
>She doesn't smile much, but when you give your speeches she's always in the back of the crowd where she thinks you can't see her, a poorly suppressed smile on her maw
>During a routine inspection of a home you find traces of illegal food products smuggled over from the neighboring republic of trashnistria prompting a much larger investigation leading to several arrests of foreign spies
>This act earns you and your favorite she-bear a few new medals, not to mention a spot in a newly built government housing unit!
>Life is good for the next several weeks, more arrests, more speeches, more commendations from your superiors
>After another day hard at work hanging up some new banners at a local market you stop to buy some groceries while she goes back to headquarters to fill out some paperwork
>A paper bag full of food in each hand you make your way back the apartment, get your keys out, open the door and-
>Your consciousness returns painfully
>There's a throbbing pain on your forehead, must have been where someone knocked you out
>You try to stand up only to realize your ankles are tied to the chair you're sitting in and your wrists are tied tightly behind your back
>Your gaze rises and Alina is standing in front of you in her full dress uniform, you seem to be in one of the interrogation rooms deep in the bowels of the state police headquarters
>Beside her are three other commissars, you recognize two of them as a paired human/anthro couple just like you and your wife except the anthro in this case was a lanky arctic fox
>They're lower ranking than you and Alina, not having as made nearly as many arrests or investigations
>The third commissar is your superior officer, a grizzled older wolfess with piercing blue eyes and smoldering cigarette hanging from her mouth
>You look back to Alina
>Her expression is stoic but you detect just the faintest hints of panic behind her eyes
>You try to speak only to find a piece of cloth has been tied around your mouth, muffled half words are the best you can manage
>Noticing you're awake the wolfess hands a paper to your wife
>"Read it to him." She coldly commands
>She takes the paper and begins reading
>"Attention, attention, Commissar Anon Anonov has been accused of the following crimes: illegal storage of prohibited items, conspiracy to commit espionage against state assets, conspiracy to assassinate state representatives, illegal consumption of prohibited literature, and...high treason against the state."
>Her hands begin gripping the paper so tightly her claws puncture it
>"After a period of lawful deliberation the justice department of the state has found Anon Anonov guilty of all crimes. Due to his association with the commissariat punishment shall be determined by his superior officer."
>She looks up to you with shocked expression and the paper drops from her paws
>Your CO shakes her head and spits out her cigarette, grinding it against the cold concrete floor
>"Anonov I had so much faith in you, you were doing so well, then I order a random inspection of your new domicile and I can't believe what they found. Documents linking you to foreign spy networks, illegal weapons, pamphlets encouraging human male and human female pairings, and all these items covered in your fingerprints! It's utterly unthinkable one of my own would do this."
>She turns to Alina
>"Luckily for you everything they found could only be linked to Anon, otherwise you would be in the same position he is. You're a nice girl, never given me or the state any trouble, and for your loyal service I'm willing to classify all of this for your sake. You shouldn’t expect any more promotions in this lifetime but you’ll always have a roof over your head. However, I do have one little favor to ask. Just to make sure you really are on the right side."
>The wolfess takes her pistol out of its holster and turns it around so Alina can take it
>"The Justice department left his punishment up to me and I say this traitor gets the death penalty. One shot to the head to be administered by you. Keep it clean."
>Alina just stares at the pistol for a few moments before hesitantly taking it, pointing it down by her side
>”But Senior Commissar how can we be sure the items the other two found are legitimate? I’ve known Anonov for quite some time and I have no reason to suspect-“
>The white furred vixen cuts her off
>”Do not argue with the senior commissar bear! The evidence me and my husband found is irrefutable!”
>The man beside lovingly rubs the top of her head causing her eyes to go half lidded
>”That’s right honey, irrefutable.”
>Alina stares at the wolfess for guidance
>”What the other two say is right, I inspected everything they found myself.”
>In a split second everything makes sense to you
>The two junior commissars, they planted the evidence against you to try and gain promotions by fucking over their comrades instead doing things the right way like you and Alina
>They probably planned on implicating both of you but since you arrived at the house alone they couldn’t put her fingerprints on anything
>Not that it mattered, your life and Alinas career are over at this point
>You struggle against your bindings with all the strength you can muster while shouting muffled pleas to Alina and the wolfess, desperately trying to get them to do anything other than continue with this insidious plot
>They all watch you struggle, the fox and her husband with smug grins and Alina with a despondent expression
>The wolfess just glares at you silently
>Eventually she’s had enough hesitation from Alina
>”Commissar Alina! Fulfill your duty to the anthrostate and terminate this traitor. Prove your loyalty.”
>”Ya! Do it already she-bear! We’re getting tired of waiting.” The fox’s husband shouts
>”Y-yes senior commissar.” Alina says, her voice on the verge of cracking
>You watch Alina raise the pistol through your tear soaked eyes
>Your muffled cries have devolved into muffled whimpers and with one last impotent struggle against your restraints you give up and remain still
>All you can do is look into Alinas eyes and softly shake your head side to side as she points the muzzle right at your forehead
>The fox and her husband say something but it fades into the background as you choose your last words
>You know she won’t be able to understand you through the gag but you decide to say them anyway
>”Alina, it’s not your fault. I still love you. We’ll meet again in the next life. I know it.”
>Her finger curls around the trigger
>Her grip tightens
>Then she suddenly brings the pistol up to her face
>”Oh, I forgot to take the safety off.”
>”Stupid bear, stop procrastinating and kill him before I have to.” The fox spits
>She flicks a switch on the pistol
>”Okay, safety is off.” She turns to the fox and points the pistol at her. “Why don’t you check it for me?”
>The vixen can only give her a confused look before Alina pulls the trigger twice, shooting her square in the chest
>The fox’s husband tries to get his own pistol out but is shot down before he can even open his holster
>Your superior grabs at her own holster only to realize the bear already has her sidearm
>Instead of shooting her like the others Alina closes the distance between them and gives her a knockout punch right to the head
>She crumples to the ground, blood dribbling out of her nose
>Alina walks in front of you and cuts your gag off with a claw
>She puts two paws on either side of your head and stares into your soul
>”Is what they said true? That you’re a traitor?”
>”No Alina! It’s all bullshit! Those bastards planted the evidence after I came back home.”
>She continues staring at you for several tense seconds before giving you a mighty bear hug and cutting your restraints
>She helps you to your feet
>”So what now? The courts still think I’m a traitor and you just murdered two commissars. We’re totally fucked.”
>”Baby steps Anon. First we need to get out of this building. We’ll make our way to the garage then acquire one of the police cruisers. With a full tank of gas we should be able to make it to the border.”
>You shake your head in disbelief
>”The border? And then what? Even if we make it past the last checkpoint no country is going to take in a couple of murderous former commissars from the anthrostate. And there’s no way we’ll blend into the populace for very long.”
>Alina begins methodically looting the bodies on the floor for their pistols, wallets, and spare ammunition
>”We’ll drive to the uninhabited zone then.” She states confidently
>”Nobody lives there Alina. It’s all just wilderness, we’ll die of starvation or get eaten by wild animals.”
>”Better than getting sent to the gulag mining rocks for the rest of our lives.”
>Well, she has a point
>”Okay fine, we’ll steal a cruiser then make a run for the uninhabited zone. But how the hell are we getting to the garage?”
>”I’m doing a prisoner transport on the orders of the senior commissar and you’re the prisoner. If anyone asks I’ll just show them the paper with your conviction.”
>You snatch the paper off the ground and present it to her
>”Good idea, but what’s the plan if they don’t believe you?”
>She retrieves the paper and hands you a couple of pistols
>”We’ll each have two pistols with plenty of ammunition. Enough to put up a decent fight as we dash to the garage.”
>She strips a bullet from a spare magazine and hands it to you
>”But keep one for yourself, just in case we don’t”
>You stare at the shiny piece of metal in your hand before closing it in your fist
>”Alina, either I’m making it to the garage with you or not at all.”
>She places a paw gently on your shoulder
>”Same my dearest Anon, same.”
>After both of you gather your nerves and fix your uniforms you stand by the door leading out of the interrogation room, and open it

Just gonna get this out of my system.
>You were absolutely against the current situation.
>Tall, lanky, with milk-white scales and blood-red eyes, the snake woman peered down at you from the doorway.
>Her eyes looked past you to your one-bedroom apartment while you read the letter she passed you for the umpteenth time in five minutes
>"Anon. I'm sending over a co-worker to stay with you for a couple of days. She's been relocated to your city, but her apartment has an infestation and is being fumigated. Letting her borrow your couch is cheaper than a hotel, so please show some kindness. ---Dad"
>"P.S. I know how you feel about anthros, but try to man up for a couple of days."
>You really hated when he did shit like this...
>"Sso, as you can see, your father has given the okay. I promise I won't be a bother."
>You want to close the door and wash your hands of this, but you already know you'll be getting an earful from the old man if you did
>Also, you guess, it'd be kind of a dick move
>Crumpling the note and tossing it in the bin, you step aside and let the beanpole into your home
>"You won't regret this." she says as she ducks under the doorframe, a set of bags rolling behind her
>The rest of the afternoon was fairly uneventful. You gave your sudden roommate the tour of the place, let her know about your early wakeup times, and told her about what foods not to touch in the fridge
>To her credit, she seemed to absorb everything, nodding along with your explanations and respecting the boundaries you set up
>When all was said and done, you settled back down and resumed your zombified movie watching
>At some point you heard the shower start, and felt satisfied that she was doing her own thing
>Nearly an hour later she...was still in the shower
>You would be concerned, but you can hear her off-key singing from here
>Fuck it, you need sleep and no amount of weird snake lady singing is going to stop you
>You give one last look towards the bathroom door, then retire
>That night, your dreams took on a strange tone
>You were being dragged off to some pyramid by guards and mummified
>All the while some cat they worshiped danced in the background to the music a camel was playing past the smoke of his cigarette
>You were going to die
>You were so cold...
>You woke up, but a scaly hand covered your mouth and scream
>"Sssh." hissed a voice in your ear, making your skin prickle
>Something tightened around your legs
>"Just let me sleep here. Where it's warm."
>Who the hell...oh
>Oh god it's the snake!
>Your eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a white form could be seen moving around your
>And sure enough, the ruby orb of her eye watched you from the side as something wrapped around your legs
>You would guess it's HER legs but that amount of flexibility wasn't normal, right?
>Every breath brought her body closer to yours, pressed her form closer to yours and stopped your struggling a little bit more
>You wanted to shout, to tell her to fuck off, but that hand stayed tight
>She was WAY stronger than her wiry frame had implied
>"Just relax. I won't bite." she paused, and added, "Not unless you want me to."
>Maybe it was the tone of her voice, maybe it was the way she pressed against you. Maybe it was even the adrenaline going to the entirely WRONG part of your body
>But the one part of you that wasn't being constricted sprung free from your boxers in defiance
>You would hope that she didn't notice during her molestation, but her chuckles let you know otherwise
>A cold finger grazed against you, stealing away the heat but doing nothing to remove its rigidity
>More followed, coiling around you there as well
>You felt your face flush, only for that heat to be wicked away by her other hand as she turned your face to hers
>"Your father warned me that you were...opposed, to nonhumans. That you'd slam the door in my face."
>Her neck coiled around behind yours, head resting on your other shoulder
>"Perhaps he was wrong."
>You looked down to your traitorous erection
>She did as well, touching as your arousal leaked out
>Slow and nimble fingers spread it around, gliding further and further down as they slicked the scales and skin
>Your breath came out in a shudder, and you felt her laugh vibrate through you
>"Should I keep going?"
>NO! She should absolutely not! She should let you go and go back to the couch before she gets kicked out and has to return to that gas chamber of an apartment
>Is what you wanted to say. Instead you nodded, much to your own surprise
>That devilish tongue flicked your ear, sending a shock through your head
>By then, you'd been completely lubed up from the fluids of your own making
>The hand gripped your head, just enough pressure to be felt without being painful
>The descent down was tortuously slow
>You couldn't control your breathing as she watched your reaction from her perch on your shoulder
>You had to bite your lip to keep from groaning from this attention
>All the while she whispered things into your ear
>Terrible things and vulgar praises
>Each second felt like hours as she claimed your manhood for herself
>At some point her fingers started to constrict, milking you in steady wave against
>By the time her palm made contact with your groin, your hips moved what little they could to meet it
>You were shamefully clo-
>"Let me stay for the month."
>What?
>"You can have more of this, if you do."
>Is she REALLY-
>Her fingers reached down to massage your testes
>This time you couldn't suppress it, groaning in defeat
>"You could feel so much better."
>The milking intensified
>"You could indulge in this...shameful act."
>...
>"It doesn't count if you're forced, right?"
>...you guess...
>"You have no way of controlling this, right?"
>Yeah. Yeah, you were completely overwhelmed..."
>"So you should let me stay. That I can't blackmail you."
>...guess you don't have a choice
>She chuckles again
>"Good boy. Forbidden fruit is so sweet, isn't it?"
>You aren't aware of what exactly happened past that point
>Only vague sensations surface in your memories
>You remember claws in your shoulders and legs around your waist, as you tried to push against something impossibly tight and heavy
>You recall sibilant whispers in your ears that promised all sorts of terribly wonderful and wonderfully terrible things
>You kind of remember the feelings of fangs in your neck, mind reeling with the idea of someone seeing your "mark" as you go about your day
>You can still feel the shape of a forked tongue against yours, while your moans were muffled by infinite white
>The visage of two red orbs bobbing above your crotch, and two white hands holding yours down is especially prominent
>But most of all, the thing that you couldn't forget if you tried, was the morning after
>You awoke alone, drenched in sweat, and half hanging out of your bed
>Your entire body ached, and your swear you could taste something weirdly familiar at the back of your throat
>As you stumbled into the living room, your roommate seemed to be snoring peacefully on the couch
>Your memory from last night came flooding back and were summarily pushed back down
>You needed coffee. Strong coffee.
>"Make me a cup too." hissed a voice from behind
>You didn't even hear her move, but the feeling of her head on your shoulder was too familiar
>"You look like hell." she observed, "had a rough night?"
>Of course. She-
>"I slept great, in case your were wondering. Your couch is surprisingly comfortable."
>Wait...
>"You seemed to be talking in your sleep, though."
>Hang on...
>"Whatever you were DREAMING about, it must have been intense."
>You pause mid-pour and make eye contact with your roommate
>"By the way...I might need to stay here a bit longer. Maybe a month, maybe more."
>A scaled hand rest on your other shoulder, thumb tracing over a particularly tender spot
>"You don't mind, right?"

So, the thread’s discussed before how mustelids might have a special medical card obligating guys to help them out during their heat. But what happens in an area with a significant mustelid population? I suspect it depends on whether mustelids’ heat cycles synch and how much variance there is. If your friends, coworkers, and random passers-by just periodically go into heat during the season, cool, everyone just takes their turn I guess. But if they do synch then I can only imagine how bugfuck crazy it would get for a human guy. Fights breaking out over who gets to ride your dick or your face. And you probably wouldn’t be able to escape from them on the net either - you just get bombarded with thirsty comments, simping, unexpected pussy/tit pics, the works. In the synch case you would probably want to stock up on as much water as possible. You’ll need it.

Im pretty sure there would be some sort of government program or a special hospital wing for mustelids during heat
Naturally humans who volunteer to help mustelids during heat are well compensated
humans who volunteer are also almost always marry the mustelid they assisted
humans are even forced to help them during the heat wave if they are single

That would be a fun idea for a green/story
Anon’s a single dude and he gets a letter telling him to do his duty in the heat ward/wing. Maybe on his way over he gets cat-called/harassed by some mustelids that are starting to go into heat but aren’t quite at the stage where they need to go into the hospital themselves.
You even have a ready-made name in “Heatwave”

>the worst part is he's making more doing that then he ever did stealing shit

Concept: Dominant anthro ladies who don't start that way. When you first meet them they're shy and reserved, and the more they're coaxed from their shell, the more they find themselves by literally taking control of you and your life. They just needed a warm, caring subby to ignite their passions and give them a prize to fixate on.

>due to an abusive single mother, Anon becomes a bully
>he ends up bullying a shy nerdy anthro.
>one day she starts to hit a growth spurt and then hits the gym
>she becomes increasingly defiant of Anon until she starts bullying him
>one day she goes to bully Anon alone outside, only to find him treating a burn mark on his shoulder
>she confronts him and forces a confession out of him
>his mother had gotten drunk last night and had put a cigarette out on his arm
>enraged, the anthro drags him to the principal’s office and makes him show the burn
>cps gets called and she makes Anon stay at her house for the next few days
>the investigation concludes and custody of Anon is given to his estranged father
>from then on she continues to bully Anon, but it takes on a much different form
>hugging him from behind, making him sit in her lap, running her paws through his hair in class.
>she has finally achieved her goal of breaking down her former bully.

Cps needs to move Anon to protect him from retaliation.
Anon gets pressured by the waifur to accept her offer for a temporary shelter home.

>Anon finds himself in the room of his former victim, then heckler, now...??
>it's still a girl's room, and a nerdy one at that.
>soft toys and shelves of manga in evidence, alongside some weeby posters and figurines
>her bed vaguely resembles an enormous, pillowy mass of cotton marshmallows
>but there's also a clear delineation between all that and the spartan floorspace dedicated to a variety of training mats, weights, and even a rowing machine (guess her parents must get her what she wants)
>full length mirror even has a few photos stuck to it, tracking her progress from the shorter, dumpy little girl to the powerful woman leering over him right now with a claw resting firmly, but reassuringly on his shoulder
>Anon expected the place to stink of flowers and perfurme too, that's what girls like right?
>instead everything just kind of smells like... her. It's a space where she lives and uses her body freely
>it permeates everything. It isn't what would jump to mind when he thinks of 'good' smells, but there's something nice about it all the same, something he can't quite pin down
>she hasn't said anything since they sat down on her bed
>she's just staring at thim through those big, dorky glasses of hers
>he stole those from her back in 6th grade, and only gave them back when he got busted for it
>she'd cried when she'd put them back on, the lenses getting all foggy
>The memory made him feel like shit now, especially with the way her stare was magnified by the same lenses.
>he fidgets and squirms beneath it
>"S-so uh..."
>he breaks the gaze and looks around in a panic for something distracting
>his bag, bingo
>he fishes out a textbook
>"Should we study or something?"
>she still doesn't say anything, she just raises an eyebrow, and looks at him like he's the biggest idiot there was
>Without taking her eyes off him, she bats the paperback booklet aside
>Anon watches it spin and bounce off the floor as he feels himself get pushed down into the soft blankets.

>Your mother introduces you to her friends neet daughter
>they want you to become a couple and eventually married so they can have grandchildren

Would humans be cheerleaders in a adhg universe?
i bet alot of anthros would love it if skimpily dressed humies cheered them on while they played sports

>She's your neighbor in the apartment next door
>Once in a while when coming home from work you see her hauling several fully-stuffed bags of trash from her unit
>She always makes some crude sexual remark to you as you pass by
>It's her half-assed way of trying to hit on you/compliment you
>You brush it off, head into your unit, and shut and lock the door
>She sighs to herself as she continues towards the trash chute, feeling sad that she still hasn't gotten you to pay her any attention

God I wish we could have the roles reversed.
>getting cat-called by anthros while walking at night.
>your wife, a foot taller than you, pulls you closer to her as you walk by a group of rough looking carnivores.
>waiting for wife while she's in the bathroom or something, a shortstack mouse saunters over and starts teasing, asking if you're really married.
"Yes. He's sure."
>A stern, familiar voice says from behind you, as you feel your wife's hand firmly grasp your shoulder.
"Fuckin 'carnies... Leme know when you get sick of being the chew-toy for some mutt."
>she scowls up at your wife for a moment before looking back down to wink at you.
>she turns and walks away, but there's no way her hips are swaying like that by accident.
>you turn around and look up at your wife, her haunches raised, staring a hole into the back of the mouses head.
>reaching up, you stroke the underside of her chin as you move your hand to her cheek.
>wife is instantly soothed, and the rest of your day is normal, aside from your wife being even more publicly affectionate towards you than usual.
>you think you notice her give a scanning glance around the food court after licking your face.
>get home, and barely get your shoes off before she's dragging you to the bedroom by the back of your shirt.
>satisfied smile as you allow yourself to be dragged off for an hour or so before making dinner.

>It was said that in days of antiquity, when unclaimed men were a rarity, it was said that women of nobility and pedigree would engage at the mouth of busy thoroughfares, epees in paw, to engage in a dignified, if bloody exchange of clamancy and finesse in jabs and slashes, which called upon the refinement of the Anthro spirit against the nature of their inherent bodily advantages, such as claws and fangs; a symbol of utmost class in ages gone.
>The bout would commence upon the willing acknowledgement of one another's names, and a removal of their tops and as such, grievous injuries as well as death were not an unusual sight for melees lasting over half an hour, where the victor, whether by technicality or surrender of the foe, would assume direct and immediate ownership of the rival's "skin", as men were sometimes known in these discourses.
>For an opponent who willing waived the challenge for their life, these furs would find themselves in a state of inexorable shame, and frequently demerited of titles, other property and even their own life.
>These fencing displays were but one of the many examples of how valued human males were not just as a mate, but a commodity in Anthro societies of the distant past.

>Be flying fox
>Work for the anti-Anthrostate equivalent of the CIA
>Literal spook
>Rabid human rights activist
>Help escapees from the Anthrostate adjust to normal life
>Secretly passive-aggressive and borderline misandrist

>Force Anon to listen to Radio Free Anthrostate on the way to the embassy
>We're helping cartels run drugs to finance another war in the developing world
>Paranoid by Black Sabbath plays in the background
>Drowned out slightly by the bales of cocaine rattling around in the back of the truck

>go to an anime/game con
>nerdy anthros in cosplay ranging from very accurate to cardboard cutouts being emboldened by the environment and their costumes trying to flirt/molest you
>or you actually went in cosplay yourself
>getting asked to have a picture by an anthro who looks ready to drop spaghetti
>see if you can tease some aggresion out of her and lean into her when she hover hands for the picture
>let her grope you some to give her something to remember or have the spark to go after the humie boy she likes
>hopefully you didn't accidentally get him raped from giving her the confidence boost
>oh well, time to tease more anthro girls until you find one horny enough to pounce

>anon builds a cabin in the woods
>US martials and FBI check up on him, cant have a humie out all alone in the woods where there is danger
>ruby ridge, i hate the antichrist, etc
>held down and forced to drink corn syrup
>the conspiracies are true! he is domesticated on the spot and has a shotgun marriage with one of the feds

>when you magic teacher/master is a beastkin
>when it's a female beastkin
>wears no clothes aside from some jewelry and and a mage hat
>could just as easily crush you in her paw as with her magic

>shielding yourself from her spells that will make you "go into heat"

>etc

> As alien invasions go, it could have been a lot worse, really
> Well.... maybe even 'invasion' is a bit too harsh
> On the surface the treaty between humanity and the Fenrisians is one of equality and mutual friendship
> Only once humanity had begun to get some sort of grasp of politics on the intergalactic scale, and just how powerful their newfound 'allies' were, did the truth become fully clear
> In your species' haste to establish friendly relations with the first intelligent species they found, they hadn't done their homework first
> The two of you are equal partners on the surface but very clearly the vassals of the Fenrisians in any real sense
> And yet... surprisingly, not much had radically changed
> A ton of Fenrisians had chosen to move to Earth, but the Embassy was fairly selective in who they allowed to come - you'd been told in confidence by a friend in the diplomatic service that it was treated by the Empire as a reward posting for those wolves who'd distinguished themselves somehow
> Your initial suspicions about how the Fenrisians saw your kind had been thoroughly confirmed as they proceeded to fuck as many humans as they could, but...
> Despite the overwhelming power disparity on the personal and political scales, they never used force when they went about it
> Apparently, seducing humans was treated as something of a sport by their kind
> Using force worked, but it was entirely too easy and 'poisoned the well,' so to speak
> Much, much more satisfying was to lure in humans by raw force of presence and charisma instead
> Apparently, a Fenrisian's ability to woo a human into bed was a great point of pride and source of bragging rights among those who had emigrated to Earth
> The intelligence services had spied in on quite a few gambles about just how quickly a wolf could talk any given human into bed
> And with just how powerful, alluring, exotic, and protective they were, not that many could actually resist
> And so as time went on, wolves became an increasingly common sight on Earth, as the Empire tightened its grip on its latest conquest
> Any incursions into human space were quickly and violently dealt with, the Fenrisians more than happy to fulfill their end of the bargain in exchange for the partnership they'd found
> Only a few years later, as the ties between Earth and Fenris continued to solidify, would you hear confirm what you had increasingly begun to privately suspect
> It turns out, the Fenrisian Empire held enough planets that it would often categorize them in terms of the resources they would provide
> Earth was no exception
> And it seemed your home had been placed in the Luxury Goods category
> Specifically, you were all classified as a 'pleasure world'

>magic school of some sort
>group of human boys that are inexperienced mages
>each one has a specialty in different magic abilities/schools
>get assigned missions/tests to deal with magical events/disturbances/anomalies/etc
>mostly dealing with magical creatures/monsters
>basically an excuse for them to get fucked hard by various anthros and monsters
>like common beasts using and harnessing magic for their own sexual gratification/breeding
>more extreme cases of the boy's magic being stolen/drained/hijacked
>each one is a different level into wanting to be sexually destroyed by the beasts

Main plot points I'd think would work well:
> anon's main love interest was part of the first contact group. Later both were put into the diplomatic envoy together.
> Ethical Dilemma would be the fact earth is basically a colony planet for a far more advanced space empire. They are very well taken care of, but they almost have no say in what they do in space and are basically treated as a child brothel.
> anon and interests relationship is strained near the middle/end because he starts to believe that he failed diplomatically or he believes that humanity is a slave state or something along those lines. Trys to flee the planet and hide out among the stars or something.
>concludes with confrontation with interest, realization that love interest very much loves anon, submits, starts a family.
>throw in some political situations with other planets and species like you already did with the space gas station. Verge of war because wolf empire won't share humies, etc.

>hao is supposed to be some kind of uber sadist dom
>/adhg/ still finds a way to make jokes about her
I love this place

She's deceptively human in her personal rhythm and that's appreciated
>maintains an unerring façade in her official positions
>but harbors a real beast deep within
>is crushingly devious and dismissive to those not valuable to the State of the maintaining of her position therein
>finds those willing to partake in that side of her exceptionally intriguing
>loves putting the pressure on these few, letting the gravity of their decisions sink in like stone
>yet when against all odds, they refuse to break, and she's fully ensnared them in her web...
>a different Tanuki comes out

>you will never be taken as a mate by a young daxy sergeant when humanity is inducted into the empire
>you will never be calmed by breathing in her pheromones and her loving encouragement
>you will never see the galaxy at her side
>you will never raise a big family of scaled daughters and human sons with her

"Alight' lads, is penis inspection day!"
>The chief inspector declares.
>When you signed up for human drug trials you weren't expecting this, then again you really didn't know what to expect.
>Regardless, you weren't expecting to have your dick measured and toyed with by several anthros once a week.
>Honestly, the offer seemed too good to be true.
>Free room and board on top of getting paid and all you have to do is just wait around for a drug to take affect?
>Hell, they even offered moving services.
>Unfortunately, you, like a dumbass, somehow missed that the contract was for four years and you can only get out of it if you have a severe allergic reaction.
>You enter your testing room.
"You know the drill, strip down."
>It was difficult getting used to being naked in front of two anthros, but the bright lights and scientific tools helped in some odd way.
"Five-point-seven percent increase in testicle size."
>In hindsight, you're glad that these drug trials were for 'male-enhancements' instead of painkillers or something.
"Penis length has increased to twenty-three-point-four centimeters."
>You know the routine now, that's the last check they do before the examination is officially over.
>But then comes the unofficial examination.
>The scientist that was taking the notes opens up her lab coat to reveal her fur covered breasts and lack of any fabric beneath.
>The one who was measuring you had already rolled a condom onto you.
>The note-taker turns your head to the side and plants your face between her tits and whispers:
"Last week the most you came was twenty-three milliliters, think you can beat it?"
>You try to murmur out a 'Yes', but speaking while being smothered is difficult.
>Her response is an amused huff as other scientist starts rolling her hips back.
>You emerge a hour later and stumbling into a wall.
>Damn they're insatiable, you think you used five condoms, at least.
>You don't know why they have a 'taste test' but you're not complaining.

>join cult of sekhmet
>since you're a young human male you get a specific job
>pampering and caring for the "avatars of sekhmet"
>which are actually just any and all anthro lionesses at the temple
>they can do whatever they want to and you have to obey any order they give
>all of them are big amazons of beast women just like sekhmet herself
>even if you weren't part of the cult of sekhmet they'd be able to force you to whatever they wanted from their size and strength
>mostly they want sex or for you to sexually pleasure them due to soft human tongue and hands
>mostly sex since sekhmet is also a fertility goddess
>also since you're an official member and have the job of caring for the avatars of the goddess you have to wear certain clothes and/or jewelry to denote that to others
>which just means the lionesses can easily spot you from a distance and tell you apart from other humans
>and you don't stop being part of the cult when you leave the temple so the lionesses can still do whatever they want to and tell you do anything they want still
>sometimes share woes and your aches at a bar that members of different cults/temples frequent too
>mostly bitching at each other who has it worse
>the guy from the anubis/anput cult complaining of always smelling of dog saliva, the sobek cult guy complaining of nearly drowning, bastet cultist complaining of all the pouncing and gift of dead mice, and so on
>but everyone always shuts up when the taweret cultist hobbles in
>also money being exchanged due those losing the bet on when his hips will be broken by hippo ass

Why are anthros better endowed than roasties?

Superior genetics. Imagine the seething from human women over species who got better assets just from their species
>cow/sheep/milky species being titty monsters
>rabbits/kangaroos having amazing legs and hips with no work
>minks having amazing fur even if they're NEETs
>weasel/ferret girls can out do human gymnasts in flexibility at birth
>bear girls having big everything plus bear strength
>fox girls don't even need to bother with makeup due to how appealing fox faces are naturally
>wolf girls being prime tomboys and built like it
>spotted hyenas being natural amazons
>etc

>anon gets hired as a jail guard
>kind of a weird hiring process. he had a comfortable, sedentary deskjob when a recruiter reached out to him out of the blue
>never asked for qualifications, of which anon has none pertaining to keeping the inmates restrained or docile
>the pay would make you think you were seeing double though
>anon starts his first day on the job
>the whole jail is in the pocket of a crimelord housed there
>she wanted access to a cute humie and he is how the demand was fulfilled, whether he knows it or not and whether he wants it or not.

>Anthro gangs tend to be made up of the same species
>If the prison hires a bunch of anthros there's the risk of a guard allying with their own species and giving favors to prison gangs, giving some prisoners better treatment, maybe even helping in an escape attempt
>Humies however are almost never a consenting member of a gang and with practically no humies in the prison system in the first place there's no risk of them allying with the prisoners
>Or maybe humies have a natural calming effect on anthros, thus causing some of the most dangerous ones to tone down their violent tendencies when a human is around

> Be Anon, extremely unsuccessful scientist
> All of your research turns to shit, none of your grant requests are accepted, none of your contemporaries like you, and you spend the entirety of your 20s scraping trying to make ends meet and failing at everything you try
> On your latest birthday, depressed and completely jaded, you decide 'fuck it' and just live in the moment for a while
> Living in the moment involves drugs, you decide
> A lot of drugs
> A LOT of drugs
> Surprising how easy it is to get your hands on LSD when you're a scientist
> Wake up three weeks later
> Cannot remember a single fucking thing that happened between then and now
> The large, muscular, blue furry woman smiling at you is new though
> She claims you made her somehow
> ...
> Uhhhhh ...........
> Says she's very grateful, and she wants to properly 'thank' you
> Licks her lips as she looks at you
> Adds that it might take her a few tries to properly get the sentiment across
> A few days and a lot of rehydration later, and you've officially got a new lab assistant
> She insists her primary duty is to keep you properly relaxed
> And, if you're ever reluctant to take a break, to 'insist'
> At one point, you ask her why she doesn't go literally anywhere and do anything else
> She shrugs
> Says she's perfectly happy where she is
> Smirks and wraps you up in a big hug, pressing a breast into your face
> Teasingly asks you if you really mind
> And thus life went on, very similar and very different
> The constant marathon sex sessions admittedly do a lot to relax you and boost your productivity
> You even start to bring in a little money and earn a bit more respect for your research papers as the quality goes up
> You stay pretty private though.... you've got all you really need back at home and in the lab, now
> Only one thing complicates it all a bit
> You don't partake of your stash very often, but sometimes you still do
> And every time you do, you wind up blacking out for at least a few days
> And.... you wake up with a new, very forceful, and very thirsty wife
> You're up to three of them now
> Still no fucking clue how you're doing it
> Feel like you should be worried
> But whenever one of them is done with you, you're lucky to be able to 'feel' much more than your toes

"Clerk, do you know why you've been called here?"
"No Oberst. Have I made an error in filing your reports?"
>She chuffs as she gets up to look out a window.
>You immediately note that she's lacking her usual dress pants and is wearing some mesh.
>Her tail is flopping about and frequently hitting her midback, if you were to stare a bit then you could get a glimpse of-
>You remind yourself of her rank and rip your eyes away and to her upper body.
>She's holding up her hand to examine it, curling and uncurling each digit, you see a grin on the side of her muzzle.
"You have not."
>She does a quick turn on her heel to look as you while she leans against the windowsill.
>It is a struggle to not glance down, you resist the urge the best you can by focusing on her neck.
"You served in the army, did you not?"
"Yes Oberst, I was a sniper."
>She is speaking with a tone you can't decipher, usually she speaks with a cold, professional tone.
"How bold, it's rare to find a man willing to enlist, more so to find one able to make the physical requirements."
"Thank you Oberst...?"
"You've done well enough that you may call me Nicole."
"Yes Ober- er, Nicole."
>Her tail dances about at that, even if her face doesn't show it.
>She turns back to the window and gets in a slightly lower position, simply resting her hands on the windowsill instead of standing, it's not much but enough to draw your eyes to her rear.
>Try as you may you cannot stop your eyes from dipping down and locking on her slowly swaying tail.
>It's not going as high as it was so you can't get a good look but if you wait-
"How do you think the war effort is going?"
>Her usual professional tone is back and it quickly breaks you from the throes of lust.
"Very well Ob- Nicole, the partisan attacks on the supply lines are growing weaker and weaker by the day."
"Indeed they are, and our enemies' lines are growing weaker. They'll be starved of ammunition soon."
>She shifts her upper body around so she can crack her back, in the quiet of the room it sounds like a handgun firing.
"They'll be forced to surrender soon, I estimate that they'll be able to hold out for another half year at most. Assuming their people don't force them to yield sooner."
>You stay silent, you're not quite sure what to say.
>She peers at you over her shoulder and you meet her eye.
"Did you have any plans for after the war?"
>You mull it over for a moment.
"I want... I'd like to have a family and buy a home."
>At her silence you continue,
"At least three or four children, I grew up as an only child and I always missed not having a brother or sister."
"How sweet."
>She's gone to a very familiar tone, one you heard from your fellow anthro soldiers all the time as they propositioned you.
"I want to have triplets, to celebrate the end of this war."
>She sinks to resting her elbows on the table and her teasing tail no longer covering anything.
>Your eyes immediately lock on her exposed rear.
"Will you give them to me? Or must I take them from you?"
>You throat locks up and you watch as her legs impatiently tense up at your lack of reaction, probably to lunge for you.
"Why me?"
>Is all you can struggle out, but it's enough to prevent her pounce.
"As I said, it is very rare to find a strong man, and in order to have strong children, both parents need to be strong themselves."
>You don't quite get what she's saying, but the sight and scent of your aroused superior presenting makes up your mind for you.
>Her display only gets more intense as you undress and approach.
"I do hope you know that this will take more than a single try."
>As you line up, you feel relieved by fact she chose the window facing the forest instead of the one facing the base.
.
>After a hour of her pounding you into the top of her desk, she gets an affectionate glint in her eye.
>She raises her hands to the sides of your face and states:
"Good boy."

Anthros are already physically superior to humans
but them having the ability to do magic makes humans completely powerless against them.
Avoid anthros that can do magic they are very dangerous.

“Oh, there wasn’t a mistake.”
“What? You don’t seem like a wolf.”
>She reaches behind her head, grabs her hair, and pulls forward.
>Revealing a smug wolf head.
“Oh, I love it when a horny slut has to tell me his desires.”
“I…”
“You blushing, slut? Delicious.”
>He stutters himself in incoherence as the wolf grabs him by the shoulder and into his home.
“I’m going to get this suit off, you better be nude and ready for a workout when I come out.”
>He manages to state:
“Yes ma’am,”
>As she walks into his bedroom.

>"Clean & Serene for six months" is written on the obverse
>for the first time since graduation, it feels as though you scaled a mountain
>like you really have made progress somewhere, anywhere with your life

>every time that scent takes you aside
>the cravings come crawling back
>you never told her about your struggles with nicotine
>and for some reason, you don't feel the need to bring it up
>...as she looks aside, and offers you a puff

>She slowly drags the edge of her scissors down the side of your neck, pausing to rest the flat side against your skin so you can feel the chill of her steel.
>The blades open with a snap and the fabric on your shoulder is sent into its maw.
>She forces you to stare into her eyes with the force of her gaze.
>You feel the scissors slowly close with the sound of grinding steel and you await the sound of fabric being cut asunder.
>But you don't hear it.
>Hao's eyes break from your and shift to your shoulder and yours follow suit.
>She opens the scissors again and snaps them shut.
>You do not hear the sound of them cutting.
>The claws on the paw under your shirt begin to dig into your flesh at her agitation.
>She futilely snaps the blades closed with increasing force.
>snarls of aggravation escape her mouth as she continues to fail.
>You feel the blood dripping down your chest as her claws were dragged across it.
>She eventually gives up and starts using her claws.
>To both of your dismay, the results stay the same.
"What is this made of, Kevlar!?"
"I don't know, I just grabbed something cheap!"
"Damn the quality of the State's goods, if it was foreign-made I could've ripped it off with ease..."
>She stops trying and climbs off you.
"Wait here, I'm going to get another set of scissors."
>You quietly nod, you're tied to the chair so you couldn't move even if you wanted to.
>Not that you wanted to, you leaving would just make her upset.
.
>She comes back about 20 minutes later with a new pair of scissors.
>Though, calling them scissors might be a bit incorrect, as they seem to be the size of shears.
>She climbs atop you and pulls your head back to lock you into eye contact.
>She moves the shears back to where she was trying to cut.
>Without fanfare, she shuts them.
>They make a beautiful sound as they slice your shirt.
>The click they made puts a content smile on Hao's face.
"That's better. Now then, where were we?"

>Skullcrushers Bar, Gym, and Internet Cafe
>Humans can show up and be locked into seating for their faces to be sat on for however many hours they sign up for, entry is free and volunteers are offered free drinks and snacks
>They can be benches in the gym, the sauna, the changing room, barstools, and gaming chairs
>Anthros pay a small membership fee for 24/7 access

>You'd been technically homeless for the past year and a half.
>Granted calling yourself 'not homeless' might have been a stretch as you didn't have a house or apartment.
>Or an official, normal job.
>You were working for a place called 'Skullcrushers'.
>Working might not be the correct word to use as you didn't have an official position, but you'd been going there for about a year and have been living off tips.
>The anthros that go there tip well, really well.
>It almost makes you glad you'd gotten laid off.
>You finally get from the bed and start getting ready to take a shower.
>The owner had set up 'cuddling rooms', specific areas for a human and anthro to cuddle or 'cuddle' about a year ago.
>You'd like to think it was because she took a liking to you and didn't want to see you sleeping on the floor of the gaming room.
>It probably wasn't, but it's a nice thought.
>To be honest, the cuddling rooms are quite accurately named, most come in because they actually want to cuddle.
>That and confess their depraved desire for headpats, pets, and even handholding.
>You'd left to go grab your birth control and STD prevention pills.
>The fact they were invented is something you're thankful for every day.
>They might cost as much as your rent did, but you're not exactly paying rent
>But you're really in no position to have or raise kids.
>Getting syphilis or something would be terrible as well.
>You wave to the bouncer as you 'clock' in.
"I think I'll take... two hours in the bar. Feel free to grab me if something comes up."
>You'd been there for so long that if some new guy came in to be a chair, they'd pop you out to give him some quick training.
>Some of the human barstool slots have a 'design flaw' where the human's arms can move about.
>You usually try and get into one of those.
>Reaching up and locking them to the seat so you can tongue-fuck more orgasms out of them than they expected is always a treat.
>Two anthros fall prey to your tactics and practiced tongue.
>The first was a grey furred canine with a bit of feral blood in her if her cookie was anything to go by.
>She made an adorable whine as when you edged her to her third.
>Next up was a large reptile, probably a crocodile or alligator if the deep rumble she made was any indication.
>You get pulled out with about 20 minutes left on your shift, if your clock is correct.
>Some kid decided that he wanted to try out the sauna, for a 4 hour shift.
>Either he's a complete dumbass or he wrote the wrong number.
>You go to educate him and, unfortunately, he's a dumbass who thinks himself invincible.
>Hell, you can barely stand 2 hours in the sauna and you've one of the guys who has been working here the longest.
>You demonstrate to him how to use one of the gaming chairs, as they're the easiest to get used to.
>As you're doing that, you rewrite his '4' into a '1' and learn that his friends dared him into it.
>Kid needs to find better friends.
>Or at least friends who won't get him to sweat himself to death under an anthro's ass.
>Once you get to the locker room, you tell him to strip.
>He's resistant because there's at least 3 anthros hungrily staring him down.
"You're not allowed in the sauna unless you're naked, company policy. There's some employee lockers over here you can use."
>He begins to slowly strip, but you one-up him by doing an 'accidental' striptease.
>Now that you're both in only your skins, you take him into the sauna and show him how to lock himself in it.
"Last chance to back out, once I lock you in you're not getting out."
>He tells you to do it and you lock him in for an hour.
>Normally, you'd get one of the more 'gentle' anthro regulars to ease in a new guy, but this kid hasn't wanted a leniency thus far, he probably doesn't want it now.
>You help out the bartender for the next 50 minutes.
>By help out, you mean subtly flirt with the anthro patrons while giving them drinks.
>Such as petting their hand as you give them their drink;
>Randomly giving discounts to girls as you call them cute;
>Stating that there's a fly on their head and you reach to pet it off;
>And so on.
>Ten minutes after that you wait outside the sauna and watch the clock.
>As if on cue comes a panicking, naked tigress clutching the limp body of the kid.
>He looks visibly dehydrated, you know what to look for.
>He's not the first to overestimate how long you can stay in the sauna.
>Preparing your tone of faux authority you instruct her:
"He needs water, take him to one of the cuddling rooms and get some water. Make him drink the water slowly, a mouthful every minute or two."
>She's still panicked, but now she's panicked with a set of instructions to follow and she darts off to execute them.
>You suppress a snicker as she runs out the door nude, but smile at her concern.
>You make the mistake of sitting on one of the benches, there's not a guy under it, but you soon find an anthro in your lap.
>Her cheeky smirk is plain enough to you even if you can't see her face.
>Reaching a hand up to fondle and pet and the other below to line up, you feel her eagerness drool down.
>Once you're all nicely lined up, she slams herself down with enough force to knock the wind out of you.
>Ah, you know her type very well, let's see how well she stands up to your trickery.
.
>You leave her sprawled across the tile, occasionally twitching.
>She had two of your loads pumped into her, the first was gotten with her own aggression which you enflamed with taunts and teases.
>Once she was spent you got her on her back as you pet her and switched between whispering sweet words in her ear and kissing.
>She'd melted at that.
>Now, you'll go to the gaming section, lotta girls in need of some love over there.
>God damn do you love your job.

>you tried to get her to take a shower
>she brushed you off
>you told her to clean her room or else you wouldn't fuck her anymore
>she somehow made you spend six hours on "chair duty" for that
>finally you had enough and you unplugged the router to take it back to your room
>buncel was a furious mess as she tried to follow you
>she pounded her fists on your back, but it felt like getting hit with wiffle balls
>you were just walking into your room when you tripped
>buncel wrapped herself around your leg with her entire body
>you both go down
>before you could stand back up, she got her massive thunder thigs around your neck in a leg lock
>she mashed your face against her pussy as her entire weight bore down on you
>she ranted and raved as your head was filled with her musk
>buncel humped your head into the floor until you blacked out
>which leads to your new position
>buncel has tied you to her chair, and gagged your mouth with a used pair of panties
>she says she'll let you up to rest, in her bed of course, when she thinks you've learned your lesson

>work on airport fixing planes
>no anthro girls on the maintenance team or working outside, given the heat-stroke inducing weather 90% of the year
>work is a little too dirty for smart anthro girls, but requires too much training and school cost for the... hyena-types you'd find working on trucks
>basically, anyone with enough money is doing the flying and anyone smart enough to do this managed to get into college to be an engineer instead
>which left you, with enough intelligence and money to get through trade school, turning the wrenches
>work uniform is all black because of all the oil and grease you get on you, which means crows instantly notice you
>sometimes this one crow girl flirts with you outside the 7-11, you got her a slurpee one time
>she's pretty much the only anthro you've ever talked to, most of the others at the airport won't give you the time of day because they're busy sexually harassing the pilots

>manage to coax the mouse into a conversation
>ask her why she's in your house
>she confesses to watching you for the past few weeks, and says that she desires you as a mate
>tell her that the size difference would make it impractical
>she says it doesn't bother her on the slightest
really, she's 5 inches tall. what's she gonna do?

Scenario: You are the sole human living in your neighborhood. Your neighbors are all manner of prehistoric beasties. Some of them are tiny, and a lot of them could crush your house. The architecture tends to favor the larger set with allowances for smaller sorts such as yourself. You have ready access to food and water, you own a vehicle even if you rarely use it (it's easier to ride on a friendly shoulder), and you make decent income. You have good to neutral standing with your neighbors, and you have no outstanding legal issues.
What does an average day look like for you? What are some things you like to do? Do you have any romantic prospects? What do you do with your friends?

The issue is how scent plays into something like anthros.
>next door little billy is just a human cub running around
>then he hits puberty
>now his body is pumping off all sorts of pheromones saying he's not a cub, but viable male ready for breeding
>which just gets compounded by him fapping so much and not showering afterwards to clear the smell since humans are scent blind
>which may as well be him unknowingly screaming he's available and virile

>The first fingers of sunlight crest the horizon as morning dawns on the town.
>Saturday begins with you curled in your bed; alarm blissfully silent as you sleep deeply.
>The heavy curtains of your bedroom window block the sun from entry.
>Your weighted cover and white linen sheet sandwich you in warmth.
>You could remain this way through the entire day.
>An hour passes in peaceful, dreamless silence.
>It's a sound like approaching thunder that stirs you.
>The ground quakes, sending your bed rocking.
>The noise grows to a din, like the passing of a herd of massive cattle.
>You remain unmoved, though annoyed at the disturbance.
>Reluctantly, you move from your spot, instantly missing your cozy nest.
>Bracing yourself against the light, you peel aside a thin sliver of your curtains.
>Outside, a bit too close to your house for comfort, is a great, moving mass of scaly pillars.
>You'd almost forgotten.
>Saturday is the day when the local saurian fitness group has their early-morning group run.
>By your count, there can't be more than twenty of them, but it's enough to cause a ruckus.
>With all your time spent among the scaly sort, you've become an expert at estimating size and weight.
>Thankfully, you don't see anyone over fifteen feet or so.
>The truly gargantuan members must be jogging out of town.
>You'd call it considerate if it weren't the law.
>Saurians past a certain size and weight limit need to keep any strenuous activity away from civilization.
>Fortunately for you, that means your house won't get knocked down today.
>The thundering throng passes as quickly as it came.
>The lingering echoes of their passing acts as a wake-up call to the neighborhood.
>You know that in moments the day will start, the streets bustling with activity.
>People of every shape and size going about whatever business they have on a Saturday.
>Thankfully, you aren't one of them.
>You'd think working from home takes a bit of the thrill out of lazy weekends.
>You'd be wrong, of course.
>Sighing, you crawl back into bed, snuggling back into the warmth.
>There's no way in creation that you're up this early on a Saturday.
>It's not happening.
>You doze again, letting time slip away from you.
>Content to share company with the backs of your eyelids.
>It's not until around ten o'clock that something finally rouses you from bed properly.
>Your doorbell rings.
>Grousing, you rise from your rest, stretching a kink out of your back.
>The bell sounds again as you tie up your robe and slip your slippers on.
>By the time you've made it to your front door, it's rung a third time.
>Undoing the deadbolt, you open your door to see no one there.
>"Package delivery!" A voice huffs, strained.
>You look down to see a small, brown saurian with a long, skinny tail.
>She's struggling under a hefty, brown, carboard box that's slowly crushing her.
>She can't be more than three feet tall.
>Obligingly, you quickly take the package from her, much to her relief.
>You set the package aside as she straightens herself out, huffing and panting from exertion.
>"Whew! Thanks, man!" She says, elated to have the weight off. "I thought I was... done..."
>She trails off, and with the box out of the way, you get a good look at her.
>Aside from being brown and short, she's surprisingly slim.
>Her skinny tail trails away from a skinny body with skinny limbs.
>Her skinny neck terminates in a small, pointy head.
>She's naked save the postal sash she wears across her chest, covering her miniscule breasts.
>Her mouth with its little, sharp teeth gapes open as she stares at you with wide, little eyes.
>"Oh, wow." She gasps, breathless. "You're a human."
>You resist the urge to roll your eyes.
>This isn't the first time you've had to interact with someone like her.
>"Yep." You say, keeping your voice neutral. "In the mammalian flesh."
>She continues staring, unable to hide her interest.
>You have to wonder what gets into these lizards sometimes.
>You know humans are rare enough, and that there are some odd rumors about them.
>Still hardly seems like a reason to get all star struck over you.
>"Do I need to sign off on this?"
>That seems to snap her out of her daze.
>"Huh?" She squeaks. "Oh! Yeah! Uh, please."
>She pulls a device from her sash and hands it to you.
>Quickly scribbling on the screen, you return it.
>She still stares as she takes it back.
>You're starting to get a little uncomfortable.
>You clear you throat. "Is there anything else?"
>She shakes herself. "Uh! No! No, sir! Thank you!"
>You nod, retreating back inside.
>"Okay. Have a good day, then."
>"You too, sir! Thank you!" She says as you close the door.
>Watching from the peephole in your door, you can see her walking back to her truck.
>She stops to pull out a notepad, scribbling something down in it.
>Your address, you imagine.
>You imagine you'll be seeing her again.

Id imagine humans would make the best tailors in an athro world, given our dexterous digits.
You'd find human grooming parlous, clothiers and jewelers in all the major population hubs

>anthro smiths/tailors/artisans can do similar work, but struggle with the smaller fine detailed stuff
>humans have a natural affinity to with small slim nimble fingers
>so either you have separate stores/guilds handling it
>or a smart anthro hires a human or several for their place to do such work
always fun to do settings where humans are minority/new species in an area and how they try to adapt or prosper there

>Want to do something by myself tonight
>Anthro female handler won’t let it happen
Why and also how the fuck did I get a handler for?

>You stopped to watch the sunset at the edge of a bridge without railings.
>It'd been a while since you last paused and looked at the world around you.
>The sky was turning a beautiful color of red, orange, and gold.
>You stared into the water for contrast, and saw the last few sun rays punch down and paint the dark blue water.
>If you focused, you could even see a few fish splashing about in the wat-
"This is the police! Step away from the edge!"
>With a jerk of surprise from the breach of serenity, you slip backwards and land on your rear.
>Immediately you're swarmed by anthro police officers pulling you towards their cars
>As they place you in the car, you realize that you didn't have cuffs placed on you.
>Well, if you were in trouble you'd be cuffed so you relaxed.
"Why are you asking me all these questions? I was just watching the sunset."
"Sir, we're going to have a handler follow you about just for our own peace of mind."
>You sigh, hopefully this handler is nice.

"I'll see you later, boss."
>you sigh and stretch your back as you wave goodbye to your manager
>the middle-aged capybara frowns thoughtfully as she watches you go
>"Feeling alright Anon? You seemed kinda down during your shift."
>you wave your hand dismissively
"I'm fine, just a rough go of it lately. Just need to make to the weekend, am I right?"
>you give her a tired grin to show you're alright, and step onto the elevator
>truthfully, things had been pretty bad for you for a while now
>but you just gotta keep trundling along until things get better, right?
>your manager watches you go, that frown still on her face
>but then she's gone when the elevator dings and the doors slide shut
>it's a short drive back to your apartment
>the three flights of stairs to your floor are a drain though
>the elevator's been out of order for two months
>you trudge up the stairs and roll out the keys to your door
>the lock is finicky, and it takes several attempts to get it just right for the key to turn
>you grumble and step into the dark studio apartment
"I'm home!"
>you call out to no one in particular, as you live alone since your ex dumped you
>without even the energy to change properly, you kick off your shoes as you cross the room and drop face-first onto your bed
>but try as you might, you can't get to sleep
>you toss, and you turn, and you groan and grumble
>finally you give up and pull out your phone to at least drown out the buzz of your thoughts with garbage internet videos
>just as the screen lights up however, there's a harsh pounding at your door
>"HPS! Open up!"
>the HPS?
>what are they doing here?
>you're hardly in any danger
>you sit up and scoot to the edge of your bed
"What do you--"
>BAM!
>the door-frame shatters as a wolf in full combat gear kicks the door in
>"Don't move! HPS!"
>a half-dozen officers pile into the room, surrounding the bed with shields raised
>you sit there in stupefied silence
>you look around the room, but they've completely locked you in with a wall of riot shields
>one of the officers, another canine, breaks the line, stepping forward slowly
>"I'm going in."
>she lowers her shield and reaches out with her free arm
>you lean away as her paw draws closer to her face
>the officer shushes you comfortingly as her paw finally lands on your head
>"I've made contact."
>you expect to be wrestled to the ground and subdued, but instead the canine woman gently strokes your hair
>"There there. It's okay."
>cooing and shushing you, she pats your head as you sit there dumbfounded
>is this really happening?
>she moves in closer, sitting beside you on the bed to continue petting you
>"There's a good boy. You've been working so hard, and you're being so brave for me."
>fuck, it's been so long since you've been touched so tenderly
>you lean into the petting hand
>a small chorus of 'awws' comes from the other officers, who break ranks and descend on you
>the canine pulls you into her lap, and all the other officers take a turn petting your hair, stroking your cheek, and even giving you a hug
>once you've melted completely into the officer's embrace, she lifts you in a bridal carry
>"Extracting the target. He's a precious, good boy, over."

>/fit/izen waifur who posts gains from fucking you silly
>claims to lift "to dom my husband better"
>and also for the total destruction of the state of /collared/
>her "workouts" are intense enough that you're noticing a benefit yourself
>on the other hand you're so exhausted you don't get the chance to use it

>The guards had left you alone a good 5 minutes ago now, but the sound of gunfire was still getting closer.
>Not like you could do anything about it though.
>You couldn't even try to hide against the wall in your present state.
>your wrists were bound behind your back, and then hoisted up towards the ceiling with a rope and pulley, leaving you awkwardly hunched forwards.
>The exchanges of gunfire seemed to be happening less and less frequently though, and you thought you heard one of your captors voices cry out in the distance.
>It had barely echoed through the dusty hallway outside the solid iron door, and left an eerie silence in its wake.
>A few tense minutes tick by before the faint sound of stomping boots starts to float into your cell through the small barred window centred just above eye level.
>Your anxiety only grows as it gets closer, but the tension is broken when you hear a voice speaking in an accent you haven't heard in over half a year.
"Look. Holding cells."
>Is all he said, but its enough to light the brightest glimmer of hope you've felt in your entire life.
>The boots seem to be stepping much more softly now, but you can hear them plain as day in the hallway outside.
>Two figures rush past your door in quick succession, and your heart skips a beat as they fail to stop and look inside.
>You try to shout after them, but before you can muster the breath to make more than a pained wheeze, a third figure darkens your tiny window.
>Pausing to look in for only a moment, their head turns sharply and silhouettes their snout off to one side as they call out:
"Sam! Over here!"
>There's a sudden commotion just at what you assume is the end of the hall, by the way that the pounding of boots grows louder as it approaches.
>The silhouette in front of you stands aside, and another indistinct, but somehow more familiar form peers in at you from under their identical ballistic helmet.
>But it can't be, it's been so long...
"Anon! ANON! OHMYGODITSHIM! SOMEBODY GET ME THE DOOR RAM"
>Relief washes over you for what feels like the first time in your life.
>That voice, it is her.
>Sam, an experienced DEVGRU operator, and your wife of 6 years.
"RAAHH! FUCK IT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!"
>The desperation in her voice spills over, and the shadow at the edge of your door retreats just in time.
*CRASH*
>The iron door shudders on its hinges.
>Solid as it is, the frame it's hung on is very old.
>It's not giving up that easily though.
*CRASH*
"Jesus fuck Sam, you're gonna-"
*BANG*
>the first voice started to say, but was quickly cut off by the final resounding impact as the door crashed open on its hinges.
"ANON!"
>Sam shouted as she burst into your cell, quickly being followed up by 2 other marines sweeping their tac-lights around the small dingy room.
>She started to rush straight for you, but diverted herself upon taking in your restraints.
>Swiftly pulling the combat knife from the front of her plate carrier, she took one step to the side and cut the heavy rope where it was tied off to a pipe jutting out of the wall.
>Her other arm shoots out to catch you as you fall, and she drops the knife in her hand as she hastily side-steps back to take your whole weight in her embrace.
>You can feel how desperate she is to hold you as tight as she can, but she's mindful enough to know you've probably got enough internal injuries as it is.
>Sinking slowly to her knees, she lowers you to the floor.
>Rather than placing you down on it however, she kicks her legs out one at a time to sit on the hard concrete, and lays down on her back, gently pulling you forwards and on top of her.
"Oh Anon..."
>she says softly into your shoulder, and you notice that she's gently sobbing.
>You're still too in shock to feel much but the most profound sense of relief, and of course, adoration for the professional soldier who held you so gingerly.
>The one you had married.

>The coin in your pouch jingled as you leapt down from the carriage.
>You'd gone to the slave market looking to get a maid to tidy up your home.
>It has ten bedrooms, 2 kitchens, 3 separate living rooms, and so many bathrooms.
>Perhaps mansion would be a better word to call it.
>Regardless, it was far too much for you to clean.
>The only reason you were going for a slave instead of hiring someone is that a slave was much cheaper.
>Granted, you'd prefer to call whoever you're buying a 'servant' instead of a 'slave'.
>The first thing you saw in the first group of anthro's was how their eyes were glazed over with... emptiness.
>You try your best to hide your shudder, but you still do all the same.
>How... disturbing.
>It's enough to make you want to turn back and just hire a maid.
>You make a decision to yourself, you don't want a slave with that emptiness inside them.
>The next few groups you look at still have that emptiness and you pass them without another thought.
>A pang of self-loathing hits you, how could you so easily shrug off their worth?
>You resolve to take a good look in their eyes before you pass your judgement.
>You immediately regret that.
>These slav- anthros simply look dead, inside and out.
>If necromancers were still about, you'd think their fresh thralls would look like these.
>Still, you take a close look into your eyes.
>Something inside you seems to slowly die as you look each in their eyes.
.
>After a soul crushing experience, you stumble upon an anthro with life in her eyes.
>Feeling heartened, you try to look her in the eye.
>There's fire there too.
>She lunges for you snarling behind her muzzle and her wrath kept only by her chains.
>Flagging down a market keeper, you request that he remove her muzzle.
>She stare into your eyes and declares with a snarl:
"You will never break me, human."
>You fail to conceal your glee at finding someone in this earthly hell that seems to have a soul.
>The market keeper looks at you strangely.
>As does the chained anthro before you.
>But where the keeper's look is of confusion the anthro's is more undecipherable.
>Sure her growls got louder, but her still tail started flick and her eyes gained an old glint.
"Hell bound pervert, you'll pay for whatever you try."
>You immediately offer to purchase her.
"Are you certain sir? She's not been here for long enough to get trained. She's likely to rip out your throat the first chance she gets."
>His warnings are brushed aside by you offering coin.
>Reluctantly he accepts your offers.
>The next half hour is spent filling ownership papers.
>The sensible voice in the back of your mind asks if you really should be getting an anthro who tried to bite you to be your housekeeper.
>With glee, you ignore the thoughts of possible death in favor of pulling a bright soul from the pits of hell.
>The keeper hooks up a leash to her and off you go.
>She puts up a token fight, she must really be getting hit hard by malnutrition.
.
>She looks confused as you tell her you're making her your housekeeper from across the table.
"What? Just a maid?"
"Yes, that's why I'd even gone to... such a dreadful place."
>She looks confused at your rational, but doesn't question it to your surprise.
>You answer anyways.
"I did the math, the costs of purchasing and owning a slave is far cheaper than hiring a maid."
>Her eyes seem to dull at your pragmatism.
.
>You'd spent the next few weeks cleaning up the house with the help of your maid.
>She had been confused the first few days with using the cleaning tools, but she had grown familiar with them.
>Nevertheless, she seemed increasingly irritated with something.
>She'd also taken to dusting thing in front of you with a slightly raised tail.
>After about two months after you'd purchased her, she sought you out.
>She planted one of her arms to the side of your head.
>You noted that ever since she started eating right, her body has regained the muscle and healthy curves she'd lost.
"Enough of these games. What debased tastes were you looking to fill?"
>To be approached in such a manner is frightening.
"What tastes? I just need-ed a maid. You've seen how large this place is, I couldn't clean it myself..."
>She brings her face nearly nose to nose to yours, and growls.
"You expect me to believe that? What foul plans did you have to try and break my will? Keeping me in heat without offering to put it out? Was that your plan to torment me?"
"You're heat?"
"Of course I am! I would have thought that even with your nose you would have smelt it and been a slave to your desires as you smashed my head against the floor and pumped me full of pups!"
>You're taken aback by this, she'd always seemed like the type you wouldn't want to miss with.
>Your stunned silence enrages her.
>She reaches her claws into your shirt and rips them away.
>Your pants follow shortly, but they were made of stronger fabric than your shirt, thus making you fall on your ass with your back against the wall.
"If you won't take advantage of me, I'll make you."
>She grabs the back of your head and drags it under her pantiless skirt.
>Your lips slot against a wide, heated cunt.
>She speaks out again:
"Lick."
>And you do, you drag your tongue all over the 'Y' of her flesh.
>It is earthy, with spicy hints.
>You find yourself enjoying the taste.
>The rate at which you lick increases, soon after you try and drill your tongue deeper to coax out more tasty fluid
"Pervert, I bet you've forced that tongue of yours against the unwilling slits of many anthros..."
>You try to mutter out a 'no' but it is muffled her jamming you face against her.
"Lick dammit."
>You continue with your swift, deep licks.
>A wet gush of her spills across your tongue and face and floods down your thirsting maw.
>She pulls you so you're standing.
"Now, you're going to breed me properly."
>She turns around a starts to lean over with her arms extended towards you, you grab the offered arms.
"Good boy. Now breed this unruly bitch!"
>It takes a few tries to get it in without your hands, but you do and start pounding away.
>She's pulling your member into herself more than you're able to thrust into her.
>Not that you're really able to thrust.
>You have to lean back against the wall to prevent you both from falling forward, due to her position and larger size.
>She's still rattling off more of her perverse lines calling you debased and such.
>She's growing less and less coherent by the second
>You can't hold back anymore and thrust forward as she is mostly slid off of you.
>Both of you fall.
>She lands with the side of her muzzle pressed against the ground and her ass right up in the air.
>You fall behind her and buried to the hilt.
>With a few more thrusts, your shaft gives her her long awaited fulling.
>You collapse atop of her in exhaustion.
"Tomorrow."
>She states, sternly meeting your eyes from the floor
"We'll do this tomorrow, and every day after that. You're going to make me fill this house with your kids, master~"

Not the original author, but I wanted to add onto this.
>Part of you is glad that your slave is asserting her own agency.
>If she was a free citizen you could afford to hire like you originally wanted, you'd expect her to put herself first.
>Her eyes were completely full of life now, instead of fighting off the deadness the other slaves succumbed to.
>But the other, larger part of you is now afraid of her.
>Which made you feel stupid.
>Even remembering the slave trader's warning, you were never afraid that she might hurt you.
>And her attack on you only hurt your courage.
>Well, you sustained a few bruises.
>Not a big deal, versus the memory of being completely overpowered.
>You spent each day of the following weeks trying to avoid her prophecy,
<Unsuccessfully.
>Sure, she knew the place well enough to thoroughly clean every room.
>But having lived there for years, you knew all its hiding places.
>That was your logic anyway.
>Logic that failed you.
>Your vanishing act pissed her off.
>At first.
>But then she came to expect it.
>...And relish it.
"Are you in here, master?"
>Her approaching taunts gave you chills.
>It was just a game to her.
>A game she always won.
>Your fear was part of her reward.
"Oh master, keep making those cute shrieks!"
>You couldn't work out on your own how she could always find you.
>She had to tell you.
>Though she was probably meaning to ridicule you.
>There you were, lying under the floorboards, setting a new record for how long you were postponing the inevitable.
>Her footsteps hadn't left the room for a whole hour.
"Oh master, just give up. I can smell you~!"
Of course!
>How could you be this stupid?
>On two counts.
>Her enhanced senses were designed to hunt out prey!
>Also...
>Did you really just fucking say that out loud?
>Time for you to change your strategy.
>You surrendered your slave's tribute earlier than usual that day, hiding in a glass door cabinet down in the wine cellar.
>She looked right at you for a couple of seconds while walking directly toward it, only to turn and search somewhere else.
>What happened next was like something out of a horror novel from the mansion's library.
>The cabinet's doorknob squeaked first, alerting you the end was nigh.
>Her claw was clasping and turning it.
>The door creaks open.
>Her had feels blindly, slowly, deeper into your hiding place, before touching and caressing your arm.
>There was a moment where she you holds still.
>She briefly feels the pulsing of your heartbeat, before tearing you out and pinning you to the ground.
>You can still feel the cold stone floor as you disembark the carriage.
>This time you're visiting the upstanding part of the market.
>It has food, books, homewares, the normal civilized stuff.
>There's a stall for perfume at the end of one of the aisles. Just what you need.
Do you have anything that can throw of the scent of anthros?
"If you're going hunting dear, you're better off talking to the fella a couple rows over."
No no, I need it for home.
"Then you should talk to someone who deals with pest control. They can give you something to keep them off your property. That or a guard."
What if they're inside?
"Huh?"
>Her demeanor drops a little. She and reaches down and fumbles around for a bit.
"Some folks drop by and ask for this particular odor. They look like they're from the anthro slave market though. Is this what you're after?"
>Your face turns red from shame. You hope she can't read your mind. After a quick nod and exchange of coins, you hurry off.
>You're home in time for lunch. It's probably the first time in weeks you've eaten lunch at a regular time.
>Your housekeeper's food is as good as ever too. She eats with you and chats about one of the adventure books she's been reading.
>It's almost like this morning never happened.
>However your mind is still on the matte glass bottle you purchased earlier, tucked guiltily in one of your pouches.
>Did slave merchants really use this stuff?
>It plays on your mind the entire day.
>If you were going to use it, you'd need to go to bed early, and spray it around before she woke up.
>Your conscience is bothering you too much to stay up anyway.
>You open your eyes to darkness.
>No light refracts through the bedroom window.
>It's not a great time to wake up.
>But as you stir, the soreness of your pelvis pangs through your body.
>If only you could catch a break from it.
>Struggling to sit upright, you feel around for the scent that might give you some relief.
>Only feeling it in your hand without its ominous sight detaches you from its suspicious usage.
>To convince yourself it's okay, you spray a little in the air in front of you.
>The smell isn't too noticeable, though it is unpleasant.
>No way it could counterbalance your potential salvation.
>You quickly cover each room and hallway with the perfume
>It dissipates over time too, making you confident this is the right decision
>Finally you're standing outside the door to your housekeeper's room
>Taking a short breath, you push it open a crack.
>She oiled the hinges recently. A task that needed to be done for sure, but it also helped her creep about and pounce on you.
>With that thought you fire a short squirt inside, close the door and leave.
>Just one last thing to cover now. You.
>Your morning is peaceful. The most peace you've had in quite some time.
>You brought a later volume of the series your housekeeper was reading into your undiscovered nook.
>Without distraction, you finish a couple chapters.
>Leaving for breakfast, you keep some space between the rooms you hear your housekeeper is in.
>She seems to be focusing on her chores, giving you ample time to eat and read the newspaper.
>As the day goes by without seeing her, you become emboldened.
>Strutting around the house, you find new time and space to dedicate back to your languishing projects.
>Reply to some of the letters that've piled up. Building models in your workshop. Getting some needed exercise. Not the lewd kind.
>Hoping to remain undisturbed, you respray the scent in your new locations
>Lunch comes and goes. You don't see her. The meal's laid out for you.
>It's almost as if she's avoiding you.
>The same happens with dinner.
>Your body is enjoying its break, but you mind has become uneasy.
>She's made more food than usual. Your favorites too. You worry about why.
>Could you find a way to check on her? Without risking another breeding?
>Everything's done except these dishes, so maybe she's gone back to her room.
>Once again, her door's hinges conceal your presence.
>From her ensuite, you can hear her shower running.
>Listening close you also hear her...
>...hear her sobbing!
>All this time together, you'd never hear or seen her sad.
>Your mind flashes back to the slave market.
>The broken souls there mostly silently forlorn.
>But you could distinctly remember some infrequent cries.
>Cries your housekeeper was now also making.
>Peering into the shower, you see her facing the wall underneath the water, pressing away from it with her paws.
>Her tail shyly wraps around her legs.
>Just looking at her anguished pose is heartbreaking.
Hey, are you al—
"Get away!"
>You're now sure she has been deliberately avoiding you."
"You've tormented me enough!"
>You step toward her.
Can I—
"No stop!"
>She sucks in a deep breath of air, holds it, and pinches her nose.
>God. Fucking. Damn. It.
>It couldn't be more obvious what's wrong.
Don't freak out, I'm coming in.
>She does freak out, bearing her claws at you.
>You back off, then see the closed window. You rush on over and open it.
Give me some soap! I need to wash the scent off.
>This gives her a change to pelt you with something as revenge. The soap hits you square in the head.
>Staggering from her attack, you then have to scoop it up off the floor.
>Desperately you strip down and scrub yourself. Of course, this alone won't be enough.
I need to rinse myself. I'm coming in.
>No claws this time. You join her under the water.
>Her eyes are glassy and fearful, even if the water is washing away her tears.
>Almost immediately she wraps her arms around you and digs her face into your chest.
>Her tight embrace isn't reflected in what she has to say to you.
"Why would you do this to me? I hate you! Stupid human! I... I'm sorry...!"
>You can feel her claws gently tearing up your back. It's not as bad as the tearing you feel in your chest.
I didn't mean... I just wanted...
>It probably isn't worth it. It's better to just shut up and let her resolve this on her terms.
>Neither of you say a lot in the next few minutes. Being in each others arms seems to be enough.
>The embrace is broken when she slides down to her knees.
>Also drained, you join her on the shower floor.
"When I was captured, my owner said he'd enjoy suffocating my flame."
>Looking back in your eyes, she didn't look full of life as she did for the last couple of months.
"In order to wear me down, he'd poison the air. He always told me it had no effect on humans whenever I gagged."
>You stretch and grasp her paw.
"Smelling it here...took me back to that time... I was afraid...you'd decided to break me... It was all a trick after all..."
>You hadn't said it yet, so draw closer and whisper to her.
I'm sorry.
>In your head you knew it wasn't enough.
>So you decided to do something you'd never done before.
>You kissed her.
>Of course, you two had kissed. You'd kissed plenty. But she always kissed you.
>It shouldn't have been like this. You shouldn't have broken her, even a little, before offering yourself to her.
>You really did like her. You liked her fire. You liked being underneath her.
>You just never really reciprocated.
>She kissed you back hard.
>Not wanting to fall completely back into old ways, you kept moving forward.
>Pulling her head into you. Scratching her long ears. Moving your weight on top of hers.
>This time you'd give her what she wanted.
>She wouldn't need to take it.
>Your initiative took her aback.
>She was such a powerful anthro, but she'd never been overpowered by you.
>Her body wasn't resisting. She liked this side of you.
>Even though she was completely wet from the shower, her entrance was soaked.
>There's no way you could deny her.
>You move your hand down to rub her clit. Your shaft positions itself at her slit.
>Push forward...
>And you finally claim her.
>Being in control made you ecstatic.
>So this was the rush she felt every time she smothered you.
>Her body reacts wildly to your deep thrusts.
>You look down on her and grin confidently.
>In you're head you're egging yourself on.
>Yeah, a human like you CAN ravish and anthro like her.
>But the moment you think that, she starts pushing back.
>What the fuck? Was she reading her mind.
>She grabs your arms and starts throwing thrusts back at you.
>It takes you by surprise, and throws off some of your balance.
>This is supposed to be your moment!
>Her head pulls back from your kiss.
"Oh master, you almost had me there~!"
>Slowly she lift you off of her. Soon you're bother at an even level.
"It's cute you're finally giving yourself to me."
>You open your mouth to response, but all that comes out is a stupid moan.
"I can't let you get away with this though. You kept me waiting the whole day!"
>She's started weighing you down. Just like all those other times.
>No! It can't end this way! You wanted to be in control!
>If she thought she could push you around like all those other times, she was wrong!
>You tense up and begin to fight back.
"Ah! So vigorous! Where did this spirit come from, master?"
>It's not a fair battle though.
>There's no escaping she's stronger than you. But this time, she's holding back.
>Normally she's much more forceful. Even as she's pounding you, you can make sense of it.
>It's probably the same amount of energy with you both fucking each other rather than her completely dominating you.
>One thing you didn't count on is how much striking back would drain your stamina.
>When she was in control, the only thing you'd do is plead yourself not to cum.
>You were too distracted putting all your effort into railing her to notice you'd were at your limit.
>Attack turned into defence.
>Your hips stopped moving forward and tried to hold their position.
>If you'd underestimated your endurance, maybe she'd underestimated hers?
>She was certainly wetter than usual. More vocal too!
>Her hands grip your body tighter to stop herself from shaking.
>The extra composure allows her to hold her gasps back and address you in a low voice.
"You'd better cream my breeding hole right now master. I'll cuddle you from now on if you do."
>You didn't stand a chance.
>You never stood a chance.
>Your mind infatuated the idea of her holding you tenderly.
>You don't know why it broke you.
>You'd pushed push the limit of your strength.
>You completely collapsed.
>You screamed her name.
>You nutted right on cue.
>She tumbled down in a wailing mess right after you.
>Maybe at the same time?
>No way she'd admit to that.
>Your pumping seed gave her desperate relief.
>Even though she'd fallen, it wasn't before you.
>There she was:
>Undefeated.
>Sort of.
---
>Your relationship changed.
>Sure, she'd still breed you every day.
>But you'd come to her a lot.
>It was more passionate.
>Loving.
>You'd contribute so much more.
>Even if she'd still always win.
>Another barrier was dismantled too.
>It was time you shared your bed with her.
>A clever plan to maximize your cuddles.
>She owed you.
---
>Months more go by.
>Her belly has a cute bump in it.
>Your first child together is on the way.
>She's making good on her promise to give you a family for your empty mansion.
>Lying down on the couch together, she thinks it's the perfect time to pick your brains.
"So why'd you want a slave so badly!"
I told you, I couldn't afford to hire a maid.
"The house isn't THAT big, master~. We get everything done by early afternoon!"
Why do you insist on calling me master? And maids are more expensive than you think!
"You sure you didn't want a cute anthro to live with?"
You're hardly cute. You're a psycho!
"And you still chose me! Not one of those trained, submissive ones!"
They were so sad... So vacant...
"I'll tell you what I think."
You always do.
"You're a little submissive creature yourself!"
That's not true...
"You were hoping a rowdy little slave would fix that."
How would that even work.
"By having a fiery personality to bounce off! Come on. You've started being so much more confident and assertive since you bought me!"
It doesn't stop you from bullying me.
"Oh, stop whining like a little pup. And what did you used to do all day? Play with your toys all by yourself!"
I still do, you know that.
"Of course, you do with ME! That and you've taken me out to all those other things."
I like doing stuff with you. We can't just have sex...
"Hahaha. Face it Anon. I complete you!"
You... Uhh... You...
"And you complete me... *smooch*"

>Besides, I'm sure any of your assets caught up in the blasts could be easily replace with your fortune."
>the viper fist clenched upon hearing this
>"Physical assets can be replaced, yes. But you're bombs put many extremely valuable personnel out of commission. Money can't replace them."
>a scoff came through the phone
>"When the elders return all will serve them, and you shall have your pick of the lot.
>Consider your people's deaths as righteous sacrifice."
>all the anger seemed to vanish from Sylvanah as she relaxed and responded
>"I see. Well in the future I suggest you inform me, even if it is just minutes before.
>I can't continue to supply your resistance efforts if I no longer have the people to do so."
>051 spoke again, "Perhaps, but you should put more trust in the elders. They shall provide you with all you need. Glory to the Elders."
>"Glory to the Elders." Sylvanah's response was almost robotic
>anon's mind began to race, was she actually an elder cultist?
>it made no sense with the back story she gave him earlier
>another call brought back anon's attention
>"Police chief Kinsler, I have information on Monday's attack." Sylvanah's cold voice once again graced your ears
>the police chief responded, "Ms. Sylvanah? Alright, you have my attention."
>"The bombing was carried out by a group called the Elders disciples.
>They are led by a hybrid named Marcus, but he only responds to his old Advent unit designation."
>she knew all this and did nothing about them before hand?
>"Of course its another elder cult." The chief sounded only slightly annoyed by this
>"I am forwarding you all locational data you need now. Also Chief Kinsler, outside your precinct, you will find an APC loaded with new equipment.
>I will allow you to keep it all if you do me the favor of bringing me the leader, alive."
>her voice was cold before. Now it was ice.
>"Consider it done." With that the call was ended and silenced consumed the room
>anon felt Sylvanah take his hand in hers again
>without any further stimulation, awareness quickly failed anon and he succumb to sleep
>another unknowable amount of time passes before police sirens rouse the man from slumber
>anon awakes to find his hand empty as Sylvanah stands at the foot of his bed outside his view
>before long heavy footsteps are heard and a knock shakes the door
>"Enter."
>the door opens and the heavy footsteps continue
>"Your home is as lovely as ever Ms. Sylvanah. Shame I have to visit under the current circumstances."
>this voice is familiar to anon
>"Kinsler, you can drop him here."
>there is no greeting from her, only ice
>a thud and a grunt echo throughout the room
>summoning all his might, anon slowly shifts his head to view scene
>in the middle of the room a hybrid is on his knees, bound and gagged
>"You may leave now, Kinsler."
>a large muton stepped into view and said, "I lost a few good men bringing him here.
>And protocol dictates that I maintain line of sight on prisoners to prevent 'suicide' attempts."
>the viper does not respond, only turn her attention to the hybrid
>"Ever since I was freed from their influence I have despised the elders.
>I resented them for denying me a life that should have been mine from the beginning"
>she began to circle the kneeling figure
>she began to circle the kneeling figure
>"You, however. You almost stole from me my most cherished possession.
>My husband nearly died and now lies in a coma because of your zealous devotion to them."
>she had him completely surrounded by her coils, but she had yet to constrict
>once behind the hybrid she places a hand on his shoulder and leans in close
>"Die in agony, you groveling cur."
>her fangs sunk into the hybrid's exposed neck
>venom pumping so fervently through them some leaks out around the vipers mouth
>at first her victim struggled against her
>but soon the struggling turned to seizures
>foam and blood oozed out from his gagged mouth

>he continues twitching for a several moments more before finaly falling limp
>the muton breaks the silence, "Looks like he had a suicide pill in his teeth. Damn shame."
>the viper looks up from her kill, "It appears so. Won't you clean up this mess for me, before you leave?"
>the muton nods, "Gladly. And Sylvanah? I do hope your husband there gets well soon."
>she turns to face the bed where anon lay, "I... I appreciate that. As agreed, Chief Kinsler, the APC and its contents are yours."
>shortly after, it was once again just only the two of them alone
>Sylvanah returned to her place at the bed side
>shifting the sheets aside she climbs into bed and once again takes anon's hand in hers
>anon remains conscious while his "wife" drifts off to sleep in his arms

>Your eyes drift down to the bag of gummy bears she was holding
>"And the candy? I thought you said you trying to eat healthier."
>She quickly throws the bag under the bed as if you might forget about them if they were out of sight

>Ya, you were totally raiding her stash under the bed the next time she wasn't looking
>You hope she has some funyuns hidden under there, you love those salty little bastards

She's a demon. Conjured up by desperate survivors using the kid's eyes as a sacrifice. The ritual fucked up and she murdered the cult. She brought the kid with her on a whim, intending to force him to serve her in a menial fashion, maybe as a cook or something. Eventually she comes to care for him, frail and weak as he is, and they become true companions.
He doesn't know who she is or that she took his eyes. It's kinda eating at her from inside.

>She definitely molests him.
>spares kid due to weird kinship regarding summoning
>drags him along roughly during her travels, feeding him scraps from her kills
>barks orders at him, forces him to do little jobs around their makeshift camps
>his blindness makes it tough, he's terrible at it
>getting annoyed, demon wolf starts teaching him how to move and carry himself, how to feel out his surroundings, how to cook and clean and mend clothing
>kid actually responds well to the hard lessons, soaks up every lesson in earnest, demon wolf is pleased
>starts relaxing around him more. She still orders him around, but now it's because she knows he can take it, and wants to get stronger
>fills her with a sense of triumph and respect
>two start growing closer
>during cold nights she tells him to ditch blankets and cuddle up to her
>It feels nice having her minion do what she wants... but there's something else?
>she doesn't really understand what she feels. A sort of aching pain and regret
>A longing?
>She can't process it. Her mind is all about strength and fighting and conquest
>But now something is nagging at a conscience she didn't know she had
>and to top it all off he's been getting a little weaker lately.. maybe he needs a new push in a new direction?
>on another such night of close contact she makes a move
>she wrestles his pants down and takes him in her mouth carefully, fighting down the urge to bite and taste blood
>perhaps this little 'reward' will let him know he's pleased his mistress
>instead it has the opposite effect
>kid grows more distant
>And the itching feeling in her head is still there
>She feels guilty
>guilty because she took something from him, and now she doesn't understand how to care for a human
>and it hurts because she DOES care for him
>dammit... he's still growing weaker and sicker
>what's wrong with him
>he's eating almost as much as she does, and the same food too
>...
>He's a human, so it's fine to feed him other humans.
>right?

>Areas with large Mustelid populations tend to have a bunch of laws concerning consent and heat
>Namely if she’s in heat and rapes a single man, it’s just community service
>If he’s not single, there’s an additional fine
>He gets a small payment for his “services” and gets told to be more careful
>There are even places where men are registered like Selective Service, and if they are single during “Heat Season” they are drafted inti brothels
>These laws are rarely enforced thanks to modern medicine that turns mustelid heat from “Will kill you if you don’t get sex” to “Sexually frustrated if you don’t get sex”
>However one season due to a shortage in one of the reagents there isn’t enough to go around
>The “Heat Blocker” meds have to be saved for those who need it most
>Anon just moved to the area
>Has barely time to unpack before he finds himself spirited away by gropey Mustelid cops to be taken to an emergency brothel

>demons finally get into the mortal world/Earth
>except it's post-apocalypse
>may as well still be trapped in hell with how everything looks and how little there is to do
>destroying things is pointless since everything is already destroyed
>no good mortal food/drink to indulge
>tormenting the surviving humans has no fun since everyday is already hell for them
>can't even turn people to sin since the mortals are more worried and preoccupied with surviving and have lost the concept of sins and such

Anthrostate gets boring fast because it's always just "modern world, but with anthros" with very minor variations. Go fantasy and scifi or even different historical settings.
>humans being the minority in an anthro kingdom
>living on a planet/space station where there are few of your kind compered to the space anthors
>humans emigrating to the new world and running into the anthro Indian tribes
>wild west era where a human moves out into new land mostly filled with anthro settlers
>being a debter shipped off to Australia to form a colony where it's filled with wild anthros instead of abbos and the usual murder wildlife
>etc

>anthro tears through your entire unit
>you're the sole survivor, surrounded by your dead friends
>she grabs you, takes you into a bombed out house and roughly fucks you
>all while still smelling of blood
>she tells you to get very used to this

I always imagined the anthrostate being set in like 1979 east germany, where west germany is /collared/.
Just because you have a narrow view of what the setting could be doesn't mean we all do.

the split nation thing might be able to work.
>massive superstate with a roughly similar anthro to human population
>numerous disasters lead to political unrest and the rise of extremist groups
>one day it all comes to a head when a collection of states declare independence from the republic and form the anthrostate
>the same happens with a human supremacist group rising up and declaring the human empire.
>3 way civil war that eventually ends in a stalemate
>the 3 sides all agree to peace, and a new cold war between them kicks off.

>A human in a lab coat is presenting the research he's done in how human laps are the most comfortable seat for anthros.
>Next to him is a board covered with anatomical references and methods for how to prevent an anthro's tail from being uncomfortable.
>At the table in front of him sits the leader of the nation and four of her trusted advisors.
>All of whom are sitting on a human.
>The scientist's audience is smiling and nodding in agreement with most of his points.
>The humans being sat on sometimes look at each other with eyes questioning how they got there.
>Eventually they shrug and get back to petting the legs of the anthro that's on them.
>The presentation was wildly successful.
>The leader gave large amounts of funding for the creation of 'human seat' jobs.
>Humans are regularly being employed as seats in workplaces.
>Some even work as seats in the home of single anthros.
>Productivity has slightly reduced, but general happiness has had a notable increase.

>anthros have little care for clothes or seeing each other naked
>humie boy starts showing more skin and they all go nuts and drooling over him

small embarrassing things when working at a job run by anthros
>if you have a name tag words like "good boy" are put on it near your name
>uniform is either loose or tight in certain places that's appealing to anthro women
>mandatory scent inspections from your boss
>also mandatory scent markings/rubbings so customer know you work there
>etc

>Broken and defiled Hao who harbors deep hatred towards human men for what they have done to her
>She takes all that frustration out on them when she gets the opportunity to do so, abusing her authority without guilty
>She enjoys seeing the eyes of human men full with fearful tears, she likes making them beg for their life
>But a certain human, Anon, is resilient and takes this punishment like a man
>Hao can't stop thinking about him, and Anon visits her frequently despite the treatment he gets from her
>Hao is confused and stressed about it, she wonders why her heart starts beating so fast when he sees him now, it brings her bad memories, but it doesn't feel bad at all
"Why do you always come back here, Anon? No reward is awaiting for you."
"Because I like you."
>Hao is left speechless
>She doesn't even beat you that day, she just kicks you away so she can process everything
>The next meetings go as if nothing had been confessed, yet Hao's behaviour starts changing slightly
>She cuddles against you when she ties you down, she holds you close when she's trying to choke you, she starts trembling when she's resting on your lap, she lovingly licks the bloody wounds she inflicts you
>You pretend you don't notice what she really wants and what kind of feelings she has for you, you don't want to stress her out more
>It's very obvious she's crushing on you and she gets jealous of other girls you approach
>She leaves marks on visible places of your body for everyone to know that you're hers
>But now she wants to be yours, too, and you will be the first man she'll willingly give herself to

>Amine Con 20XX
>Nerdy humans and Anthros alike full the halls of a once nerd free hotel
>Your days at the gym and avoiding delicious garlic bread have paid off!
>You now have the bod to cosplay as your main in Guilty Gear!
>Your sculpted abs and strong chest are on full display as you carry your briefcase around.
>As you shuffle in the crowded hallway from booth to booth you cant help but notice all the wandering paws pinching and groping you.
>You'd call them out on it if you could get a clear look past the long white wig you're wearing.
>maybe cosplaying as Venom wasn't such a good idea.

>The more respectful Anthros asked you to pose for pictures.
>Some made the expected pool cue and ball jokes.
>That gives you a chance to showcase the the contraption you built for yourself.
>Your cue is connected through the center via bungee cable so you don't have to manually take it apart and put it back together every time you need it.
>It also saves room in your briefcase for snacks and cash since this costume has no pockets.
>You make your way to the dealer room and notice a cute bear anthro holding up a free hugs sign.
>She's about your height and dressed up like a bumble bee in a crop top and mini skirt.
>You take her up on her offer and giver her a great big hug.
>She returns the hug in kind and rubs your back.
>You didn't quite think through how odd this would feel while you're effectively shirtless.
>You go to break the hug but the bear pulls you back in.
>uh oh.

>Be blinded soldier, end up lost in the woods, where eventually a woman find you and offers to lead you to her home, where she claims to be able to create an elixir that can heal any wound
>As you travel she seems incredibly careful to keep her distance from you
>You reach her home, within it is a small trickling waterfall, the source of the elixir, when you drink, the strength leaves your body and you fall to the ground.
>She tells you that your strength will return within a month, that you should be able to crawl at least, within a week
>She begins to talk about how much she's done for you thus far, how with all she's done you should be groveling at her feet
>It sounds like a joke but her tone is completely serious
>"Yes i think that's a good start" she says as she pushes, what feels almost like a paw into your face
>"Kiss" she says
>You stop wondering whether or not its a joke and, after evaluating your options, you slowly begin to comply
>Over the next week she has you use your mouth on just about every part of her body in exchange for rewards like "food", "water" and during the cold nights, "warmth", which comes in the form of her body.
>Once you're able to crawl she begins to ask far more of you, now certain parts of her body are held up as rewards for doing as she asks, and despite yourself, you find yourself wanting them more and more.
>Basically trains you to associate all good feelings with pleasing her
>By the end of the month you can shakily walk but every day the thought of escape drifts further and further from your mind
>She's begun offering one reward that you want more than anything
>"sexual release"
>When she finally decides that you've earned it, she straddles you and takes you inside her, your cock hasn't been stimulated in over a month so the feeling instantly has you groaning out loud.
>As you both approach climax, she asks you to speak *magic words* that will bind you to her forever
>You eagerly say them and live happily ever after :)

>You set up a blind date with an anthro.
>You've been chatting with her for several months
>So meeting up with her outside of town in the middle of a wheat field didn't strike you as odd.
>Okay it did, but she's worth the risk.
>After some time walking though the field, you arrive at the spot she marked.
>First date someone setup with GPS coordinates with you.
>You're way too early.
>It's a nice warm day so you lie down and enjoy the blue clear sky.
>It doesn't take long for you to fall asleep.
>You're woken up by the sounds of something huge approaching you.
>You're the first person to actually come to this odd date location and not just stand her up instead.
>She's VERY happy about that.
>Or maybe it's the morning wood in your pants that makes her drool out of two holes.

dumb little idea
>covid happens, but anthros are immune
>humans forced to stay inside for their safety
>new services start popping up that's basically anthros offering to keep lonely humies company and help with getting them things from the store
>more extreme cases of human guys asking for anthro roommates
>lucky anthro girls already have a humie roommate or BF with them
>now he's always at home waiting for her/the others to come back
>keeps the place clean since he has nothing else to do
>maybe taking up cooking
>lounging around the place in a loose shirt and boxers after some time since he no longer cares if the anthros see him vulnerable like that
>doesn't even fight or complain about the cuddles and skinship from the anthros anymore since it's all the contact he gets now
>etc

>Most colonization efforts which used recently married couples to establish populations
>The settlers sent to the Lupercal Frontier were entirely young men of marriageable age
>The hope is that the wolf tribes, which seem to be entirely made from a majority of female wolves and a smaller number human males
>The hopes being that the single female population will see the available husbands and self civilize
>Unfortunately from the reports that have been received many of the men granted homesteads have gone native, joining the wolf tribes instead
>Armed conflict may not be a viable option as their numbers grow and they adopt the armaments and territory of the colony
>The best hope may be that we establish ourselves as a trading partner and ally

>Oh trust me, it's quite nice. Why don't you feel for yourself?
>"Why, don't mind if I do~" her friend will purr with a smug incantation, as she moves to feel you up like cheap boy candy
>you squeeze your owner's arm as your taint is felt and explored in surprising detail, you can feel yourself getting ashamedly hard in her grasp
>"My, you're right, he IS quite the toy~!" The friend will excitedly remark after her "full inspection." "You'll have to let me borrow him sometime, yes?"

You crawl up to one of the dead caravaners to dig through their backpack and you realize it only has shit like bars of metal and copper sheets in it.

Playing dead which they dig through everyone’s stuff until a giant veteran bone dog kicks you over and the dessert sun mixed with the pain forces you to open your eyes.

do different species have different porn scenarios?

I could see each having a favored scenario
>wolves love the whole red ridding hood play
>aquatic species liking sex in the water or scenarios around being water
>spotted hyenas have taste for smaller guys
>sheep pornos always have someone being shaved/sheared in them
>rats having the dominant one groom the other
>etc
Speaking of spotted hyena pornos, the type of guy they'd like would be rather different look wise to the typical male porn actor. Imagine how funny it'd be to see a human guy who does hyena pornos at like a porn convention and such. Even the stereotypical porno names would differ in hilarious ways.

>Bear porn often involves scenarios where a humie burglar "accidently" wakes up a bear from her hibernation and snu snus the humie as compensation

>Raccoons love to ambush humies that wander too close to dumpsters and pop out, snatching their new dumpster mate
>Elephants love getting frisky in water parks and putting their trunks in their humies (swimming) trunks
>Cats enjoy sitting in trees waiting for the perfect moment to pounce on an unsuspecting pedestrian, halfway because they're horny and halfway because they're too scared to get down on their own

>be the 90s, late at night
>live way off in the countryside, displaced from a few other houses by mountainous treeline, a few hundred meters between each
>murder mysteries playing on the TV nonstop, you're just trying to enjoy your Friday night with a good book, cozied up by the window
>suddenly, the phone rings, which you disturb your peaceful position to answer
>"Hello?"
>hear something you can only describe as "hurried" over the line
>and... the sound of something wet?
>as the realization settles none-too-subtly, you call whoever was clearly very busy on the other end a pervert and quickly hang up
>you wanted to *69, but felt like leaving it alone
>you were armed after all, what did you have to worry about?

we need more anthro religions taking interesting liberties regarding humans
>fantasy/scifi setting where anthros view human males as their property
>like the human god(s) were too weak and submitted to the anthro god(s) in order to get safety and protection for humanity
>which is why human males have so many features that seem designed to pleasure anthros
>while also being much more defenseless with weak night vision, no claws, tiny fangs, no fur, etc

Actual ADHG nightmare I had
Stupid dream logic ahead
>Dream starts with something unrelated to the thread.

>There's some faint daylight coming from the stairs going upwards.
>I wait a little longer for Hao's footsteps to get quieter
>The moment I step out of the elevator, I can hear her running up the stairs.
>I rush up the stairs to escape
>She's getting closer
>Hit the end of the staircase and find myself on the roof of the building.
>There's someone else on the roof
>Oh wow, it's (furboi from another ADHG story)!
>He's on a smoking break, so all I get is a brief glimpse in my direction before he turns away again.
>The building is in the middle of nowhere, huge green fields surrounding it.
>It's also really tall.
>Hao has made it to the rooftop by now.
>Now I have two options
>Surrender and let her do whatever depraved shit I read about here to me.
>Or just jump down.
>Without thinking about it again I sprint to the edge and jump.
>Dreams ends as I hit the ground.

>Not anthrostate
>Meet with waifur in secret
>She loves you, but the approval of her parents is still very important to her.
>They're traditionalists and very much against cross species relationships.
>One time while you were over at her house, they came for a surprise visit.
>Luckily you both were still in office clothing and were able to convince them you just came over to discuss a work project.
>This further pushes her into making your relationship even more secret.

>You're too scared to tell her to stop.
>Yet you still enjoy getting pounded into the mattress.
>As you're both getting close she pulls up into a hug.
>Or so you thought.
>Her maw opens wide and she lunges towards your shoulder
>Her sharp teeth dig deep into your flesh.
>She's downright growling now.
>Both of your orgsams hit both of you, yet she still remains in this position.
>After a few more minutes she pulls her teeth out of your flesh.
>You want her to explain herself.
>Instead she pulls you into an actual hug and swiftly falls asleep with you in her arms.
>As soon as your adrenaline wears off, the exhaustion puts you to sleep.
>The next day you're still in her embrace.
>She wakes up not much after you.
>Just from your strained expression she can tell you're wondering what exactly happened last night.
>She explains it's some genetic quirk in her species.
>It only happens when they want someone to be their partner for life.
>Oh shit, did she just propose to you?
>No she didn't.
>Or did she?
>She isn't sure herself as this hasn't happened to her before.
>Definitely loves you still.
>Over the next few months she wants you to visit a lot more often now.

>She leans closer and audibly sniffs you.
>You took a lengthy shower before went out
>However you neglected to do anything about your waifurs scent on your clothing.
>Her mother questions why you have her scent on your casual clothing.
>The grip she has on your shoulder tightens and you wince in pain.
>Your reaction shocks her.
>She knows how strong she is, she didn't squeeze you hard enough to elicit such a strong reaction.
>One of her claws moves towards the collar of your shirt.
>Without hesitation she rip parts of your shirt open.
>She gasps and takes a step back shutting her snout with her paws.
>The scars of the claiming bite are in full display.
>As it turns out the importance of the tradition to remain within their own species pales in comparison to the one of the claiming bite.
>What happened in that one night, happens only once in their species lives.
>To ensure the happiness of their daughter you're essentially forced to marry her.
>It's all very sudden for you, but you truthfully are very happy to spend the rest of your life with her.

>"Nope, instant turn-off," you mock your Bond villain-esque captor
>the iron links of your midieval bonds clatter against the 19th Century heater to which you're chained as your bare form heaves against it in laughter
>Your captor's wicked grin edges to the cloud-like poofs of her ears as the poodle rises from her bath
>Hot, lavender-scented water cascades down around her from well-rounded shoulders, like a satin curtain flowing elegantly around the matronly flare of her hips
>Lifting each impossibly-plush thigh out of the rosy liquid with the practiced flourishes of a lifetime in ballet and operatic theater, she shimmies her body to shake the water out of her fur in a very doglike manner, briefly lifting her arms up to her chest to restrain her endowments, lest they flop around like a fisherman's quarry in the bottom of a net
>You kneel in your torn denims, unable to peel your eyes away from the approaching Venusian goddess, to which she raises her nose in mock witness to your unintended gesture of deference
>Not that you wanted to give the bitch any satisfaction, it just really was all you could do to conceal the painfully constrained stiffy presently betraying you both to your archnemesis
>Her seven-foot tall frame towers over you as she cocks her snout at you as though she were appraising a cut of meat at a butchery shop's countertop display
>"What're ya' gonna do, bitch? Kill me?" you spit defiantly at her rose-painted toe claws
>She just tuts and shakes her head before lowering herself down to your level, her visage shifting from cold indifference to a mockery of motherly sympathy and bemusement
>"You poor, sad thing," she cooed in a Mid-Atlantic accent, deftly gripping and digging her nails into your jaw, only a head-jerky protest away from breaking skin
>Her grip was vice-like, fuck...
>"So lost, so afraid," her cadence hung onto that last word as her lips curled into a wolf-like sneer
>"Mommy's gonna take care of you now."

>Anon wants a slave just because it's cheaper than a maid.
>He goes to the market and is shocked by all the broken spirits he finds there.

There's an older concept for saurians that I could trot out.
It's not dino/human vore, but it's something that might be a little controversial for the thread.
The basic idea is that carnivorous saurians have certain predatory urges.
It's stronger for some than others, but most if not all carnivorous saurians prefer their meat as raw as possible.
Thusly, certain businesses and organizations make it possible for these saurians to satisfy those urges.
Hunting preserves and "meat farms" where the saurian patrons are allowed to kill and eat their meat personally are the typical outlet.
It cannot be overstated that humans and other saurians are strictly off the menu.

what if a human got into one of those hunting grounds by accident?

Well, other than seeing some things that most people wouldn't want to see and getting a stern talking and possibly a fine for trespassing, not much.
As was said, humans are illegal to consume as that would be murder and a little too close to cannibalism.
Bein invited to a farm or preserve is a different story.
The human in question is still off the menu, but you can be a saurians plus one if they invite you along for whatever reason.

>accompany your raptor gf to the local hunting grounds to work out some post-rut stress
>she swears she gets nothing from it, but when the bi-yearly need hits, it's all she can think of to get her mind off of clutching
>tells me it's okay if I stay at the hotel, but I'm welcome to try to keep up
>opt to go to be supportive
>after stripping down to just a spaghetti-string thong, she releases a shrill, avian cry into the night sky before vanishing off into inky dark of the artificially tropicalized forest
>can hear running and distant cries
>oh lord, we're not alone out here?!
>primal fear grips my spirit, right down to every fiber of my being
>something inside tells me to flee—that I'M the prey out here
>but I know better
>she knows better
>we both know better
>d-don't we?
>I reflexively clutch the folding knife in my left pocket
>I know better
>She wasn't even sure about me coming, she was worried about me getting lost or even just being uncomfortable
>This was a side of her I'd never seen, and I felt in my heart it was right
>And I know better
>but...
>I fled, tripping over shrubbery and loose stones as another blood-curdling shriek pierced my eardrums

reminds me of an old idea I had
>a big nature preserve is bought and turned into a lewd sort of vacation spot
>little is actually changed except a fence around the area for safety
>basically a big area of nature where anthros can indulge in their animal side and humans can have a rather different nature experience
>have to sign a form when you pay for a trip inside
>basic stuff like the owners not being liable for injury or loss/damage of property you bring in
>some slight difference in forms between anthros and humans
>anthros aren't allowed to seriously injure other anthros or humans, but light scratches and bites are ok
>human's forms basically say by signing the papers and entering the reserve they're consenting to sexual advances by anthros even forcible ones
>also making sure they're aware any clothes they wear in may be ripped off them by anthros
>luckily the place has a bunch of lockers for people to store their stuff before entering or making sure they have a fresh pair of clothes to change into afterwards
>basically can buy different passes that vary by how long you want to stay
>they lock on a bracelet that tracks your location and has a built in clock/timer to let you know how long you have left
>basically an elaborate sex club for anthros to chase humans around in the wild and for humans to let anthros do as they please to them
>also some fun role playing for some anthro species with other anthros and humans
>even open at night for nocturnal species and humans looking to have a spookier time
>cameras are all over to make sure no one gets a bad injury and also so videos can be sold to people
>the place also does special deals or themes during holidays or times where certain species get in cheaper and humans wearing certain outfits
>a popular one being based around red riding hood where wolves and humans wearing red cloaks/hoodies get in cheaper
>also hosts games/competitions with prizes ranging from cash, free passes, physical goods, etc

goofy little idea regarding some fantasy style classes that get their spells/power from another more entity like clerics, summoners, warlocks, etc
>be a cleric of a goddess whos form is similar to anthros or it's the most common guise she takes
>won't let you use your powers unless you refer to her as "mommy" or such embarrassing terms
>will make you offer "tribute" to her forms of pleasuring yourself in front of one of her alters/statues/etc
>sometimes dictates uniform changes or no powers either that are mostly just lewd outfits that pleases her
>can take corporeal forms in special instances or places of power/influence so she can personally fuck you
>or does it through avatars of hers that are anthros that match forms she takes
>warlocks have a similar issues, but since they're demons the perversion is even greater
>summoners have it worse on another level
>since they're physically calling in spirits/demons/beasts/monsters/etc the summoner can be interacted with much often and quicker
>the summons putting prices on being summoned
>won't do anything until they get a kiss
>which aren't always on the face
>referring to them with certain titles that embarrass you
>pre payment in the form of being viciously fucked before they will even answer future summons

>It was Valentine's day and you were planning on finally asking out that cute girl you had a crush on.
>There was one big issue with your plan:
>You didn't know where she lived.
>So you had to ask around, no one but no one knew where she lived except Kathrine.
>She could only barely be considered a friend as she was a complete jackass, both literally and metaphorically.
>You got all dressed up, got a box of fancy 'chocolates' that were safe for anthros, and got some flowers that the florist said that anthros commonly liked.
>Driving over to the address Kathrine gave you.
>Your trust in the accuracy of her information was lacking at best, but you didn't have anything else.
>Getting out of your car, the first thing you noticed was how large the house was.
>The second thing was how daunting the staircase up to the porch was. It was at least 20 steps.
>As you neared the top of the staircase, you abruptly learned that the top step was higher than the rest.
>The flowers went off to the side and the box flew forward as you tripped.
>You laid sprawled out on the porch for a moment as the front door opened, the owner likely hearing your approach or fall.
>Fire arose in your cheeks as you looked up at a very naked wolf looking down at the well dressed stranger on her porch with a perplexed expression.
>You tried and failed to speak, she wasn't who you were looking for.
>The wolfess looked around and started to piece together why you were there.
"Did Alice put you up to this? Dammit, I told her how much I hated Valentine's day and she goes and does this..."
>You can do nothing but gape at her as she trailed off to a mutter.
>She bends down and grabs the box of 'chocolates' before offering you a hand up.
"Holy shit, I've seen these before at the store, just this box alone was sixty dollars..."
>You accept her weak grip and get to your feet, you go over and grab the flowers as well.
"Well, you might as well come inside."
>You feel like an imposter in a way, you've accidentally shown up at the home of a lonely wolf and have been accused of being sent as a date.
>She grabs you by the shoulder and leads you into her living room.
>As you take a seat you start,
"Sorry, I am- I don't know an Alice. I mean, I wasn't sent by Alice."
>She looks at you with exasperation.
"So she didn't send you, and you just happened to walk up with a bundle of my favorite flowers and wearing my favorite cologne?"
>You just picked what was generally liked, you didn't even put on cologne.
"Yes...?"
"Alright, sure."
>She makes no attempt to hide her disbelief.
"I'm going to go grab some wine and glasses."
>You fidget on the couch, you kinda feel bad for her.
>Sure she wasn't who were planning on taking out for a date, but it's not like you're in a relationship so you're not breaking any commitments.
>She comes back with a fancy bottle of wine and two nice wine glasses, attached to the bottle is a note.
>You can't really make out anything aside from the name 'Alice' on it.
>The glasses fill with the scarlet fluid and she offers you a glass.
>You try to be as classy as you can, but it's difficult.
>Not having had alcohol before means that you are not used to the taste of alcohol.
>Thankfully, she seems more amused by your expression than anything else.
>It took a bit but you finished the glass, long after she'd finished but you eventually finished.
>She took your glass and refilled both it and her own.
>You started talking with her between sips.
>The previous awkwardness you held faded away as you drank.
>Her suspicion started to fade as she nursed her drink.
>Your stutter left you and the conversation between you two flowed nice and smoothly.
>The topics drifted from movies, to music, to food.
>To your surprise, you had quite a few things in common.
>It wasn't until the topic of sex came up that you respilled your spaghetti.
>Your blushing only emboldened her intoxicated tongue.
>She starts rubbing up against you as you attempt, and fail, to recompose yourself.
>Her touches becomes outright fondling as you remain a blushing mess.
>It takes some effort, but you manage to babble out a suggestion about going to her bedroom.
>She responds by picking you up in a bridal carry.
>Your foggy mind decides that trying to kiss her is a good idea, it takes you some effort but you get your lips to touch the tip of her muzzle.
>Your mouth is soon filled with her tongue as she parts her muzzle to stuff more inside.
>She tastes of earth and the wine.
>Getting up the stairs is difficult for her, between the alcohol, carrying you, and her cramming her tongue into you, but she manages.
>You open her bedroom door for her so she doesn't have to kick it down.
>Landing on the bed, you bounce towards the headboard. She's crawling onto the bed after having tossed you.
>Frantically, you start trying to undress.
>She pauses and tries to strip, but gives up and just uses her claws to shred them off. Good thing they looked cheap...
>By the time she's done ripping everything off herself, you've pulled down your pants and opened your shirt.
>You whip out a condom, but she bats it from your hand.
"I'm not in heat, get that away."
>She starts by sinking her nose into your crotch and huffing, before sliding forward to drag her tongue up your naked chest.
>When her tongue reaches your face, she looks down at your shaft where she's dripping onto it.
>One of your hands goes to lift up and one of her paws goes to guide it in.
>She pauses once your head slots in and she looks back at you, soon after you receive a kiss followed by a lot of tongue.
>Her parted lower lips kiss your base shortly after that.
>Her thighs rest to the sides of your torso as she sits impaled atop you.
>Despite her initial aggression, she's being slower with her tongue and her paws are roaming along your sides under your shirt.
>Your hands move to wander in much the same way.
>After her short pause, she begins lifting her hips again and bringing them down.
>She starts to speed up and her claws start lightly scraping at your skin.
>Her movements keep speeding up and her wetness drenches you, her hips slam down onto you with the springiness of the mattress being the only thing preventing bruising.
>Eventually, she stops and her walls work to milk you and another wave of wetness drenches your groin and the cloth under you.
>Once her spasms end, she gives a couple more drops to get you to unload into her.
>A minute after your twitching ends, she starts moving again, perhaps even faster than before.
>Instinctively, you try and push her off, but all you do is get her to grab your hands in her paws and pin them above your head.
>Her tongue goes from simply filling your mouth to working its way into your throat.
>You attempt to thrust back and the best you can do is maybe raise your hips a little off the mattress before she slams down.
>Between the pinning, the aggressive pounding, and the lack of air, you feel your seed burst forth into her.
>To your fortune, her own orgasm comes a few pounds later.
>She lazily pulls her tongue from your throat, you cough a bit at the treatment of your throat.
>Her paws pull you close and she rolls onto her back with your face between her breasts and resting on her chest fluff.
>You move to pull out and lay beside her, but her legs arc up and lock behind your hip so you're buried in her.
>Sleep comes easily to your tired body.
>You awake with a headache and buried in tits.
>A desire to get off of her rises, but is halted by you deciding to nuzzle into her fluff instead.
>Maybe you'll come back here again, you meshed well with her.

>You will never be courted and successfully seduced by a bnuuy of Amazonian stature
>You will never marvel at how her soft fur and kind, dorky disposition contrast with her absurd physical strength and desire to protect you
>She will never outdo even the most absurdly proportioned shortstacks and casually crush bricks between her thighs to turn you on
>She will never agree to use protection if you want, because she wants a well-planned family with you someday and isn’t using you as a baby factory
How hard would this make tiny buncels seethe?

>You will grow the garden
>You will expand the garden
>You will breathe in the spores
>You will breathe in the pollen
>You will be vegan
>You will give yourself to The Green
>You will be fertilizer for her when you're done pollinating
>You will be happy

>You date buncel for a bit in high school.
>Absolute creep. Unhygienic, racist, and prone to self pity parties when she's not raging at you for no reason.
>Years later you return to your home town, and who do you meet but her.
>She hasn't physically grown, but she's clearly way better than before.
>Turns out she was bipolar the entire time. She's on medications now and couldn't be happier. Has a stable job and everything.
>Wants another chance. Just one date, no pressure she says!
>Do you take the risk? Can people REALLY change?

>imagine hearing their loud bellowing moos when ever a humie boy walks by
>cat calls of "look at those lips made for sucking"
>"want some fresh milk"
>"bet those hands would feel great tugging my udders"
>"I'll give you a free milk bath"
>and such

>Be sitting in your high schools lunch room
>Eating your government issue pizza square and drinking your carton of milk
>After downing your food and drink you turn to talk to one of your friends
>When you turn back you can't help but notice your milk carton seems to have a little more milk in in that you thought
>Huh, weird
>Drink it then go back to talking to your friend
>You turn back and, yep, your milk carton is magically no longer empty and some anthro girls farther down the table are doing a poor job of hiding their giggles
>Only now do you notice that there's one holstein cow among the group
>She's casually looking the other way and doing something on her phone
>Odd
>After leaving the lunchroom a buddy of your runs up to you and shoves his phone in your face
>Apparently there's some hot new prank video making the rounds on bawktock
>Something about an anthro tricking a humie into drinking their milk...

>Be married to an anthro
>Wife is a wolf
>Wife has a cookie
>Makes you lick, suck, kiss and eat that cookie almost everytime you guys have sex
>She proceeds to slam down on your pelvis after your done munching on the cookie
>Cuddle with your wife afterwards
>You love your wife
>And your wife loves you

>waifur aggressively rides your face every night
>once she's done she gives one final wiggle in your face, rolls over, pulls you into a hug and falls asleep
>leaving you to bury your face in her fur and jerk off

>You and your wolfur sit on the ground leaning against a wall, her arms hugging you tightly against her chest
>"SORRY-SORRY-SORRY-SORRY" She repeats, her words sometimes devolving into anguished sobs
>Her apologies do little to dull the pain coming from the left side of your face
>Aside from the pain there was also a warmth trickling down your neck, it must still be bleeding
>When she's run out of different ways to say sorry she loosens the hug to talk to you face to face
>The fur around her eyes is soaked with tears, and she visibly cringes when her eyes briefly glance towards your cheek
>"Anon, I didn't mean to do it, you have to believe me!" She loudly implores. "It's just-I-we're-we're a mated pair anon. Bonded for life. You know how much that matters to me, right?"
>You gently shake your head in an affirmative
>She's suddenly devoid of remorse, her teeth bared and words almost snarled
>"Then you know how I must have felt when you came home smelling like some other woman. The scent of some foreign canine on your skin, her blond fur on your shirt, and you tried to act like nothing was wrong!"
>But then her ears droop and eyes moisten with new tears
>"I should have believed you when you said your shirt got torn at work and a friend offered you a spare. I should have believed you."
>Her voice cracks
>"B-but I was just so mad Anon. We were made for each other, you and me. And it seemed like you had betrayed my trust mere days after proposing. I can't even bear to think of you being unfaithful. I know I can't find someone else like you out there and I got scared. So scared of losing you. Then I got angry at the thought that I had already lost you to some other bitch and-and-and...damn my temper."
>She slowly moves her muzzle against your cheek and licks your wounds
>You're not sure if it helps
>She stops the licking and moves away from your head
>"Anon?" She softly says
>"What?"
>"Don't let anyone else know about this. Please. I don't want anyone to think that I've gone rabid or something. All wolves have protective instincts but we aren't supposed to hurt our mates like this. You know how much I love you Anon. It's just I let my emotions get the better of me and took it out on you. But I didn't mean to, it was a mistake, you have to believe me Anon. Please"
>Once again she hugs you tightly and cries into your shoulder
>While she cries her eyes out you bring an arm up and gently rub her muscular back
>It seems to help her recover from the crying fit
>She looks at you with her bright hazel eyes, they seem to be filled with a determination you haven't seen in a long time
>"Anon, I love you, and I can only love you. We both forfeited our right to anyone else the second I claimed you as mine. You're going to father my pups, help me raise them, and when our days are done the first one to go will wait for the other in paradise. That's how it's going to go. Do you get me?"
>You shake your head and she raises her voice, sharp canine teeth bared and glistening
>"Good. Because I WILL NOT have you stolen away by some skanky cock breathed fur slut. I don't care if I have to make you see that I'm the only one. I'll scent mark you, give you a claiming bite, record the conceiving of our first litter and post it on the internet so the whole world will know it ME that claimed YOU. I'll escort you to and from work, growl at any sluts that look at you, I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll."
>She stutters then falls silent, words failing her
>In this delicate moment you bring a hand up and stroke her furry muzzle
>She closes her eyes and leans into your hand in response
>"Honey, sometimes I think you love me too much." You whisper
>She opens her eyes
>"No, I think I don't love you enough."

I want a group of tribal matriarchal bovine women to come into my village and take me as a bedwarmer!

>you get abducted back to their village
>you realize you're the only human there
>it's your job to pleasure the entire tribe
>whatever time you have not being mating-pressed they make you spend grooming their hooves, horns, and hair

>The first several days after being captured are one big blur
>You're passed from hut to hut for horned ladies to demand services from you
>Sometimes they want sexual relief, sometimes they want you to bathe their bodies, sometimes they just want someone to hold as they sleep
>At this point most of your caloric intake now comes from an engorged nipple
>One day get told to polish and clean the hooves of the chieftess
>You drag your haggard body to her quarters to be met with the big lady sitting on her throne
>Well you think it was supposed to be a throne, it seemed more like a slightly taller than normal chair with some embellishments carved onto it
>After getting on your knees in front of her you get to work
>The entire time she just stares down at you with a slight frown, her horns glinting in the light from a nearby fire
>It takes a lot of elbow grease but you eventually get them to a mirror sheen
>She raises a hoof and moves it around in front of her
>She gives a satisfied huff and stands up, walking past you to the outside
>You scurry to the entrance of her hut and sit beside it, you've long since learned that these tribeswomen expect you to wait at the entrance for them when they've left
>Surprisingly she enters no more than a few minutes later
>She struts past you and sits in the throne, looking to you expectedly
>Your gaze lowers to her hooves and they're covered in wet dripping mud
>Fuck
>Well it's not like you have anything better to do
>While cleaning her hooves another cow anthro enters the tent and says something that sounds like a question
>The chieftess barks something back and the guest leaves in a hurry
>The chieftess continues giving you busy work through the next several days, by now you're almost always in her hut, only occasionally getting sent to other tribewomen as favors, from what you can tell anyway

Random musings about mustelid waifurs based upon their IRL counterparts

>Acts all flustered if this is pointed out
>Likes to pinch small items of yours when you're not paying attention and add them to a little collection she keeps at home
>This extends to underwear if she visits your place; she probably tries to sniff them when enjoying some "private time"
>For those who like bites, a weasel might give you a claiming bite during sex
>Always trying to get you to dance with her whenever she's very happy or excited (or even teach you how to dance with plenty of hands-on contact)
>Sea otters letting you lie on them when you go swimming, possibly with a handjob on the cards
>Besides the spectacular increase in horniness in even the shyest mustelid, they might also get rather protective (or possessive) if another lady tries to make a move on you

>There's a mosquito in your room!
>You made sure that it couldn't have gotten in!
>Every window is closed and locked shut, the door is barricaded, and you've done several laps around the house to ensure everything was shut.
>But there's that damn buzz again.
>It ceases with a heavy weight landing upon your bed.
>You simply grit your teeth and pretend to be asleep.
>The last time you tried to grab her, she managed to it dodge and hide.
>You didn't have a good night of sleep that night.
>Your room is tiny, where did she even hide?
>Who the hell decided that genetically modifying mosquitos to be near human size and have tits was a good idea?!
>With some soft pulls, she pulls your thin blanket away, exposing you to the warm air.
>Your boxers are pulled from your frame soon after.
>Her weight comes down upon your legs with her breasts near your dick.
>It doesn't take her much touching and fondling to get you hard.
>Then comes her proboscis to slither down into your dick.
>No matter how many nights she's done this, it hasn't felt less weird.
>She's at least good at what she does.
>Two of her hands move grasp her breasts and give you a titfuck as another goes to play with your balls.
>The last hand sends a single, nimble digit up your rear to press on your prostate.
>All of that only slightly distracts you from the suction you feel beneath the base of your cock.
>You haven't even cum yet and still you feel bulges in her proboscis as she sucks.
>With practiced efficiency, she gets you off and each of your throbs sends another bulge up her proboscis.
>Once your spasms cease, her hands pull away but she still keeps her proboscis down your shaft for a little bit to get every last drop.
>After she's gotten everything she wanted, she pulls the covers back over you and flies off with that annoying hum.
>Being so drained makes you ache throughout the day.
>But hey, it could be worse.

Imagine in a world/setting where anthros exist and you have human women with a fetish for human guys being viciously fucked by them or making content about that
>fantasy setting where some noble woman has her beastkin female slaves/pets/servants fuck her human guy servents or finds some homeless boy and offers him money to be snu snu by a beast woman while she watches

>It practically becomes an X rated reality show with how much time is spent on family drama and narrated mating scenes

nature documentary with "wild/feral" anthros is still a fun idea and more so with using interns as bait/lures for horny animal women

>making a nervous intern walk down naked to a river bank because it has croc women in it laying in wait

>a cursed kiss
>she retreats quickly from the duel and her army following soon after
>the abbey and his men treat this as a victory, but anon feels somewhat disappointed
>not long after his duel with the witch he finds the thought of her worming its way into his mind
>he tries to ignore these intrusive thoughts but they just seem to keep coming more frequently
>soon his own dreams are being invaded by her
>each night he is plagued with scenes of the dragon witch performing lecherous acts on him
>in response anon begins pushing himself harder and harder in battle, giving himself little time for rest
>in his exhausted state the curse reaches its peak

>following her voice, anon makes his way to the witch's castle
>awaiting him on her throne the dragoness beckons him forth
>"You held out much longer than anticipated, champion.
>Come now, off to our bedroom. Taking you in our dreams is well and good, but now I crave the real thing. Don't you?"
>anon can only nod his head and follow his corrupting mistress, sealing the fate of his kingdom with it

speaking of paladins and such
>evil/lusty anthros learn of a paladins
>except their take on them is a bit different
>bunch of males walking around throwing themselves into dangerous situations and wander about
>so basically easy picking and they more or less come straight to the anthros
>full older boys and young men either due to taking in those without a place or haughty high born with hero complexes
>they take vows of chastity
>which means to the anthros they get to pop the cherries of the ones they beat/capture
>showing them all the bestial pleasures they can inflict on them that those boys never experienced

lewd cute idea
>have a special item you hold or wear that signals you're up to being ravaged
>could be a pillow with "yes" on it
>wearing a certain shirt, necklaces, boxers, etc
>basically asking for it without needing to say a thing
>but also opens you up for massive teasing since it's up to her when and wear she pounces
>letting you get more pent up, anxious, and needy the longer she waits
>until she finally takes you and has you moaning her name

>Anons from a really well off family but is a useless mental case.
>almost 20 and just got out of involuntary phyc hold.
>He’s desperate to convince his family he is same now and their desperate to forget he ever existed.
>His family decides to let him live in one of the properties they own that’s on the beach in Florida while he recovers.
>It’s right on the beach. There are hundreds of houses lined right up on the sand but no one is ever around.
>The place is practically empty because it’s just empty rich people houses that they keep as assets that no one can afford to buy.
>Neighborhood with tons of million dollar houses but he never sees any cars and maybe one person jogs pass his place a week.
>He is left in isolation just sort of rotting while working on a novel or something.
>He constantly feels like he’s being watched, having visual/ auditory hallucinations.
>Anon is trying really hard to convince his family he isn’t crazy anymore.
>Go on a beach walk until he get to see the sun rise every night.
>Two nights in a row he walks past a black figure walking parallel to him.
>Kinda odd since he never sees anyone else in the neighborhood, much less at the beach, much less at the beach at 4 am.
>Next night he realizes the person is following him from way behind.
>Super paranoid.
>Every night the stalker gets closer but always disappear before the sun rises.
>At the times when he’s home he double checks his doors locks all throughout the day and keeps his blinds shut.
>One night he changes directions and it still happens, it’s really fucking with his head.
>He decides to walk the street one night to get a finally take a walk where he dosnt feel like he’s being followed. While at a street lamp he realizes that the figure is running down the sidewalk toward him. He gets chased through the suburbs. By the time they get close enough for him to have a glimpse at their inhuman form they disappear.
>He comes home by 7am. He’s physically and mentally exhausted. He’s just to tired to be afraid anymore.
>He walks into the kitchen ready to start drinking and their already sitting there with a bottle out.
>Anon just sort of excepts it and they sit down to drink together.
>She’s a windigo from some place like Montana that decided to move to Florida on a sort of permanent vacation.(not retirement she still stalks and eats people)
>She enjoys the freedom of being able to just walk around in her natural form since the place is so barren, except for the new meat the decided to trespass on her favorite fishing spot.
>The hunt was on. She would stalk him for miles down the beach waiting for the perfect time to pounce. She started off being really cautious, following from afar slowly picking up pace all while in the shadows. She realized that Anon is an oblivious idiot and she could walk right up to him and him not notice. Instead of killing him she made it into a game by seeing how close she could get to him before he could notice. She eventually moved on to breaking into his house while he was there and staying in the same room as him while he was sleeping.
>she wears Hawaiian shirts and drinks piña Coladas
>Anon is really good at making piña coladas
>they start going on the walks together and doing stuff like watching movies.
>he can’t say anything because he is trying to convince people he’s sane now so he can’t go off about the giant beach bum demon that’s molesting him.
>also they have pretty similar life styles and really enjoy not being so alone.
>anons like a deranged little depressive schizo guy that’s really empathetic
>windigo lady that is loving but is selfish and wants anon to do whatever she wants so she is kinda abusive. She just wants to have fun like drunk surfing at midnight and breaking into peoples empty house to mastubate in their beds. She feels like she’s never been around someone that appreciates her company so she is really self conscious about the idea of anon ever leaving her. She try’s to get him to self isolate even more through manipulating him so that he is only ever with her.
Ideas for story stuff
>Maybe she gets into conflict with his therapist that’s (a human woman/ another windigo/ other cryptid)
>Anon has to train windigo ladies pretending to be a human skills enough for him to introduce her to his family. Maybe she introduces him to her family?
>Anons releases his book and it sells like 4 copies.
>Anon gets a flirty neighbor
Anons sister visits to see if he’s still alive and finds out about everything and is oddly just sort of okay with it and is just glad anon found someone/ something and becomes friends with windigo lady
>Windigo lady finds massive ship week under water or something idk
>She decides to fuck anon inside someone’s house then a grounds keeper shows up and they have to escape.
>Cops suspect that Anon is a serial killer because the windigo keeps making people in the area disappear so she has to kill a lawyer, take the lawyers form then represent him in court
>She invites a bunch of her friends over to eat dinner Anon cooked. Her friends are like deep ones, ocean ghost ladies, another windigo, sirens, tentacles, and anons sister makes a second appearance.
>They find a boat
>They run out of alcohol
>They get a lot of alcohol
>Windigo lady gets sick and windigos get really fucking weird when they get a windigo cold
>It snows in Florida???
>Anon realizes she’s actually Cuban and just happened to live in Montana before moving to Florida
>They both go to the movie theater to see morbius and because the theaters so empty they have play hide and fuck in the empty building.
>She makes anon think she can turn him into a windigo like a vampire and they spend the entire chapter preparing for anons transformation just for her to reveal it was prank.
>She decides to actually become a real lawyer and get a law degree online.
>There’s a hurricane! They bother hunker down for the stormy night in the downstairs walk in closet.
>Another hurricane where the power goes out. She disappears half way through the night so he walks around the big house only illuminated by the candle he’s carrying and the lighting while she plays hide and rape.
>She uses her shape shifting abilities so anon and her can walk around the neighborhood pretending to be cops.
>She pretends to be anon and goes to his therapy for him
>They both stop being mooching pieces of shit and get jobs at a publix
>They both get sober and they start to hate each other so they start drinking again
>Halloween

>wake up in your suspiciously hot room
>drenched in sweat you reach over and check your phone
>From Sis: "Hey! I'm going to band camp this summer! I'm leaving Dalia with you, Mom said it was okay!"
>"P.S It's mating season so if she wants to go for a run, GO WITH HER!"
>putting down your blinding phone screen, you suddenly notice the giant hyperventilating tiger
>for some reason, you don't think she'll want to go outside any time soon.

General idea is that Anon is failing a class, I was thinking about something difficult like calculus.
He remembers the standard porn trope of fucking the teacher for better grades and attempts it by asking for 'private tutoring' in 'sexy' clothing.
So a red hoodie, ripped tiger print jeans, and a choker.
She agrees and gives her address to him, but he arrives she starts doing actual tutoring.
The teacher ignores his attempts to seduce until he fails the finals.
She makes some proposal about trying to improve his ability to learn over the summer if he'll retake her class.
The idea she has is to give him a 'learning fetish'.
For the ending, she's successful and he goes from a D student taking low level classes to Honors A student who studies particle physics to masturbate.
Once he's graduated, then she calls him over to her house to reward him for his grand improvement.

>the bunny pressed against your back shamelessly gropes you
>inside your thighs, cupping your balls, teasing your cock
>all the while schlicking with her other paw
>you're so desensitized to her constant molestation that you've let her go way too far
>you groan and lean against the door of the elevator
>"P-please" you gasp "what if someone sees?"
>the bunny doesn't answer, just panting faster as she starts to stroke your shaft
>she thrusts her hips against you
>her moans amplified by the small space you're sharing
>you're fully hard, leaking pre-cum
>finally the bunny speaks up
>"I've been waiting so--haaa--long for this. I don't even work here anymore, I just come back for you. I'm gonna--"
>DING!
>the elevator stops, and the door slides open
>you and the bunny go sprawling out
>landing at the feet a very shocked looking hyena
>the bunny recovers first, squeaking out a meek apology as she jumps up and flees down the hallway
>leaving you alone with the hyena
>"Listen, I don't--" you try to come up with a good excuse "It wasn't really..."
>the hyena shushes you
>"Back in the elevator, boy. It looks like that little bunny left her job unfinished."
>you have no room to protest as the yeen lifts you by the collar to drag you back into the elevator

>a short, greasy looking rabbit girl with big glasses
>as the weeks go on you notice her sitting closer and closer to you
>you've even seen her point phone camera at you when she thinks you aren't looking
>eventually you go to sit down and find her sliding into the seat next to you
>you freeze as she leans into you, breathing creepily
>"don't make a scene, I just want to touch you"
>you want to hit her, or shout for help, but that might mean getting a bigger anthro involved
>one that might want "payment" for getting rid of this loon

>Both shoulders
>And the claw marks on his back
>Far too big to be a hyena, this must be the claiming marks of a-
>A claw taps her shoulder and she turns around, staring right into the face of a stinky wereyeen
>"Too late floppy ears!" The hunchbacked yeen bellows
>The wereyeen falls to the ground cackling
>Buncel goes back to her place and plays mariokart for the rest of the night, her dreams of proving bnnuy superiority dashed once again

>Your wife is trying to impress you with her hunting skills again.
>But after you looked in the trash can and found an empty container with a label of 'Elk heart, $35.99' you knew the truth.
>Honestly, you didn't care, but you knew she did.
>She prided herself on her old claw hunting skills, but you know that she usually uses a crossbow nowadays because her tits got too large.
>It's a sore spot for her.
>So you never brought up this 'dark' truth you had learned out of love for her.
>You were just glad that she started cooking it after you came down with food poisoning two weeks ago.
>It's rare, sometimes medium rare, but isn't that how steaks are supposed to be served?
>This isn't a steak, but it's close enough for you.
>She just looks so happy when you eat it with your hands and lick the bloody droplets off the plate.
>How could you deny her that?

>anthros taking human males as mates
>other anthros wonder why those other females would take such weak mates
>notice the human males don't go out as much and do a lot of work in their home
>seem even more fragile and useless
>then they start noticing the females with human males look unusually more groomed and nicer looking fur
>also their clothes or sacks/bags have stronger and tighter stitching
>their weapons have more intricately designed patterns cut onto them
>unusual and mouth watering smells come from their house when the human is cooking
>the females also won't shut up about how soft and nimble human tongues and fingers are and have no claws so no accidental scratches
>then those other anthros start getting ideas and the raids on human towns/villages goes up with mostly young males being taken alive

>husky/malamute GF really likes to carry you around or give piggyback rides for some reason
>then winter rolls around and get enough snow
>she's more excited than normal
>then she pulls a fucking sled out of a closet and some ropes/straps
>rips her own clothes off and makes you help put on all these weird straps on her
>then it hits you
>she wants to pull you on the sled herself
>turns out actually pretty fun and having her wiggling/bouncing ass dominate your view for most of the ride is pretty good too
>course this lasted only so long before she rushed the two of you back home where she fucks you so hard while still wearing the sled dog gear your legs temporary don't work

>medieval times
>all the guards/knights/nobility are anthros
>constantly forced to lick sweaty armored pits as a poor catnip farmer

>anthro caesars legion
>majority of the soldiers and almost all of the higher ups are anthros
>caesar is still a human

Caesar is a heifer with her horns buffered down
Lanius is a bear, ironically
Malpais is a ram
Lucius is a wolf
Vulpes is a fox
Aurelius is a phoenix
Gaius is a sphynx
I am horny

I still think caesar being a human makes the most sense as it would be more in line with how the legion was founded.
I also think it would be funny to have a legion of buff anthros led by a human guy that's half their size.

>you decide to hit up a bar one night for a couple drinks
>you sit down and notice the music over the speakers is a little loud

>Tribute? We don't raid your village, there's no need for--
>Aha, but I can tell that's not why you came here... you can't hide that embarrassment from me.

>I promise that your generosity will be rewarded in kind...

People keep complaining about stories/story quality lately, so here's two ideas I've had in the back of my mind:
Slowburn yandere/kidnapping stuff where I actually make it somewhat realistic. This would slightly lean into abusefag territory without being annoying or gory.
Wholesome story about Anon and his leopard seal girlfriend trying to make their relationship work. They live on an island and she's a commercial fisher or dockhand.
Any interest in either of these?

>buncel buys a motorcycle thinking it will make her a badass and show off to anon
>she's way too small to actually ride, falls over the moment she manages to get the kickstand up
>scrapes her knee and starts crying
>buncel has to ride bitch while anon takes it back to the dealership for her
>she uses her position to grope him whenever they're stopped

>getting hugged by anthros
>getting cuddled by anthros
>being in a loving relationship with them
>brushing their fur

>have Anthro step sister

>walking in on you showering
>walking around naked

>wake up one night while she sucks your cock
>"if you tell anybody, youre dead!"
>she proceeds to suck you off 4 more times before she leaves

>Date a husky anthro
>She is really nice and caring
>One night she sent me a image of a normal husky
>She says I have to share it in 24 hours or else she'll have fun with me

>anthro species can't interbreed like real animal species
>but humans are oddly universally compatible with all anthro species
>humanXanthro crossbreeding always results in the child/children being the same species as the anthro parent
>though there are many complications with human females trying to carry a baby/babies of a different species
>so the human males end up being the vast majority of the crossbreeding
>so this results in anthro species on the rarer side or ones in areas with few others of their species around seeking human guys to have children with

>This is some Mr. Burns shit
>You make your way towards your boss at the opposite end of the room
>As you do, you begin to make out a very familiar melody

>Oh shit.

I have a sci fi setting where humans set out to colonise the galaxy but the ship got lost and anthros found it centuries later
Now anthros didn't really understand why there was a large freezer of fertile apes floating around and they misinterpreted the ships logs in such a way that they believed they had found a race of peaceful breeders
Now anthros, being dominatrixes, had a destiny to claim the galaxy for the empress and great mother...but that takes a long time when you have a fixed breeding season. A limit these adaptable soft skins didn't appear to share.
So they "helped" the humans fulfill their mission. To become breeders and bring life to the anthro empires new worlds.
Being treated like this by anthros for generations created a new branch of humanity. With increased fertility, lower aggression, more traits that anthros desired such as creativity and general fitness, more varied hair and eye colors.
Of course this has pros/cons...in some regions humans are simply property, in others they are revered, the rapidly expanding empire has resulted in different factions.
Only a few anthros know the truth about humans tho, lost in the archives an all that. Somewhere out there are humans just as wild as any anthro warlord.
Yeah I have to get a life I know...I just love sci fi bros

Imagine being on earth when space anthros send aid and it just ends up being a husband adoption center for the weman of the galactic military. It’s a stay on a hell world to die or let the nice lady who has food play with your hair situation.

>She slowly moves a clawed hand to his scalp, running her fingers through his hair
>She leans in, looking your comrade right in his eyes
>"You're a goooood booooy" She softly coos. "My perfect little army man. So cute with your green clothes and big strong muscles. You ever thought about having kids someday? I can think of some privates under my command that would love to meet you."
>He weakly shakes his head side to side, damn it man resist!
>"Tell you what, if you give me the location to the outpost I'll make sure there'll be someone around to take good care of you. A priceless treasure like you doesn't deserve to be alone in the big cold universe."

>she was of course enquiring as to the fat nut you were requested to sit on over night, and finish this morning

>"No, no. You'll do pleasantly. Now stand on this scale facing me."
>she was referring to the same model of pediatric measuring device found in every such facility, black and white, loud as a train and looks like it was composed by a Nazi rocket scientist
>but facing her? she was standing to the side, somewhat awkwardly between the hazardous waste bin, counter edge and measure all in one area, centered to the room
>it was around the time that you began walking that the scent of your body has finally caught up with everything up top

>"Please remain comfortable for the remainder of the examination, and remember not to hold it in."
>"Hold it in?" you parroted, as she flashed a red and white pen light in your eyes
>"Oh." you dimly retorted, as your genitals immediately began to run frigid, a sensation which also began just above your pubis
>where your unmistakably lavatory-curious bladder was seated
>"Ma'am?"
>"I understand the sensation is uncomfortable, but this is the best that we can do." all but reading your mind, she assured, giving you the pride to finish at least one statement
>it was then that you felt rather rooted to the spot, as the apparent curse this woman has put you under has inebriated any urges to engage in that human pastime known as walking
>your lips were becoming like two viscous pieces of slime that were pried apart and haphazardly clenched together again; ill-defined and very, very damn yellow
>wait, not THAT yellow
>why is the doctor red and green now?
>'Persistence of Memory' had already begun re-creating itself with the sparse selection of wall art, as the doctor has taken your genitals in paw, apparently forgoing any further inspections
>it must have been
>the fucking pills
>the previous sight and revelation having been your final moments of note, as you began uncontrollably relieving yourself where you stood
>not quite prepared, the doctor hissed only an "Ah." before plugging the newfound leak; her scrubs, mask, fur and the floor so clean you would've previously eaten off it not unscathed, those jaundiced stains already setting in deeply
>the doctor hilted your average size with expertise, her lips forming a distinct funneling around the root of your cock, as she, well really- quite funneled your own sour fluid down her throat, likely not having tasted as much as one might expect
>in spite of a lack of reasonable faculties, your current dubiously-induced, definitely illegal-but-it's-China-so-who-hell-really-knows drug trip has resolved the situation in all but a few creative ways
>the hazard bin was making timely Abbot and Costello skits with unerring impressionism, and you didn't even know who Abbott and Costello were!
>the doctor had been in this situation many times previously, and had long since curbed any urges during this time, although the audible moans had indicated at least one set of vague emotions as she pulled off your penis slowly, her fangs harmlessly dragging along the skin, but not undetected
>as the empty status of your not-balls was fast approaching, Doctor Panda took your base and testicles in one tight O gesture between her thumb and pointer, and allowed your remaining fetid fluids to run flush across her tongue
>her eyes hitched but did not roll at the flavor, your piss settled upon her taste buds, and whipped her black and white bud into high gear
>as embarrassing as it was to have some smelly Chink's piss run awash over your nice, white labcoat, at least you weren't short enough to need a couple inches offset just to be mouth-to-dick level with a slouched Chinaman buzzing past Neptune on a concoction of paralytics and shitty Chinese psychoactives scraped off a dance floor in Xinjiang
>it appears that the shame was no large feat for her, as she popped your glans out from her apparently very painful hold, two streams of your steamy lemonade trickling from the intentionally open right side of her mouth, running fast and crashing hard into the fluff of her corresponding cheek
>drawing a quick breath, she pulled your little Chairman by his pointy hat back to her lips, where she was smearing any amount of saliva, dick sweat and that third forbidden ingredient across her pert little lips, which pursed and puckered along your reddened tip
>finally releasing her medically qualified sluthold, Doctor Panda rose, baring the faintest hint of intoxication in an errant lean into the counter, which she swiftly countered with professional subtlety
>now drained of your hot, stinking piss and your Johnson being far cleaner now than it has been in a fortnight, the trail of comets, floating Deng heads and geographically misplaced tanukis having settled some seconds earlier, it would almost seem as though Ms. Mrs.? Panda had all but cleaned your system out for good
>and really, isn't that all we ever ask of our medical professionals? to clean us out of poor health and any wealth?
>looking back at the clock, which you could only faintly make out from this distance deprived of your glasses, indicated that about fifteen minutes had passed, as you stickily arose from the padded inspection bench which crinkled incessantly as the waxed paper layer stuck to your greasy, neet back like the impending dread of $10 a gallon gas prices
>thank Xi you're not American you think, as the fond tones of flambeed dog testicles fills your mind, which was unusually refreshed
>focusing back to the room, you discovered that there was only one occupant, save for the puddle of your pee still on the floor to your right and the pointedly empty jar which still sat atop the counter
>desiring a little warmth in the temperature controlled setting, you had glanced where you last left your outfit, which was now missing
>as hesitation rose your heart rate, you had begun questioning a bit more than necessary at this point in the story
>but after a short time, she returned, visibly huffing, and her uniform and face still blemished
>"There... has been an unexpected setback with our diagnostic machinery. We experienced a wing-wide system outage lasting only eight seconds, but a substantial enough amount of time to render any samples invalid under their precise requirements."
>"Oh, well where are m-"
>"This of course means the events of this session will be rendered null until operations can be signed off before this weekend, and you will need to return first thing Monday morning for a comprehensive reanalysis under structured terms."
>failing to notice the outstretched midget arm which was handing you not one, not two but three of those very same shady capsules from yesterday
>"Which also means that your prescription will need to be extended for the weekend duration. We deeply apologize for any inconveniences this may cause, and will enjoy having you a- ..with us again once all of these technical kinks have been ironed out." adjusting her spectacles on the misspeak
>prying yourself from the bizzare doctor's office architecture, you stood before her, the short Panda making quick effort to continue looking you in the eye as she turns back to the counter, her position now reset
>intent to ask, but feeling rudely cut off one too many times to bother, you instead walked for the door
>"Your clothes are currently being washed in the janitor's office, you may wait here if you like until they are finished."
>having rested your hand on the metal hand already, you pressed on, intent to exit the uncharacteristically thick air of the patient to practitioner exchange
>not letting the door slam behind you, they were too cheap to install weighted door catches, the room now resumed a sole occupancy
>after having to ask for directions and be lead to a room labeled "Janitor's Closet" but in Chinese, you washed yourself at the sink, recovered your clothing and departed with the unorthodox in-house prescription in pocket
>tracing the embossment of the measures on the glass, Panda felt a writhe of malpracticing guilt in her gut, probably along with a couple cup's worth of piss to boot, as she grasped the measuring tool, stepped on the hazard bin's release and tossed the spotless glass inside

>A silence that is broken by several clicks and the roar of flames coming to life in front of you
>A fireplace makes itself known, it's warm flames a welcome change
>The adjustment to your surroundings, however, are not so welcome
>Rose petals are strewn on the floor around you, littering the bearskin rug you've been placed on

>On another stand that flanks the bed, is yet more roses
>It looks very much like someone's grand romantic gesture gone horribly wrong

She’s in competition with the private investigator hired by the family, and a vigilante looking for justice. Though their goals align it’s clear that they will never be able to work together.

>'I am sick and tired of coyotes sucking on my nutsack. I have had it with wild dogs rimming my ass. We Need change, and we need it now. I want to see a world where I can wander through the woods without worrying about some furry fuck making out with my testicles. I want to live in peace and harmony with all anthros, but these mangy curs keep interrupting my me-time to have a taste of my junk.*
>I am not a walking buffet for flea-ridden vermin, and I will not stand for it any longer. These coyotes need to be put down, or at the very least, relocated to a place where they can't bother innocent people like me. I have half a mind to go out there with a shotgun and start picking them off myself. It's time we took our country back from these amorous beasts.'*
>He then slammed the post button with far more force than needed, showing his fury to the rest of the other members of the discord server.
>Waiting a few seconds for the argument his fervent declaration created to get brought to him by his shitty internet, he rereads his statement.
"Perhaps I should start carrying my shotgun, it'd scare most of those critters off," he muttered to himself.
>The next day he went for his daily hike, looked at his shotgun for a moment, checked that it was loaded, and slung it over his shoulder.
>Stepping out of his house, he locked the door and set out.
>There's a nice lake a short ways away from his house where he goes fishing.
>He even built a little shed to store his fishing gear in so he doesn't need to carry a rod or bait out.
>The walk to the lake was calm, but he made certain to get his gun in his hands and face any noise he heard.
>But it was rarely the walk to the lake that was troublesome, it was always the trek back after a good day of fishing that was the time he'd get assaulted the most.
>They never took too much of his fish, but it was grating to have his work stolen from him.
>Not today.
>Today he's coming back home with a full cooler of fish.
>The fishing was successful, his traps managed to catch a couple of crayfish and the nets and his rod got quite a few fish.
>He was fortunate that the lake was large enough to make overfishing it nearly an impossibility.
>Mentally preparing for the journey back, he locked up his gear and extended the handle of the wheeled cooler.
>Silently cursing the fact he didn't have a handgun, he started walking.
>Even with his shotgun, he felt vulnerable.
>Wielding a shotgun one handed is just impossible, if he got attacked he'd have to drop the cooler to even line up a shot.
>That's a lot of time for a coyote to close the distance.
>It also meant responding to every shaking bush that might have either a pair of fucking squirrels or a coyote waiting in ambush took more time.
>So he as completely unprepared for when two coyotes leapt at him and pinned him to the ground.
>As one of them moved to pin your upper body and silence your angry words with her rear on your face, you saw another three coyotes come from the woods.
>With your last moments of sight, you saw one move to the cooler and the others go to where their friend was pulling down your pants.
>Your attempts at struggling are ineffective against the strength of four coyotes and all of your wrathful words are reduced to mere vibrations against the triangular folds of the anthro atop of him.
>The three coyotes at your lower half fumble at undoing your belt with your squirming, but eventually they manage.
>In result of their success, you feel your pants get pulled to your ankles and your legs tossed up in the air.
>The coyote on your face grabs your legs and pins them so your knees are against your sides, it is not comfortable in the slightest.
>Now that you're completely exposed, the coyotes can have their fun, one takes your balls in her mouth to assail with her tongue.
>Another draws your half-mast member into her maw.
>The last immediately drills her tongue into your ass.
>The one on your face tries to order you to eat her out, but you stubbornly refuse with pursed lips.
>The coyote caressing your nuts with her tongue demonstrates the sharpness of her fangs to encourage you to reconsider.
>Reluctantly, you stick your tongue out and half-heartedly give a few licks, the happy pants of the bitch above you removes the sensation of sharp fangs against your sack.
>The sensation of a long tongue in your rear is an unfortunately familiar sensation.
>Between the violation of your rear and the suction on your member, your reach your peak and give the suckling coyote the mouthful she wanted.
>With their 'payment' now complete, they bounce off of you, the one eating your ass giving a whine of displeasure as she's dragged away.
>Your hands immediately start reaching for your shotgun, but doing so is difficult with your pants being down and you having just came.
One of the fuckers decides to shout, "Thanks for the fish! See you tomorrow!" as they run.
>The shotgun finally finds your hands and you try to line up a shot but they're already gone.
>The temptation to fire a shot after them immerges in the finger on the trigger, but you relent.
>It's unlikely you'd even hit them with how thick the woods can be at times.
>Disgruntled, you fix your pants and look around for your belt as you grumble.
>Finally redressed, you try and brush off some of the dirt as you search the cooler.
>They took half of it, some of the better stuff too.
>You were looking forward to that large fish, it was a difficult catch.
>Now dirty and dejected, you restart the journey home with a much lighter cooler.
>Maybe you'll head into town tomorrow.
>Perhaps cut down a tree, firewood is useful to have around.
>You're tired of fishing.
>Well, not fishing itself, you're just tired having half of your daily catch get stolen from you.
>A few days of just doing some carpentry and work around the house would be nice.
>You've been meaning to clean your stove.

>You hunker down behind the crate, trying to keep your breathing down.
>"Where are youuuuuu?" You hear her sing out.
>"There's no where you can run, my girls have this place surrounded. All you'll accomplish is tiring yourself out before the fun part!"
>You tried to think, how on earth were you going to get out of this mess?
>You think you see a door to outside on the second floor, but she was literally standing between you and the stairs.
>You hear the clacking of her claws against the cement floor. She sounded a good distance away, but with how bad the acoustics in this warehouse were, that didn't mean anything.
>At least all the spilled chemicals meant she couldn't smell you.
>"~come out, come out wherever you are!~" She sings again, sounding closer this time.
>"Where oh where has my cute mate gone? Are you in...HERE?" As she suddenly yanks open a closet.
>"You're lucky I enjoy a good game of hide and seek. I wonder what sort of reward I'll have to take from you when I win?"
> The clacking sound is getting closer. You spy a long table you could probably crawl underneath of to get some distance around her, but surely any movement you make will risk alerting her?
>Maybe she'll give up?
>"Why are you hiding from me? It's not like I want to hurt you, I've simply decided you're the one for me. Really, it's your own fault for not getting hitched already." She mocked, sounding closer and closer.
>What was it going to be; hide in one spot or make a break for it? If you were quiet, she might pass by you. If you were fast, you might be able to sneak around her and make for the stairs.
>"I hope you aren't thinking about escaping. I'd be really disappointed if I had to keep hunting you. This heat has been making me so irritable I might just do something rash when I finally find you."

>How would Zig Zag work in a /adhg/ setting?
Anon pushed/coerced/forced into pornography seems like the first obvious choice, depending on how hard into dominating him you want to go. Zig Zag is a businesswoman who understands supply and demand very well and what kinds of humie porn is popular among her target audiences.

>human men down on their luck get pimped out to anthros for cash
>after running into legal trouble, Anon is desperate for money to pay off loans and decides to sell his body
>however every time he is about to go off with some anthro client, he is somehow diverted to some chore by the boss/pimp
>due to his inability to get clients, he isn’t paid enough for the loans
>the boss comes up to him with an offer to pay off his debt
>in exchange; he is employed to her forever, and receives a “promotion” to her “personal assistant”

>Anon answers an ad for a human male pornstar, has his reservations but desperately needs the money
>Meets Zig Zag, who mostly retired from acting to stay behind the camera nowadays, and who makes the convincing enough argument for him to go through with it
>It's not like he uses the Internet much anyways, his dignity is worth the consistent paycheck
>Virtually all of his films involve him being topped by either bigger, muscular anthros or squat and kinda gross buncel-types
>Not the hot anthro stepsister or pizza-ordering MILF he'd rather be with, but Zig Zag made it clear this is what the audience wants
>And she paid for the actual studies to prove it
>But every night when she joins him in bed, bare skin against soft fur and his head against her wonderfully voluptuous chest
>Being gentle with him in every way the actresses aren't, running claws through his hair while whispering in his ear that he's her favorite
>It might just make it all worth it
I could see it being two-pronged domination, not only being physically dominated on cam but also being mentally or emotionally dominated by Zig Zag herself even if she's intentionally being gentle with him.

Need more anthros pimping out brothers, husbands, and fathers.

>During the research leading to the composition of his monograph The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behavior, Hans Kruuk kept a tame hyena he named Solomon.
>Kruuk found Solomon's company so congenial, he would have kept him, but Solomon had an insatiable taste for "cheese in the bar of the tourist lounge and bacon off the Chief Park Warden's breakfast table", and no door could hold him back, so Solomon was obliged to live out his days in the Edinburgh Zoo.

"Ava."
>she goes on rumbling in her sleep
>you shove the offending appendage away from you and try to scoot to the other end of the bed
>but that tail of hers seems to have a mind of its own, as it slaps down on your side and starts to curl around your waist
"Ava! Cut it out!"
>you manage to pry loose from the gator's tail before it manages to constrict you like a boa
>you roll over
>and then you have to roll over again to reach the edge and sit up on the bed
>you groan, stretching out sore and dehydrated muscles
>Ava rumbles a little more, and the whole bed shudders as the towering reptile covers the whole distance of the super-king sized bed in one turn
>"GRRRRMMMMmmmmornin' Anon..."
>she reaches out to you, catching your arm to drag you down into her embrace
"Ava, please. Let me get some water before we start again."
>she sighs and reaches out to the bedside table, picking up a pitcher of water that had apparently been there all night
>""ere ya go Anon."
>with that, she brings the pitcher to your face and upends it, drenching you
"Ah!"
>you gasp and tug against Ava's arm that still hold you against her chest
"What the hell Ava! Your tail was bad enough already!"
>you gasp, sputtering out for breath
>at least you feel a little revitalized
>Ava giggles and cuddles you tighter, forcing your head between her breasts so all the world is framed in her soft-scaled flesh
>if you were turned around, you'd be worried about her putting you in another death roll
>you don't know if you could survive a fifth
>"What's wrong with my tail, Anon?"
>her voice rumbles around you, making you feel it as much as you hear it
"It's fine, when it's not slapping me silly or accidentally choking me in my sleep!"
>Ava laughs again
>"Oh hush, you didn't mind my tail so much last night. You hugged the whole thing when I let you take a break and fuck me doggy style."
>she considers that a break?
>you were holding onto her tail for dear life
"Just stop...slapping me with it. I don't know how you manage with a giant anaconda attached to your butt."
>that earns another laugh from the gator, and she pulls you free from her embrace to turn you about and look you in the eye
>"Oh it's much more than that baby. It's thicker, and sexier than any snake."
>you roll your eyes
>Ava harrumphs and sits up
>she takes you with her, easily manhandling you into place to sit at the edge of the bed beside her
>then Ava stands with her hands on her hips, and her tail raised
>god you love that ass of hers
>"Maybe you and it just need to get reacquainted."
>you go to ask what she means, before she slaps the whole weight of her tail down against your body, knocking you flat
>the wind is knocked out of your lungs
>"That's better! Anon, meet tail."
>Ava giggles, surprisingly high-pitched for a creature of her size, and presses down with her tail
>all your attempts to escape from under the appendage fail, she's surprisingly dexterous with it and keeps you pinned
>the underside of her tail is lined with the same soft scales as her chest and belly, and despite your annoyance, rubbing against it is starting to have an affect on you
>your cock starts to throb at the sensation
>you groan
>after going six rounds with an insatiable gator last night, you didn't think it was possible for you to get hard again
>but as Ava grinds your tail against your entire body, the tip slapping against your face, your body finds the will and spare fluids to get to full mast
>"Oh? Starting to make nice with miss tail? Why don't you kiss it, Anon?"
>you turn your head to the side to speak
"I will not."
>Ava laughs, and slaps your cheek with the tip of her tail as she grinds against you harder
>"Go on, give it a kiss. It'll hurt my feelings if you don't. You know you love it."
>you sigh and turn back, giving the gator tail a kiss as it slides across your face
>Ava laughs triumphantly and lifts her tail off you
>she gasps
>"Oh! You really like my tail, don't you? Were you gonna cum just from humping it?"
>your face burns
"No, you were just rubbing against me and..."
>Ava continues to laugh, and slaps her tail down on your body again
>"That's not the truuuth!"
>teasing you in a sing-song voice, she slaps you a few more times before lifting her tail again
>"Tell me the truth Anon. Tell me you're a dirty, tail-humping pervert, and I'll let you cum on it."
>fuck it
>you already admitted to being 'mommy's little man' last night
>and you're really starting to enjoy yourself anyways
"I'm a tail-humping pervert, Ava. You've got the thickest, sexiest, best tail in the world and I wanna hump it until I bust a nut all over its pretty scales."
>"Ha! You really are a pervert. But since you're such a good boy, I guess I'll let you have your fun."
>she lets her tail down again in a might 'whump!' and starts to grind over you again
>this time you get into it
>hard
>your arms and legs go around the meaty tail, and you thrust against it in reckless lust
>you love this giant gator's tail so much, you kiss it again
>your thrusts get faster and faster
>and after last night, your stamina isn't exactly in top form
"Ava, j--just a little more!"
>she rumbles in pleasure
>you give one final thrust and burst
>spattering her scales with your seed, you grip onto the tail laid across your body desperately
>Ava goes on rumbling in smug self-satisfaction while you use her tail to get off
>if you weren't already covered head-to-toe with Ava's own fluids, you might feel a little ashamed at making such a mess all over both of you
>especially since it seems that tail-humping is especially taboo
>when you're finally finished, Ava raises her tail from you and admires her handiwork
>or tailiwork?
>"You really are a pervert, Anon. Cumming all over a girl's tail."
>she scoffs in mock disdain at your apparent degeneracy, before turning around to look down at you
>"I guess I can forgive you for being such a dirty little tail-humper. If you help me wash up in the shower."
>Ava reaches down and tenderly lifts you up into her arms, carrying you bridal style
>"I'll even let you kiss my tail again~"

>Anon wants to turn his life around

>work has been kicking your ass, especially with all the extra customers that summertime brings to an ice-cream shop
>you feel sticky, tired, and miserable
>but you had to find some way of paying for school
>community college may be cheap, but it's not that cheap
>you'll be saving up all summer just to afford a payment plan for next semester
>that is if your grades were good enough
>you say a silent prayer to whoever may be listening for your finals to have gone over well
>when you slide the key into the front door of your apartment, you place your ear against the door to listen for any sounds within
>thankfully quiet is all that greets you
>she's not home yet
>you slip inside, and make sure to lock the door behind you
>you'll have a little time to yourself to relax and unwind
>first things first, you shed your uniform, not bothering to pick any of it up as you make your way toward the bathroom to shower
>if she's going to get on your case, she can do it once you're clean
>the shower is heavenly, even if the pressure is still a little weird
>but when you come out, you hear the voice you were so dreading
>"There you are! You got home earlier than I expected, Anon."
>the timber smiles warmly down at you
>she was waiting for you in the hallway
"Oh. Hey Harper. How was your day?"
>she sighs and indicates the bundle of clothes cradled under one arm
>"I missed you of course. Why do you have to go to work all day, even in the summer? I make more than enough to pay for your classes."
>you wince at the mention of your schooling
>your girlfriend had offered to pay for it a dozen times over, as well as house, clothe, and feed you for the duration of your college career
>but you insisted on making it on your own
>it was a point of pride
>you were going to make it on your own
>"Speaking of, I think your grades should have come back by now. Why don't we go check them?"
>her demeanor becomes dour as she takes your wrist to pull you along
>"You remember our deal, right Anon?"
>how could you forget?
"Of course I remember the deal."
>ever since you were kids, Harper has been asking you to marry her
>at first it was just cute puppy love, but as time went on, she became more and more serious
>you remained close friends through middle school
>of course you dated in high school
>and she took your virginity, just like you took hers
>but all the while she still promised that one day she would marry you
>her happily ever after
>which leads to now, as she pulls you toward your computer desk to check your grades
>when you graduated high school, you and Harper made a deal
>once you made it through college, then you would consider getting married once you had a proper job
>but when "once" you graduated college became "if" you graduated college, she amended the deal
"Can I at least put on some pants?"
>Harper sits you down and flips open the laptop in front of you
>"No. I want easy access."
>the new deal was if you failed out, you agreed to marry her
>and father her first litter ASAP
>"Okay, now check your grades."
>Harper leans down against you, arm around your bare shoulder as you pull up the school's access page
>you log in, and hover the mouse curser over the link labeled "Grades"
>you hesitate
>you had really tried your best this semester
>if those grades aren't good enough to get you off probation...
>Harper's paw goes over yours, and clicks the mouse
>it seems to take forever for the page to load
>but when it finally does, and you see those four letters staring back at you
>you freeze
>the whole world starts to spin
>you try to breath, but it feels erratic and uncontrollable
"Wait..."
>Harper squeezes your shoulder
"Wait wait wait, no..."
>the timber wolf stands to her full height and slides the laptop closed without a word
"Harper please, I can--I can appeal with a counselor..."
>she doesn't respond, simply reaching down to trace a tender paw over your cheek
>you turn stare up at her, tears welling in your eyes
>her yellows eyes start back, big and round and full of care
>"Anon, my love. My dearest. I'm so sorry."
>she takes your wrist again in an attempt to stand you up
>but when you resist, she simple leans down again to scoop you up into her arms
>you cling to her, shaking with the effort to keep from crying
>Harper shushes you as she carries you down the hall to your bedroom
>even when she sits down, she doesn't release you from her embrace
>she just keeps shushing you and hugs you tight
>"It's okay Anon. It's alright."
>you shake your head
"It's not alright. I'm a failure Harper! I--I tried and I worked and I studied! I did everything right and I failed!"
>you cling to her in let out a scream through clenched teeth
>it's not fair
>"You didn't fail, my love. It was never meant to be."
>you gasp
>the words sting like an open wound
>"You tried your best, and you never gave up. That's why you'll make a perfect husband, and a wonderful father to our pups. That's what is meant to be."
>she traces a paw over your cheek again, wiping away tears as she does so
>"This is the next chapter of our lives, Anon. Our life, together."
>she pulls you into a tender kiss, still holding your trembling body with her other arm
>you want to protest
>your pride burns in anguished defeat to this powerful she-wolf
>and worst of all, she's right
>you love Harper
>and even if it meant losing your pride, you couldn't bear to leave her
"I just--"
>you pull away from the kiss in the last throws of your surrender
"I wanted to be more than just a house husband."
>Harper shakes her head and frowns at you in disapproval
>"You are already everything I could ever ask of you."
>she kisses you one more time, deep and passionate as she lays you down and mounts you
>"You're mine."

>War happens, your waifur has to gather food since food is scarce due to shelling of shops

‘Thanks for agreeing to look after him, Vera. I don’t know what I’d do without you.’
‘Oh, it’s not a problem at all, Julia!’ Vera smiled. ‘Little Luke seems like a darling. You say he’s well-behaved?’
‘Absolutely.’ Julia nodded. ‘He’s a darling. He really tries to be nice and helpful whenever he can. You be sure to tell me if he misbehaves, though.’ Julia opened her mouth to say something. She hesitated, then decided to proceed. ‘I was wondering... it might be rude for me to ask, but... how goes the search for a man?’
‘Not rude at all!’ Vera smiled. ‘It’s nice to have another lady to discuss these things with. And, honestly? It’s not going well at all.’
‘Oh, dear.’ Julia did feel concerned. The fox woman was her neighbour, after all, and she had little time for socialising nowadays. Frankly, Vera was good company. Julia honestly didn’t understand why the busty vixen couldn’t find a partner. She didn’t know her exact age, but Julia suspected her to be in her early-to-mid thirties.
Julia doubted her capacity as a human to assess the attractiveness of a beast female, but... really, there was no way to call Vera ‘ugly’. Smooth, short fur covered her body, red across the top of her head, down her back, and at the top of her arms and her thighs. The rest of her fur was cream-coloured, and she clearly took good care of it. She wore a pair of jeans, and a simple, light-blue top.
‘Not fantastic at all. I‘m aware we’re a bit of a minority nowadays, but honestly… all the good canid men are taken! I’ve been considering doing it artificially at this point, but...’ she shrugged. ‘You know.’
Julia nodded her head sadly. ‘Don’t do anything if you aren’t one hundred percent sure about it.’
‘Oh, I won’t. My clock’s ticking, though. I don’t want to wait another five years to get started. Honestly, I don’t want to wait two!’ She smiled, glancing towards her neighbour’s house. Julia’s front lawn was a little overgrown – a fact Vera didn’t judge her for in the slightest. Being a single mom was not an easy thing. ‘I do still have a few ideas, though... where is your little Luke?’
‘Here he is now!’ Right as Vera asked, the door to Julia’s suburban home opened. A small boy bounded out, holding a small backpack. He smiled, approaching Vera and Julia. ‘There you are. What took you so long?’
‘I couldn’t find my game. I’ve got it now, though.’ The boy beamed a smile up at Vera. ‘Hi, Miss Cannis!’
‘Oh, please, call me Vera.’ Vera reached a paw down and ruffled Luke’s hair. She smiled with her eyes, very pleased to see the boy she’d be looking after for the day. Luke wore a pair of cargo shorts and a black t-shirt, and resembled his mother somewhat. He had smooth, straight blonde hair and blue eyes, a cute, round face, and a skinny build. Unlike Julia, whose mood was constantly marred by stress, Luke had an adorable smile on his face almost every time Vera saw him. He was, in Vera’s strong opinion, tremendously adorable and handsome. It would be a shame when he truly became a teenager – Vera worried he would lose his cute looks.
‘You know where the house key is?’ asked Julia. ‘You’ve got a change of clothes? You have your laptop?’
‘Come on, Mom, it’s right next door! The house key is under the pot plant on the porch. I didn’t forget anything, and if I did, I can just go inside and get it!’
‘I know, I know.’ Julia sighed. ‘Sorry. I really have to get going.’ She leaned down and gave Luke a kiss on the forehead. ‘Be good for Vera, okay?’
‘I promise, Mom! Go off to work!’
Julia chuckled, shaking her head as she headed towards her car. ‘I’ll see you after twenty-four hours of running around after sick and dying people. All the poor, sick birdie men... you know how it goes. Fun.’ Julia got into her car and started the engine. She waved at Vera, and her son, smiling and driving away. She felt content leaving Luke with her neighbour, and her thoughts were quickly consumed with her upcoming shift at the hospital.
Vera watched the car drive away. She turned to Luke. ‘Well. How about we head inside?’
‘Sure!’
>Three Hours Later
Vera gazed at Luke as he reclined happily on her living room couch, playing on a handheld game console and watching a movie. She leaned on the kitchen countertop, supporting her head with her hands, watching him intently. Well, she couldn’t see much beyond the back of his head from this angle – Vera was in deep thought.
This was a good movie. It had a funny romantic subplot between a feline and a human. Like many canid species, Vera could never find cat people attractive. She remembered back when she was a puppy, when calling them ‘cats’ wasn’t politically incorrect. Calling an avian a ‘bird’ had been no issue, and referring to an equine as a ‘horse’ was only mildly offensive. ‘Pony’, however, still hadn’t been okay even back then...
Still, the state of the world really did her head in sometimes. She understood why some folk had grown to dislike it. Being called by the species you’d evolved from didn’t suit everyone. Vera would never call a human ‘monkey’, but she could never see herself taking offense to being labelled ‘fox.’
She decided to take her mind off the complexity of modern animalistic politics, turning her thoughts to Luke. She’d stripped down a bit since inviting him inside, swapping out her shirt for a white tank top.
She had also removed her bra.
‘You’re not hungry?’ Vera asked, approaching her charge slowly.
‘Nope, I’m fine, thanks!’ replied Luke, tapping away at his console.
‘You want to chat at all?’
‘Sure!’ Luke put his game down. ‘I can pause this game. And I’ve seen this movie, like, ten times.’
Vera leaned atop the sofa, resting her enormous breasts on top of it. She noticed Luke’s eyes flicker to them, then back up to her face. ‘I just want to know how you’re doing. I have a few fun things we can do while you’re here.’ This was the first time Luke had stayed with his mature, busty vixen neighbour, though Vera had entertained some lewd thoughts about her neighbour’s son before...
‘Yeah, I’m doing fine! How about you? What fun things?
Well...’ she moved slowly around the couch, moving with a gentle sway of her hips, before sitting down beside Luke. The younger, smaller boy eyed her curiously. ‘I’ve got a couple of things I’d like to talk to you about.’
‘Sure.’ Luke smiled. ‘What’s been going on? I heard you and Mom talking about some stuff.’
Vera sidled a little closer to him, noticing how the boy’s eyes darted across her body. He really was adorable. Vera was getting all kinds of thoughts just looking at him. ‘Yes. Well, as you can see, I’m a grown-up woman. That means I want certain things.’
‘You’re really pretty, too, Vera.’
‘Ohoho, you sweet boy!’
‘I was wondering why you didn’t have a husband or anything.’ Luke closed his mouth tightly. ‘Uh... sorry, I think that was rude to say.’
‘Oh, don’t worry, sweetheart. You’re right to wonder – that's just what I was going to talk about.’
‘H-huh?’
‘I just turned thirty-five, you see. When women get to my age... well, there are things a lot of them want.’ She stared down at Luke, who averted her eyes. He was starting to blush. No doubt Vera’s lack of a bra was throwing him off. Her rack was, to put it simply – massive. She was extremely well-endowed, and had been blessed with a curvy canine figure. She had a thick ass, furry like the rest of her body, but no less attractive to the majority of men. There were always the types who didn’t want to fuck a fox lady. But, with the way Luke was looking at her... ‘Can you guess what I want?’
‘Um... I’m not sure.’
‘Well, tell me, little Luke. Have you learned in school... how babies are made?’
‘Babies?’ Luke blushed even more. ‘Yeah. Yeah, I did. You put a man’s... honestly, it’s kind of embarrassing to talk about.’
‘Did they tell you that it feels good?’
‘Huh?’ Vera leaned down to the small boy, now, resting her muzzle on his shoulder. ‘I like that, Vera. But what are you doing? What do you mean?’ She reached a careful paw down to the boy’s crotch, letting it rest on his front. ‘Uh...’
‘Making a baby. You have sex to make a baby.’
Luke nodded. ‘They mentioned that. Also, why are you touching my dick?’
Vera giggled. Such a cute little human boy. He really was just perfect. ‘It’s what you use to make a baby. Has your dick ever got all big and hard?’ Vera smiled at Luke as he turned his head away. ‘Don’t be shy. You can tell me anything. I don’t bite.’
‘A couple of times. It always goes down, though. They explained that, but I didn’t really get it. I’ve tried touching it a bit, but I don’t think that did anything. Were you wanting to touch it?’
‘I was.’ Vera stood up, getting off the couch. She crouched down in front of Luke, giving him an eyeful of her fantastic rack. ‘You see, the reason I haven’t gotten married at all is I like human boys like you. I’ve been realising... canid men just don’t do it for me. They’re always so rough, aggressive, dominating... every man I meet is the same.’
‘A-are they really?’ Luke didn’t want to admit it, but he was starting to get an erection. There would be no hiding it. Vera had her muzzle right in front of his crotch.
‘I just can’t bring myself to like them. Not when there are adorable human boys around. Have you ever had a girlfriend, little Luke? You’re such a gorgeous boy.’
‘No. Most of the girls my age aren’t all that pretty.’
‘What kind of girls do you like?’
‘...’
‘Come on. You know I won’t tell your mother anything that happens here. All she’ll hear is that you’ve been a good boy.’
‘I like... grown-up girls. And... well, I like fox ladies. I mean... what’?’
‘It’s okay to call me a fox, dear. I’m so glad to hear you like us. Not all human men do. You think I’m pretty too, don’t you?’
‘L... lots. I, um... I think of you at night-time, sometimes.’
Every word the boy said was music to Vera’s doggy ears. Even in animalistic cultures, the things she would soon do were not exactly acceptable... but there would be no harm done, if everything went according to her plans. ‘And I think you’re a cute, wonderful little man who I’d like to do a few very fun things with.’
‘Like what?’
‘If I touch your dick, I can make you feel good. Not just good – amazing. You trust me, don’t you?’
‘Yeah, of course! It sounds a little weird, but you can do whatever you want with me!’
What an excellent start to things. ‘There’s just one condition. You absolutely cannot ever tell your Mum. I won’t tell her anything, but you need to keep it a secret too.’
‘Sure. I’m good at keeping secrets.’ God, Vera wanted to just jump onto him. She was feeling butterflies in her stomach and a fire in her loins. Her friend’s son had been cute as a button for as long as Vera had known him, but she’d only been honest with herself recently. She got in close to the boy’s crotch, edging her paws up his thighs, slowly caressing them.
‘Mmm...’ she grabbed the boy by his small, soft hand. ‘Follow me to my bedroom if you want to do something really fun...’
