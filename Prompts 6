I want nothing more than to have a big beautiful bodacious bountiful bear wife. I want to pump her full of cubs then watch the sun set over a scenic forest, the bump on her belly growing alongside the pride in my chest I feel every time I gaze upon her fecund form. When I put the finishing touches on the cabin we'll call it home, a safe but comforting speck of paradise hidden amongst the vast untouched nature that surrounds us. As we watch our cubs grow and mature she will keep a gentle, but firm, paw on their development. They may stumble, and fall, and try our patience, but with a well of unconditional love that proves limitless we'll all make it through the tribulations of child rearing mostly unscathed and a whole lot wiser. There will come a time when the cubs are all grown up, and our joints seem creaky, and the small joys in life seem to be all that's in reach, and she'll feel like passing time just sitting on the front porch counting down the days until she's not around to count them any longer. And you know what? That's fine. Just as long as you're right next to her.

>anthro goddess grabs random human souls when on their way to heaven, fucks them til they're numb and then takes them to her personal corner of the afterlife where they will live in her bliss for the rest of eternity

>gets inironically snu snu’d
>goes through the whole process again now he’s dead

>CRACK!
>"agh.. oops.. you okay mortal?... uh.."
>wheezing anon writhes in agony under her hips, having just been broken in half
>"ahh... d-don't worry! I'll make this quick!"
>Goddess lifts her butt off his hips and slams it down on his head with full force, anon barely knows what hit him.
>Suddenly his eyes shoot open, was it a dream? No...
>Sitting on fluffy clouds, a gorgeous permanent sunset sky above
>Goddess stands before him with a sheepish expression
>"So.. funny thing, you got lucky so you get to go round two with me!"
>"You're already dead so it's not like I can accidentally kill you this time, ready when you are, mortal"
>spend what feels like hours letting the goddess ride you
>being slammed into the clouds by her is probably the best thing you've ever felt. unironically a religious experience.
>once all is said and done you feel exhaustion creeping up on you.
>as you're dozing off she picks you up in a bridal carry. resting your head on her heavenly breasts
>"come on mortal. let's get you home". the last thing you hear before falling asleep
>you wake up in your bed. with your body intact
>huh. was it really a dream?
>you look out the window, the sky is cloudy
>just then the clouds part. the sky is awash with heavenly lights and you see the goddess in the middle of the clouds
>she speaks to you in a booming voice. "good to see my favorite mortal awake. I had a great night, we should meet up again sometime"

>she shoots a lightning bolt at your front yard and disappears into the clouds
>confused, you go to check the spot where the lightning bolt hit

>a new planet begins to grow in her womb
>you're not quite sure how to feel about being partly responsible for birthing a world

>Viper waifur who loves to roleplay cheesy scenes from her "ADVENT Occupation" pornos
>Both of you struggle to keep a straight face staying in-character
>The shit-eating grin you give when she calls you a "disgusting rebel"
>The fanged smirk you see when you call her a "vile beast"
>It never lasts, though
>By the end you're laying there together as you did on your first meeting
>She still teases you about how easy it was to catch you that night
>How eager you were to lay with her in exchange for your life
>Spending the rest of the war "indefinitely detained" in her quarters
>And being here for her now, when she needs you most

>Your workplace went out of business so you have to find a new job.
>Go out searching for anyone who will hire you
>All of the jobs that even pay something near acceptable require a doctorate.
>You have 10 years experience and a bachelor, why the fuck won't they even call back?!
>Your impending existential crisis is averted when you find a job that pays well.
>Suspiciously well at that given the job description.
>Well, if you could call it a job description.
>It's literally just 'Chair, human men only' and then the pay.
>Well that's really descriptive.
>Well fuck, even if it is a scam it's not like you have something else lined up.
>You arrive at an office building.
>It's half a dozen floors tall with the stereotypical shiny windows.
>You walk, greet the receptionist, who was some kind of deer, and tell her your there for a job application.
"What job in particular?"
"Uh, all it said was 'Chair.'"
She gets an odd smirk on her, "Ah, the HR head told me that she's jumping right to the interview. She's in office 236 on the right."
"Thank you."
>Jesus, they're either extremely desperate or going to rob you blind.
>You stand outside the office and check the time, it's 2:29 pm.
>Entering the HR head's office, you see a tigress filling out papers, she tells you to enter but doesn't say a word to you for a few minutes.
"So, why are you here today?"
"I was looking for a job and saw the 'chair' position, but the description was unclear so I wanted some more information."
"Oh? Didn't you check the website?" she inquires with a coy tone.
"I did, but I couldn't find it."
"What a shame. Would you like a hands-on demonstration?"
"What do you mean by that?" you ask tensely.
"You'll have a ten minute trial experience, just so you can get a good grasp."
>Nervous but curious, you agree to the demonstration.
She gets out of her chair and sets a 10 minute timer in front of you, "Just as a show of good faith."
>She pushes her chair off to the side and extends something from the desk.
>She walks over to where you're sitting anxiously and pulls you out of the chair and walks you behind her desk with her hand on your shoulder.
>With a sudden move she sweeps her legs out from under you and places you onto the desk extension.
>It feels like a bed, a thin bed but a bed nevertheless.
The 'pillow' extends vertically on the sides of your head with a hole in them so your ears aren't blocked.
>She sits down and forces your head back into the 'pillow' groove before you can get up or even protest.
>You know that the job description said 'Chair' but you expected to be an Ikea chair assembler or something.
>Not being the chair.
>You attempt to push her off, but she's just too heavy, the only thing she does is release a content growl and wiggle her ass side to side.
>It has the side effect of her getting right where your lips would be touching hers if there wasn't a cloth barrier in the way.
"Ah, those side cushions are nice. Makes it so I don't have to worry about crushing you."
>You attempt to reply but are too muffled under her to make anything intelligible.
"Don't do that!" she states irritably, "...Yet at least. You'd be doing it a lot once you accept the position."
>Your attempts at getting her off your face all end in failure and her huffing contentedly.
>You lay there for a minute, your will to fight being sapped by your sheer inability to push her off.
>She did state that she'd get off you in ten minutes, what time did she start it?
>When last you checked it was 2:31? That means she'll get off you around 2:41 then, hopefully.
>You lay there for a few minutes and begin breathing normally.
>This wasn't what you thought it was going to be, but really what were you expecting for it to have such high pay?
>You untense, there's nothing you can do right now but wait.
>Perhaps this isn't so bad.
>Frankly it could be worse.
>You could not have this whole 'bed' type thing, sitting on the ground with your head at this angle in a chair would be awful.
>Hell even those- what'd she call them- side cushions are nice to have.
>Eventually you hear an alarm ring and she climbs off of you.
>Checking to see if she kept her word, you pull out your phone and check the time.
>It's 2:46.
>5 minutes later than you thought, but you probably spent that talking with her.
>Surprisingly, it seems like she kept her word.
"Will you accept the position or will you need to think about it at home?" she asks and upon seeing your relaxed expression she continues with a grin, "Or will you require another ten minute demonstration?"
>You mull it over in your head for a minute or two, thinking about the pay and such.
>It takes you another minute to decide on the wording of your response.
>She doesn't seem to like how long you're taking and waits impatiently.
You open your mouth to reply, "Another demonstration would help me come to a more, informed decision."
>She sets the timer again, shows it to you, and then makes herself comfortable on your face once more.

>pay a gorgeous deathclaw for a night of company
>she's cheap, but beautiful, and cuddly to boot
>but there's a catch of course
>you rub your eyes, feeling the sun on your bare skin
>you can hear shuffling around
>as you glance around you see the lady of the night tying a tarp around all your stuff and slinging it over her shoulder
>she blows you a kiss before walking off into the wasteland
>you can barely walk after all the incredible things she did to you
>worth it.

>your rabbit friend seems kind of down lately
>trouble with boys you think
>next time you're hanging out, you give her a hug and tell her that you're there for her
>she bursts into tears and buries her head in your chest
>refuses to let go of you until she's soaked your shirt through with tears
>you're not sure how to react
>when she finally lets go she whispers 'I love you'

>this is the story of a girl named buncel
>buncel went to a public high school on a street corner marked 427
>her daily routine was simple,
>she diligently ensured passing C grades in class
>sat alone in a corner at lunch time
>and angrily grumbled at anyone who got too near as she walked home
>this is what buncel did every day, of every month of every year.
>and although many would consider this a self destructive lifestyle, buncel was sure she would luck into the ultimate prize.
>a human for a boyfriend
>and buncel was miserable.

>you will never be smothered under a quarter-ton of big cat
>your entire body will never vibrate as she purrs and gently scratches your head with those sharp, sharp claws

every time i read shelby for some reason it makes me think about a similar plot where anon is dtf but his assigned wife is worried she will lose control and hurt him, even though hes hot for it. he tries to seduce her and tries to make her lose control.
>what are you worried about honey?

>massive court case
>prosecutor thinks anon could be the star witness, gets pushy and tries to guilt trip him to take active involvement in the case

i imagine anthros still rely heavily on scent so if someone leaves their life for long periods of time it would be hard for them to be recognized followed by the anthro freaking out.
>"Hey, it's me! Back from when we were kids and played together!"
>suspicious anthro grabs the guy and shoves her snout into his pants and inhales deep
>then a moment of clarity from the anthro
>"Now I recognize you! It's been forever! Also noticed you're single too~"

>You are Daniel
"Attacking them head on is the stupidest thing we could do."
>and you are in the woods with a bunch of hick tweakers hiding from the Daxy.
>Charles glares at you for a moment before responding.
>"And do what else? Eat away at our food supplies and do nothing? While they pick us off? We should be getting revenge for New York!"
"How, exactly would we do that? We have no military support. The army never showed up here they just let the scales roll into town. We don't have artillery. We don't have air support. We have a handful of deer guns and shitty mall ninja ARs. If you want to run off and get killed or captured by them then you do you. I'm going to survive."
>"Fuckin' coward."
>Charles takes a drag from his cigarette and continues. "There is nothing for us out here. We got almost no food left and it's like every day that someone up and disappears to the fuckin' dinosaurs. I want to go out on my own terms, high as a kite and guns blazing. I've always wanted to kick in the doors of the courthouse with a gun anyways. That's where they're holed up."
>You look around the camp
>All men in various states of physical fitness, most of them not fit for service else they would have been drafted into the continental army.
>All of the women had been carted off by the Daxy as soon as the scales arrived in town almost completely uncontested.
>Some of the men tried to hastily form a militia but it was a worthless endeavor.
>out numbered at least three to one with inferior technology, weapons, communications, and training.
>Running out into the forest was the smartest option, despite it being the middle of winter.
>You sigh and decide to change the subject with Charles.
"James is on patrol now right? Who is he with?"
>"Fuck if I know. I think he left with the kid." Charles is just being petty now.
>You grab a radio and try to hail James and wait for a response. After two more tries with only a crackle of static as a response Charles chimes in bitterly. "Maybe they got him too. We should attack now before numbers dwindle anymore."
>You decide not to respond. There are more pressing matters to attend to anyways.
"I'm gonna go do what a bear does in the woods."
>Charles looks at you like you're an idiot.
>It sounded cooler in you head.
>You grab a roll of toilet paper and head out of the camp.
>On your way out you see Charles packing a glass pipe with what looks like, but is certainly not small crystals of ice.
>You would be more confident in you chances of survival if these guys were not all constantly drinking or getting high.
>you've been out here over a week, how do they still have a supply?
>Snow crunches underfoot but otherwise the woods are quiet. You find a spot behind a tree and do your business.
>As you are cleaning up you hear several muted pops from the direction of the camp.
>Did someone start shooting?
>You run back but as you approach the camp a billow of smoke wafts towards you.
>It smells faintly of bitter citrus. You don't know what it is and you don't want to be breathing it in but you need to get to camp.
>You turn and run perpendicular to the cloud's direction but something is wrong. You feel sluggish and the cold that was nipping your face before is notably absent.
>As you keep moving past the cloud it begins to dissipate so you turn again to head closer to the camp.
>By this point you feel sleepy and disjointed.
>You have to slow down so as to not trip on the uneven soil.
>You push drunkenly through the undergrowth and trip while trying to push between some bushes.
>You can see the camp from your place on the ground covered by the foliage.
>several canisters are embedded in the earth with small wisps of gas still escaping them
>everyone is laid out on the ground. Some are unresponsive, some are groaning like they're in the middle of receiving an expert massage. One guy was unlucky enough to be near the impact point of a gas canister. He is curled up holding tightly to his calf as blood seeps between his fingers but his sedation is overpowering the pain.
>Whatever that gas was, they took a full dose. You're the only one that can still move
>You still have enough of your faculties about you to call James and tell him not to return but as your fumble for the radio you see across the camp a squad of a half dozen daxy emerge from the treeline.
>They are all armored in navy blue kit aside from the one leading them who wears all black with thick gold accenting.
>She has James in tow with a claw around his neck and behind them another daxy has a teenager in tow.
>She is too far away to be heard but she leans down to coo something sweet to him.
>Bizarrely he seems to try to rub up against her like a cat looking for attention.
>The kid just looks scared. His attention split between James' unusual behavior and the camp full of laid out men.
>You do your best to stay quiet and sink into the bush. You didn't carry your rifle with you into the woods but its not like it would have helped at all against a half dozen daxy.
>The daxy stream in to the camp and start searching tents until one finds the man clutching his leg.
>"Male harmed! Salis get over here, bring the kit!"
>Two of the daxy rush over and begin caring for him. One tears off the leg of his pants with her daunting claws while the other begins preparing antiseptic swabs and gauze for clotting the wound.
>One of them starts saying soothing things to him about his safety and happiness but your attention is cut short by the swift sound of a zipper being tugged
>Charles steps out of a yet unchecked tent wearing a gas mask and levels a shotgun at the nearest daxy who happens to be the gold fringed apparent leader.
>She sees him and throws James away from the immediate danger just as Charles catches her in the leg with a slug.
>He's jittery as he tries to rack the shotgun for a second shot and manages to catch the spent shell in the ejection port.
>At the same time the wounded daxy draws a pistol from her side and puts a round in Charles' gut.
>He falls on his back and you see a large syringe with a plume for a tail sticking out of his belly.
>He went out the way he wanted to.
>It amounted to even less than you expected from his plans.
>He tries to lift the gun again but he treats it like it's a hundred pounds heavier. Before he can do anything else the wounded leader and another daxy are upon him, pulling the gun away and holding him down against his insignificant drug suppressed fight for a moment until he loses consciousness.
>Whatever was in that syringe was strong stuff to cut through the meth he was smoking when you left.
>At least they didn't kill him.
>The leader daxy stands up and holds he thigh with a groan.
>James crawls over to the daxy that had just thrown him away a moment ago. "Tassis are you alright? You're bleeding! He hurt you!"
>He tries to grab on to her but she leans down to him with a grimace and holds him at arm's length by his shoulders. "I've had worse, don't you worry about me."
>Its creepy how sweet she is to him.
>She motions to another daxy to take care of him. The daxy pulls him away despite his protests.
>Its even creepier that he's like a blithering pet to her.
>Tassis stands with another grunt and checks over her leg. "Salis I know males are important but you better leave enough supplies in that kit for me."
>Salis finishes tying off a bandage and stands up with the pack. "One of the plates from the pheromone mortar broke off from the impact and embedded in his leg. It's not life threatening and he'll be up and walking in time for our mating ceremony."
>Tassis raises an eyebrow at her. "'Our'? You already laying claim to him?"
>"I touched him first. Doesn't that mean he's mine by right?"
>The medic removes Tassis' thigh armor and inspects the wound. "No penetration from the slug. It looks like your armor shattered and some of it's in your leg. We'll need to get back to base to get it all out of you."
>Tassis hisses through her teeth as Salis injects something into the wound area and begins applying a bandage. "At least wait for the commander to sign off on your mate before you start talking like that. We're calling a transport ship in, I really don't want to walk all the way back to base like this and we shouldn't stress the males anymore."
>A daxy who is bridal carrying a man who is more than willing to cuddle her pipes up from across the camp. "So I got time to take my new mate for a spin?"
>Tassis deadpans. "You really want to take your armor off in this weather?"
>The daxy falters. She looks at the man trying to bury his head in the crook of her neck then at a tent for a moment. "Shit, yer right."
>"You should be looting the camp for more than just a mate anyway." Tassis presses a button on her helmet and calls in for transport as the daxy continue to clean out the camp of any supplies they deem valuable.
>Charles begins to stir from his unconscious state.

>While documenting leopard seals in Antarctica for a 2006 National Geographic magazine story, photographer Paul Nicklen had an experience that he says "will stay with me forever"
>"Leopard seals are the most incredible animals I've ever had the pleasure of photographing," he said. "When you get in the water with a wild animal, you're essentially giving yourself to that animal because, as humans, we're quite helpless and vulnerable in the water. You're at the seal's mercy. You're at the predator's mercy.
>"Not only did the leopard seals not attack as some predicted they would, they fed me penguins, followed me around, and generally put on a nonstop show."
>In the video above, Nicklen explained how an encounter with one particular female leopard seal was especially poignant. The animal had a head larger than a grizzly bear's, and it took his camera and his head into its mouth. But instead of harming him, the seal began to "nurture" him. It began to bring him penguins, first alive, then dead, perhaps assuming that he was a "useless predator in her ocean."
>The top predator apparently tried to feed the weaker Nicklen for four days as he scuba dived in the area, working on the assignment.

I’m glad this new show called Deltarune didn’t make the human boy as the main love interests and plot between these two anthro girls! It’s nice to see a human male being treated as a character and not be used as a female gaze for fan service and be more than just some boy. Glad they didn’t try giving him a shirt that expose their shoulders. That’s the most sexualized design on a human male. Best of all, they remain friends and refuse to do the typical “Anthro girls competing for humie boi’s heart” trope that plagues the entire mainstream entertainment!

Actually, speaking of horror movies there'd be even more genres to play into different species. Prey species horror movies would usually have pred anthros has the villains/monsters. Pred species horror movies might have an even bigger predator as the villain or having it focus more on the humie boys being danger.

Was just struck with such a beautiful epiphany because of this post:
>Greenland Shark banshee, over a thousand years old
>a prolific and almost quasi-mythical serial killer and harvester of men, she has stalked the coast inland of Western Iceland since the days of the island's first major settlement, and by the whispers of century-old tales told by the Norse who landed previously, much longer
>completely blind, her eyes have long since whitened over with an almost imperceptible sky-blue iris, parasites are embedded in and flagellating about on the eyeballs in various spots, starved for water, some already hanging limp, like distended lashes that flick and whip as she turns them
>normally rigid in the water, she drifts several meters below off-shore beneath the tide in a torpor state
>can "taste" the blood of living things from over a kilometer way, and as such, her infamy and such stories have found that any man who recklessly wanders the coasts at night seldom return
>her hunt is unerring and supernatural, the shark's body first finds itself "drawn" towards the man's closest point at the shore, where she is beached for a moment before hunching forward, standing and shadowing the victim(s) with a vague gait that embellishes her head and torso, as they lock forward in such a way that she would be severely straining any abdominal organs, as though one were really and truly puking up their guts
>is known to bury herself within the beaches, a practice which is said to have inspired the Greenlandic tradition of curing regular greenland shark meat before letting it hang out to ferment, sickening, half-rotten digits vibrating unnaturally through the sand to grab at one's vulnerable point, eliciting as little activity as possible
>due to her reliance on conserving as much energy as possible, most of her tactics revolve around hiding in plain sight, the only for sure tell being that unmistakable scent any true Icelander would know, the acrid stench of hákarl

>anthro who asks her humie bf if he would like to try something "kinky" in bed
>the human agrees
>she starts off with rather light stuff. some scratches and maybe light biting
>all is going well but then she accidentally gives him a severe injury. maybe she accidentally bit his neck too hard or something like that.
>she's angry at herself as she feels like she betrayed her bf's trust.
>tries to make it up to him the next day

anthros who want to give you a claiming bite but wait for your consent first.

That reminds me of something.
Let me tell you all about the disappointment of Frozen Homes.

>Probably shouldn't have taken that doll
>Finally mustered the courage to explore that run down building you'd stared at for years
>Once you were inside, it practically called to you
>Now it just stares at you, no matter where you put it or what angle you turn it
>You never see it move but its always looking at you

>Amateur paranormal hunter
>Haven't managed to find anything paranormal yet but I know they are stalking the night.
>Investigate abandoned Japanese-themed restaurant due to reports of spooky noises coming from inside at night.
>Restaurant is mostly empty besides the group cat doll thing that just seems to stare at you.
>You take it home it eventually reveals it is alive and has imprinted on you.
>After draining your balls it vows to be your wife and desires to help you in your crusade against the paranormal.

>Even since you took that doll home, you've been having nightmares.
>Dreams of blood and gore.
>Falling to death.
>Drowning, the fluid you drown in changes sometimes, there was once where it was beer.
>Another was honey.
>There was also that odd non-water water.
>You thought about tossing it out.
>And you did.
>But after a single night of dreamless sleep, you awoke to find it in your living room.
>That night you had the longest and worse nightmares of your life
>You attempted to destroy it with a hammer and you shattered it to pieces and were rewarded with a pleasant night of rest.
>The next day it was back again and whole.
>It seemed to give off a smug, or perhaps amused, feeling, despite its expression not changing.
>Yet again, you had a nightmare.
>This time of you being vivisected and your bones being methodically broken with a hammer.
>You try everything you can think of but the result is still the same.
>It comes back smugly and takes revenge on your attacks.
>Even putting it back from where you took it didn't work.
>At wits end, you give up trying to destroy it.
>Nothing you've attempted has worked.
>As all modern men do when they want to drown out their sorrows, you surf the internet.
>Going to shady sites, you see an advertisement for sex dolls and body pillows.
>Both of which give you ideas in your post-nut clarity.
>You go into the living room and think aloud.
"The nightmares get worse whenever I try to get rid of it..."
>You feel the amusement and smugness oozing off the doll.
"...Maybe if I bring it closer the nightmares will lessen."
>The smugness abates for curiosity.
>You walk over and scoop up the doll, you can feel it try and resist you moving it, but it cannot stop you.
>You carry it over to your bedroom and place on your bed.
>You get under the covers as the doll remains above them.
>The nightmare bit of your sleep seems to have been delayed, but it was outlandishly realistic and brutal.
>You move seems to have caught the doll off-guard, you'll have to go with a more intense strategy.
>The next night, instead of having it on top of the cover, you have it under the cover and spoon with it.
>That really catches it off guard if your nightmares are anything to go by.
>They had the late start of the previous night, but seemed... less real.
>It's actually kind of nice.
>It feels more like a first-person movie than a torture session.
>Waking up you do your subconscious stretching and roll your hips forward.
>Then promptly realize that you were hotdogging her with your morning wood.
>She seems a bit flustered, she's likely never received any treatment like this before being a cursed doll and all.
>...Wait, 'her'? 'She'?
>...Eh, given what you were doing you think she's probably earned being called a she instead of an it.
>You continue spooning her nightly for the next few days and the nightmares keep lessening in intensity and frequency until you have a night where you aren't getting them anymore.
>Perhaps it's linked to your grinding against her as you sleep.
>You've woken up a couple of times because you felt your orgasm building in your sleep because of your passive rubbing.
>About a week or two later, you'd had an odd dream.
>It was the first wet dream you'd had since you were... a teenage.
>Given the dream stuff the doll has done, you chalked it up to it being her doing.
>Still you took it as a sign and started dressing her down before bed.
>Also dressing her when you woke up, because why the hell not? You can't dress her down if she's not clothed.
>You joined her in nudity as well, just for that extra bit of sensation.
>Also to not get cum on your clothes and have it dry, that's a bit of a pain to get out.
>Naturally, you begin having wet dreams nearly every night, sometimes multiple times if you woke up.
>The general theme is that you're tied or otherwise locked down as something rides you.
>Some of them look pretty horrifying, or at least they might've been if she hadn't given you weeks of nightmares to desensitize you.
>She seems unable to resist adding in pain, in the lewd dreams she sometimes makes you experience the sensation of your hip getting broken repeatedly.
>Again, you have to thank her for the torture as it gave you the ability to bypass that dream pain.
>One night as you're getting the both of you ready for bed, you notice that she's had changes made to her previously featureless bumps.
>A set of nipples and a pussy.
>If she's going to provide such a tempting offer, do you have any option to not take her up on it?
>Naturally, you probe her pussy with your fingers, both to act as foreplay and to check for traps or anything.
>You don't feel any spikes and she's not getting any wetter so you line yourself up.
>You take it slow for a bit, more for your own benefit as you want to enjoy this.
>It feels much like you'd expect, except a little warmer and slightly lubed.
>When you do cum, you catch a glimmer in her eyes but it's gone before you can place it.
>You lay down on top of her and pass into the realm of dreams.
>The first thing you note upon entering the dream is the heavy weight on your hips.
>Looking up, you see the doll sitting atop you.
>Meeting your gaze, she shifts from a sitting position into more a looming one with her hands pinning your shoulders.
>You give a couple of testing struggles and find her grip to yield as much as concrete.
>Her face looks down upon you with possessiveness and a set of predatory eyes.
>She stares you down for at least a minute or two, rolling her hips as to prevent you from forgetting what your position is.
>She eventually starts pummeling you into the ground and you feel the illusionary feel of your pelvis cracking under her.
>You've had enough experience with that trick that it doesn't phase you anymore.
>What does catch you off guard is her not stopping after pulling an orgasm out of you.
>She simply continues on, well aware of your overstimulation.
>And she does it again.
>And again.
>And yet again.
>It isn't until your tenth that she finally stops and leans down to whisper her first words to you:
"Mine."
>You awake.
>This time with the seed of nearly a dozen rounds seeping out of the doll.
>You start cleaning her and the bed up, much to her amusement.
>Well, this is certainly better than the nightmares she gave you before.
>You can live with this as part of your routine from now on.

>I’ll never be bought off the black market by a rich queen bee to be her private sex slave
>She’ll never make me her 24/7 dickthrone as a power play, so any other queens visiting for negotiations have to see her tits bounce as she rides.
>She’ll never let the royal guard gangrape me on days she has to be at a different hive

Imagine getting seduced by a colony/hive forming anthro and before you know it your surrounded by a countries worth of daughters and they wont let you leave.

A colony built a hive around you while you slept after having sex with the queen?

don't worry she will take good care of you
you'll of course be living with her and sleeping right next to her since she only has 1 bedroom

Food and lodging cost extra. You can take on extra duties to cover the cost.

>Insists on rubbing her entire body over your face and neck before you go outside to make sure none of those giant hussies try to claim her man, despite this her scent is still barely noticeable and you have to turn away anthros that think you're unclaimed, often having to resort to showing them her little red "claiming bites" she leaves on your neck to prove that you're with someone

Do you think Canines and felines wouldn't like each other?

Absolutely
>Canines see felines as pretentious, lazy, entitled, selfish, whorish, sneaky, and extravagant
>Felines see canines as annoying, loud, clingy, dirty, unsophisticated, brutish, stupid, and ugly

Nah just become a monster tamer/Bard find monsters willing to fight for you.

On that note, I like the idea of (you) being a summoner and accidentally summoning an anthro who wants to fuck you.
>Be anon, human studying to be a mage
>Final exam comes where you're required to summon a monster to serve you.
>You need to pass this exam to actually graduate so it is do or die.
>Everyone keeps summoning fantastic beasts that listen to their every command.
>Your turn eventually comes and you can feel all the eyes on you.
>You begin the ritual and the largest, nasty shewolf you've ever seen pops out of the summoning circle.
>You try to command her but she won't respond to any of them.
>Things like, "I'm your master beast".
>The wolf gives you a smug smile and tells you, "This is a contract that we'll have to negotiate. I refuse to do your bidding without proper compensation"
"Compensation?"
>She walks over to you and takes a huge sniff on top of your head.
>The shewolf continues, "Your virginity, offer it to me and I will do a task for you."
>It was stated loudly enough everyone is laughing.
>You're going to have to accept if you want to pass the class

> Only been a few years since humanity discovered basic FTL travel and has begun exploring surrounding star systems
> You are among the survey team that very unexpectedly makes first contact with the Fenrisians
> Despite none of you being trained for this, it goes amazingly well, the all-female crew of Fenrisians is a bit reserved, but tremendously welcoming all the same
> They treat you a lot like precocious children
> Given their comparative tech level and physiques, it's not entirely unwarranted
> As the awkwardness begins to fade, they start smiling a lot more, patting humans on the head, that sort of thing
> Maybe not entirely respectful, but clearly affectionate
> Several months pass and formal diplomatic relations are opened
> As part of the initial First Contact team you are included, more as a formality than anything else
> Eventually you are invited to a tour of their home planet, which you accept
> En route aboard their ship, the crew get increasingly familiar, almost cooing at you quite often
> Evidently humans are absolutely adorable to them
> They really seem to enjoy picking you up or otherwise showing off their strength
> Sometimes seem a little.... flushed when they do it
> You're just projecting
> .... You are.... right?
> Fenris is far enough away that it takes a couple of weeks to reach even with their FTL drives
> One of your assigned guards comes to you one day and informs you with a very sour look on her face that due to a logistical screwup they will have to make a brief stop at a neutral refueling station along the way
> You assure her you don't mind, and even beg her for permission to disembark and look around during the stop
> Officially humanity hasn't been introduced to any other races yet, but you're feeling adventurous
> Your guard looks like she's just eaten a raw lemon
> But despite how they treat you like a kid, they've yet to actually refuse any of your requests
> You go aboard the station under the close watch of four Fenrisian bodyguards
> It's an uneventful as your first stop at an alien gas station can be, for the most part
> You do get a lot of odd looks but that's not exactly unexpected
> The Fenrisians seem pretty uncomfortable with you being exposed like this, but since they're bodyguards and you're technically a diplomat that's not exactly unexpected either
> You're almost back to the ship when it goes wrong
> Apparently the one angle your guards didn't think to watch, was straight up
> You jump in startled fright as the bat-like anthro lands only inches away from you, but don't make it too far before she grabs you tightly and pulls you against herself
> All four Fenrisians immediately fall into clear attack stances, but hesitate with you directly in the way
> You know enough of their language at this point to understand the murderously growled command to let you go on the authority of the Fenrisian Empire
> The bat gives off an amused laugh and responds in a language you don't understand, but sounding unimpressed
> The leader of your detail steps forward and says something you have a harder time parsing, something about diplomat status and...
> Uh... you're not sure, actually
> You think you made out the root-sounds for the words.... 'guard' and 'race?' And...
> ... 'Love?'
> At that the bat's grin slackens
> A couple of uneasy seconds of silence later, she lets you go and you are RUSHED by two of your guards, one of whom physically picks you up and starts carrying you off back to the ship
> Just barely, as you lose sight of the bat and your remaining two guards around a corner, you hear something you manage to understand a bit more clearly
> The translation is a bit crude, but in English you suppose it'd be something like 'spread the word'
> Just as soon as you've parsed that, you hear the *SLAM* sound of something hitting the wall very hard
> You feel a hand gently turn your chin away from where you'd been craning to hear the voices behind you
> The guard carrying you smiles down gently, and tells you not to worry about any of that
> You're in very good hands

>Anthrostate assigns you a bear commissar as a wife named Alina
>Get a fancy dress uniform lined with medals for who knows what, officers cap, polished leather shoes, etc. all for free in the assignment center
>Turns out your job is to follow Alina around as she does inspections of local communities making sure that silly humans don't try to run from their furry guardians, that anthrostate propaganda is proudly displayed in all public areas, and keeping unwanted foreign influences from polluting the minds of anthrostate citizens
>You take your job very seriously helping to convince your fellow humans of the inherent superiority of the anthrostate and giving loud impassioned speeches about the benevolency of our furred superiors, often citing experiences with your wife as examples
>She doesn't smile much, but when you give your speeches she's always in the back of the crowd where she thinks you can't see her, a poorly suppressed smile on her maw
>During a routine inspection of a home you find traces of illegal food products smuggled over from the neighboring republic of trashnistria prompting a much larger investigation leading to several arrests of foreign spies
>This act earns you and your favorite she-bear a few new medals, not to mention a spot in a newly built government housing unit!
>Life is good for the next several weeks, more arrests, more speeches, more commendations from your superiors
>After another day hard at work hanging up some new banners at a local market you stop to buy some groceries while she goes back to headquarters to fill out some paperwork
>A paper bag full of food in each hand you make your way back the apartment, get your keys out, open the door and-
>Your consciousness returns painfully
>There's a throbbing pain on your forehead, must have been where someone knocked you out
>You try to stand up only to realize your ankles are tied to the chair you're sitting in and your wrists are tied tightly behind your back
>Your gaze rises and Alina is standing in front of you in her full dress uniform, you seem to be in one of the interrogation rooms deep in the bowels of the state police headquarters
>Beside her are three other commissars, you recognize two of them as a paired human/anthro couple just like you and your wife except the anthro in this case was a lanky arctic fox
>They're lower ranking than you and Alina, not having as made nearly as many arrests or investigations
>The third commissar is your superior officer, a grizzled older wolfess with piercing blue eyes and smoldering cigarette hanging from her mouth
>You look back to Alina
>Her expression is stoic but you detect just the faintest hints of panic behind her eyes
>You try to speak only to find a piece of cloth has been tied around your mouth, muffled half words are the best you can manage
>Noticing you're awake the wolfess hands a paper to your wife
>"Read it to him." She coldly commands
>She takes the paper and begins reading
>"Attention, attention, Commissar Anon Anonov has been accused of the following crimes: illegal storage of prohibited items, conspiracy to commit espionage against state assets, conspiracy to assassinate state representatives, illegal consumption of prohibited literature, and...high treason against the state."
>Her hands begin gripping the paper so tightly her claws puncture it
>"After a period of lawful deliberation the justice department of the state has found Anon Anonov guilty of all crimes. Due to his association with the commissariat punishment shall be determined by his superior officer."
>She looks up to you with shocked expression and the paper drops from her paws
>Your CO shakes her head and spits out her cigarette, grinding it against the cold concrete floor
>"Anonov I had so much faith in you, you were doing so well, then I order a random inspection of your new domicile and I can't believe what they found. Documents linking you to foreign spy networks, illegal weapons, pamphlets encouraging human male and human female pairings, and all these items covered in your fingerprints! It's utterly unthinkable one of my own would do this."
>She turns to Alina
>"Luckily for you everything they found could only be linked to Anon, otherwise you would be in the same position he is. You're a nice girl, never given me or the state any trouble, and for your loyal service I'm willing to classify all of this for your sake. You shouldn’t expect any more promotions in this lifetime but you’ll always have a roof over your head. However, I do have one little favor to ask. Just to make sure you really are on the right side."
>The wolfess takes her pistol out of its holster and turns it around so Alina can take it
>"The Justice department left his punishment up to me and I say this traitor gets the death penalty. One shot to the head to be administered by you. Keep it clean."
>Alina just stares at the pistol for a few moments before hesitantly taking it, pointing it down by her side
>”But Senior Commissar how can we be sure the items the other two found are legitimate? I’ve known Anonov for quite some time and I have no reason to suspect-“
>The white furred vixen cuts her off
>”Do not argue with the senior commissar bear! The evidence me and my husband found is irrefutable!”
>The man beside lovingly rubs the top of her head causing her eyes to go half lidded
>”That’s right honey, irrefutable.”
>Alina stares at the wolfess for guidance
>”What the other two say is right, I inspected everything they found myself.”
>In a split second everything makes sense to you
>The two junior commissars, they planted the evidence against you to try and gain promotions by fucking over their comrades instead doing things the right way like you and Alina
>They probably planned on implicating both of you but since you arrived at the house alone they couldn’t put her fingerprints on anything
>Not that it mattered, your life and Alinas career are over at this point
>You struggle against your bindings with all the strength you can muster while shouting muffled pleas to Alina and the wolfess, desperately trying to get them to do anything other than continue with this insidious plot
>They all watch you struggle, the fox and her husband with smug grins and Alina with a despondent expression
>The wolfess just glares at you silently
>Eventually she’s had enough hesitation from Alina
>”Commissar Alina! Fulfill your duty to the anthrostate and terminate this traitor. Prove your loyalty.”
>”Ya! Do it already she-bear! We’re getting tired of waiting.” The fox’s husband shouts
>”Y-yes senior commissar.” Alina says, her voice on the verge of cracking
>You watch Alina raise the pistol through your tear soaked eyes
>Your muffled cries have devolved into muffled whimpers and with one last impotent struggle against your restraints you give up and remain still
>All you can do is look into Alinas eyes and softly shake your head side to side as she points the muzzle right at your forehead
>The fox and her husband say something but it fades into the background as you choose your last words
>You know she won’t be able to understand you through the gag but you decide to say them anyway
>”Alina, it’s not your fault. I still love you. We’ll meet again in the next life. I know it.”
>Her finger curls around the trigger
>Her grip tightens
>Then she suddenly brings the pistol up to her face
>”Oh, I forgot to take the safety off.”
>”Stupid bear, stop procrastinating and kill him before I have to.” The fox spits
>She flicks a switch on the pistol
>”Okay, safety is off.” She turns to the fox and points the pistol at her. “Why don’t you check it for me?”
>The vixen can only give her a confused look before Alina pulls the trigger twice, shooting her square in the chest
>The fox’s husband tries to get his own pistol out but is shot down before he can even open his holster
>Your superior grabs at her own holster only to realize the bear already has her sidearm
>Instead of shooting her like the others Alina closes the distance between them and gives her a knockout punch right to the head
>She crumples to the ground, blood dribbling out of her nose
>Alina walks in front of you and cuts your gag off with a claw
>She puts two paws on either side of your head and stares into your soul
>”Is what they said true? That you’re a traitor?”
>”No Alina! It’s all bullshit! Those bastards planted the evidence after I came back home.”
>She continues staring at you for several tense seconds before giving you a mighty bear hug and cutting your restraints
>She helps you to your feet
>”So what now? The courts still think I’m a traitor and you just murdered two commissars. We’re totally fucked.”
>”Baby steps Anon. First we need to get out of this building. We’ll make our way to the garage then acquire one of the police cruisers. With a full tank of gas we should be able to make it to the border.”
>You shake your head in disbelief
>”The border? And then what? Even if we make it past the last checkpoint no country is going to take in a couple of murderous former commissars from the anthrostate. And there’s no way we’ll blend into the populace for very long.”
>Alina begins methodically looting the bodies on the floor for their pistols, wallets, and spare ammunition
>”We’ll drive to the uninhabited zone then.” She states confidently
>”Nobody lives there Alina. It’s all just wilderness, we’ll die of starvation or get eaten by wild animals.”
>”Better than getting sent to the gulag mining rocks for the rest of our lives.”
>Well, she has a point
>”Okay fine, we’ll steal a cruiser then make a run for the uninhabited zone. But how the hell are we getting to the garage?”
>”I’m doing a prisoner transport on the orders of the senior commissar and you’re the prisoner. If anyone asks I’ll just show them the paper with your conviction.”
>You snatch the paper off the ground and present it to her
>”Good idea, but what’s the plan if they don’t believe you?”
>She retrieves the paper and hands you a couple of pistols
>”We’ll each have two pistols with plenty of ammunition. Enough to put up a decent fight as we dash to the garage.”
>She strips a bullet from a spare magazine and hands it to you
>”But keep one for yourself, just in case we don’t”
>You stare at the shiny piece of metal in your hand before closing it in your fist
>”Alina, either I’m making it to the garage with you or not at all.”
>She places a paw gently on your shoulder
>”Same my dearest Anon, same.”
>After both of you gather your nerves and fix your uniforms you stand by the door leading out of the interrogation room, and open it

Just gonna get this out of my system.
>You were absolutely against the current situation.
>Tall, lanky, with milk-white scales and blood-red eyes, the snake woman peered down at you from the doorway.
>Her eyes looked past you to your one-bedroom apartment while you read the letter she passed you for the umpteenth time in five minutes
>"Anon. I'm sending over a co-worker to stay with you for a couple of days. She's been relocated to your city, but her apartment has an infestation and is being fumigated. Letting her borrow your couch is cheaper than a hotel, so please show some kindness. ---Dad"
>"P.S. I know how you feel about anthros, but try to man up for a couple of days."
>You really hated when he did shit like this...
>"Sso, as you can see, your father has given the okay. I promise I won't be a bother."
>You want to close the door and wash your hands of this, but you already know you'll be getting an earful from the old man if you did
>Also, you guess, it'd be kind of a dick move
>Crumpling the note and tossing it in the bin, you step aside and let the beanpole into your home
>"You won't regret this." she says as she ducks under the doorframe, a set of bags rolling behind her
>The rest of the afternoon was fairly uneventful. You gave your sudden roommate the tour of the place, let her know about your early wakeup times, and told her about what foods not to touch in the fridge
>To her credit, she seemed to absorb everything, nodding along with your explanations and respecting the boundaries you set up
>When all was said and done, you settled back down and resumed your zombified movie watching
>At some point you heard the shower start, and felt satisfied that she was doing her own thing
>Nearly an hour later she...was still in the shower
>You would be concerned, but you can hear her off-key singing from here
>Fuck it, you need sleep and no amount of weird snake lady singing is going to stop you
>You give one last look towards the bathroom door, then retire
>That night, your dreams took on a strange tone
>You were being dragged off to some pyramid by guards and mummified
>All the while some cat they worshiped danced in the background to the music a camel was playing past the smoke of his cigarette
>You were going to die
>You were so cold...
>You woke up, but a scaly hand covered your mouth and scream
>"Sssh." hissed a voice in your ear, making your skin prickle
>Something tightened around your legs
>"Just let me sleep here. Where it's warm."
>Who the hell...oh
>Oh god it's the snake!
>Your eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a white form could be seen moving around your
>And sure enough, the ruby orb of her eye watched you from the side as something wrapped around your legs
>You would guess it's HER legs but that amount of flexibility wasn't normal, right?
>Every breath brought her body closer to yours, pressed her form closer to yours and stopped your struggling a little bit more
>You wanted to shout, to tell her to fuck off, but that hand stayed tight
>She was WAY stronger than her wiry frame had implied
>"Just relax. I won't bite." she paused, and added, "Not unless you want me to."
>Maybe it was the tone of her voice, maybe it was the way she pressed against you. Maybe it was even the adrenaline going to the entirely WRONG part of your body
>But the one part of you that wasn't being constricted sprung free from your boxers in defiance
>You would hope that she didn't notice during her molestation, but her chuckles let you know otherwise
>A cold finger grazed against you, stealing away the heat but doing nothing to remove its rigidity
>More followed, coiling around you there as well
>You felt your face flush, only for that heat to be wicked away by her other hand as she turned your face to hers
>"Your father warned me that you were...opposed, to nonhumans. That you'd slam the door in my face."
>Her neck coiled around behind yours, head resting on your other shoulder
>"Perhaps he was wrong."
>You looked down to your traitorous erection
>She did as well, touching as your arousal leaked out
>Slow and nimble fingers spread it around, gliding further and further down as they slicked the scales and skin
>Your breath came out in a shudder, and you felt her laugh vibrate through you
>"Should I keep going?"
>NO! She should absolutely not! She should let you go and go back to the couch before she gets kicked out and has to return to that gas chamber of an apartment
>Is what you wanted to say. Instead you nodded, much to your own surprise
>That devilish tongue flicked your ear, sending a shock through your head
>By then, you'd been completely lubed up from the fluids of your own making
>The hand gripped your head, just enough pressure to be felt without being painful
>The descent down was tortuously slow
>You couldn't control your breathing as she watched your reaction from her perch on your shoulder
>You had to bite your lip to keep from groaning from this attention
>All the while she whispered things into your ear
>Terrible things and vulgar praises
>Each second felt like hours as she claimed your manhood for herself
>At some point her fingers started to constrict, milking you in steady wave against
>By the time her palm made contact with your groin, your hips moved what little they could to meet it
>You were shamefully clo-
>"Let me stay for the month."
>What?
>"You can have more of this, if you do."
>Is she REALLY-
>Her fingers reached down to massage your testes
>This time you couldn't suppress it, groaning in defeat
>"You could feel so much better."
>The milking intensified
>"You could indulge in this...shameful act."
>...
>"It doesn't count if you're forced, right?"
>...you guess...
>"You have no way of controlling this, right?"
>Yeah. Yeah, you were completely overwhelmed..."
>"So you should let me stay. That I can't blackmail you."
>...guess you don't have a choice
>She chuckles again
>"Good boy. Forbidden fruit is so sweet, isn't it?"
>You aren't aware of what exactly happened past that point
>Only vague sensations surface in your memories
>You remember claws in your shoulders and legs around your waist, as you tried to push against something impossibly tight and heavy
>You recall sibilant whispers in your ears that promised all sorts of terribly wonderful and wonderfully terrible things
>You kind of remember the feelings of fangs in your neck, mind reeling with the idea of someone seeing your "mark" as you go about your day
>You can still feel the shape of a forked tongue against yours, while your moans were muffled by infinite white
>The visage of two red orbs bobbing above your crotch, and two white hands holding yours down is especially prominent
>But most of all, the thing that you couldn't forget if you tried, was the morning after
>You awoke alone, drenched in sweat, and half hanging out of your bed
>Your entire body ached, and your swear you could taste something weirdly familiar at the back of your throat
>As you stumbled into the living room, your roommate seemed to be snoring peacefully on the couch
>Your memory from last night came flooding back and were summarily pushed back down
>You needed coffee. Strong coffee.
>"Make me a cup too." hissed a voice from behind
>You didn't even hear her move, but the feeling of her head on your shoulder was too familiar
>"You look like hell." she observed, "had a rough night?"
>Of course. She-
>"I slept great, in case your were wondering. Your couch is surprisingly comfortable."
>Wait...
>"You seemed to be talking in your sleep, though."
>Hang on...
>"Whatever you were DREAMING about, it must have been intense."
>You pause mid-pour and make eye contact with your roommate
>"By the way...I might need to stay here a bit longer. Maybe a month, maybe more."
>A scaled hand rest on your other shoulder, thumb tracing over a particularly tender spot
>"You don't mind, right?"

So, the thread’s discussed before how mustelids might have a special medical card obligating guys to help them out during their heat. But what happens in an area with a significant mustelid population? I suspect it depends on whether mustelids’ heat cycles synch and how much variance there is. If your friends, coworkers, and random passers-by just periodically go into heat during the season, cool, everyone just takes their turn I guess. But if they do synch then I can only imagine how bugfuck crazy it would get for a human guy. Fights breaking out over who gets to ride your dick or your face. And you probably wouldn’t be able to escape from them on the net either - you just get bombarded with thirsty comments, simping, unexpected pussy/tit pics, the works. In the synch case you would probably want to stock up on as much water as possible. You’ll need it.

Im pretty sure there would be some sort of government program or a special hospital wing for mustelids during heat
Naturally humans who volunteer to help mustelids during heat are well compensated
humans who volunteer are also almost always marry the mustelid they assisted
humans are even forced to help them during the heat wave if they are single

That would be a fun idea for a green/story
Anon’s a single dude and he gets a letter telling him to do his duty in the heat ward/wing. Maybe on his way over he gets cat-called/harassed by some mustelids that are starting to go into heat but aren’t quite at the stage where they need to go into the hospital themselves.
You even have a ready-made name in “Heatwave”

>the worst part is he's making more doing that then he ever did stealing shit

Concept: Dominant anthro ladies who don't start that way. When you first meet them they're shy and reserved, and the more they're coaxed from their shell, the more they find themselves by literally taking control of you and your life. They just needed a warm, caring subby to ignite their passions and give them a prize to fixate on.

>due to an abusive single mother, Anon becomes a bully
>he ends up bullying a shy nerdy anthro.
>one day she starts to hit a growth spurt and then hits the gym
>she becomes increasingly defiant of Anon until she starts bullying him
>one day she goes to bully Anon alone outside, only to find him treating a burn mark on his shoulder
>she confronts him and forces a confession out of him
>his mother had gotten drunk last night and had put a cigarette out on his arm
>enraged, the anthro drags him to the principal’s office and makes him show the burn
>cps gets called and she makes Anon stay at her house for the next few days
>the investigation concludes and custody of Anon is given to his estranged father
>from then on she continues to bully Anon, but it takes on a much different form
>hugging him from behind, making him sit in her lap, running her paws through his hair in class.
>she has finally achieved her goal of breaking down her former bully.

Cps needs to move Anon to protect him from retaliation.
Anon gets pressured by the waifur to accept her offer for a temporary shelter home.

>Anon finds himself in the room of his former victim, then heckler, now...??
>it's still a girl's room, and a nerdy one at that.
>soft toys and shelves of manga in evidence, alongside some weeby posters and figurines
>her bed vaguely resembles an enormous, pillowy mass of cotton marshmallows
>but there's also a clear delineation between all that and the spartan floorspace dedicated to a variety of training mats, weights, and even a rowing machine (guess her parents must get her what she wants)
>full length mirror even has a few photos stuck to it, tracking her progress from the shorter, dumpy little girl to the powerful woman leering over him right now with a claw resting firmly, but reassuringly on his shoulder
>Anon expected the place to stink of flowers and perfurme too, that's what girls like right?
>instead everything just kind of smells like... her. It's a space where she lives and uses her body freely
>it permeates everything. It isn't what would jump to mind when he thinks of 'good' smells, but there's something nice about it all the same, something he can't quite pin down
>she hasn't said anything since they sat down on her bed
>she's just staring at thim through those big, dorky glasses of hers
>he stole those from her back in 6th grade, and only gave them back when he got busted for it
>she'd cried when she'd put them back on, the lenses getting all foggy
>The memory made him feel like shit now, especially with the way her stare was magnified by the same lenses.
>he fidgets and squirms beneath it
>"S-so uh..."
>he breaks the gaze and looks around in a panic for something distracting
>his bag, bingo
>he fishes out a textbook
>"Should we study or something?"
>she still doesn't say anything, she just raises an eyebrow, and looks at him like he's the biggest idiot there was
>Without taking her eyes off him, she bats the paperback booklet aside
>Anon watches it spin and bounce off the floor as he feels himself get pushed down into the soft blankets.

>Your mother introduces you to her friends neet daughter
>they want you to become a couple and eventually married so they can have grandchildren

Would humans be cheerleaders in a adhg universe?
i bet alot of anthros would love it if skimpily dressed humies cheered them on while they played sports

>She's your neighbor in the apartment next door
>Once in a while when coming home from work you see her hauling several fully-stuffed bags of trash from her unit
>She always makes some crude sexual remark to you as you pass by
>It's her half-assed way of trying to hit on you/compliment you
>You brush it off, head into your unit, and shut and lock the door
>She sighs to herself as she continues towards the trash chute, feeling sad that she still hasn't gotten you to pay her any attention

God I wish we could have the roles reversed.
>getting cat-called by anthros while walking at night.
>your wife, a foot taller than you, pulls you closer to her as you walk by a group of rough looking carnivores.
>waiting for wife while she's in the bathroom or something, a shortstack mouse saunters over and starts teasing, asking if you're really married.
"Yes. He's sure."
>A stern, familiar voice says from behind you, as you feel your wife's hand firmly grasp your shoulder.
"Fuckin 'carnies... Leme know when you get sick of being the chew-toy for some mutt."
>she scowls up at your wife for a moment before looking back down to wink at you.
>she turns and walks away, but there's no way her hips are swaying like that by accident.
>you turn around and look up at your wife, her haunches raised, staring a hole into the back of the mouses head.
>reaching up, you stroke the underside of her chin as you move your hand to her cheek.
>wife is instantly soothed, and the rest of your day is normal, aside from your wife being even more publicly affectionate towards you than usual.
>you think you notice her give a scanning glance around the food court after licking your face.
>get home, and barely get your shoes off before she's dragging you to the bedroom by the back of your shirt.
>satisfied smile as you allow yourself to be dragged off for an hour or so before making dinner.

>It was said that in days of antiquity, when unclaimed men were a rarity, it was said that women of nobility and pedigree would engage at the mouth of busy thoroughfares, epees in paw, to engage in a dignified, if bloody exchange of clamancy and finesse in jabs and slashes, which called upon the refinement of the Anthro spirit against the nature of their inherent bodily advantages, such as claws and fangs; a symbol of utmost class in ages gone.
>The bout would commence upon the willing acknowledgement of one another's names, and a removal of their tops and as such, grievous injuries as well as death were not an unusual sight for melees lasting over half an hour, where the victor, whether by technicality or surrender of the foe, would assume direct and immediate ownership of the rival's "skin", as men were sometimes known in these discourses.
>For an opponent who willing waived the challenge for their life, these furs would find themselves in a state of inexorable shame, and frequently demerited of titles, other property and even their own life.
>These fencing displays were but one of the many examples of how valued human males were not just as a mate, but a commodity in Anthro societies of the distant past.

>Be flying fox
>Work for the anti-Anthrostate equivalent of the CIA
>Literal spook
>Rabid human rights activist
>Help escapees from the Anthrostate adjust to normal life
>Secretly passive-aggressive and borderline misandrist

>Force Anon to listen to Radio Free Anthrostate on the way to the embassy
>We're helping cartels run drugs to finance another war in the developing world
>Paranoid by Black Sabbath plays in the background
>Drowned out slightly by the bales of cocaine rattling around in the back of the truck

>go to an anime/game con
>nerdy anthros in cosplay ranging from very accurate to cardboard cutouts being emboldened by the environment and their costumes trying to flirt/molest you
>or you actually went in cosplay yourself
>getting asked to have a picture by an anthro who looks ready to drop spaghetti
>see if you can tease some aggresion out of her and lean into her when she hover hands for the picture
>let her grope you some to give her something to remember or have the spark to go after the humie boy she likes
>hopefully you didn't accidentally get him raped from giving her the confidence boost
>oh well, time to tease more anthro girls until you find one horny enough to pounce

>anon builds a cabin in the woods
>US martials and FBI check up on him, cant have a humie out all alone in the woods where there is danger
>ruby ridge, i hate the antichrist, etc
>held down and forced to drink corn syrup
>the conspiracies are true! he is domesticated on the spot and has a shotgun marriage with one of the feds

>when you magic teacher/master is a beastkin
>when it's a female beastkin
>wears no clothes aside from some jewelry and and a mage hat
>could just as easily crush you in her paw as with her magic

>shielding yourself from her spells that will make you "go into heat"

>etc

> As alien invasions go, it could have been a lot worse, really
> Well.... maybe even 'invasion' is a bit too harsh
> On the surface the treaty between humanity and the Fenrisians is one of equality and mutual friendship
> Only once humanity had begun to get some sort of grasp of politics on the intergalactic scale, and just how powerful their newfound 'allies' were, did the truth become fully clear
> In your species' haste to establish friendly relations with the first intelligent species they found, they hadn't done their homework first
> The two of you are equal partners on the surface but very clearly the vassals of the Fenrisians in any real sense
> And yet... surprisingly, not much had radically changed
> A ton of Fenrisians had chosen to move to Earth, but the Embassy was fairly selective in who they allowed to come - you'd been told in confidence by a friend in the diplomatic service that it was treated by the Empire as a reward posting for those wolves who'd distinguished themselves somehow
> Your initial suspicions about how the Fenrisians saw your kind had been thoroughly confirmed as they proceeded to fuck as many humans as they could, but...
> Despite the overwhelming power disparity on the personal and political scales, they never used force when they went about it
> Apparently, seducing humans was treated as something of a sport by their kind
> Using force worked, but it was entirely too easy and 'poisoned the well,' so to speak
> Much, much more satisfying was to lure in humans by raw force of presence and charisma instead
> Apparently, a Fenrisian's ability to woo a human into bed was a great point of pride and source of bragging rights among those who had emigrated to Earth
> The intelligence services had spied in on quite a few gambles about just how quickly a wolf could talk any given human into bed
> And with just how powerful, alluring, exotic, and protective they were, not that many could actually resist
> And so as time went on, wolves became an increasingly common sight on Earth, as the Empire tightened its grip on its latest conquest
> Any incursions into human space were quickly and violently dealt with, the Fenrisians more than happy to fulfill their end of the bargain in exchange for the partnership they'd found
> Only a few years later, as the ties between Earth and Fenris continued to solidify, would you hear confirm what you had increasingly begun to privately suspect
> It turns out, the Fenrisian Empire held enough planets that it would often categorize them in terms of the resources they would provide
> Earth was no exception
> And it seemed your home had been placed in the Luxury Goods category
> Specifically, you were all classified as a 'pleasure world'

>magic school of some sort
>group of human boys that are inexperienced mages
>each one has a specialty in different magic abilities/schools
>get assigned missions/tests to deal with magical events/disturbances/anomalies/etc
>mostly dealing with magical creatures/monsters
>basically an excuse for them to get fucked hard by various anthros and monsters
>like common beasts using and harnessing magic for their own sexual gratification/breeding
>more extreme cases of the boy's magic being stolen/drained/hijacked
>each one is a different level into wanting to be sexually destroyed by the beasts

Main plot points I'd think would work well:
> anon's main love interest was part of the first contact group. Later both were put into the diplomatic envoy together.
> Ethical Dilemma would be the fact earth is basically a colony planet for a far more advanced space empire. They are very well taken care of, but they almost have no say in what they do in space and are basically treated as a child brothel.
> anon and interests relationship is strained near the middle/end because he starts to believe that he failed diplomatically or he believes that humanity is a slave state or something along those lines. Trys to flee the planet and hide out among the stars or something.
>concludes with confrontation with interest, realization that love interest very much loves anon, submits, starts a family.
>throw in some political situations with other planets and species like you already did with the space gas station. Verge of war because wolf empire won't share humies, etc.

>hao is supposed to be some kind of uber sadist dom
>/adhg/ still finds a way to make jokes about her
I love this place

She's deceptively human in her personal rhythm and that's appreciated
>maintains an unerring façade in her official positions
>but harbors a real beast deep within
>is crushingly devious and dismissive to those not valuable to the State of the maintaining of her position therein
>finds those willing to partake in that side of her exceptionally intriguing
>loves putting the pressure on these few, letting the gravity of their decisions sink in like stone
>yet when against all odds, they refuse to break, and she's fully ensnared them in her web...
>a different Tanuki comes out

>you will never be taken as a mate by a young daxy sergeant when humanity is inducted into the empire
>you will never be calmed by breathing in her pheromones and her loving encouragement
>you will never see the galaxy at her side
>you will never raise a big family of scaled daughters and human sons with her

"Alight' lads, is penis inspection day!"
>The chief inspector declares.
>When you signed up for human drug trials you weren't expecting this, then again you really didn't know what to expect.
>Regardless, you weren't expecting to have your dick measured and toyed with by several anthros once a week.
>Honestly, the offer seemed too good to be true.
>Free room and board on top of getting paid and all you have to do is just wait around for a drug to take affect?
>Hell, they even offered moving services.
>Unfortunately, you, like a dumbass, somehow missed that the contract was for four years and you can only get out of it if you have a severe allergic reaction.
>You enter your testing room.
"You know the drill, strip down."
>It was difficult getting used to being naked in front of two anthros, but the bright lights and scientific tools helped in some odd way.
"Five-point-seven percent increase in testicle size."
>In hindsight, you're glad that these drug trials were for 'male-enhancements' instead of painkillers or something.
"Penis length has increased to twenty-three-point-four centimeters."
>You know the routine now, that's the last check they do before the examination is officially over.
>But then comes the unofficial examination.
>The scientist that was taking the notes opens up her lab coat to reveal her fur covered breasts and lack of any fabric beneath.
>The one who was measuring you had already rolled a condom onto you.
>The note-taker turns your head to the side and plants your face between her tits and whispers:
"Last week the most you came was twenty-three milliliters, think you can beat it?"
>You try to murmur out a 'Yes', but speaking while being smothered is difficult.
>Her response is an amused huff as other scientist starts rolling her hips back.
>You emerge a hour later and stumbling into a wall.
>Damn they're insatiable, you think you used five condoms, at least.
>You don't know why they have a 'taste test' but you're not complaining.

>join cult of sekhmet
>since you're a young human male you get a specific job
>pampering and caring for the "avatars of sekhmet"
>which are actually just any and all anthro lionesses at the temple
>they can do whatever they want to and you have to obey any order they give
>all of them are big amazons of beast women just like sekhmet herself
>even if you weren't part of the cult of sekhmet they'd be able to force you to whatever they wanted from their size and strength
>mostly they want sex or for you to sexually pleasure them due to soft human tongue and hands
>mostly sex since sekhmet is also a fertility goddess
>also since you're an official member and have the job of caring for the avatars of the goddess you have to wear certain clothes and/or jewelry to denote that to others
>which just means the lionesses can easily spot you from a distance and tell you apart from other humans
>and you don't stop being part of the cult when you leave the temple so the lionesses can still do whatever they want to and tell you do anything they want still
>sometimes share woes and your aches at a bar that members of different cults/temples frequent too
>mostly bitching at each other who has it worse
>the guy from the anubis/anput cult complaining of always smelling of dog saliva, the sobek cult guy complaining of nearly drowning, bastet cultist complaining of all the pouncing and gift of dead mice, and so on
>but everyone always shuts up when the taweret cultist hobbles in
>also money being exchanged due those losing the bet on when his hips will be broken by hippo ass

Why are anthros better endowed than roasties?

Superior genetics. Imagine the seething from human women over species who got better assets just from their species
>cow/sheep/milky species being titty monsters
>rabbits/kangaroos having amazing legs and hips with no work
>minks having amazing fur even if they're NEETs
>weasel/ferret girls can out do human gymnasts in flexibility at birth
>bear girls having big everything plus bear strength
>fox girls don't even need to bother with makeup due to how appealing fox faces are naturally
>wolf girls being prime tomboys and built like it
>spotted hyenas being natural amazons
>etc

>anon gets hired as a jail guard
>kind of a weird hiring process. he had a comfortable, sedentary deskjob when a recruiter reached out to him out of the blue
>never asked for qualifications, of which anon has none pertaining to keeping the inmates restrained or docile
>the pay would make you think you were seeing double though
>anon starts his first day on the job
>the whole jail is in the pocket of a crimelord housed there
>she wanted access to a cute humie and he is how the demand was fulfilled, whether he knows it or not and whether he wants it or not.

>Anthro gangs tend to be made up of the same species
>If the prison hires a bunch of anthros there's the risk of a guard allying with their own species and giving favors to prison gangs, giving some prisoners better treatment, maybe even helping in an escape attempt
>Humies however are almost never a consenting member of a gang and with practically no humies in the prison system in the first place there's no risk of them allying with the prisoners
>Or maybe humies have a natural calming effect on anthros, thus causing some of the most dangerous ones to tone down their violent tendencies when a human is around

> Be Anon, extremely unsuccessful scientist
> All of your research turns to shit, none of your grant requests are accepted, none of your contemporaries like you, and you spend the entirety of your 20s scraping trying to make ends meet and failing at everything you try
> On your latest birthday, depressed and completely jaded, you decide 'fuck it' and just live in the moment for a while
> Living in the moment involves drugs, you decide
> A lot of drugs
> A LOT of drugs
> Surprising how easy it is to get your hands on LSD when you're a scientist
> Wake up three weeks later
> Cannot remember a single fucking thing that happened between then and now
> The large, muscular, blue furry woman smiling at you is new though
> She claims you made her somehow
> ...
> Uhhhhh ...........
> Says she's very grateful, and she wants to properly 'thank' you
> Licks her lips as she looks at you
> Adds that it might take her a few tries to properly get the sentiment across
> A few days and a lot of rehydration later, and you've officially got a new lab assistant
> She insists her primary duty is to keep you properly relaxed
> And, if you're ever reluctant to take a break, to 'insist'
> At one point, you ask her why she doesn't go literally anywhere and do anything else
> She shrugs
> Says she's perfectly happy where she is
> Smirks and wraps you up in a big hug, pressing a breast into your face
> Teasingly asks you if you really mind
> And thus life went on, very similar and very different
> The constant marathon sex sessions admittedly do a lot to relax you and boost your productivity
> You even start to bring in a little money and earn a bit more respect for your research papers as the quality goes up
> You stay pretty private though.... you've got all you really need back at home and in the lab, now
> Only one thing complicates it all a bit
> You don't partake of your stash very often, but sometimes you still do
> And every time you do, you wind up blacking out for at least a few days
> And.... you wake up with a new, very forceful, and very thirsty wife
> You're up to three of them now
> Still no fucking clue how you're doing it
> Feel like you should be worried
> But whenever one of them is done with you, you're lucky to be able to 'feel' much more than your toes

"Clerk, do you know why you've been called here?"
"No Oberst. Have I made an error in filing your reports?"
>She chuffs as she gets up to look out a window.
>You immediately note that she's lacking her usual dress pants and is wearing some mesh.
>Her tail is flopping about and frequently hitting her midback, if you were to stare a bit then you could get a glimpse of-
>You remind yourself of her rank and rip your eyes away and to her upper body.
>She's holding up her hand to examine it, curling and uncurling each digit, you see a grin on the side of her muzzle.
"You have not."
>She does a quick turn on her heel to look as you while she leans against the windowsill.
>It is a struggle to not glance down, you resist the urge the best you can by focusing on her neck.
"You served in the army, did you not?"
"Yes Oberst, I was a sniper."
>She is speaking with a tone you can't decipher, usually she speaks with a cold, professional tone.
"How bold, it's rare to find a man willing to enlist, more so to find one able to make the physical requirements."
"Thank you Oberst...?"
"You've done well enough that you may call me Nicole."
"Yes Ober- er, Nicole."
>Her tail dances about at that, even if her face doesn't show it.
>She turns back to the window and gets in a slightly lower position, simply resting her hands on the windowsill instead of standing, it's not much but enough to draw your eyes to her rear.
>Try as you may you cannot stop your eyes from dipping down and locking on her slowly swaying tail.
>It's not going as high as it was so you can't get a good look but if you wait-
"How do you think the war effort is going?"
>Her usual professional tone is back and it quickly breaks you from the throes of lust.
"Very well Ob- Nicole, the partisan attacks on the supply lines are growing weaker and weaker by the day."
"Indeed they are, and our enemies' lines are growing weaker. They'll be starved of ammunition soon."
>She shifts her upper body around so she can crack her back, in the quiet of the room it sounds like a handgun firing.
"They'll be forced to surrender soon, I estimate that they'll be able to hold out for another half year at most. Assuming their people don't force them to yield sooner."
>You stay silent, you're not quite sure what to say.
>She peers at you over her shoulder and you meet her eye.
"Did you have any plans for after the war?"
>You mull it over for a moment.
"I want... I'd like to have a family and buy a home."
>At her silence you continue,
"At least three or four children, I grew up as an only child and I always missed not having a brother or sister."
"How sweet."
>She's gone to a very familiar tone, one you heard from your fellow anthro soldiers all the time as they propositioned you.
"I want to have triplets, to celebrate the end of this war."
>She sinks to resting her elbows on the table and her teasing tail no longer covering anything.
>Your eyes immediately lock on her exposed rear.
"Will you give them to me? Or must I take them from you?"
>You throat locks up and you watch as her legs impatiently tense up at your lack of reaction, probably to lunge for you.
"Why me?"
>Is all you can struggle out, but it's enough to prevent her pounce.
"As I said, it is very rare to find a strong man, and in order to have strong children, both parents need to be strong themselves."
>You don't quite get what she's saying, but the sight and scent of your aroused superior presenting makes up your mind for you.
>Her display only gets more intense as you undress and approach.
"I do hope you know that this will take more than a single try."
>As you line up, you feel relieved by fact she chose the window facing the forest instead of the one facing the base.
.
>After a hour of her pounding you into the top of her desk, she gets an affectionate glint in her eye.
>She raises her hands to the sides of your face and states:
"Good boy."

Anthros are already physically superior to humans
but them having the ability to do magic makes humans completely powerless against them.
Avoid anthros that can do magic they are very dangerous.

“Oh, there wasn’t a mistake.”
“What? You don’t seem like a wolf.”
>She reaches behind her head, grabs her hair, and pulls forward.
>Revealing a smug wolf head.
“Oh, I love it when a horny slut has to tell me his desires.”
“I…”
“You blushing, slut? Delicious.”
>He stutters himself in incoherence as the wolf grabs him by the shoulder and into his home.
“I’m going to get this suit off, you better be nude and ready for a workout when I come out.”
>He manages to state:
“Yes ma’am,”
>As she walks into his bedroom.

>"Clean & Serene for six months" is written on the obverse
>for the first time since graduation, it feels as though you scaled a mountain
>like you really have made progress somewhere, anywhere with your life

>every time that scent takes you aside
>the cravings come crawling back
>you never told her about your struggles with nicotine
>and for some reason, you don't feel the need to bring it up
>...as she looks aside, and offers you a puff

>She slowly drags the edge of her scissors down the side of your neck, pausing to rest the flat side against your skin so you can feel the chill of her steel.
>The blades open with a snap and the fabric on your shoulder is sent into its maw.
>She forces you to stare into her eyes with the force of her gaze.
>You feel the scissors slowly close with the sound of grinding steel and you await the sound of fabric being cut asunder.
>But you don't hear it.
>Hao's eyes break from your and shift to your shoulder and yours follow suit.
>She opens the scissors again and snaps them shut.
>You do not hear the sound of them cutting.
>The claws on the paw under your shirt begin to dig into your flesh at her agitation.
>She futilely snaps the blades closed with increasing force.
>snarls of aggravation escape her mouth as she continues to fail.
>You feel the blood dripping down your chest as her claws were dragged across it.
>She eventually gives up and starts using her claws.
>To both of your dismay, the results stay the same.
"What is this made of, Kevlar!?"
"I don't know, I just grabbed something cheap!"
"Damn the quality of the State's goods, if it was foreign-made I could've ripped it off with ease..."
>She stops trying and climbs off you.
"Wait here, I'm going to get another set of scissors."
>You quietly nod, you're tied to the chair so you couldn't move even if you wanted to.
>Not that you wanted to, you leaving would just make her upset.
.
>She comes back about 20 minutes later with a new pair of scissors.
>Though, calling them scissors might be a bit incorrect, as they seem to be the size of shears.
>She climbs atop you and pulls your head back to lock you into eye contact.
>She moves the shears back to where she was trying to cut.
>Without fanfare, she shuts them.
>They make a beautiful sound as they slice your shirt.
>The click they made puts a content smile on Hao's face.
"That's better. Now then, where were we?"

>Skullcrushers Bar, Gym, and Internet Cafe
>Humans can show up and be locked into seating for their faces to be sat on for however many hours they sign up for, entry is free and volunteers are offered free drinks and snacks
>They can be benches in the gym, the sauna, the changing room, barstools, and gaming chairs
>Anthros pay a small membership fee for 24/7 access

>You'd been technically homeless for the past year and a half.
>Granted calling yourself 'not homeless' might have been a stretch as you didn't have a house or apartment.
>Or an official, normal job.
>You were working for a place called 'Skullcrushers'.
>Working might not be the correct word to use as you didn't have an official position, but you'd been going there for about a year and have been living off tips.
>The anthros that go there tip well, really well.
>It almost makes you glad you'd gotten laid off.
>You finally get from the bed and start getting ready to take a shower.
>The owner had set up 'cuddling rooms', specific areas for a human and anthro to cuddle or 'cuddle' about a year ago.
>You'd like to think it was because she took a liking to you and didn't want to see you sleeping on the floor of the gaming room.
>It probably wasn't, but it's a nice thought.
>To be honest, the cuddling rooms are quite accurately named, most come in because they actually want to cuddle.
>That and confess their depraved desire for headpats, pets, and even handholding.
>You'd left to go grab your birth control and STD prevention pills.
>The fact they were invented is something you're thankful for every day.
>They might cost as much as your rent did, but you're not exactly paying rent
>But you're really in no position to have or raise kids.
>Getting syphilis or something would be terrible as well.
>You wave to the bouncer as you 'clock' in.
"I think I'll take... two hours in the bar. Feel free to grab me if something comes up."
>You'd been there for so long that if some new guy came in to be a chair, they'd pop you out to give him some quick training.
>Some of the human barstool slots have a 'design flaw' where the human's arms can move about.
>You usually try and get into one of those.
>Reaching up and locking them to the seat so you can tongue-fuck more orgasms out of them than they expected is always a treat.
>Two anthros fall prey to your tactics and practiced tongue.
>The first was a grey furred canine with a bit of feral blood in her if her cookie was anything to go by.
>She made an adorable whine as when you edged her to her third.
>Next up was a large reptile, probably a crocodile or alligator if the deep rumble she made was any indication.
>You get pulled out with about 20 minutes left on your shift, if your clock is correct.
>Some kid decided that he wanted to try out the sauna, for a 4 hour shift.
>Either he's a complete dumbass or he wrote the wrong number.
>You go to educate him and, unfortunately, he's a dumbass who thinks himself invincible.
>Hell, you can barely stand 2 hours in the sauna and you've one of the guys who has been working here the longest.
>You demonstrate to him how to use one of the gaming chairs, as they're the easiest to get used to.
>As you're doing that, you rewrite his '4' into a '1' and learn that his friends dared him into it.
>Kid needs to find better friends.
>Or at least friends who won't get him to sweat himself to death under an anthro's ass.
>Once you get to the locker room, you tell him to strip.
>He's resistant because there's at least 3 anthros hungrily staring him down.
"You're not allowed in the sauna unless you're naked, company policy. There's some employee lockers over here you can use."
>He begins to slowly strip, but you one-up him by doing an 'accidental' striptease.
>Now that you're both in only your skins, you take him into the sauna and show him how to lock himself in it.
"Last chance to back out, once I lock you in you're not getting out."
>He tells you to do it and you lock him in for an hour.
>Normally, you'd get one of the more 'gentle' anthro regulars to ease in a new guy, but this kid hasn't wanted a leniency thus far, he probably doesn't want it now.
>You help out the bartender for the next 50 minutes.
>By help out, you mean subtly flirt with the anthro patrons while giving them drinks.
>Such as petting their hand as you give them their drink;
>Randomly giving discounts to girls as you call them cute;
>Stating that there's a fly on their head and you reach to pet it off;
>And so on.
>Ten minutes after that you wait outside the sauna and watch the clock.
>As if on cue comes a panicking, naked tigress clutching the limp body of the kid.
>He looks visibly dehydrated, you know what to look for.
>He's not the first to overestimate how long you can stay in the sauna.
>Preparing your tone of faux authority you instruct her:
"He needs water, take him to one of the cuddling rooms and get some water. Make him drink the water slowly, a mouthful every minute or two."
>She's still panicked, but now she's panicked with a set of instructions to follow and she darts off to execute them.
>You suppress a snicker as she runs out the door nude, but smile at her concern.
>You make the mistake of sitting on one of the benches, there's not a guy under it, but you soon find an anthro in your lap.
>Her cheeky smirk is plain enough to you even if you can't see her face.
>Reaching a hand up to fondle and pet and the other below to line up, you feel her eagerness drool down.
>Once you're all nicely lined up, she slams herself down with enough force to knock the wind out of you.
>Ah, you know her type very well, let's see how well she stands up to your trickery.
.
>You leave her sprawled across the tile, occasionally twitching.
>She had two of your loads pumped into her, the first was gotten with her own aggression which you enflamed with taunts and teases.
>Once she was spent you got her on her back as you pet her and switched between whispering sweet words in her ear and kissing.
>She'd melted at that.
>Now, you'll go to the gaming section, lotta girls in need of some love over there.
>God damn do you love your job.

>you tried to get her to take a shower
>she brushed you off
>you told her to clean her room or else you wouldn't fuck her anymore
>she somehow made you spend six hours on "chair duty" for that
>finally you had enough and you unplugged the router to take it back to your room
>buncel was a furious mess as she tried to follow you
>she pounded her fists on your back, but it felt like getting hit with wiffle balls
>you were just walking into your room when you tripped
>buncel wrapped herself around your leg with her entire body
>you both go down
>before you could stand back up, she got her massive thunder thigs around your neck in a leg lock
>she mashed your face against her pussy as her entire weight bore down on you
>she ranted and raved as your head was filled with her musk
>buncel humped your head into the floor until you blacked out
>which leads to your new position
>buncel has tied you to her chair, and gagged your mouth with a used pair of panties
>she says she'll let you up to rest, in her bed of course, when she thinks you've learned your lesson

>work on airport fixing planes
>no anthro girls on the maintenance team or working outside, given the heat-stroke inducing weather 90% of the year
>work is a little too dirty for smart anthro girls, but requires too much training and school cost for the... hyena-types you'd find working on trucks
>basically, anyone with enough money is doing the flying and anyone smart enough to do this managed to get into college to be an engineer instead
>which left you, with enough intelligence and money to get through trade school, turning the wrenches
>work uniform is all black because of all the oil and grease you get on you, which means crows instantly notice you
>sometimes this one crow girl flirts with you outside the 7-11, you got her a slurpee one time
>she's pretty much the only anthro you've ever talked to, most of the others at the airport won't give you the time of day because they're busy sexually harassing the pilots

>manage to coax the mouse into a conversation
>ask her why she's in your house
>she confesses to watching you for the past few weeks, and says that she desires you as a mate
>tell her that the size difference would make it impractical
>she says it doesn't bother her on the slightest
really, she's 5 inches tall. what's she gonna do?

Scenario: You are the sole human living in your neighborhood. Your neighbors are all manner of prehistoric beasties. Some of them are tiny, and a lot of them could crush your house. The architecture tends to favor the larger set with allowances for smaller sorts such as yourself. You have ready access to food and water, you own a vehicle even if you rarely use it (it's easier to ride on a friendly shoulder), and you make decent income. You have good to neutral standing with your neighbors, and you have no outstanding legal issues.
What does an average day look like for you? What are some things you like to do? Do you have any romantic prospects? What do you do with your friends?

The issue is how scent plays into something like anthros.
>next door little billy is just a human cub running around
>then he hits puberty
>now his body is pumping off all sorts of pheromones saying he's not a cub, but viable male ready for breeding
>which just gets compounded by him fapping so much and not showering afterwards to clear the smell since humans are scent blind
>which may as well be him unknowingly screaming he's available and virile

>The first fingers of sunlight crest the horizon as morning dawns on the town.
>Saturday begins with you curled in your bed; alarm blissfully silent as you sleep deeply.
>The heavy curtains of your bedroom window block the sun from entry.
>Your weighted cover and white linen sheet sandwich you in warmth.
>You could remain this way through the entire day.
>An hour passes in peaceful, dreamless silence.
>It's a sound like approaching thunder that stirs you.
>The ground quakes, sending your bed rocking.
>The noise grows to a din, like the passing of a herd of massive cattle.
>You remain unmoved, though annoyed at the disturbance.
>Reluctantly, you move from your spot, instantly missing your cozy nest.
>Bracing yourself against the light, you peel aside a thin sliver of your curtains.
>Outside, a bit too close to your house for comfort, is a great, moving mass of scaly pillars.
>You'd almost forgotten.
>Saturday is the day when the local saurian fitness group has their early-morning group run.
>By your count, there can't be more than twenty of them, but it's enough to cause a ruckus.
>With all your time spent among the scaly sort, you've become an expert at estimating size and weight.
>Thankfully, you don't see anyone over fifteen feet or so.
>The truly gargantuan members must be jogging out of town.
>You'd call it considerate if it weren't the law.
>Saurians past a certain size and weight limit need to keep any strenuous activity away from civilization.
>Fortunately for you, that means your house won't get knocked down today.
>The thundering throng passes as quickly as it came.
>The lingering echoes of their passing acts as a wake-up call to the neighborhood.
>You know that in moments the day will start, the streets bustling with activity.
>People of every shape and size going about whatever business they have on a Saturday.
>Thankfully, you aren't one of them.
>You'd think working from home takes a bit of the thrill out of lazy weekends.
>You'd be wrong, of course.
>Sighing, you crawl back into bed, snuggling back into the warmth.
>There's no way in creation that you're up this early on a Saturday.
>It's not happening.
>You doze again, letting time slip away from you.
>Content to share company with the backs of your eyelids.
>It's not until around ten o'clock that something finally rouses you from bed properly.
>Your doorbell rings.
>Grousing, you rise from your rest, stretching a kink out of your back.
>The bell sounds again as you tie up your robe and slip your slippers on.
>By the time you've made it to your front door, it's rung a third time.
>Undoing the deadbolt, you open your door to see no one there.
>"Package delivery!" A voice huffs, strained.
>You look down to see a small, brown saurian with a long, skinny tail.
>She's struggling under a hefty, brown, carboard box that's slowly crushing her.
>She can't be more than three feet tall.
>Obligingly, you quickly take the package from her, much to her relief.
>You set the package aside as she straightens herself out, huffing and panting from exertion.
>"Whew! Thanks, man!" She says, elated to have the weight off. "I thought I was... done..."
>She trails off, and with the box out of the way, you get a good look at her.
>Aside from being brown and short, she's surprisingly slim.
>Her skinny tail trails away from a skinny body with skinny limbs.
>Her skinny neck terminates in a small, pointy head.
>She's naked save the postal sash she wears across her chest, covering her miniscule breasts.
>Her mouth with its little, sharp teeth gapes open as she stares at you with wide, little eyes.
>"Oh, wow." She gasps, breathless. "You're a human."
>You resist the urge to roll your eyes.
>This isn't the first time you've had to interact with someone like her.
>"Yep." You say, keeping your voice neutral. "In the mammalian flesh."
>She continues staring, unable to hide her interest.
>You have to wonder what gets into these lizards sometimes.
>You know humans are rare enough, and that there are some odd rumors about them.
>Still hardly seems like a reason to get all star struck over you.
>"Do I need to sign off on this?"
>That seems to snap her out of her daze.
>"Huh?" She squeaks. "Oh! Yeah! Uh, please."
>She pulls a device from her sash and hands it to you.
>Quickly scribbling on the screen, you return it.
>She still stares as she takes it back.
>You're starting to get a little uncomfortable.
>You clear you throat. "Is there anything else?"
>She shakes herself. "Uh! No! No, sir! Thank you!"
>You nod, retreating back inside.
>"Okay. Have a good day, then."
>"You too, sir! Thank you!" She says as you close the door.
>Watching from the peephole in your door, you can see her walking back to her truck.
>She stops to pull out a notepad, scribbling something down in it.
>Your address, you imagine.
>You imagine you'll be seeing her again.

Id imagine humans would make the best tailors in an athro world, given our dexterous digits.
You'd find human grooming parlous, clothiers and jewelers in all the major population hubs

>anthro smiths/tailors/artisans can do similar work, but struggle with the smaller fine detailed stuff
>humans have a natural affinity to with small slim nimble fingers
>so either you have separate stores/guilds handling it
>or a smart anthro hires a human or several for their place to do such work
always fun to do settings where humans are minority/new species in an area and how they try to adapt or prosper there

>Want to do something by myself tonight
>Anthro female handler won’t let it happen
Why and also how the fuck did I get a handler for?

>You stopped to watch the sunset at the edge of a bridge without railings.
>It'd been a while since you last paused and looked at the world around you.
>The sky was turning a beautiful color of red, orange, and gold.
>You stared into the water for contrast, and saw the last few sun rays punch down and paint the dark blue water.
>If you focused, you could even see a few fish splashing about in the wat-
"This is the police! Step away from the edge!"
>With a jerk of surprise from the breach of serenity, you slip backwards and land on your rear.
>Immediately you're swarmed by anthro police officers pulling you towards their cars
>As they place you in the car, you realize that you didn't have cuffs placed on you.
>Well, if you were in trouble you'd be cuffed so you relaxed.
"Why are you asking me all these questions? I was just watching the sunset."
"Sir, we're going to have a handler follow you about just for our own peace of mind."
>You sigh, hopefully this handler is nice.

"I'll see you later, boss."
>you sigh and stretch your back as you wave goodbye to your manager
>the middle-aged capybara frowns thoughtfully as she watches you go
>"Feeling alright Anon? You seemed kinda down during your shift."
>you wave your hand dismissively
"I'm fine, just a rough go of it lately. Just need to make to the weekend, am I right?"
>you give her a tired grin to show you're alright, and step onto the elevator
>truthfully, things had been pretty bad for you for a while now
>but you just gotta keep trundling along until things get better, right?
>your manager watches you go, that frown still on her face
>but then she's gone when the elevator dings and the doors slide shut
>it's a short drive back to your apartment
>the three flights of stairs to your floor are a drain though
>the elevator's been out of order for two months
>you trudge up the stairs and roll out the keys to your door
>the lock is finicky, and it takes several attempts to get it just right for the key to turn
>you grumble and step into the dark studio apartment
"I'm home!"
>you call out to no one in particular, as you live alone since your ex dumped you
>without even the energy to change properly, you kick off your shoes as you cross the room and drop face-first onto your bed
>but try as you might, you can't get to sleep
>you toss, and you turn, and you groan and grumble
>finally you give up and pull out your phone to at least drown out the buzz of your thoughts with garbage internet videos
>just as the screen lights up however, there's a harsh pounding at your door
>"HPS! Open up!"
>the HPS?
>what are they doing here?
>you're hardly in any danger
>you sit up and scoot to the edge of your bed
"What do you--"
>BAM!
>the door-frame shatters as a wolf in full combat gear kicks the door in
>"Don't move! HPS!"
>a half-dozen officers pile into the room, surrounding the bed with shields raised
>you sit there in stupefied silence
>you look around the room, but they've completely locked you in with a wall of riot shields
>one of the officers, another canine, breaks the line, stepping forward slowly
>"I'm going in."
>she lowers her shield and reaches out with her free arm
>you lean away as her paw draws closer to her face
>the officer shushes you comfortingly as her paw finally lands on your head
>"I've made contact."
>you expect to be wrestled to the ground and subdued, but instead the canine woman gently strokes your hair
>"There there. It's okay."
>cooing and shushing you, she pats your head as you sit there dumbfounded
>is this really happening?
>she moves in closer, sitting beside you on the bed to continue petting you
>"There's a good boy. You've been working so hard, and you're being so brave for me."
>fuck, it's been so long since you've been touched so tenderly
>you lean into the petting hand
>a small chorus of 'awws' comes from the other officers, who break ranks and descend on you
>the canine pulls you into her lap, and all the other officers take a turn petting your hair, stroking your cheek, and even giving you a hug
>once you've melted completely into the officer's embrace, she lifts you in a bridal carry
>"Extracting the target. He's a precious, good boy, over."

>/fit/izen waifur who posts gains from fucking you silly
>claims to lift "to dom my husband better"
>and also for the total destruction of the state of /collared/
>her "workouts" are intense enough that you're noticing a benefit yourself
>on the other hand you're so exhausted you don't get the chance to use it

>The guards had left you alone a good 5 minutes ago now, but the sound of gunfire was still getting closer.
>Not like you could do anything about it though.
>You couldn't even try to hide against the wall in your present state.
>your wrists were bound behind your back, and then hoisted up towards the ceiling with a rope and pulley, leaving you awkwardly hunched forwards.
>The exchanges of gunfire seemed to be happening less and less frequently though, and you thought you heard one of your captors voices cry out in the distance.
>It had barely echoed through the dusty hallway outside the solid iron door, and left an eerie silence in its wake.
>A few tense minutes tick by before the faint sound of stomping boots starts to float into your cell through the small barred window centred just above eye level.
>Your anxiety only grows as it gets closer, but the tension is broken when you hear a voice speaking in an accent you haven't heard in over half a year.
"Look. Holding cells."
>Is all he said, but its enough to light the brightest glimmer of hope you've felt in your entire life.
>The boots seem to be stepping much more softly now, but you can hear them plain as day in the hallway outside.
>Two figures rush past your door in quick succession, and your heart skips a beat as they fail to stop and look inside.
>You try to shout after them, but before you can muster the breath to make more than a pained wheeze, a third figure darkens your tiny window.
>Pausing to look in for only a moment, their head turns sharply and silhouettes their snout off to one side as they call out:
"Sam! Over here!"
>There's a sudden commotion just at what you assume is the end of the hall, by the way that the pounding of boots grows louder as it approaches.
>The silhouette in front of you stands aside, and another indistinct, but somehow more familiar form peers in at you from under their identical ballistic helmet.
>But it can't be, it's been so long...
"Anon! ANON! OHMYGODITSHIM! SOMEBODY GET ME THE DOOR RAM"
>Relief washes over you for what feels like the first time in your life.
>That voice, it is her.
>Sam, an experienced DEVGRU operator, and your wife of 6 years.
"RAAHH! FUCK IT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!"
>The desperation in her voice spills over, and the shadow at the edge of your door retreats just in time.
*CRASH*
>The iron door shudders on its hinges.
>Solid as it is, the frame it's hung on is very old.
>It's not giving up that easily though.
*CRASH*
"Jesus fuck Sam, you're gonna-"
*BANG*
>the first voice started to say, but was quickly cut off by the final resounding impact as the door crashed open on its hinges.
"ANON!"
>Sam shouted as she burst into your cell, quickly being followed up by 2 other marines sweeping their tac-lights around the small dingy room.
>She started to rush straight for you, but diverted herself upon taking in your restraints.
>Swiftly pulling the combat knife from the front of her plate carrier, she took one step to the side and cut the heavy rope where it was tied off to a pipe jutting out of the wall.
>Her other arm shoots out to catch you as you fall, and she drops the knife in her hand as she hastily side-steps back to take your whole weight in her embrace.
>You can feel how desperate she is to hold you as tight as she can, but she's mindful enough to know you've probably got enough internal injuries as it is.
>Sinking slowly to her knees, she lowers you to the floor.
>Rather than placing you down on it however, she kicks her legs out one at a time to sit on the hard concrete, and lays down on her back, gently pulling you forwards and on top of her.
"Oh Anon..."
>she says softly into your shoulder, and you notice that she's gently sobbing.
>You're still too in shock to feel much but the most profound sense of relief, and of course, adoration for the professional soldier who held you so gingerly.
>The one you had married.

>The coin in your pouch jingled as you leapt down from the carriage.
>You'd gone to the slave market looking to get a maid to tidy up your home.
>It has ten bedrooms, 2 kitchens, 3 separate living rooms, and so many bathrooms.
>Perhaps mansion would be a better word to call it.
>Regardless, it was far too much for you to clean.
>The only reason you were going for a slave instead of hiring someone is that a slave was much cheaper.
>Granted, you'd prefer to call whoever you're buying a 'servant' instead of a 'slave'.
>The first thing you saw in the first group of anthro's was how their eyes were glazed over with... emptiness.
>You try your best to hide your shudder, but you still do all the same.
>How... disturbing.
>It's enough to make you want to turn back and just hire a maid.
>You make a decision to yourself, you don't want a slave with that emptiness inside them.
>The next few groups you look at still have that emptiness and you pass them without another thought.
>A pang of self-loathing hits you, how could you so easily shrug off their worth?
>You resolve to take a good look in their eyes before you pass your judgement.
>You immediately regret that.
>These slav- anthros simply look dead, inside and out.
>If necromancers were still about, you'd think their fresh thralls would look like these.
>Still, you take a close look into your eyes.
>Something inside you seems to slowly die as you look each in their eyes.
.
>After a soul crushing experience, you stumble upon an anthro with life in her eyes.
>Feeling heartened, you try to look her in the eye.
>There's fire there too.
>She lunges for you snarling behind her muzzle and her wrath kept only by her chains.
>Flagging down a market keeper, you request that he remove her muzzle.
>She stare into your eyes and declares with a snarl:
"You will never break me, human."
>You fail to conceal your glee at finding someone in this earthly hell that seems to have a soul.
>The market keeper looks at you strangely.
>As does the chained anthro before you.
>But where the keeper's look is of confusion the anthro's is more undecipherable.
>Sure her growls got louder, but her still tail started flick and her eyes gained an old glint.
"Hell bound pervert, you'll pay for whatever you try."
>You immediately offer to purchase her.
"Are you certain sir? She's not been here for long enough to get trained. She's likely to rip out your throat the first chance she gets."
>His warnings are brushed aside by you offering coin.
>Reluctantly he accepts your offers.
>The next half hour is spent filling ownership papers.
>The sensible voice in the back of your mind asks if you really should be getting an anthro who tried to bite you to be your housekeeper.
>With glee, you ignore the thoughts of possible death in favor of pulling a bright soul from the pits of hell.
>The keeper hooks up a leash to her and off you go.
>She puts up a token fight, she must really be getting hit hard by malnutrition.
.
>She looks confused as you tell her you're making her your housekeeper from across the table.
"What? Just a maid?"
"Yes, that's why I'd even gone to... such a dreadful place."
>She looks confused at your rational, but doesn't question it to your surprise.
>You answer anyways.
"I did the math, the costs of purchasing and owning a slave is far cheaper than hiring a maid."
>Her eyes seem to dull at your pragmatism.
.
>You'd spent the next few weeks cleaning up the house with the help of your maid.
>She had been confused the first few days with using the cleaning tools, but she had grown familiar with them.
>Nevertheless, she seemed increasingly irritated with something.
>She'd also taken to dusting thing in front of you with a slightly raised tail.
>After about two months after you'd purchased her, she sought you out.
>She planted one of her arms to the side of your head.
>You noted that ever since she started eating right, her body has regained the muscle and healthy curves she'd lost.
"Enough of these games. What debased tastes were you looking to fill?"
>To be approached in such a manner is frightening.
"What tastes? I just need-ed a maid. You've seen how large this place is, I couldn't clean it myself..."
>She brings her face nearly nose to nose to yours, and growls.
"You expect me to believe that? What foul plans did you have to try and break my will? Keeping me in heat without offering to put it out? Was that your plan to torment me?"
"You're heat?"
"Of course I am! I would have thought that even with your nose you would have smelt it and been a slave to your desires as you smashed my head against the floor and pumped me full of pups!"
>You're taken aback by this, she'd always seemed like the type you wouldn't want to miss with.
>Your stunned silence enrages her.
>She reaches her claws into your shirt and rips them away.
>Your pants follow shortly, but they were made of stronger fabric than your shirt, thus making you fall on your ass with your back against the wall.
"If you won't take advantage of me, I'll make you."
>She grabs the back of your head and drags it under her pantiless skirt.
>Your lips slot against a wide, heated cunt.
>She speaks out again:
"Lick."
>And you do, you drag your tongue all over the 'Y' of her flesh.
>It is earthy, with spicy hints.
>You find yourself enjoying the taste.
>The rate at which you lick increases, soon after you try and drill your tongue deeper to coax out more tasty fluid
"Pervert, I bet you've forced that tongue of yours against the unwilling slits of many anthros..."
>You try to mutter out a 'no' but it is muffled her jamming you face against her.
"Lick dammit."
>You continue with your swift, deep licks.
>A wet gush of her spills across your tongue and face and floods down your thirsting maw.
>She pulls you so you're standing.
"Now, you're going to breed me properly."
>She turns around a starts to lean over with her arms extended towards you, you grab the offered arms.
"Good boy. Now breed this unruly bitch!"
>It takes a few tries to get it in without your hands, but you do and start pounding away.
>She's pulling your member into herself more than you're able to thrust into her.
>Not that you're really able to thrust.
>You have to lean back against the wall to prevent you both from falling forward, due to her position and larger size.
>She's still rattling off more of her perverse lines calling you debased and such.
>She's growing less and less coherent by the second
>You can't hold back anymore and thrust forward as she is mostly slid off of you.
>Both of you fall.
>She lands with the side of her muzzle pressed against the ground and her ass right up in the air.
>You fall behind her and buried to the hilt.
>With a few more thrusts, your shaft gives her her long awaited fulling.
>You collapse atop of her in exhaustion.
"Tomorrow."
>She states, sternly meeting your eyes from the floor
"We'll do this tomorrow, and every day after that. You're going to make me fill this house with your kids, master~"

Not the original author, but I wanted to add onto this.
>Part of you is glad that your slave is asserting her own agency.
>If she was a free citizen you could afford to hire like you originally wanted, you'd expect her to put herself first.
>Her eyes were completely full of life now, instead of fighting off the deadness the other slaves succumbed to.
>But the other, larger part of you is now afraid of her.
>Which made you feel stupid.
>Even remembering the slave trader's warning, you were never afraid that she might hurt you.
>And her attack on you only hurt your courage.
>Well, you sustained a few bruises.
>Not a big deal, versus the memory of being completely overpowered.
>You spent each day of the following weeks trying to avoid her prophecy,
<Unsuccessfully.
>Sure, she knew the place well enough to thoroughly clean every room.
>But having lived there for years, you knew all its hiding places.
>That was your logic anyway.
>Logic that failed you.
>Your vanishing act pissed her off.
>At first.
>But then she came to expect it.
>...And relish it.
"Are you in here, master?"
>Her approaching taunts gave you chills.
>It was just a game to her.
>A game she always won.
>Your fear was part of her reward.
"Oh master, keep making those cute shrieks!"
>You couldn't work out on your own how she could always find you.
>She had to tell you.
>Though she was probably meaning to ridicule you.
>There you were, lying under the floorboards, setting a new record for how long you were postponing the inevitable.
>Her footsteps hadn't left the room for a whole hour.
"Oh master, just give up. I can smell you~!"
Of course!
>How could you be this stupid?
>On two counts.
>Her enhanced senses were designed to hunt out prey!
>Also...
>Did you really just fucking say that out loud?
>Time for you to change your strategy.
>You surrendered your slave's tribute earlier than usual that day, hiding in a glass door cabinet down in the wine cellar.
>She looked right at you for a couple of seconds while walking directly toward it, only to turn and search somewhere else.
>What happened next was like something out of a horror novel from the mansion's library.
>The cabinet's doorknob squeaked first, alerting you the end was nigh.
>Her claw was clasping and turning it.
>The door creaks open.
>Her had feels blindly, slowly, deeper into your hiding place, before touching and caressing your arm.
>There was a moment where she you holds still.
>She briefly feels the pulsing of your heartbeat, before tearing you out and pinning you to the ground.
>You can still feel the cold stone floor as you disembark the carriage.
>This time you're visiting the upstanding part of the market.
>It has food, books, homewares, the normal civilized stuff.
>There's a stall for perfume at the end of one of the aisles. Just what you need.
Do you have anything that can throw of the scent of anthros?
"If you're going hunting dear, you're better off talking to the fella a couple rows over."
No no, I need it for home.
"Then you should talk to someone who deals with pest control. They can give you something to keep them off your property. That or a guard."
What if they're inside?
"Huh?"
>Her demeanor drops a little. She and reaches down and fumbles around for a bit.
"Some folks drop by and ask for this particular odor. They look like they're from the anthro slave market though. Is this what you're after?"
>Your face turns red from shame. You hope she can't read your mind. After a quick nod and exchange of coins, you hurry off.
>You're home in time for lunch. It's probably the first time in weeks you've eaten lunch at a regular time.
>Your housekeeper's food is as good as ever too. She eats with you and chats about one of the adventure books she's been reading.
>It's almost like this morning never happened.
>However your mind is still on the matte glass bottle you purchased earlier, tucked guiltily in one of your pouches.
>Did slave merchants really use this stuff?
>It plays on your mind the entire day.
>If you were going to use it, you'd need to go to bed early, and spray it around before she woke up.
>Your conscience is bothering you too much to stay up anyway.
>You open your eyes to darkness.
>No light refracts through the bedroom window.
>It's not a great time to wake up.
>But as you stir, the soreness of your pelvis pangs through your body.
>If only you could catch a break from it.
>Struggling to sit upright, you feel around for the scent that might give you some relief.
>Only feeling it in your hand without its ominous sight detaches you from its suspicious usage.
>To convince yourself it's okay, you spray a little in the air in front of you.
>The smell isn't too noticeable, though it is unpleasant.
>No way it could counterbalance your potential salvation.
>You quickly cover each room and hallway with the perfume
>It dissipates over time too, making you confident this is the right decision
>Finally you're standing outside the door to your housekeeper's room
>Taking a short breath, you push it open a crack.
>She oiled the hinges recently. A task that needed to be done for sure, but it also helped her creep about and pounce on you.
>With that thought you fire a short squirt inside, close the door and leave.
>Just one last thing to cover now. You.
>Your morning is peaceful. The most peace you've had in quite some time.
>You brought a later volume of the series your housekeeper was reading into your undiscovered nook.
>Without distraction, you finish a couple chapters.
>Leaving for breakfast, you keep some space between the rooms you hear your housekeeper is in.
>She seems to be focusing on her chores, giving you ample time to eat and read the newspaper.
>As the day goes by without seeing her, you become emboldened.
>Strutting around the house, you find new time and space to dedicate back to your languishing projects.
>Reply to some of the letters that've piled up. Building models in your workshop. Getting some needed exercise. Not the lewd kind.
>Hoping to remain undisturbed, you respray the scent in your new locations
>Lunch comes and goes. You don't see her. The meal's laid out for you.
>It's almost as if she's avoiding you.
>The same happens with dinner.
>Your body is enjoying its break, but you mind has become uneasy.
>She's made more food than usual. Your favorites too. You worry about why.
>Could you find a way to check on her? Without risking another breeding?
>Everything's done except these dishes, so maybe she's gone back to her room.
>Once again, her door's hinges conceal your presence.
>From her ensuite, you can hear her shower running.
>Listening close you also hear her...
>...hear her sobbing!
>All this time together, you'd never hear or seen her sad.
>Your mind flashes back to the slave market.
>The broken souls there mostly silently forlorn.
>But you could distinctly remember some infrequent cries.
>Cries your housekeeper was now also making.
>Peering into the shower, you see her facing the wall underneath the water, pressing away from it with her paws.
>Her tail shyly wraps around her legs.
>Just looking at her anguished pose is heartbreaking.
Hey, are you al—
"Get away!"
>You're now sure she has been deliberately avoiding you."
"You've tormented me enough!"
>You step toward her.
Can I—
"No stop!"
>She sucks in a deep breath of air, holds it, and pinches her nose.
>God. Fucking. Damn. It.
>It couldn't be more obvious what's wrong.
Don't freak out, I'm coming in.
>She does freak out, bearing her claws at you.
>You back off, then see the closed window. You rush on over and open it.
Give me some soap! I need to wash the scent off.
>This gives her a change to pelt you with something as revenge. The soap hits you square in the head.
>Staggering from her attack, you then have to scoop it up off the floor.
>Desperately you strip down and scrub yourself. Of course, this alone won't be enough.
I need to rinse myself. I'm coming in.
>No claws this time. You join her under the water.
>Her eyes are glassy and fearful, even if the water is washing away her tears.
>Almost immediately she wraps her arms around you and digs her face into your chest.
>Her tight embrace isn't reflected in what she has to say to you.
"Why would you do this to me? I hate you! Stupid human! I... I'm sorry...!"
>You can feel her claws gently tearing up your back. It's not as bad as the tearing you feel in your chest.
I didn't mean... I just wanted...
>It probably isn't worth it. It's better to just shut up and let her resolve this on her terms.
>Neither of you say a lot in the next few minutes. Being in each others arms seems to be enough.
>The embrace is broken when she slides down to her knees.
>Also drained, you join her on the shower floor.
"When I was captured, my owner said he'd enjoy suffocating my flame."
>Looking back in your eyes, she didn't look full of life as she did for the last couple of months.
"In order to wear me down, he'd poison the air. He always told me it had no effect on humans whenever I gagged."
>You stretch and grasp her paw.
"Smelling it here...took me back to that time... I was afraid...you'd decided to break me... It was all a trick after all..."
>You hadn't said it yet, so draw closer and whisper to her.
I'm sorry.
>In your head you knew it wasn't enough.
>So you decided to do something you'd never done before.
>You kissed her.
>Of course, you two had kissed. You'd kissed plenty. But she always kissed you.
>It shouldn't have been like this. You shouldn't have broken her, even a little, before offering yourself to her.
>You really did like her. You liked her fire. You liked being underneath her.
>You just never really reciprocated.
>She kissed you back hard.
>Not wanting to fall completely back into old ways, you kept moving forward.
>Pulling her head into you. Scratching her long ears. Moving your weight on top of hers.
>This time you'd give her what she wanted.
>She wouldn't need to take it.
>Your initiative took her aback.
>She was such a powerful anthro, but she'd never been overpowered by you.
>Her body wasn't resisting. She liked this side of you.
>Even though she was completely wet from the shower, her entrance was soaked.
>There's no way you could deny her.
>You move your hand down to rub her clit. Your shaft positions itself at her slit.
>Push forward...
>And you finally claim her.
>Being in control made you ecstatic.
>So this was the rush she felt every time she smothered you.
>Her body reacts wildly to your deep thrusts.
>You look down on her and grin confidently.
>In you're head you're egging yourself on.
>Yeah, a human like you CAN ravish and anthro like her.
>But the moment you think that, she starts pushing back.
>What the fuck? Was she reading her mind.
>She grabs your arms and starts throwing thrusts back at you.
>It takes you by surprise, and throws off some of your balance.
>This is supposed to be your moment!
>Her head pulls back from your kiss.
"Oh master, you almost had me there~!"
>Slowly she lift you off of her. Soon you're bother at an even level.
"It's cute you're finally giving yourself to me."
>You open your mouth to response, but all that comes out is a stupid moan.
"I can't let you get away with this though. You kept me waiting the whole day!"
>She's started weighing you down. Just like all those other times.
>No! It can't end this way! You wanted to be in control!
>If she thought she could push you around like all those other times, she was wrong!
>You tense up and begin to fight back.
"Ah! So vigorous! Where did this spirit come from, master?"
>It's not a fair battle though.
>There's no escaping she's stronger than you. But this time, she's holding back.
>Normally she's much more forceful. Even as she's pounding you, you can make sense of it.
>It's probably the same amount of energy with you both fucking each other rather than her completely dominating you.
>One thing you didn't count on is how much striking back would drain your stamina.
>When she was in control, the only thing you'd do is plead yourself not to cum.
>You were too distracted putting all your effort into railing her to notice you'd were at your limit.
>Attack turned into defence.
>Your hips stopped moving forward and tried to hold their position.
>If you'd underestimated your endurance, maybe she'd underestimated hers?
>She was certainly wetter than usual. More vocal too!
>Her hands grip your body tighter to stop herself from shaking.
>The extra composure allows her to hold her gasps back and address you in a low voice.
"You'd better cream my breeding hole right now master. I'll cuddle you from now on if you do."
>You didn't stand a chance.
>You never stood a chance.
>Your mind infatuated the idea of her holding you tenderly.
>You don't know why it broke you.
>You'd pushed push the limit of your strength.
>You completely collapsed.
>You screamed her name.
>You nutted right on cue.
>She tumbled down in a wailing mess right after you.
>Maybe at the same time?
>No way she'd admit to that.
>Your pumping seed gave her desperate relief.
>Even though she'd fallen, it wasn't before you.
>There she was:
>Undefeated.
>Sort of.
---
>Your relationship changed.
>Sure, she'd still breed you every day.
>But you'd come to her a lot.
>It was more passionate.
>Loving.
>You'd contribute so much more.
>Even if she'd still always win.
>Another barrier was dismantled too.
>It was time you shared your bed with her.
>A clever plan to maximize your cuddles.
>She owed you.
---
>Months more go by.
>Her belly has a cute bump in it.
>Your first child together is on the way.
>She's making good on her promise to give you a family for your empty mansion.
>Lying down on the couch together, she thinks it's the perfect time to pick your brains.
"So why'd you want a slave so badly!"
I told you, I couldn't afford to hire a maid.
"The house isn't THAT big, master~. We get everything done by early afternoon!"
Why do you insist on calling me master? And maids are more expensive than you think!
"You sure you didn't want a cute anthro to live with?"
You're hardly cute. You're a psycho!
"And you still chose me! Not one of those trained, submissive ones!"
They were so sad... So vacant...
"I'll tell you what I think."
You always do.
"You're a little submissive creature yourself!"
That's not true...
"You were hoping a rowdy little slave would fix that."
How would that even work.
"By having a fiery personality to bounce off! Come on. You've started being so much more confident and assertive since you bought me!"
It doesn't stop you from bullying me.
"Oh, stop whining like a little pup. And what did you used to do all day? Play with your toys all by yourself!"
I still do, you know that.
"Of course, you do with ME! That and you've taken me out to all those other things."
I like doing stuff with you. We can't just have sex...
"Hahaha. Face it Anon. I complete you!"
You... Uhh... You...
"And you complete me... *smooch*"

>Besides, I'm sure any of your assets caught up in the blasts could be easily replace with your fortune."
>the viper fist clenched upon hearing this
>"Physical assets can be replaced, yes. But you're bombs put many extremely valuable personnel out of commission. Money can't replace them."
>a scoff came through the phone
>"When the elders return all will serve them, and you shall have your pick of the lot.
>Consider your people's deaths as righteous sacrifice."
>all the anger seemed to vanish from Sylvanah as she relaxed and responded
>"I see. Well in the future I suggest you inform me, even if it is just minutes before.
>I can't continue to supply your resistance efforts if I no longer have the people to do so."
>051 spoke again, "Perhaps, but you should put more trust in the elders. They shall provide you with all you need. Glory to the Elders."
>"Glory to the Elders." Sylvanah's response was almost robotic
>anon's mind began to race, was she actually an elder cultist?
>it made no sense with the back story she gave him earlier
>another call brought back anon's attention
>"Police chief Kinsler, I have information on Monday's attack." Sylvanah's cold voice once again graced your ears
>the police chief responded, "Ms. Sylvanah? Alright, you have my attention."
>"The bombing was carried out by a group called the Elders disciples.
>They are led by a hybrid named Marcus, but he only responds to his old Advent unit designation."
>she knew all this and did nothing about them before hand?
>"Of course its another elder cult." The chief sounded only slightly annoyed by this
>"I am forwarding you all locational data you need now. Also Chief Kinsler, outside your precinct, you will find an APC loaded with new equipment.
>I will allow you to keep it all if you do me the favor of bringing me the leader, alive."
>her voice was cold before. Now it was ice.
>"Consider it done." With that the call was ended and silenced consumed the room
>anon felt Sylvanah take his hand in hers again
>without any further stimulation, awareness quickly failed anon and he succumb to sleep
>another unknowable amount of time passes before police sirens rouse the man from slumber
>anon awakes to find his hand empty as Sylvanah stands at the foot of his bed outside his view
>before long heavy footsteps are heard and a knock shakes the door
>"Enter."
>the door opens and the heavy footsteps continue
>"Your home is as lovely as ever Ms. Sylvanah. Shame I have to visit under the current circumstances."
>this voice is familiar to anon
>"Kinsler, you can drop him here."
>there is no greeting from her, only ice
>a thud and a grunt echo throughout the room
>summoning all his might, anon slowly shifts his head to view scene
>in the middle of the room a hybrid is on his knees, bound and gagged
>"You may leave now, Kinsler."
>a large muton stepped into view and said, "I lost a few good men bringing him here.
>And protocol dictates that I maintain line of sight on prisoners to prevent 'suicide' attempts."
>the viper does not respond, only turn her attention to the hybrid
>"Ever since I was freed from their influence I have despised the elders.
>I resented them for denying me a life that should have been mine from the beginning"
>she began to circle the kneeling figure
>she began to circle the kneeling figure
>"You, however. You almost stole from me my most cherished possession.
>My husband nearly died and now lies in a coma because of your zealous devotion to them."
>she had him completely surrounded by her coils, but she had yet to constrict
>once behind the hybrid she places a hand on his shoulder and leans in close
>"Die in agony, you groveling cur."
>her fangs sunk into the hybrid's exposed neck
>venom pumping so fervently through them some leaks out around the vipers mouth
>at first her victim struggled against her
>but soon the struggling turned to seizures
>foam and blood oozed out from his gagged mouth

>he continues twitching for a several moments more before finaly falling limp
>the muton breaks the silence, "Looks like he had a suicide pill in his teeth. Damn shame."
>the viper looks up from her kill, "It appears so. Won't you clean up this mess for me, before you leave?"
>the muton nods, "Gladly. And Sylvanah? I do hope your husband there gets well soon."
>she turns to face the bed where anon lay, "I... I appreciate that. As agreed, Chief Kinsler, the APC and its contents are yours."
>shortly after, it was once again just only the two of them alone
>Sylvanah returned to her place at the bed side
>shifting the sheets aside she climbs into bed and once again takes anon's hand in hers
>anon remains conscious while his "wife" drifts off to sleep in his arms

>Your eyes drift down to the bag of gummy bears she was holding
>"And the candy? I thought you said you trying to eat healthier."
>She quickly throws the bag under the bed as if you might forget about them if they were out of sight

>Ya, you were totally raiding her stash under the bed the next time she wasn't looking
>You hope she has some funyuns hidden under there, you love those salty little bastards

She's a demon. Conjured up by desperate survivors using the kid's eyes as a sacrifice. The ritual fucked up and she murdered the cult. She brought the kid with her on a whim, intending to force him to serve her in a menial fashion, maybe as a cook or something. Eventually she comes to care for him, frail and weak as he is, and they become true companions.
He doesn't know who she is or that she took his eyes. It's kinda eating at her from inside.

>She definitely molests him.
>spares kid due to weird kinship regarding summoning
>drags him along roughly during her travels, feeding him scraps from her kills
>barks orders at him, forces him to do little jobs around their makeshift camps
>his blindness makes it tough, he's terrible at it
>getting annoyed, demon wolf starts teaching him how to move and carry himself, how to feel out his surroundings, how to cook and clean and mend clothing
>kid actually responds well to the hard lessons, soaks up every lesson in earnest, demon wolf is pleased
>starts relaxing around him more. She still orders him around, but now it's because she knows he can take it, and wants to get stronger
>fills her with a sense of triumph and respect
>two start growing closer
>during cold nights she tells him to ditch blankets and cuddle up to her
>It feels nice having her minion do what she wants... but there's something else?
>she doesn't really understand what she feels. A sort of aching pain and regret
>A longing?
>She can't process it. Her mind is all about strength and fighting and conquest
>But now something is nagging at a conscience she didn't know she had
>and to top it all off he's been getting a little weaker lately.. maybe he needs a new push in a new direction?
>on another such night of close contact she makes a move
>she wrestles his pants down and takes him in her mouth carefully, fighting down the urge to bite and taste blood
>perhaps this little 'reward' will let him know he's pleased his mistress
>instead it has the opposite effect
>kid grows more distant
>And the itching feeling in her head is still there
>She feels guilty
>guilty because she took something from him, and now she doesn't understand how to care for a human
>and it hurts because she DOES care for him
>dammit... he's still growing weaker and sicker
>what's wrong with him
>he's eating almost as much as she does, and the same food too
>...
>He's a human, so it's fine to feed him other humans.
>right?

>Areas with large Mustelid populations tend to have a bunch of laws concerning consent and heat
>Namely if she’s in heat and rapes a single man, it’s just community service
>If he’s not single, there’s an additional fine
>He gets a small payment for his “services” and gets told to be more careful
>There are even places where men are registered like Selective Service, and if they are single during “Heat Season” they are drafted inti brothels
>These laws are rarely enforced thanks to modern medicine that turns mustelid heat from “Will kill you if you don’t get sex” to “Sexually frustrated if you don’t get sex”
>However one season due to a shortage in one of the reagents there isn’t enough to go around
>The “Heat Blocker” meds have to be saved for those who need it most
>Anon just moved to the area
>Has barely time to unpack before he finds himself spirited away by gropey Mustelid cops to be taken to an emergency brothel

>demons finally get into the mortal world/Earth
>except it's post-apocalypse
>may as well still be trapped in hell with how everything looks and how little there is to do
>destroying things is pointless since everything is already destroyed
>no good mortal food/drink to indulge
>tormenting the surviving humans has no fun since everyday is already hell for them
>can't even turn people to sin since the mortals are more worried and preoccupied with surviving and have lost the concept of sins and such

Anthrostate gets boring fast because it's always just "modern world, but with anthros" with very minor variations. Go fantasy and scifi or even different historical settings.
>humans being the minority in an anthro kingdom
>living on a planet/space station where there are few of your kind compered to the space anthors
>humans emigrating to the new world and running into the anthro Indian tribes
>wild west era where a human moves out into new land mostly filled with anthro settlers
>being a debter shipped off to Australia to form a colony where it's filled with wild anthros instead of abbos and the usual murder wildlife
>etc

>anthro tears through your entire unit
>you're the sole survivor, surrounded by your dead friends
>she grabs you, takes you into a bombed out house and roughly fucks you
>all while still smelling of blood
>she tells you to get very used to this

I always imagined the anthrostate being set in like 1979 east germany, where west germany is /collared/.
Just because you have a narrow view of what the setting could be doesn't mean we all do.

the split nation thing might be able to work.
>massive superstate with a roughly similar anthro to human population
>numerous disasters lead to political unrest and the rise of extremist groups
>one day it all comes to a head when a collection of states declare independence from the republic and form the anthrostate
>the same happens with a human supremacist group rising up and declaring the human empire.
>3 way civil war that eventually ends in a stalemate
>the 3 sides all agree to peace, and a new cold war between them kicks off.

>A human in a lab coat is presenting the research he's done in how human laps are the most comfortable seat for anthros.
>Next to him is a board covered with anatomical references and methods for how to prevent an anthro's tail from being uncomfortable.
>At the table in front of him sits the leader of the nation and four of her trusted advisors.
>All of whom are sitting on a human.
>The scientist's audience is smiling and nodding in agreement with most of his points.
>The humans being sat on sometimes look at each other with eyes questioning how they got there.
>Eventually they shrug and get back to petting the legs of the anthro that's on them.
>The presentation was wildly successful.
>The leader gave large amounts of funding for the creation of 'human seat' jobs.
>Humans are regularly being employed as seats in workplaces.
>Some even work as seats in the home of single anthros.
>Productivity has slightly reduced, but general happiness has had a notable increase.

>anthros have little care for clothes or seeing each other naked
>humie boy starts showing more skin and they all go nuts and drooling over him

small embarrassing things when working at a job run by anthros
>if you have a name tag words like "good boy" are put on it near your name
>uniform is either loose or tight in certain places that's appealing to anthro women
>mandatory scent inspections from your boss
>also mandatory scent markings/rubbings so customer know you work there
>etc

>Broken and defiled Hao who harbors deep hatred towards human men for what they have done to her
>She takes all that frustration out on them when she gets the opportunity to do so, abusing her authority without guilty
>She enjoys seeing the eyes of human men full with fearful tears, she likes making them beg for their life
>But a certain human, Anon, is resilient and takes this punishment like a man
>Hao can't stop thinking about him, and Anon visits her frequently despite the treatment he gets from her
>Hao is confused and stressed about it, she wonders why her heart starts beating so fast when he sees him now, it brings her bad memories, but it doesn't feel bad at all
"Why do you always come back here, Anon? No reward is awaiting for you."
"Because I like you."
>Hao is left speechless
>She doesn't even beat you that day, she just kicks you away so she can process everything
>The next meetings go as if nothing had been confessed, yet Hao's behaviour starts changing slightly
>She cuddles against you when she ties you down, she holds you close when she's trying to choke you, she starts trembling when she's resting on your lap, she lovingly licks the bloody wounds she inflicts you
>You pretend you don't notice what she really wants and what kind of feelings she has for you, you don't want to stress her out more
>It's very obvious she's crushing on you and she gets jealous of other girls you approach
>She leaves marks on visible places of your body for everyone to know that you're hers
>But now she wants to be yours, too, and you will be the first man she'll willingly give herself to

>Amine Con 20XX
>Nerdy humans and Anthros alike full the halls of a once nerd free hotel
>Your days at the gym and avoiding delicious garlic bread have paid off!
>You now have the bod to cosplay as your main in Guilty Gear!
>Your sculpted abs and strong chest are on full display as you carry your briefcase around.
>As you shuffle in the crowded hallway from booth to booth you cant help but notice all the wandering paws pinching and groping you.
>You'd call them out on it if you could get a clear look past the long white wig you're wearing.
>maybe cosplaying as Venom wasn't such a good idea.

>The more respectful Anthros asked you to pose for pictures.
>Some made the expected pool cue and ball jokes.
>That gives you a chance to showcase the the contraption you built for yourself.
>Your cue is connected through the center via bungee cable so you don't have to manually take it apart and put it back together every time you need it.
>It also saves room in your briefcase for snacks and cash since this costume has no pockets.
>You make your way to the dealer room and notice a cute bear anthro holding up a free hugs sign.
>She's about your height and dressed up like a bumble bee in a crop top and mini skirt.
>You take her up on her offer and giver her a great big hug.
>She returns the hug in kind and rubs your back.
>You didn't quite think through how odd this would feel while you're effectively shirtless.
>You go to break the hug but the bear pulls you back in.
>uh oh.

>Be blinded soldier, end up lost in the woods, where eventually a woman find you and offers to lead you to her home, where she claims to be able to create an elixir that can heal any wound
>As you travel she seems incredibly careful to keep her distance from you
>You reach her home, within it is a small trickling waterfall, the source of the elixir, when you drink, the strength leaves your body and you fall to the ground.
>She tells you that your strength will return within a month, that you should be able to crawl at least, within a week
>She begins to talk about how much she's done for you thus far, how with all she's done you should be groveling at her feet
>It sounds like a joke but her tone is completely serious
>"Yes i think that's a good start" she says as she pushes, what feels almost like a paw into your face
>"Kiss" she says
>You stop wondering whether or not its a joke and, after evaluating your options, you slowly begin to comply
>Over the next week she has you use your mouth on just about every part of her body in exchange for rewards like "food", "water" and during the cold nights, "warmth", which comes in the form of her body.
>Once you're able to crawl she begins to ask far more of you, now certain parts of her body are held up as rewards for doing as she asks, and despite yourself, you find yourself wanting them more and more.
>Basically trains you to associate all good feelings with pleasing her
>By the end of the month you can shakily walk but every day the thought of escape drifts further and further from your mind
>She's begun offering one reward that you want more than anything
>"sexual release"
>When she finally decides that you've earned it, she straddles you and takes you inside her, your cock hasn't been stimulated in over a month so the feeling instantly has you groaning out loud.
>As you both approach climax, she asks you to speak *magic words* that will bind you to her forever
>You eagerly say them and live happily ever after :)

>You set up a blind date with an anthro.
>You've been chatting with her for several months
>So meeting up with her outside of town in the middle of a wheat field didn't strike you as odd.
>Okay it did, but she's worth the risk.
>After some time walking though the field, you arrive at the spot she marked.
>First date someone setup with GPS coordinates with you.
>You're way too early.
>It's a nice warm day so you lie down and enjoy the blue clear sky.
>It doesn't take long for you to fall asleep.
>You're woken up by the sounds of something huge approaching you.
>You're the first person to actually come to this odd date location and not just stand her up instead.
>She's VERY happy about that.
>Or maybe it's the morning wood in your pants that makes her drool out of two holes.

dumb little idea
>covid happens, but anthros are immune
>humans forced to stay inside for their safety
>new services start popping up that's basically anthros offering to keep lonely humies company and help with getting them things from the store
>more extreme cases of human guys asking for anthro roommates
>lucky anthro girls already have a humie roommate or BF with them
>now he's always at home waiting for her/the others to come back
>keeps the place clean since he has nothing else to do
>maybe taking up cooking
>lounging around the place in a loose shirt and boxers after some time since he no longer cares if the anthros see him vulnerable like that
>doesn't even fight or complain about the cuddles and skinship from the anthros anymore since it's all the contact he gets now
>etc

>Most colonization efforts which used recently married couples to establish populations
>The settlers sent to the Lupercal Frontier were entirely young men of marriageable age
>The hope is that the wolf tribes, which seem to be entirely made from a majority of female wolves and a smaller number human males
>The hopes being that the single female population will see the available husbands and self civilize
>Unfortunately from the reports that have been received many of the men granted homesteads have gone native, joining the wolf tribes instead
>Armed conflict may not be a viable option as their numbers grow and they adopt the armaments and territory of the colony
>The best hope may be that we establish ourselves as a trading partner and ally

>Oh trust me, it's quite nice. Why don't you feel for yourself?
>"Why, don't mind if I do~" her friend will purr with a smug incantation, as she moves to feel you up like cheap boy candy
>you squeeze your owner's arm as your taint is felt and explored in surprising detail, you can feel yourself getting ashamedly hard in her grasp
>"My, you're right, he IS quite the toy~!" The friend will excitedly remark after her "full inspection." "You'll have to let me borrow him sometime, yes?"

You crawl up to one of the dead caravaners to dig through their backpack and you realize it only has shit like bars of metal and copper sheets in it.

Playing dead which they dig through everyone’s stuff until a giant veteran bone dog kicks you over and the dessert sun mixed with the pain forces you to open your eyes.

do different species have different porn scenarios?

I could see each having a favored scenario
>wolves love the whole red ridding hood play
>aquatic species liking sex in the water or scenarios around being water
>spotted hyenas have taste for smaller guys
>sheep pornos always have someone being shaved/sheared in them
>rats having the dominant one groom the other
>etc
Speaking of spotted hyena pornos, the type of guy they'd like would be rather different look wise to the typical male porn actor. Imagine how funny it'd be to see a human guy who does hyena pornos at like a porn convention and such. Even the stereotypical porno names would differ in hilarious ways.

>Bear porn often involves scenarios where a humie burglar "accidently" wakes up a bear from her hibernation and snu snus the humie as compensation

>Raccoons love to ambush humies that wander too close to dumpsters and pop out, snatching their new dumpster mate
>Elephants love getting frisky in water parks and putting their trunks in their humies (swimming) trunks
>Cats enjoy sitting in trees waiting for the perfect moment to pounce on an unsuspecting pedestrian, halfway because they're horny and halfway because they're too scared to get down on their own

>be the 90s, late at night
>live way off in the countryside, displaced from a few other houses by mountainous treeline, a few hundred meters between each
>murder mysteries playing on the TV nonstop, you're just trying to enjoy your Friday night with a good book, cozied up by the window
>suddenly, the phone rings, which you disturb your peaceful position to answer
>"Hello?"
>hear something you can only describe as "hurried" over the line
>and... the sound of something wet?
>as the realization settles none-too-subtly, you call whoever was clearly very busy on the other end a pervert and quickly hang up
>you wanted to *69, but felt like leaving it alone
>you were armed after all, what did you have to worry about?

we need more anthro religions taking interesting liberties regarding humans
>fantasy/scifi setting where anthros view human males as their property
>like the human god(s) were too weak and submitted to the anthro god(s) in order to get safety and protection for humanity
>which is why human males have so many features that seem designed to pleasure anthros
>while also being much more defenseless with weak night vision, no claws, tiny fangs, no fur, etc

Actual ADHG nightmare I had
Stupid dream logic ahead
>Dream starts with something unrelated to the thread.

>There's some faint daylight coming from the stairs going upwards.
>I wait a little longer for Hao's footsteps to get quieter
>The moment I step out of the elevator, I can hear her running up the stairs.
>I rush up the stairs to escape
>She's getting closer
>Hit the end of the staircase and find myself on the roof of the building.
>There's someone else on the roof
>Oh wow, it's (furboi from another ADHG story)!
>He's on a smoking break, so all I get is a brief glimpse in my direction before he turns away again.
>The building is in the middle of nowhere, huge green fields surrounding it.
>It's also really tall.
>Hao has made it to the rooftop by now.
>Now I have two options
>Surrender and let her do whatever depraved shit I read about here to me.
>Or just jump down.
>Without thinking about it again I sprint to the edge and jump.
>Dreams ends as I hit the ground.

>Not anthrostate
>Meet with waifur in secret
>She loves you, but the approval of her parents is still very important to her.
>They're traditionalists and very much against cross species relationships.
>One time while you were over at her house, they came for a surprise visit.
>Luckily you both were still in office clothing and were able to convince them you just came over to discuss a work project.
>This further pushes her into making your relationship even more secret.

>You're too scared to tell her to stop.
>Yet you still enjoy getting pounded into the mattress.
>As you're both getting close she pulls up into a hug.
>Or so you thought.
>Her maw opens wide and she lunges towards your shoulder
>Her sharp teeth dig deep into your flesh.
>She's downright growling now.
>Both of your orgsams hit both of you, yet she still remains in this position.
>After a few more minutes she pulls her teeth out of your flesh.
>You want her to explain herself.
>Instead she pulls you into an actual hug and swiftly falls asleep with you in her arms.
>As soon as your adrenaline wears off, the exhaustion puts you to sleep.
>The next day you're still in her embrace.
>She wakes up not much after you.
>Just from your strained expression she can tell you're wondering what exactly happened last night.
>She explains it's some genetic quirk in her species.
>It only happens when they want someone to be their partner for life.
>Oh shit, did she just propose to you?
>No she didn't.
>Or did she?
>She isn't sure herself as this hasn't happened to her before.
>Definitely loves you still.
>Over the next few months she wants you to visit a lot more often now.

>She leans closer and audibly sniffs you.
>You took a lengthy shower before went out
>However you neglected to do anything about your waifurs scent on your clothing.
>Her mother questions why you have her scent on your casual clothing.
>The grip she has on your shoulder tightens and you wince in pain.
>Your reaction shocks her.
>She knows how strong she is, she didn't squeeze you hard enough to elicit such a strong reaction.
>One of her claws moves towards the collar of your shirt.
>Without hesitation she rip parts of your shirt open.
>She gasps and takes a step back shutting her snout with her paws.
>The scars of the claiming bite are in full display.
>As it turns out the importance of the tradition to remain within their own species pales in comparison to the one of the claiming bite.
>What happened in that one night, happens only once in their species lives.
>To ensure the happiness of their daughter you're essentially forced to marry her.
>It's all very sudden for you, but you truthfully are very happy to spend the rest of your life with her.

>"Nope, instant turn-off," you mock your Bond villain-esque captor
>the iron links of your midieval bonds clatter against the 19th Century heater to which you're chained as your bare form heaves against it in laughter
>Your captor's wicked grin edges to the cloud-like poofs of her ears as the poodle rises from her bath
>Hot, lavender-scented water cascades down around her from well-rounded shoulders, like a satin curtain flowing elegantly around the matronly flare of her hips
>Lifting each impossibly-plush thigh out of the rosy liquid with the practiced flourishes of a lifetime in ballet and operatic theater, she shimmies her body to shake the water out of her fur in a very doglike manner, briefly lifting her arms up to her chest to restrain her endowments, lest they flop around like a fisherman's quarry in the bottom of a net
>You kneel in your torn denims, unable to peel your eyes away from the approaching Venusian goddess, to which she raises her nose in mock witness to your unintended gesture of deference
>Not that you wanted to give the bitch any satisfaction, it just really was all you could do to conceal the painfully constrained stiffy presently betraying you both to your archnemesis
>Her seven-foot tall frame towers over you as she cocks her snout at you as though she were appraising a cut of meat at a butchery shop's countertop display
>"What're ya' gonna do, bitch? Kill me?" you spit defiantly at her rose-painted toe claws
>She just tuts and shakes her head before lowering herself down to your level, her visage shifting from cold indifference to a mockery of motherly sympathy and bemusement
>"You poor, sad thing," she cooed in a Mid-Atlantic accent, deftly gripping and digging her nails into your jaw, only a head-jerky protest away from breaking skin
>Her grip was vice-like, fuck...
>"So lost, so afraid," her cadence hung onto that last word as her lips curled into a wolf-like sneer
>"Mommy's gonna take care of you now."

>Anon wants a slave just because it's cheaper than a maid.
>He goes to the market and is shocked by all the broken spirits he finds there.

There's an older concept for saurians that I could trot out.
It's not dino/human vore, but it's something that might be a little controversial for the thread.
The basic idea is that carnivorous saurians have certain predatory urges.
It's stronger for some than others, but most if not all carnivorous saurians prefer their meat as raw as possible.
Thusly, certain businesses and organizations make it possible for these saurians to satisfy those urges.
Hunting preserves and "meat farms" where the saurian patrons are allowed to kill and eat their meat personally are the typical outlet.
It cannot be overstated that humans and other saurians are strictly off the menu.

what if a human got into one of those hunting grounds by accident?

Well, other than seeing some things that most people wouldn't want to see and getting a stern talking and possibly a fine for trespassing, not much.
As was said, humans are illegal to consume as that would be murder and a little too close to cannibalism.
Bein invited to a farm or preserve is a different story.
The human in question is still off the menu, but you can be a saurians plus one if they invite you along for whatever reason.

>accompany your raptor gf to the local hunting grounds to work out some post-rut stress
>she swears she gets nothing from it, but when the bi-yearly need hits, it's all she can think of to get her mind off of clutching
>tells me it's okay if I stay at the hotel, but I'm welcome to try to keep up
>opt to go to be supportive
>after stripping down to just a spaghetti-string thong, she releases a shrill, avian cry into the night sky before vanishing off into inky dark of the artificially tropicalized forest
>can hear running and distant cries
>oh lord, we're not alone out here?!
>primal fear grips my spirit, right down to every fiber of my being
>something inside tells me to flee—that I'M the prey out here
>but I know better
>she knows better
>we both know better
>d-don't we?
>I reflexively clutch the folding knife in my left pocket
>I know better
>She wasn't even sure about me coming, she was worried about me getting lost or even just being uncomfortable
>This was a side of her I'd never seen, and I felt in my heart it was right
>And I know better
>but...
>I fled, tripping over shrubbery and loose stones as another blood-curdling shriek pierced my eardrums

reminds me of an old idea I had
>a big nature preserve is bought and turned into a lewd sort of vacation spot
>little is actually changed except a fence around the area for safety
>basically a big area of nature where anthros can indulge in their animal side and humans can have a rather different nature experience
>have to sign a form when you pay for a trip inside
>basic stuff like the owners not being liable for injury or loss/damage of property you bring in
>some slight difference in forms between anthros and humans
>anthros aren't allowed to seriously injure other anthros or humans, but light scratches and bites are ok
>human's forms basically say by signing the papers and entering the reserve they're consenting to sexual advances by anthros even forcible ones
>also making sure they're aware any clothes they wear in may be ripped off them by anthros
>luckily the place has a bunch of lockers for people to store their stuff before entering or making sure they have a fresh pair of clothes to change into afterwards
>basically can buy different passes that vary by how long you want to stay
>they lock on a bracelet that tracks your location and has a built in clock/timer to let you know how long you have left
>basically an elaborate sex club for anthros to chase humans around in the wild and for humans to let anthros do as they please to them
>also some fun role playing for some anthro species with other anthros and humans
>even open at night for nocturnal species and humans looking to have a spookier time
>cameras are all over to make sure no one gets a bad injury and also so videos can be sold to people
>the place also does special deals or themes during holidays or times where certain species get in cheaper and humans wearing certain outfits
>a popular one being based around red riding hood where wolves and humans wearing red cloaks/hoodies get in cheaper
>also hosts games/competitions with prizes ranging from cash, free passes, physical goods, etc

goofy little idea regarding some fantasy style classes that get their spells/power from another more entity like clerics, summoners, warlocks, etc
>be a cleric of a goddess whos form is similar to anthros or it's the most common guise she takes
>won't let you use your powers unless you refer to her as "mommy" or such embarrassing terms
>will make you offer "tribute" to her forms of pleasuring yourself in front of one of her alters/statues/etc
>sometimes dictates uniform changes or no powers either that are mostly just lewd outfits that pleases her
>can take corporeal forms in special instances or places of power/influence so she can personally fuck you
>or does it through avatars of hers that are anthros that match forms she takes
>warlocks have a similar issues, but since they're demons the perversion is even greater
>summoners have it worse on another level
>since they're physically calling in spirits/demons/beasts/monsters/etc the summoner can be interacted with much often and quicker
>the summons putting prices on being summoned
>won't do anything until they get a kiss
>which aren't always on the face
>referring to them with certain titles that embarrass you
>pre payment in the form of being viciously fucked before they will even answer future summons

>It was Valentine's day and you were planning on finally asking out that cute girl you had a crush on.
>There was one big issue with your plan:
>You didn't know where she lived.
>So you had to ask around, no one but no one knew where she lived except Kathrine.
>She could only barely be considered a friend as she was a complete jackass, both literally and metaphorically.
>You got all dressed up, got a box of fancy 'chocolates' that were safe for anthros, and got some flowers that the florist said that anthros commonly liked.
>Driving over to the address Kathrine gave you.
>Your trust in the accuracy of her information was lacking at best, but you didn't have anything else.
>Getting out of your car, the first thing you noticed was how large the house was.
>The second thing was how daunting the staircase up to the porch was. It was at least 20 steps.
>As you neared the top of the staircase, you abruptly learned that the top step was higher than the rest.
>The flowers went off to the side and the box flew forward as you tripped.
>You laid sprawled out on the porch for a moment as the front door opened, the owner likely hearing your approach or fall.
>Fire arose in your cheeks as you looked up at a very naked wolf looking down at the well dressed stranger on her porch with a perplexed expression.
>You tried and failed to speak, she wasn't who you were looking for.
>The wolfess looked around and started to piece together why you were there.
"Did Alice put you up to this? Dammit, I told her how much I hated Valentine's day and she goes and does this..."
>You can do nothing but gape at her as she trailed off to a mutter.
>She bends down and grabs the box of 'chocolates' before offering you a hand up.
"Holy shit, I've seen these before at the store, just this box alone was sixty dollars..."
>You accept her weak grip and get to your feet, you go over and grab the flowers as well.
"Well, you might as well come inside."
>You feel like an imposter in a way, you've accidentally shown up at the home of a lonely wolf and have been accused of being sent as a date.
>She grabs you by the shoulder and leads you into her living room.
>As you take a seat you start,
"Sorry, I am- I don't know an Alice. I mean, I wasn't sent by Alice."
>She looks at you with exasperation.
"So she didn't send you, and you just happened to walk up with a bundle of my favorite flowers and wearing my favorite cologne?"
>You just picked what was generally liked, you didn't even put on cologne.
"Yes...?"
"Alright, sure."
>She makes no attempt to hide her disbelief.
"I'm going to go grab some wine and glasses."
>You fidget on the couch, you kinda feel bad for her.
>Sure she wasn't who were planning on taking out for a date, but it's not like you're in a relationship so you're not breaking any commitments.
>She comes back with a fancy bottle of wine and two nice wine glasses, attached to the bottle is a note.
>You can't really make out anything aside from the name 'Alice' on it.
>The glasses fill with the scarlet fluid and she offers you a glass.
>You try to be as classy as you can, but it's difficult.
>Not having had alcohol before means that you are not used to the taste of alcohol.
>Thankfully, she seems more amused by your expression than anything else.
>It took a bit but you finished the glass, long after she'd finished but you eventually finished.
>She took your glass and refilled both it and her own.
>You started talking with her between sips.
>The previous awkwardness you held faded away as you drank.
>Her suspicion started to fade as she nursed her drink.
>Your stutter left you and the conversation between you two flowed nice and smoothly.
>The topics drifted from movies, to music, to food.
>To your surprise, you had quite a few things in common.
>It wasn't until the topic of sex came up that you respilled your spaghetti.
>Your blushing only emboldened her intoxicated tongue.
>She starts rubbing up against you as you attempt, and fail, to recompose yourself.
>Her touches becomes outright fondling as you remain a blushing mess.
>It takes some effort, but you manage to babble out a suggestion about going to her bedroom.
>She responds by picking you up in a bridal carry.
>Your foggy mind decides that trying to kiss her is a good idea, it takes you some effort but you get your lips to touch the tip of her muzzle.
>Your mouth is soon filled with her tongue as she parts her muzzle to stuff more inside.
>She tastes of earth and the wine.
>Getting up the stairs is difficult for her, between the alcohol, carrying you, and her cramming her tongue into you, but she manages.
>You open her bedroom door for her so she doesn't have to kick it down.
>Landing on the bed, you bounce towards the headboard. She's crawling onto the bed after having tossed you.
>Frantically, you start trying to undress.
>She pauses and tries to strip, but gives up and just uses her claws to shred them off. Good thing they looked cheap...
>By the time she's done ripping everything off herself, you've pulled down your pants and opened your shirt.
>You whip out a condom, but she bats it from your hand.
"I'm not in heat, get that away."
>She starts by sinking her nose into your crotch and huffing, before sliding forward to drag her tongue up your naked chest.
>When her tongue reaches your face, she looks down at your shaft where she's dripping onto it.
>One of your hands goes to lift up and one of her paws goes to guide it in.
>She pauses once your head slots in and she looks back at you, soon after you receive a kiss followed by a lot of tongue.
>Her parted lower lips kiss your base shortly after that.
>Her thighs rest to the sides of your torso as she sits impaled atop you.
>Despite her initial aggression, she's being slower with her tongue and her paws are roaming along your sides under your shirt.
>Your hands move to wander in much the same way.
>After her short pause, she begins lifting her hips again and bringing them down.
>She starts to speed up and her claws start lightly scraping at your skin.
>Her movements keep speeding up and her wetness drenches you, her hips slam down onto you with the springiness of the mattress being the only thing preventing bruising.
>Eventually, she stops and her walls work to milk you and another wave of wetness drenches your groin and the cloth under you.
>Once her spasms end, she gives a couple more drops to get you to unload into her.
>A minute after your twitching ends, she starts moving again, perhaps even faster than before.
>Instinctively, you try and push her off, but all you do is get her to grab your hands in her paws and pin them above your head.
>Her tongue goes from simply filling your mouth to working its way into your throat.
>You attempt to thrust back and the best you can do is maybe raise your hips a little off the mattress before she slams down.
>Between the pinning, the aggressive pounding, and the lack of air, you feel your seed burst forth into her.
>To your fortune, her own orgasm comes a few pounds later.
>She lazily pulls her tongue from your throat, you cough a bit at the treatment of your throat.
>Her paws pull you close and she rolls onto her back with your face between her breasts and resting on her chest fluff.
>You move to pull out and lay beside her, but her legs arc up and lock behind your hip so you're buried in her.
>Sleep comes easily to your tired body.
>You awake with a headache and buried in tits.
>A desire to get off of her rises, but is halted by you deciding to nuzzle into her fluff instead.
>Maybe you'll come back here again, you meshed well with her.

>You will never be courted and successfully seduced by a bnuuy of Amazonian stature
>You will never marvel at how her soft fur and kind, dorky disposition contrast with her absurd physical strength and desire to protect you
>She will never outdo even the most absurdly proportioned shortstacks and casually crush bricks between her thighs to turn you on
>She will never agree to use protection if you want, because she wants a well-planned family with you someday and isn’t using you as a baby factory
How hard would this make tiny buncels seethe?

>You will grow the garden
>You will expand the garden
>You will breathe in the spores
>You will breathe in the pollen
>You will be vegan
>You will give yourself to The Green
>You will be fertilizer for her when you're done pollinating
>You will be happy

>You date buncel for a bit in high school.
>Absolute creep. Unhygienic, racist, and prone to self pity parties when she's not raging at you for no reason.
>Years later you return to your home town, and who do you meet but her.
>She hasn't physically grown, but she's clearly way better than before.
>Turns out she was bipolar the entire time. She's on medications now and couldn't be happier. Has a stable job and everything.
>Wants another chance. Just one date, no pressure she says!
>Do you take the risk? Can people REALLY change?

>imagine hearing their loud bellowing moos when ever a humie boy walks by
>cat calls of "look at those lips made for sucking"
>"want some fresh milk"
>"bet those hands would feel great tugging my udders"
>"I'll give you a free milk bath"
>and such

>Be sitting in your high schools lunch room
>Eating your government issue pizza square and drinking your carton of milk
>After downing your food and drink you turn to talk to one of your friends
>When you turn back you can't help but notice your milk carton seems to have a little more milk in in that you thought
>Huh, weird
>Drink it then go back to talking to your friend
>You turn back and, yep, your milk carton is magically no longer empty and some anthro girls farther down the table are doing a poor job of hiding their giggles
>Only now do you notice that there's one holstein cow among the group
>She's casually looking the other way and doing something on her phone
>Odd
>After leaving the lunchroom a buddy of your runs up to you and shoves his phone in your face
>Apparently there's some hot new prank video making the rounds on bawktock
>Something about an anthro tricking a humie into drinking their milk...

>Be married to an anthro
>Wife is a wolf
>Wife has a cookie
>Makes you lick, suck, kiss and eat that cookie almost everytime you guys have sex
>She proceeds to slam down on your pelvis after your done munching on the cookie
>Cuddle with your wife afterwards
>You love your wife
>And your wife loves you

>waifur aggressively rides your face every night
>once she's done she gives one final wiggle in your face, rolls over, pulls you into a hug and falls asleep
>leaving you to bury your face in her fur and jerk off

>You and your wolfur sit on the ground leaning against a wall, her arms hugging you tightly against her chest
>"SORRY-SORRY-SORRY-SORRY" She repeats, her words sometimes devolving into anguished sobs
>Her apologies do little to dull the pain coming from the left side of your face
>Aside from the pain there was also a warmth trickling down your neck, it must still be bleeding
>When she's run out of different ways to say sorry she loosens the hug to talk to you face to face
>The fur around her eyes is soaked with tears, and she visibly cringes when her eyes briefly glance towards your cheek
>"Anon, I didn't mean to do it, you have to believe me!" She loudly implores. "It's just-I-we're-we're a mated pair anon. Bonded for life. You know how much that matters to me, right?"
>You gently shake your head in an affirmative
>She's suddenly devoid of remorse, her teeth bared and words almost snarled
>"Then you know how I must have felt when you came home smelling like some other woman. The scent of some foreign canine on your skin, her blond fur on your shirt, and you tried to act like nothing was wrong!"
>But then her ears droop and eyes moisten with new tears
>"I should have believed you when you said your shirt got torn at work and a friend offered you a spare. I should have believed you."
>Her voice cracks
>"B-but I was just so mad Anon. We were made for each other, you and me. And it seemed like you had betrayed my trust mere days after proposing. I can't even bear to think of you being unfaithful. I know I can't find someone else like you out there and I got scared. So scared of losing you. Then I got angry at the thought that I had already lost you to some other bitch and-and-and...damn my temper."
>She slowly moves her muzzle against your cheek and licks your wounds
>You're not sure if it helps
>She stops the licking and moves away from your head
>"Anon?" She softly says
>"What?"
>"Don't let anyone else know about this. Please. I don't want anyone to think that I've gone rabid or something. All wolves have protective instincts but we aren't supposed to hurt our mates like this. You know how much I love you Anon. It's just I let my emotions get the better of me and took it out on you. But I didn't mean to, it was a mistake, you have to believe me Anon. Please"
>Once again she hugs you tightly and cries into your shoulder
>While she cries her eyes out you bring an arm up and gently rub her muscular back
>It seems to help her recover from the crying fit
>She looks at you with her bright hazel eyes, they seem to be filled with a determination you haven't seen in a long time
>"Anon, I love you, and I can only love you. We both forfeited our right to anyone else the second I claimed you as mine. You're going to father my pups, help me raise them, and when our days are done the first one to go will wait for the other in paradise. That's how it's going to go. Do you get me?"
>You shake your head and she raises her voice, sharp canine teeth bared and glistening
>"Good. Because I WILL NOT have you stolen away by some skanky cock breathed fur slut. I don't care if I have to make you see that I'm the only one. I'll scent mark you, give you a claiming bite, record the conceiving of our first litter and post it on the internet so the whole world will know it ME that claimed YOU. I'll escort you to and from work, growl at any sluts that look at you, I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll."
>She stutters then falls silent, words failing her
>In this delicate moment you bring a hand up and stroke her furry muzzle
>She closes her eyes and leans into your hand in response
>"Honey, sometimes I think you love me too much." You whisper
>She opens her eyes
>"No, I think I don't love you enough."

I want a group of tribal matriarchal bovine women to come into my village and take me as a bedwarmer!

>you get abducted back to their village
>you realize you're the only human there
>it's your job to pleasure the entire tribe
>whatever time you have not being mating-pressed they make you spend grooming their hooves, horns, and hair

>The first several days after being captured are one big blur
>You're passed from hut to hut for horned ladies to demand services from you
>Sometimes they want sexual relief, sometimes they want you to bathe their bodies, sometimes they just want someone to hold as they sleep
>At this point most of your caloric intake now comes from an engorged nipple
>One day get told to polish and clean the hooves of the chieftess
>You drag your haggard body to her quarters to be met with the big lady sitting on her throne
>Well you think it was supposed to be a throne, it seemed more like a slightly taller than normal chair with some embellishments carved onto it
>After getting on your knees in front of her you get to work
>The entire time she just stares down at you with a slight frown, her horns glinting in the light from a nearby fire
>It takes a lot of elbow grease but you eventually get them to a mirror sheen
>She raises a hoof and moves it around in front of her
>She gives a satisfied huff and stands up, walking past you to the outside
>You scurry to the entrance of her hut and sit beside it, you've long since learned that these tribeswomen expect you to wait at the entrance for them when they've left
>Surprisingly she enters no more than a few minutes later
>She struts past you and sits in the throne, looking to you expectedly
>Your gaze lowers to her hooves and they're covered in wet dripping mud
>Fuck
>Well it's not like you have anything better to do
>While cleaning her hooves another cow anthro enters the tent and says something that sounds like a question
>The chieftess barks something back and the guest leaves in a hurry
>The chieftess continues giving you busy work through the next several days, by now you're almost always in her hut, only occasionally getting sent to other tribewomen as favors, from what you can tell anyway

Random musings about mustelid waifurs based upon their IRL counterparts

>Acts all flustered if this is pointed out
>Likes to pinch small items of yours when you're not paying attention and add them to a little collection she keeps at home
>This extends to underwear if she visits your place; she probably tries to sniff them when enjoying some "private time"
>For those who like bites, a weasel might give you a claiming bite during sex
>Always trying to get you to dance with her whenever she's very happy or excited (or even teach you how to dance with plenty of hands-on contact)
>Sea otters letting you lie on them when you go swimming, possibly with a handjob on the cards
>Besides the spectacular increase in horniness in even the shyest mustelid, they might also get rather protective (or possessive) if another lady tries to make a move on you

>There's a mosquito in your room!
>You made sure that it couldn't have gotten in!
>Every window is closed and locked shut, the door is barricaded, and you've done several laps around the house to ensure everything was shut.
>But there's that damn buzz again.
>It ceases with a heavy weight landing upon your bed.
>You simply grit your teeth and pretend to be asleep.
>The last time you tried to grab her, she managed to it dodge and hide.
>You didn't have a good night of sleep that night.
>Your room is tiny, where did she even hide?
>Who the hell decided that genetically modifying mosquitos to be near human size and have tits was a good idea?!
>With some soft pulls, she pulls your thin blanket away, exposing you to the warm air.
>Your boxers are pulled from your frame soon after.
>Her weight comes down upon your legs with her breasts near your dick.
>It doesn't take her much touching and fondling to get you hard.
>Then comes her proboscis to slither down into your dick.
>No matter how many nights she's done this, it hasn't felt less weird.
>She's at least good at what she does.
>Two of her hands move grasp her breasts and give you a titfuck as another goes to play with your balls.
>The last hand sends a single, nimble digit up your rear to press on your prostate.
>All of that only slightly distracts you from the suction you feel beneath the base of your cock.
>You haven't even cum yet and still you feel bulges in her proboscis as she sucks.
>With practiced efficiency, she gets you off and each of your throbs sends another bulge up her proboscis.
>Once your spasms cease, her hands pull away but she still keeps her proboscis down your shaft for a little bit to get every last drop.
>After she's gotten everything she wanted, she pulls the covers back over you and flies off with that annoying hum.
>Being so drained makes you ache throughout the day.
>But hey, it could be worse.

Imagine in a world/setting where anthros exist and you have human women with a fetish for human guys being viciously fucked by them or making content about that
>fantasy setting where some noble woman has her beastkin female slaves/pets/servants fuck her human guy servents or finds some homeless boy and offers him money to be snu snu by a beast woman while she watches

>It practically becomes an X rated reality show with how much time is spent on family drama and narrated mating scenes

nature documentary with "wild/feral" anthros is still a fun idea and more so with using interns as bait/lures for horny animal women

>making a nervous intern walk down naked to a river bank because it has croc women in it laying in wait

>a cursed kiss
>she retreats quickly from the duel and her army following soon after
>the abbey and his men treat this as a victory, but anon feels somewhat disappointed
>not long after his duel with the witch he finds the thought of her worming its way into his mind
>he tries to ignore these intrusive thoughts but they just seem to keep coming more frequently
>soon his own dreams are being invaded by her
>each night he is plagued with scenes of the dragon witch performing lecherous acts on him
>in response anon begins pushing himself harder and harder in battle, giving himself little time for rest
>in his exhausted state the curse reaches its peak

>following her voice, anon makes his way to the witch's castle
>awaiting him on her throne the dragoness beckons him forth
>"You held out much longer than anticipated, champion.
>Come now, off to our bedroom. Taking you in our dreams is well and good, but now I crave the real thing. Don't you?"
>anon can only nod his head and follow his corrupting mistress, sealing the fate of his kingdom with it

speaking of paladins and such
>evil/lusty anthros learn of a paladins
>except their take on them is a bit different
>bunch of males walking around throwing themselves into dangerous situations and wander about
>so basically easy picking and they more or less come straight to the anthros
>full older boys and young men either due to taking in those without a place or haughty high born with hero complexes
>they take vows of chastity
>which means to the anthros they get to pop the cherries of the ones they beat/capture
>showing them all the bestial pleasures they can inflict on them that those boys never experienced

lewd cute idea
>have a special item you hold or wear that signals you're up to being ravaged
>could be a pillow with "yes" on it
>wearing a certain shirt, necklaces, boxers, etc
>basically asking for it without needing to say a thing
>but also opens you up for massive teasing since it's up to her when and wear she pounces
>letting you get more pent up, anxious, and needy the longer she waits
>until she finally takes you and has you moaning her name

>Anons from a really well off family but is a useless mental case.
>almost 20 and just got out of involuntary phyc hold.
>He’s desperate to convince his family he is same now and their desperate to forget he ever existed.
>His family decides to let him live in one of the properties they own that’s on the beach in Florida while he recovers.
>It’s right on the beach. There are hundreds of houses lined right up on the sand but no one is ever around.
>The place is practically empty because it’s just empty rich people houses that they keep as assets that no one can afford to buy.
>Neighborhood with tons of million dollar houses but he never sees any cars and maybe one person jogs pass his place a week.
>He is left in isolation just sort of rotting while working on a novel or something.
>He constantly feels like he’s being watched, having visual/ auditory hallucinations.
>Anon is trying really hard to convince his family he isn’t crazy anymore.
>Go on a beach walk until he get to see the sun rise every night.
>Two nights in a row he walks past a black figure walking parallel to him.
>Kinda odd since he never sees anyone else in the neighborhood, much less at the beach, much less at the beach at 4 am.
>Next night he realizes the person is following him from way behind.
>Super paranoid.
>Every night the stalker gets closer but always disappear before the sun rises.
>At the times when he’s home he double checks his doors locks all throughout the day and keeps his blinds shut.
>One night he changes directions and it still happens, it’s really fucking with his head.
>He decides to walk the street one night to get a finally take a walk where he dosnt feel like he’s being followed. While at a street lamp he realizes that the figure is running down the sidewalk toward him. He gets chased through the suburbs. By the time they get close enough for him to have a glimpse at their inhuman form they disappear.
>He comes home by 7am. He’s physically and mentally exhausted. He’s just to tired to be afraid anymore.
>He walks into the kitchen ready to start drinking and their already sitting there with a bottle out.
>Anon just sort of excepts it and they sit down to drink together.
>She’s a windigo from some place like Montana that decided to move to Florida on a sort of permanent vacation.(not retirement she still stalks and eats people)
>She enjoys the freedom of being able to just walk around in her natural form since the place is so barren, except for the new meat the decided to trespass on her favorite fishing spot.
>The hunt was on. She would stalk him for miles down the beach waiting for the perfect time to pounce. She started off being really cautious, following from afar slowly picking up pace all while in the shadows. She realized that Anon is an oblivious idiot and she could walk right up to him and him not notice. Instead of killing him she made it into a game by seeing how close she could get to him before he could notice. She eventually moved on to breaking into his house while he was there and staying in the same room as him while he was sleeping.
>she wears Hawaiian shirts and drinks piña Coladas
>Anon is really good at making piña coladas
>they start going on the walks together and doing stuff like watching movies.
>he can’t say anything because he is trying to convince people he’s sane now so he can’t go off about the giant beach bum demon that’s molesting him.
>also they have pretty similar life styles and really enjoy not being so alone.
>anons like a deranged little depressive schizo guy that’s really empathetic
>windigo lady that is loving but is selfish and wants anon to do whatever she wants so she is kinda abusive. She just wants to have fun like drunk surfing at midnight and breaking into peoples empty house to mastubate in their beds. She feels like she’s never been around someone that appreciates her company so she is really self conscious about the idea of anon ever leaving her. She try’s to get him to self isolate even more through manipulating him so that he is only ever with her.
Ideas for story stuff
>Maybe she gets into conflict with his therapist that’s (a human woman/ another windigo/ other cryptid)
>Anon has to train windigo ladies pretending to be a human skills enough for him to introduce her to his family. Maybe she introduces him to her family?
>Anons releases his book and it sells like 4 copies.
>Anon gets a flirty neighbor
Anons sister visits to see if he’s still alive and finds out about everything and is oddly just sort of okay with it and is just glad anon found someone/ something and becomes friends with windigo lady
>Windigo lady finds massive ship week under water or something idk
>She decides to fuck anon inside someone’s house then a grounds keeper shows up and they have to escape.
>Cops suspect that Anon is a serial killer because the windigo keeps making people in the area disappear so she has to kill a lawyer, take the lawyers form then represent him in court
>She invites a bunch of her friends over to eat dinner Anon cooked. Her friends are like deep ones, ocean ghost ladies, another windigo, sirens, tentacles, and anons sister makes a second appearance.
>They find a boat
>They run out of alcohol
>They get a lot of alcohol
>Windigo lady gets sick and windigos get really fucking weird when they get a windigo cold
>It snows in Florida???
>Anon realizes she’s actually Cuban and just happened to live in Montana before moving to Florida
>They both go to the movie theater to see morbius and because the theaters so empty they have play hide and fuck in the empty building.
>She makes anon think she can turn him into a windigo like a vampire and they spend the entire chapter preparing for anons transformation just for her to reveal it was prank.
>She decides to actually become a real lawyer and get a law degree online.
>There’s a hurricane! They bother hunker down for the stormy night in the downstairs walk in closet.
>Another hurricane where the power goes out. She disappears half way through the night so he walks around the big house only illuminated by the candle he’s carrying and the lighting while she plays hide and rape.
>She uses her shape shifting abilities so anon and her can walk around the neighborhood pretending to be cops.
>She pretends to be anon and goes to his therapy for him
>They both stop being mooching pieces of shit and get jobs at a publix
>They both get sober and they start to hate each other so they start drinking again
>Halloween

>wake up in your suspiciously hot room
>drenched in sweat you reach over and check your phone
>From Sis: "Hey! I'm going to band camp this summer! I'm leaving Dalia with you, Mom said it was okay!"
>"P.S It's mating season so if she wants to go for a run, GO WITH HER!"
>putting down your blinding phone screen, you suddenly notice the giant hyperventilating tiger
>for some reason, you don't think she'll want to go outside any time soon.

General idea is that Anon is failing a class, I was thinking about something difficult like calculus.
He remembers the standard porn trope of fucking the teacher for better grades and attempts it by asking for 'private tutoring' in 'sexy' clothing.
So a red hoodie, ripped tiger print jeans, and a choker.
She agrees and gives her address to him, but he arrives she starts doing actual tutoring.
The teacher ignores his attempts to seduce until he fails the finals.
She makes some proposal about trying to improve his ability to learn over the summer if he'll retake her class.
The idea she has is to give him a 'learning fetish'.
For the ending, she's successful and he goes from a D student taking low level classes to Honors A student who studies particle physics to masturbate.
Once he's graduated, then she calls him over to her house to reward him for his grand improvement.

>the bunny pressed against your back shamelessly gropes you
>inside your thighs, cupping your balls, teasing your cock
>all the while schlicking with her other paw
>you're so desensitized to her constant molestation that you've let her go way too far
>you groan and lean against the door of the elevator
>"P-please" you gasp "what if someone sees?"
>the bunny doesn't answer, just panting faster as she starts to stroke your shaft
>she thrusts her hips against you
>her moans amplified by the small space you're sharing
>you're fully hard, leaking pre-cum
>finally the bunny speaks up
>"I've been waiting so--haaa--long for this. I don't even work here anymore, I just come back for you. I'm gonna--"
>DING!
>the elevator stops, and the door slides open
>you and the bunny go sprawling out
>landing at the feet a very shocked looking hyena
>the bunny recovers first, squeaking out a meek apology as she jumps up and flees down the hallway
>leaving you alone with the hyena
>"Listen, I don't--" you try to come up with a good excuse "It wasn't really..."
>the hyena shushes you
>"Back in the elevator, boy. It looks like that little bunny left her job unfinished."
>you have no room to protest as the yeen lifts you by the collar to drag you back into the elevator

>a short, greasy looking rabbit girl with big glasses
>as the weeks go on you notice her sitting closer and closer to you
>you've even seen her point phone camera at you when she thinks you aren't looking
>eventually you go to sit down and find her sliding into the seat next to you
>you freeze as she leans into you, breathing creepily
>"don't make a scene, I just want to touch you"
>you want to hit her, or shout for help, but that might mean getting a bigger anthro involved
>one that might want "payment" for getting rid of this loon

>Both shoulders
>And the claw marks on his back
>Far too big to be a hyena, this must be the claiming marks of a-
>A claw taps her shoulder and she turns around, staring right into the face of a stinky wereyeen
>"Too late floppy ears!" The hunchbacked yeen bellows
>The wereyeen falls to the ground cackling
>Buncel goes back to her place and plays mariokart for the rest of the night, her dreams of proving bnnuy superiority dashed once again

>Your wife is trying to impress you with her hunting skills again.
>But after you looked in the trash can and found an empty container with a label of 'Elk heart, $35.99' you knew the truth.
>Honestly, you didn't care, but you knew she did.
>She prided herself on her old claw hunting skills, but you know that she usually uses a crossbow nowadays because her tits got too large.
>It's a sore spot for her.
>So you never brought up this 'dark' truth you had learned out of love for her.
>You were just glad that she started cooking it after you came down with food poisoning two weeks ago.
>It's rare, sometimes medium rare, but isn't that how steaks are supposed to be served?
>This isn't a steak, but it's close enough for you.
>She just looks so happy when you eat it with your hands and lick the bloody droplets off the plate.
>How could you deny her that?

>anthros taking human males as mates
>other anthros wonder why those other females would take such weak mates
>notice the human males don't go out as much and do a lot of work in their home
>seem even more fragile and useless
>then they start noticing the females with human males look unusually more groomed and nicer looking fur
>also their clothes or sacks/bags have stronger and tighter stitching
>their weapons have more intricately designed patterns cut onto them
>unusual and mouth watering smells come from their house when the human is cooking
>the females also won't shut up about how soft and nimble human tongues and fingers are and have no claws so no accidental scratches
>then those other anthros start getting ideas and the raids on human towns/villages goes up with mostly young males being taken alive

>husky/malamute GF really likes to carry you around or give piggyback rides for some reason
>then winter rolls around and get enough snow
>she's more excited than normal
>then she pulls a fucking sled out of a closet and some ropes/straps
>rips her own clothes off and makes you help put on all these weird straps on her
>then it hits you
>she wants to pull you on the sled herself
>turns out actually pretty fun and having her wiggling/bouncing ass dominate your view for most of the ride is pretty good too
>course this lasted only so long before she rushed the two of you back home where she fucks you so hard while still wearing the sled dog gear your legs temporary don't work

>medieval times
>all the guards/knights/nobility are anthros
>constantly forced to lick sweaty armored pits as a poor catnip farmer

>anthro caesars legion
>majority of the soldiers and almost all of the higher ups are anthros
>caesar is still a human

Caesar is a heifer with her horns buffered down
Lanius is a bear, ironically
Malpais is a ram
Lucius is a wolf
Vulpes is a fox
Aurelius is a phoenix
Gaius is a sphynx
I am horny

I still think caesar being a human makes the most sense as it would be more in line with how the legion was founded.
I also think it would be funny to have a legion of buff anthros led by a human guy that's half their size.

>you decide to hit up a bar one night for a couple drinks
>you sit down and notice the music over the speakers is a little loud

>Tribute? We don't raid your village, there's no need for--
>Aha, but I can tell that's not why you came here... you can't hide that embarrassment from me.

>I promise that your generosity will be rewarded in kind...

People keep complaining about stories/story quality lately, so here's two ideas I've had in the back of my mind:
Slowburn yandere/kidnapping stuff where I actually make it somewhat realistic. This would slightly lean into abusefag territory without being annoying or gory.
Wholesome story about Anon and his leopard seal girlfriend trying to make their relationship work. They live on an island and she's a commercial fisher or dockhand.
Any interest in either of these?

>buncel buys a motorcycle thinking it will make her a badass and show off to anon
>she's way too small to actually ride, falls over the moment she manages to get the kickstand up
>scrapes her knee and starts crying
>buncel has to ride bitch while anon takes it back to the dealership for her
>she uses her position to grope him whenever they're stopped

>getting hugged by anthros
>getting cuddled by anthros
>being in a loving relationship with them
>brushing their fur

>have Anthro step sister

>walking in on you showering
>walking around naked

>wake up one night while she sucks your cock
>"if you tell anybody, youre dead!"
>she proceeds to suck you off 4 more times before she leaves

>Date a husky anthro
>She is really nice and caring
>One night she sent me a image of a normal husky
>She says I have to share it in 24 hours or else she'll have fun with me

>anthro species can't interbreed like real animal species
>but humans are oddly universally compatible with all anthro species
>humanXanthro crossbreeding always results in the child/children being the same species as the anthro parent
>though there are many complications with human females trying to carry a baby/babies of a different species
>so the human males end up being the vast majority of the crossbreeding
>so this results in anthro species on the rarer side or ones in areas with few others of their species around seeking human guys to have children with

>This is some Mr. Burns shit
>You make your way towards your boss at the opposite end of the room
>As you do, you begin to make out a very familiar melody

>Oh shit.

I have a sci fi setting where humans set out to colonise the galaxy but the ship got lost and anthros found it centuries later
Now anthros didn't really understand why there was a large freezer of fertile apes floating around and they misinterpreted the ships logs in such a way that they believed they had found a race of peaceful breeders
Now anthros, being dominatrixes, had a destiny to claim the galaxy for the empress and great mother...but that takes a long time when you have a fixed breeding season. A limit these adaptable soft skins didn't appear to share.
So they "helped" the humans fulfill their mission. To become breeders and bring life to the anthro empires new worlds.
Being treated like this by anthros for generations created a new branch of humanity. With increased fertility, lower aggression, more traits that anthros desired such as creativity and general fitness, more varied hair and eye colors.
Of course this has pros/cons...in some regions humans are simply property, in others they are revered, the rapidly expanding empire has resulted in different factions.
Only a few anthros know the truth about humans tho, lost in the archives an all that. Somewhere out there are humans just as wild as any anthro warlord.
Yeah I have to get a life I know...I just love sci fi bros

Imagine being on earth when space anthros send aid and it just ends up being a husband adoption center for the weman of the galactic military. It’s a stay on a hell world to die or let the nice lady who has food play with your hair situation.

>She slowly moves a clawed hand to his scalp, running her fingers through his hair
>She leans in, looking your comrade right in his eyes
>"You're a goooood booooy" She softly coos. "My perfect little army man. So cute with your green clothes and big strong muscles. You ever thought about having kids someday? I can think of some privates under my command that would love to meet you."
>He weakly shakes his head side to side, damn it man resist!
>"Tell you what, if you give me the location to the outpost I'll make sure there'll be someone around to take good care of you. A priceless treasure like you doesn't deserve to be alone in the big cold universe."

>she was of course enquiring as to the fat nut you were requested to sit on over night, and finish this morning

>"No, no. You'll do pleasantly. Now stand on this scale facing me."
>she was referring to the same model of pediatric measuring device found in every such facility, black and white, loud as a train and looks like it was composed by a Nazi rocket scientist
>but facing her? she was standing to the side, somewhat awkwardly between the hazardous waste bin, counter edge and measure all in one area, centered to the room
>it was around the time that you began walking that the scent of your body has finally caught up with everything up top

>"Please remain comfortable for the remainder of the examination, and remember not to hold it in."
>"Hold it in?" you parroted, as she flashed a red and white pen light in your eyes
>"Oh." you dimly retorted, as your genitals immediately began to run frigid, a sensation which also began just above your pubis
>where your unmistakably lavatory-curious bladder was seated
>"Ma'am?"
>"I understand the sensation is uncomfortable, but this is the best that we can do." all but reading your mind, she assured, giving you the pride to finish at least one statement
>it was then that you felt rather rooted to the spot, as the apparent curse this woman has put you under has inebriated any urges to engage in that human pastime known as walking
>your lips were becoming like two viscous pieces of slime that were pried apart and haphazardly clenched together again; ill-defined and very, very damn yellow
>wait, not THAT yellow
>why is the doctor red and green now?
>'Persistence of Memory' had already begun re-creating itself with the sparse selection of wall art, as the doctor has taken your genitals in paw, apparently forgoing any further inspections
>it must have been
>the fucking pills
>the previous sight and revelation having been your final moments of note, as you began uncontrollably relieving yourself where you stood
>not quite prepared, the doctor hissed only an "Ah." before plugging the newfound leak; her scrubs, mask, fur and the floor so clean you would've previously eaten off it not unscathed, those jaundiced stains already setting in deeply
>the doctor hilted your average size with expertise, her lips forming a distinct funneling around the root of your cock, as she, well really- quite funneled your own sour fluid down her throat, likely not having tasted as much as one might expect
>in spite of a lack of reasonable faculties, your current dubiously-induced, definitely illegal-but-it's-China-so-who-hell-really-knows drug trip has resolved the situation in all but a few creative ways
>the hazard bin was making timely Abbot and Costello skits with unerring impressionism, and you didn't even know who Abbott and Costello were!
>the doctor had been in this situation many times previously, and had long since curbed any urges during this time, although the audible moans had indicated at least one set of vague emotions as she pulled off your penis slowly, her fangs harmlessly dragging along the skin, but not undetected
>as the empty status of your not-balls was fast approaching, Doctor Panda took your base and testicles in one tight O gesture between her thumb and pointer, and allowed your remaining fetid fluids to run flush across her tongue
>her eyes hitched but did not roll at the flavor, your piss settled upon her taste buds, and whipped her black and white bud into high gear
>as embarrassing as it was to have some smelly Chink's piss run awash over your nice, white labcoat, at least you weren't short enough to need a couple inches offset just to be mouth-to-dick level with a slouched Chinaman buzzing past Neptune on a concoction of paralytics and shitty Chinese psychoactives scraped off a dance floor in Xinjiang
>it appears that the shame was no large feat for her, as she popped your glans out from her apparently very painful hold, two streams of your steamy lemonade trickling from the intentionally open right side of her mouth, running fast and crashing hard into the fluff of her corresponding cheek
>drawing a quick breath, she pulled your little Chairman by his pointy hat back to her lips, where she was smearing any amount of saliva, dick sweat and that third forbidden ingredient across her pert little lips, which pursed and puckered along your reddened tip
>finally releasing her medically qualified sluthold, Doctor Panda rose, baring the faintest hint of intoxication in an errant lean into the counter, which she swiftly countered with professional subtlety
>now drained of your hot, stinking piss and your Johnson being far cleaner now than it has been in a fortnight, the trail of comets, floating Deng heads and geographically misplaced tanukis having settled some seconds earlier, it would almost seem as though Ms. Mrs.? Panda had all but cleaned your system out for good
>and really, isn't that all we ever ask of our medical professionals? to clean us out of poor health and any wealth?
>looking back at the clock, which you could only faintly make out from this distance deprived of your glasses, indicated that about fifteen minutes had passed, as you stickily arose from the padded inspection bench which crinkled incessantly as the waxed paper layer stuck to your greasy, neet back like the impending dread of $10 a gallon gas prices
>thank Xi you're not American you think, as the fond tones of flambeed dog testicles fills your mind, which was unusually refreshed
>focusing back to the room, you discovered that there was only one occupant, save for the puddle of your pee still on the floor to your right and the pointedly empty jar which still sat atop the counter
>desiring a little warmth in the temperature controlled setting, you had glanced where you last left your outfit, which was now missing
>as hesitation rose your heart rate, you had begun questioning a bit more than necessary at this point in the story
>but after a short time, she returned, visibly huffing, and her uniform and face still blemished
>"There... has been an unexpected setback with our diagnostic machinery. We experienced a wing-wide system outage lasting only eight seconds, but a substantial enough amount of time to render any samples invalid under their precise requirements."
>"Oh, well where are m-"
>"This of course means the events of this session will be rendered null until operations can be signed off before this weekend, and you will need to return first thing Monday morning for a comprehensive reanalysis under structured terms."
>failing to notice the outstretched midget arm which was handing you not one, not two but three of those very same shady capsules from yesterday
>"Which also means that your prescription will need to be extended for the weekend duration. We deeply apologize for any inconveniences this may cause, and will enjoy having you a- ..with us again once all of these technical kinks have been ironed out." adjusting her spectacles on the misspeak
>prying yourself from the bizzare doctor's office architecture, you stood before her, the short Panda making quick effort to continue looking you in the eye as she turns back to the counter, her position now reset
>intent to ask, but feeling rudely cut off one too many times to bother, you instead walked for the door
>"Your clothes are currently being washed in the janitor's office, you may wait here if you like until they are finished."
>having rested your hand on the metal hand already, you pressed on, intent to exit the uncharacteristically thick air of the patient to practitioner exchange
>not letting the door slam behind you, they were too cheap to install weighted door catches, the room now resumed a sole occupancy
>after having to ask for directions and be lead to a room labeled "Janitor's Closet" but in Chinese, you washed yourself at the sink, recovered your clothing and departed with the unorthodox in-house prescription in pocket
>tracing the embossment of the measures on the glass, Panda felt a writhe of malpracticing guilt in her gut, probably along with a couple cup's worth of piss to boot, as she grasped the measuring tool, stepped on the hazard bin's release and tossed the spotless glass inside

>A silence that is broken by several clicks and the roar of flames coming to life in front of you
>A fireplace makes itself known, it's warm flames a welcome change
>The adjustment to your surroundings, however, are not so welcome
>Rose petals are strewn on the floor around you, littering the bearskin rug you've been placed on

>On another stand that flanks the bed, is yet more roses
>It looks very much like someone's grand romantic gesture gone horribly wrong

She’s in competition with the private investigator hired by the family, and a vigilante looking for justice. Though their goals align it’s clear that they will never be able to work together.

>'I am sick and tired of coyotes sucking on my nutsack. I have had it with wild dogs rimming my ass. We Need change, and we need it now. I want to see a world where I can wander through the woods without worrying about some furry fuck making out with my testicles. I want to live in peace and harmony with all anthros, but these mangy curs keep interrupting my me-time to have a taste of my junk.*
>I am not a walking buffet for flea-ridden vermin, and I will not stand for it any longer. These coyotes need to be put down, or at the very least, relocated to a place where they can't bother innocent people like me. I have half a mind to go out there with a shotgun and start picking them off myself. It's time we took our country back from these amorous beasts.'*
>He then slammed the post button with far more force than needed, showing his fury to the rest of the other members of the discord server.
>Waiting a few seconds for the argument his fervent declaration created to get brought to him by his shitty internet, he rereads his statement.
"Perhaps I should start carrying my shotgun, it'd scare most of those critters off," he muttered to himself.
>The next day he went for his daily hike, looked at his shotgun for a moment, checked that it was loaded, and slung it over his shoulder.
>Stepping out of his house, he locked the door and set out.
>There's a nice lake a short ways away from his house where he goes fishing.
>He even built a little shed to store his fishing gear in so he doesn't need to carry a rod or bait out.
>The walk to the lake was calm, but he made certain to get his gun in his hands and face any noise he heard.
>But it was rarely the walk to the lake that was troublesome, it was always the trek back after a good day of fishing that was the time he'd get assaulted the most.
>They never took too much of his fish, but it was grating to have his work stolen from him.
>Not today.
>Today he's coming back home with a full cooler of fish.
>The fishing was successful, his traps managed to catch a couple of crayfish and the nets and his rod got quite a few fish.
>He was fortunate that the lake was large enough to make overfishing it nearly an impossibility.
>Mentally preparing for the journey back, he locked up his gear and extended the handle of the wheeled cooler.
>Silently cursing the fact he didn't have a handgun, he started walking.
>Even with his shotgun, he felt vulnerable.
>Wielding a shotgun one handed is just impossible, if he got attacked he'd have to drop the cooler to even line up a shot.
>That's a lot of time for a coyote to close the distance.
>It also meant responding to every shaking bush that might have either a pair of fucking squirrels or a coyote waiting in ambush took more time.
>So he as completely unprepared for when two coyotes leapt at him and pinned him to the ground.
>As one of them moved to pin your upper body and silence your angry words with her rear on your face, you saw another three coyotes come from the woods.
>With your last moments of sight, you saw one move to the cooler and the others go to where their friend was pulling down your pants.
>Your attempts at struggling are ineffective against the strength of four coyotes and all of your wrathful words are reduced to mere vibrations against the triangular folds of the anthro atop of him.
>The three coyotes at your lower half fumble at undoing your belt with your squirming, but eventually they manage.
>In result of their success, you feel your pants get pulled to your ankles and your legs tossed up in the air.
>The coyote on your face grabs your legs and pins them so your knees are against your sides, it is not comfortable in the slightest.
>Now that you're completely exposed, the coyotes can have their fun, one takes your balls in her mouth to assail with her tongue.
>Another draws your half-mast member into her maw.
>The last immediately drills her tongue into your ass.
>The one on your face tries to order you to eat her out, but you stubbornly refuse with pursed lips.
>The coyote caressing your nuts with her tongue demonstrates the sharpness of her fangs to encourage you to reconsider.
>Reluctantly, you stick your tongue out and half-heartedly give a few licks, the happy pants of the bitch above you removes the sensation of sharp fangs against your sack.
>The sensation of a long tongue in your rear is an unfortunately familiar sensation.
>Between the violation of your rear and the suction on your member, your reach your peak and give the suckling coyote the mouthful she wanted.
>With their 'payment' now complete, they bounce off of you, the one eating your ass giving a whine of displeasure as she's dragged away.
>Your hands immediately start reaching for your shotgun, but doing so is difficult with your pants being down and you having just came.
One of the fuckers decides to shout, "Thanks for the fish! See you tomorrow!" as they run.
>The shotgun finally finds your hands and you try to line up a shot but they're already gone.
>The temptation to fire a shot after them immerges in the finger on the trigger, but you relent.
>It's unlikely you'd even hit them with how thick the woods can be at times.
>Disgruntled, you fix your pants and look around for your belt as you grumble.
>Finally redressed, you try and brush off some of the dirt as you search the cooler.
>They took half of it, some of the better stuff too.
>You were looking forward to that large fish, it was a difficult catch.
>Now dirty and dejected, you restart the journey home with a much lighter cooler.
>Maybe you'll head into town tomorrow.
>Perhaps cut down a tree, firewood is useful to have around.
>You're tired of fishing.
>Well, not fishing itself, you're just tired having half of your daily catch get stolen from you.
>A few days of just doing some carpentry and work around the house would be nice.
>You've been meaning to clean your stove.

>You hunker down behind the crate, trying to keep your breathing down.
>"Where are youuuuuu?" You hear her sing out.
>"There's no where you can run, my girls have this place surrounded. All you'll accomplish is tiring yourself out before the fun part!"
>You tried to think, how on earth were you going to get out of this mess?
>You think you see a door to outside on the second floor, but she was literally standing between you and the stairs.
>You hear the clacking of her claws against the cement floor. She sounded a good distance away, but with how bad the acoustics in this warehouse were, that didn't mean anything.
>At least all the spilled chemicals meant she couldn't smell you.
>"~come out, come out wherever you are!~" She sings again, sounding closer this time.
>"Where oh where has my cute mate gone? Are you in...HERE?" As she suddenly yanks open a closet.
>"You're lucky I enjoy a good game of hide and seek. I wonder what sort of reward I'll have to take from you when I win?"
> The clacking sound is getting closer. You spy a long table you could probably crawl underneath of to get some distance around her, but surely any movement you make will risk alerting her?
>Maybe she'll give up?
>"Why are you hiding from me? It's not like I want to hurt you, I've simply decided you're the one for me. Really, it's your own fault for not getting hitched already." She mocked, sounding closer and closer.
>What was it going to be; hide in one spot or make a break for it? If you were quiet, she might pass by you. If you were fast, you might be able to sneak around her and make for the stairs.
>"I hope you aren't thinking about escaping. I'd be really disappointed if I had to keep hunting you. This heat has been making me so irritable I might just do something rash when I finally find you."

>How would Zig Zag work in a /adhg/ setting?
Anon pushed/coerced/forced into pornography seems like the first obvious choice, depending on how hard into dominating him you want to go. Zig Zag is a businesswoman who understands supply and demand very well and what kinds of humie porn is popular among her target audiences.

>human men down on their luck get pimped out to anthros for cash
>after running into legal trouble, Anon is desperate for money to pay off loans and decides to sell his body
>however every time he is about to go off with some anthro client, he is somehow diverted to some chore by the boss/pimp
>due to his inability to get clients, he isn’t paid enough for the loans
>the boss comes up to him with an offer to pay off his debt
>in exchange; he is employed to her forever, and receives a “promotion” to her “personal assistant”

>Anon answers an ad for a human male pornstar, has his reservations but desperately needs the money
>Meets Zig Zag, who mostly retired from acting to stay behind the camera nowadays, and who makes the convincing enough argument for him to go through with it
>It's not like he uses the Internet much anyways, his dignity is worth the consistent paycheck
>Virtually all of his films involve him being topped by either bigger, muscular anthros or squat and kinda gross buncel-types
>Not the hot anthro stepsister or pizza-ordering MILF he'd rather be with, but Zig Zag made it clear this is what the audience wants
>And she paid for the actual studies to prove it
>But every night when she joins him in bed, bare skin against soft fur and his head against her wonderfully voluptuous chest
>Being gentle with him in every way the actresses aren't, running claws through his hair while whispering in his ear that he's her favorite
>It might just make it all worth it
I could see it being two-pronged domination, not only being physically dominated on cam but also being mentally or emotionally dominated by Zig Zag herself even if she's intentionally being gentle with him.

Need more anthros pimping out brothers, husbands, and fathers.

>During the research leading to the composition of his monograph The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behavior, Hans Kruuk kept a tame hyena he named Solomon.
>Kruuk found Solomon's company so congenial, he would have kept him, but Solomon had an insatiable taste for "cheese in the bar of the tourist lounge and bacon off the Chief Park Warden's breakfast table", and no door could hold him back, so Solomon was obliged to live out his days in the Edinburgh Zoo.

"Ava."
>she goes on rumbling in her sleep
>you shove the offending appendage away from you and try to scoot to the other end of the bed
>but that tail of hers seems to have a mind of its own, as it slaps down on your side and starts to curl around your waist
"Ava! Cut it out!"
>you manage to pry loose from the gator's tail before it manages to constrict you like a boa
>you roll over
>and then you have to roll over again to reach the edge and sit up on the bed
>you groan, stretching out sore and dehydrated muscles
>Ava rumbles a little more, and the whole bed shudders as the towering reptile covers the whole distance of the super-king sized bed in one turn
>"GRRRRMMMMmmmmornin' Anon..."
>she reaches out to you, catching your arm to drag you down into her embrace
"Ava, please. Let me get some water before we start again."
>she sighs and reaches out to the bedside table, picking up a pitcher of water that had apparently been there all night
>""ere ya go Anon."
>with that, she brings the pitcher to your face and upends it, drenching you
"Ah!"
>you gasp and tug against Ava's arm that still hold you against her chest
"What the hell Ava! Your tail was bad enough already!"
>you gasp, sputtering out for breath
>at least you feel a little revitalized
>Ava giggles and cuddles you tighter, forcing your head between her breasts so all the world is framed in her soft-scaled flesh
>if you were turned around, you'd be worried about her putting you in another death roll
>you don't know if you could survive a fifth
>"What's wrong with my tail, Anon?"
>her voice rumbles around you, making you feel it as much as you hear it
"It's fine, when it's not slapping me silly or accidentally choking me in my sleep!"
>Ava laughs again
>"Oh hush, you didn't mind my tail so much last night. You hugged the whole thing when I let you take a break and fuck me doggy style."
>she considers that a break?
>you were holding onto her tail for dear life
"Just stop...slapping me with it. I don't know how you manage with a giant anaconda attached to your butt."
>that earns another laugh from the gator, and she pulls you free from her embrace to turn you about and look you in the eye
>"Oh it's much more than that baby. It's thicker, and sexier than any snake."
>you roll your eyes
>Ava harrumphs and sits up
>she takes you with her, easily manhandling you into place to sit at the edge of the bed beside her
>then Ava stands with her hands on her hips, and her tail raised
>god you love that ass of hers
>"Maybe you and it just need to get reacquainted."
>you go to ask what she means, before she slaps the whole weight of her tail down against your body, knocking you flat
>the wind is knocked out of your lungs
>"That's better! Anon, meet tail."
>Ava giggles, surprisingly high-pitched for a creature of her size, and presses down with her tail
>all your attempts to escape from under the appendage fail, she's surprisingly dexterous with it and keeps you pinned
>the underside of her tail is lined with the same soft scales as her chest and belly, and despite your annoyance, rubbing against it is starting to have an affect on you
>your cock starts to throb at the sensation
>you groan
>after going six rounds with an insatiable gator last night, you didn't think it was possible for you to get hard again
>but as Ava grinds your tail against your entire body, the tip slapping against your face, your body finds the will and spare fluids to get to full mast
>"Oh? Starting to make nice with miss tail? Why don't you kiss it, Anon?"
>you turn your head to the side to speak
"I will not."
>Ava laughs, and slaps your cheek with the tip of her tail as she grinds against you harder
>"Go on, give it a kiss. It'll hurt my feelings if you don't. You know you love it."
>you sigh and turn back, giving the gator tail a kiss as it slides across your face
>Ava laughs triumphantly and lifts her tail off you
>she gasps
>"Oh! You really like my tail, don't you? Were you gonna cum just from humping it?"
>your face burns
"No, you were just rubbing against me and..."
>Ava continues to laugh, and slaps her tail down on your body again
>"That's not the truuuth!"
>teasing you in a sing-song voice, she slaps you a few more times before lifting her tail again
>"Tell me the truth Anon. Tell me you're a dirty, tail-humping pervert, and I'll let you cum on it."
>fuck it
>you already admitted to being 'mommy's little man' last night
>and you're really starting to enjoy yourself anyways
"I'm a tail-humping pervert, Ava. You've got the thickest, sexiest, best tail in the world and I wanna hump it until I bust a nut all over its pretty scales."
>"Ha! You really are a pervert. But since you're such a good boy, I guess I'll let you have your fun."
>she lets her tail down again in a might 'whump!' and starts to grind over you again
>this time you get into it
>hard
>your arms and legs go around the meaty tail, and you thrust against it in reckless lust
>you love this giant gator's tail so much, you kiss it again
>your thrusts get faster and faster
>and after last night, your stamina isn't exactly in top form
"Ava, j--just a little more!"
>she rumbles in pleasure
>you give one final thrust and burst
>spattering her scales with your seed, you grip onto the tail laid across your body desperately
>Ava goes on rumbling in smug self-satisfaction while you use her tail to get off
>if you weren't already covered head-to-toe with Ava's own fluids, you might feel a little ashamed at making such a mess all over both of you
>especially since it seems that tail-humping is especially taboo
>when you're finally finished, Ava raises her tail from you and admires her handiwork
>or tailiwork?
>"You really are a pervert, Anon. Cumming all over a girl's tail."
>she scoffs in mock disdain at your apparent degeneracy, before turning around to look down at you
>"I guess I can forgive you for being such a dirty little tail-humper. If you help me wash up in the shower."
>Ava reaches down and tenderly lifts you up into her arms, carrying you bridal style
>"I'll even let you kiss my tail again~"

>Anon wants to turn his life around

>work has been kicking your ass, especially with all the extra customers that summertime brings to an ice-cream shop
>you feel sticky, tired, and miserable
>but you had to find some way of paying for school
>community college may be cheap, but it's not that cheap
>you'll be saving up all summer just to afford a payment plan for next semester
>that is if your grades were good enough
>you say a silent prayer to whoever may be listening for your finals to have gone over well
>when you slide the key into the front door of your apartment, you place your ear against the door to listen for any sounds within
>thankfully quiet is all that greets you
>she's not home yet
>you slip inside, and make sure to lock the door behind you
>you'll have a little time to yourself to relax and unwind
>first things first, you shed your uniform, not bothering to pick any of it up as you make your way toward the bathroom to shower
>if she's going to get on your case, she can do it once you're clean
>the shower is heavenly, even if the pressure is still a little weird
>but when you come out, you hear the voice you were so dreading
>"There you are! You got home earlier than I expected, Anon."
>the timber smiles warmly down at you
>she was waiting for you in the hallway
"Oh. Hey Harper. How was your day?"
>she sighs and indicates the bundle of clothes cradled under one arm
>"I missed you of course. Why do you have to go to work all day, even in the summer? I make more than enough to pay for your classes."
>you wince at the mention of your schooling
>your girlfriend had offered to pay for it a dozen times over, as well as house, clothe, and feed you for the duration of your college career
>but you insisted on making it on your own
>it was a point of pride
>you were going to make it on your own
>"Speaking of, I think your grades should have come back by now. Why don't we go check them?"
>her demeanor becomes dour as she takes your wrist to pull you along
>"You remember our deal, right Anon?"
>how could you forget?
"Of course I remember the deal."
>ever since you were kids, Harper has been asking you to marry her
>at first it was just cute puppy love, but as time went on, she became more and more serious
>you remained close friends through middle school
>of course you dated in high school
>and she took your virginity, just like you took hers
>but all the while she still promised that one day she would marry you
>her happily ever after
>which leads to now, as she pulls you toward your computer desk to check your grades
>when you graduated high school, you and Harper made a deal
>once you made it through college, then you would consider getting married once you had a proper job
>but when "once" you graduated college became "if" you graduated college, she amended the deal
"Can I at least put on some pants?"
>Harper sits you down and flips open the laptop in front of you
>"No. I want easy access."
>the new deal was if you failed out, you agreed to marry her
>and father her first litter ASAP
>"Okay, now check your grades."
>Harper leans down against you, arm around your bare shoulder as you pull up the school's access page
>you log in, and hover the mouse curser over the link labeled "Grades"
>you hesitate
>you had really tried your best this semester
>if those grades aren't good enough to get you off probation...
>Harper's paw goes over yours, and clicks the mouse
>it seems to take forever for the page to load
>but when it finally does, and you see those four letters staring back at you
>you freeze
>the whole world starts to spin
>you try to breath, but it feels erratic and uncontrollable
"Wait..."
>Harper squeezes your shoulder
"Wait wait wait, no..."
>the timber wolf stands to her full height and slides the laptop closed without a word
"Harper please, I can--I can appeal with a counselor..."
>she doesn't respond, simply reaching down to trace a tender paw over your cheek
>you turn stare up at her, tears welling in your eyes
>her yellows eyes start back, big and round and full of care
>"Anon, my love. My dearest. I'm so sorry."
>she takes your wrist again in an attempt to stand you up
>but when you resist, she simple leans down again to scoop you up into her arms
>you cling to her, shaking with the effort to keep from crying
>Harper shushes you as she carries you down the hall to your bedroom
>even when she sits down, she doesn't release you from her embrace
>she just keeps shushing you and hugs you tight
>"It's okay Anon. It's alright."
>you shake your head
"It's not alright. I'm a failure Harper! I--I tried and I worked and I studied! I did everything right and I failed!"
>you cling to her in let out a scream through clenched teeth
>it's not fair
>"You didn't fail, my love. It was never meant to be."
>you gasp
>the words sting like an open wound
>"You tried your best, and you never gave up. That's why you'll make a perfect husband, and a wonderful father to our pups. That's what is meant to be."
>she traces a paw over your cheek again, wiping away tears as she does so
>"This is the next chapter of our lives, Anon. Our life, together."
>she pulls you into a tender kiss, still holding your trembling body with her other arm
>you want to protest
>your pride burns in anguished defeat to this powerful she-wolf
>and worst of all, she's right
>you love Harper
>and even if it meant losing your pride, you couldn't bear to leave her
"I just--"
>you pull away from the kiss in the last throws of your surrender
"I wanted to be more than just a house husband."
>Harper shakes her head and frowns at you in disapproval
>"You are already everything I could ever ask of you."
>she kisses you one more time, deep and passionate as she lays you down and mounts you
>"You're mine."

>War happens, your waifur has to gather food since food is scarce due to shelling of shops

‘Thanks for agreeing to look after him, Vera. I don’t know what I’d do without you.’
‘Oh, it’s not a problem at all, Julia!’ Vera smiled. ‘Little Luke seems like a darling. You say he’s well-behaved?’
‘Absolutely.’ Julia nodded. ‘He’s a darling. He really tries to be nice and helpful whenever he can. You be sure to tell me if he misbehaves, though.’ Julia opened her mouth to say something. She hesitated, then decided to proceed. ‘I was wondering... it might be rude for me to ask, but... how goes the search for a man?’
‘Not rude at all!’ Vera smiled. ‘It’s nice to have another lady to discuss these things with. And, honestly? It’s not going well at all.’
‘Oh, dear.’ Julia did feel concerned. The fox woman was her neighbour, after all, and she had little time for socialising nowadays. Frankly, Vera was good company. Julia honestly didn’t understand why the busty vixen couldn’t find a partner. She didn’t know her exact age, but Julia suspected her to be in her early-to-mid thirties.
Julia doubted her capacity as a human to assess the attractiveness of a beast female, but... really, there was no way to call Vera ‘ugly’. Smooth, short fur covered her body, red across the top of her head, down her back, and at the top of her arms and her thighs. The rest of her fur was cream-coloured, and she clearly took good care of it. She wore a pair of jeans, and a simple, light-blue top.
‘Not fantastic at all. I‘m aware we’re a bit of a minority nowadays, but honestly… all the good canid men are taken! I’ve been considering doing it artificially at this point, but...’ she shrugged. ‘You know.’
Julia nodded her head sadly. ‘Don’t do anything if you aren’t one hundred percent sure about it.’
‘Oh, I won’t. My clock’s ticking, though. I don’t want to wait another five years to get started. Honestly, I don’t want to wait two!’ She smiled, glancing towards her neighbour’s house. Julia’s front lawn was a little overgrown – a fact Vera didn’t judge her for in the slightest. Being a single mom was not an easy thing. ‘I do still have a few ideas, though... where is your little Luke?’
‘Here he is now!’ Right as Vera asked, the door to Julia’s suburban home opened. A small boy bounded out, holding a small backpack. He smiled, approaching Vera and Julia. ‘There you are. What took you so long?’
‘I couldn’t find my game. I’ve got it now, though.’ The boy beamed a smile up at Vera. ‘Hi, Miss Cannis!’
‘Oh, please, call me Vera.’ Vera reached a paw down and ruffled Luke’s hair. She smiled with her eyes, very pleased to see the boy she’d be looking after for the day. Luke wore a pair of cargo shorts and a black t-shirt, and resembled his mother somewhat. He had smooth, straight blonde hair and blue eyes, a cute, round face, and a skinny build. Unlike Julia, whose mood was constantly marred by stress, Luke had an adorable smile on his face almost every time Vera saw him. He was, in Vera’s strong opinion, tremendously adorable and handsome. It would be a shame when he truly became a teenager – Vera worried he would lose his cute looks.
‘You know where the house key is?’ asked Julia. ‘You’ve got a change of clothes? You have your laptop?’
‘Come on, Mom, it’s right next door! The house key is under the pot plant on the porch. I didn’t forget anything, and if I did, I can just go inside and get it!’
‘I know, I know.’ Julia sighed. ‘Sorry. I really have to get going.’ She leaned down and gave Luke a kiss on the forehead. ‘Be good for Vera, okay?’
‘I promise, Mom! Go off to work!’
Julia chuckled, shaking her head as she headed towards her car. ‘I’ll see you after twenty-four hours of running around after sick and dying people. All the poor, sick birdie men... you know how it goes. Fun.’ Julia got into her car and started the engine. She waved at Vera, and her son, smiling and driving away. She felt content leaving Luke with her neighbour, and her thoughts were quickly consumed with her upcoming shift at the hospital.
Vera watched the car drive away. She turned to Luke. ‘Well. How about we head inside?’
‘Sure!’
>Three Hours Later
Vera gazed at Luke as he reclined happily on her living room couch, playing on a handheld game console and watching a movie. She leaned on the kitchen countertop, supporting her head with her hands, watching him intently. Well, she couldn’t see much beyond the back of his head from this angle – Vera was in deep thought.
This was a good movie. It had a funny romantic subplot between a feline and a human. Like many canid species, Vera could never find cat people attractive. She remembered back when she was a puppy, when calling them ‘cats’ wasn’t politically incorrect. Calling an avian a ‘bird’ had been no issue, and referring to an equine as a ‘horse’ was only mildly offensive. ‘Pony’, however, still hadn’t been okay even back then...
Still, the state of the world really did her head in sometimes. She understood why some folk had grown to dislike it. Being called by the species you’d evolved from didn’t suit everyone. Vera would never call a human ‘monkey’, but she could never see herself taking offense to being labelled ‘fox.’
She decided to take her mind off the complexity of modern animalistic politics, turning her thoughts to Luke. She’d stripped down a bit since inviting him inside, swapping out her shirt for a white tank top.
She had also removed her bra.
‘You’re not hungry?’ Vera asked, approaching her charge slowly.
‘Nope, I’m fine, thanks!’ replied Luke, tapping away at his console.
‘You want to chat at all?’
‘Sure!’ Luke put his game down. ‘I can pause this game. And I’ve seen this movie, like, ten times.’
Vera leaned atop the sofa, resting her enormous breasts on top of it. She noticed Luke’s eyes flicker to them, then back up to her face. ‘I just want to know how you’re doing. I have a few fun things we can do while you’re here.’ This was the first time Luke had stayed with his mature, busty vixen neighbour, though Vera had entertained some lewd thoughts about her neighbour’s son before...
‘Yeah, I’m doing fine! How about you? What fun things?
Well...’ she moved slowly around the couch, moving with a gentle sway of her hips, before sitting down beside Luke. The younger, smaller boy eyed her curiously. ‘I’ve got a couple of things I’d like to talk to you about.’
‘Sure.’ Luke smiled. ‘What’s been going on? I heard you and Mom talking about some stuff.’
Vera sidled a little closer to him, noticing how the boy’s eyes darted across her body. He really was adorable. Vera was getting all kinds of thoughts just looking at him. ‘Yes. Well, as you can see, I’m a grown-up woman. That means I want certain things.’
‘You’re really pretty, too, Vera.’
‘Ohoho, you sweet boy!’
‘I was wondering why you didn’t have a husband or anything.’ Luke closed his mouth tightly. ‘Uh... sorry, I think that was rude to say.’
‘Oh, don’t worry, sweetheart. You’re right to wonder – that's just what I was going to talk about.’
‘H-huh?’
‘I just turned thirty-five, you see. When women get to my age... well, there are things a lot of them want.’ She stared down at Luke, who averted her eyes. He was starting to blush. No doubt Vera’s lack of a bra was throwing him off. Her rack was, to put it simply – massive. She was extremely well-endowed, and had been blessed with a curvy canine figure. She had a thick ass, furry like the rest of her body, but no less attractive to the majority of men. There were always the types who didn’t want to fuck a fox lady. But, with the way Luke was looking at her... ‘Can you guess what I want?’
‘Um... I’m not sure.’
‘Well, tell me, little Luke. Have you learned in school... how babies are made?’
‘Babies?’ Luke blushed even more. ‘Yeah. Yeah, I did. You put a man’s... honestly, it’s kind of embarrassing to talk about.’
‘Did they tell you that it feels good?’
‘Huh?’ Vera leaned down to the small boy, now, resting her muzzle on his shoulder. ‘I like that, Vera. But what are you doing? What do you mean?’ She reached a careful paw down to the boy’s crotch, letting it rest on his front. ‘Uh...’
‘Making a baby. You have sex to make a baby.’
Luke nodded. ‘They mentioned that. Also, why are you touching my dick?’
Vera giggled. Such a cute little human boy. He really was just perfect. ‘It’s what you use to make a baby. Has your dick ever got all big and hard?’ Vera smiled at Luke as he turned his head away. ‘Don’t be shy. You can tell me anything. I don’t bite.’
‘A couple of times. It always goes down, though. They explained that, but I didn’t really get it. I’ve tried touching it a bit, but I don’t think that did anything. Were you wanting to touch it?’
‘I was.’ Vera stood up, getting off the couch. She crouched down in front of Luke, giving him an eyeful of her fantastic rack. ‘You see, the reason I haven’t gotten married at all is I like human boys like you. I’ve been realising... canid men just don’t do it for me. They’re always so rough, aggressive, dominating... every man I meet is the same.’
‘A-are they really?’ Luke didn’t want to admit it, but he was starting to get an erection. There would be no hiding it. Vera had her muzzle right in front of his crotch.
‘I just can’t bring myself to like them. Not when there are adorable human boys around. Have you ever had a girlfriend, little Luke? You’re such a gorgeous boy.’
‘No. Most of the girls my age aren’t all that pretty.’
‘What kind of girls do you like?’
‘...’
‘Come on. You know I won’t tell your mother anything that happens here. All she’ll hear is that you’ve been a good boy.’
‘I like... grown-up girls. And... well, I like fox ladies. I mean... what’?’
‘It’s okay to call me a fox, dear. I’m so glad to hear you like us. Not all human men do. You think I’m pretty too, don’t you?’
‘L... lots. I, um... I think of you at night-time, sometimes.’
Every word the boy said was music to Vera’s doggy ears. Even in animalistic cultures, the things she would soon do were not exactly acceptable... but there would be no harm done, if everything went according to her plans. ‘And I think you’re a cute, wonderful little man who I’d like to do a few very fun things with.’
‘Like what?’
‘If I touch your dick, I can make you feel good. Not just good – amazing. You trust me, don’t you?’
‘Yeah, of course! It sounds a little weird, but you can do whatever you want with me!’
What an excellent start to things. ‘There’s just one condition. You absolutely cannot ever tell your Mum. I won’t tell her anything, but you need to keep it a secret too.’
‘Sure. I’m good at keeping secrets.’ God, Vera wanted to just jump onto him. She was feeling butterflies in her stomach and a fire in her loins. Her friend’s son had been cute as a button for as long as Vera had known him, but she’d only been honest with herself recently. She got in close to the boy’s crotch, edging her paws up his thighs, slowly caressing them.
‘Mmm...’ she grabbed the boy by his small, soft hand. ‘Follow me to my bedroom if you want to do something really fun...’

>A grin came to the corners of your muzzle as you watched the man on the screen shudder in orgasm again.
>Threads of warm fluid bathed your tongue again.
>You don’t know how, but there’s a machine that keeps whoever is locked in the gloryhole constantly hard and offering plentiful loads.
>It also seems to make their cum fucking delicious.
>You’ve had to give blowjobs before, you’ve lost a few bets with your friends.
>They never tasted this good though.
>You haven’t even started rubbing your pussy and you’ve cum a few times over the last hour just from taste.
>The expectations you had about this place were low.
>Your friend described it as ‘gloryholes filled with kidnapped humans’.
>Much to your surprise, the ‘kidnapped humans’ bit wasn’t false advertising.
>Watching two hyenas drag a gagged man over to an empty stall and start stripping him was quite the sight.
>He put up quite the fight, but he didn’t succeed. Nevertheless, it was impressive to watch.
>Maybe it’s his fighting spirit that makes him so tasty?
>You don’t see why it would, but it’s been quite fun to watch him go from defiantly holding back his seed to a mewling out his peaks.
>It was tempting to take him for a ride, but you had a romantic soul.
>You wanted to save your first time for when you’d gotten married and had the usual ceremonial hunt.
>It was fun betting with your sister about how long your aunt’s husband could evade her.
>So instead you used your maw.

>You've gone on a mate hunt with three of your sisters-in-arms as hunting alone is foolish.
>The type of hunt doesn't matter, you sprain your ankle and there's a good chance you'll either never get found and starve or get finished of by a predator.
>Fortunately, you aren't just randomly prowling around for a mate.
>Another hunter pack said that they found a human wandering the wood, you had the luck of all those hunters being mated so they didn't nab him.
>You and your sisters agreed to spar over him once you brought him back to your village.
>All four of your were grinning at the thought of getting him, because of the stories you've heard.
>Enduring, intelligent, a skilled set of clawless paws to lovingly groom your fur, and that any daughters they father inherit their strength and intellect while keeping their mother's fur.
>The most alluring thing was that they would fight back and resist, sometimes they'd even win.
>A mate that can't fight you, can't stand with you against the threats of the world, whether that's starvation, disease, or raiders.
>Stalking through the wood, you found scent of smoke and the smell of cooking meat.
>You and your sisters found him quickly and determined a direction to chase him.
>Encircling him was an option, but that removes the thrill of the chase.
>First chase him and tire him out, then descend upon him with the butts of your spears to knock him out to take home.
>As the hunt leader, you wanted to be the one to spark the chase.
>Leaping to a nearby rock with the sharp end of your spear at the ready, you startle him with a howl that your sisters join.
>Glee flows through your mind as he jerks in surprise, his wide eyes making you lick your teeth.
>Your legs tense as he looks like he's about to run-!
"What?" you whisper.
>Instead of running, he started to strip and laid on the ground on his back with legs splayed, presenting his arousal towards you.
>It's the one thing you didn't plan for.
>You expected him to run, hoped he'd charge you, and feared that he'd just break down in a sobbing mess.
>With the first you'd get a merry hunt.
>The second, a duel with a mate that would face the dangers of the world with you, or whoever was lucky to get him, with courage.
>The last would be disappointing, but maybe salvageable. Perhaps he got thrown out of his tribe or something and would be able to stand with his mate in the future as he'd have something worth fighting for?
>Ironically, it's perhaps the best way to have destroyed you and your sister's interest in him.
>It's likely that he heard rumors about your people's mate hunts and came by for what he thought was some easy sex.
>He sounds like the stereotype of a disloyal mate in the stories the elders tell.
>You consult your sisters about what to do.
>Two suggest just leaving him and informing the elders about him so other hunting packs can avoid him.
>The last suggests taking him with as someone might want him.
>You make the decision to just leave the pervert, who watches in confusion at the four of you leaving.
>The trek back home isn't pleasant.
>You each had high hopes, hopes that the elders did their best to temper and make realistic.
>But having your tempered expectations get so dashed is agonizing.
>The fact your prey was held in such high renown only makes it more bitter.
>Telling the elders the bad news is met with understanding nods.
>The last thought in your mind as you went off to sleep was of how damn unlucky you are.
>You get the good fortune of hunting down a rare mate, but they'd make for a terrible mate.

>But each time, she's more and more aroused
>Each time anon gains a little more ground in the fight
>A year of this later, anon and the bear have been brawling for hours
>Neither side is willing to admit their near-inexhaustible stamina is reaching its limit
>Suddenly anon falters and the bear lands a hard gut punch
>Anon is on his back again, but this time is different
>The liquid hot heat of bear-pussy lands on his face
>She forces him to eat her out
>Anon is left with a raging erection and the mark of his opponent
>Next time is similar, but this time she grinds against his junk until she finishes
>Anon is so close, but ultimately edged in the process
>Next time they fight to a draw, both collapsing on opposite sides of the clearing
>Once they catch their breath, the bear simply walks over, pins anon under her hips, and starts riding him
>It's rough, and anon isn't 100% sure the fight actually ended
>But eventually she wrings his seed from him

>There's at least one new book in the library every night
>And the most noticable of them all
>The happy smiles on the childrens' faces
>"The shadow cat came!" they'd all show, showing off their new clothes
>"The bad luck gave me a new pair of shoes!"
>"The night knife left a cake in the kitchen!"
>And so on and so on

>Because she's telling you
>As she pummels your boss into the dirt and you pretend to be unconcious
>She might be an altruist at heart but you aren't about to test her
>You'll just settle for what you usually do: ask her out and see if you don't wake up in the middle of the night tied to your bed with a knife to your throat and a hand on your junk
>Because whether you're an abandoned child or a man forced to do terrible things to live one thing is true
>A black cat means good luck for you

>she sets down a small red bag with a white cross on it, and produces a set of jangling keys
>"Let me just grab some stuff from the clubhouse and we can get started!"
>you nod dumbly and watch her go
>you yank off your t-shirt and drop it on the deck chair, leaving you even chillier in just your swim trunks
>a couple seconds later, the otter returns sans shorts, and carrying a foam floatation device
>if she has to use that thing on you, you think you'd prefer to drown
>but she gives you an encouraging smile when she sees you
>"All set? We'll start in the shallow end just to get you acclimated. I know you humans are sensitive to cold water."
>that sounds like a good plan
>better to drown than to drown and freeze
>you walk down toward the shallow end of the pool, but stop when you hear the pad of otter paws on the pavement beside the pool
>your instruct runs right across the deck and leaps into a perfect dive into the pool
>you watch her swim two quick laps around the pool, her entire body moving gracefully in concert
>she pops up in the shallow end of the pool with a sigh, and effortlessly treads water so her upper half is above the surface
>"Ah! Feels good to get the fur wet! Come on in."
>you set your feet down on the first step, and immediately regret
>if the air is cold, the water is freezing
>you stand there and try to work up the will to move your legs
>the otter swims up close, and giggles at the sight of you
>"It's a lot easier if you just jump in all at once, get the shock out of the way."
>for some reason, you find you trust her on this
>and so you try to gracefully jump forward the rest of the way into the pool
>instead you fall into a graceless belly flop
>the shock of the cold water drives the air from your lungs, and you breath in water through your nose
>you come up coughing and gasping, trying to wipe the water from your face and stop the burning sensation in your sinus
>the instructor is right behind you before you can realize
>her paw is on your back as she leans
>"You okay there? Maybe we should have started off a bit slower."
>she tries to hide the giggle as you manage to blink your eyes clear
>"Okay, you feeling pretty used to the water now?"
>you don't know if you are, but the otter keeps her hand on you back and nods for you
>so you nod along
>damn pretty otter is going to make you drown
>"Great! Now, I have a few exercises that will help you get used to the water. We'll start with treading water!"
>over the next half hour, the otter takes you through several exercises to get the very basics of swimming into your head
>you like to think you did well
>but the constant giggles and correction from your teacher says otherwise
>several times she has to put a paw on your lower back or her long dexterous tail around you to keep you upright
>who knew swimming could be so tiring?
>she's constantly encouraging, however, praising what little progress you've made when she calls a break
>"You're doing great! This is your first time swimming you said?"
>you sit down on the pool steps and give her another nod
"First time in anything deeper than a bath tub."
>the otter beams at you and bounces in place
>don't stare at her chest you pervert
>"You're doing a great job! You've already done better than I expected you to get done in one day."
>you feel your face heating despite the chill of the pool
"Probably just cause it was a one on one lesson today."
>she nods and stops bouncing to tread water once again
>"I think so! Maybe we could do some more one on one lessons if you like? I have my own private pool so you won't have to come here so early in the morning."
>private lessons sure sound nice
>but when you looked up the price, there was no chance in hell you could afford them
"I appreciate it miss, but I don't think I can."
>the otter sighs and sinks in the water a little
>but she bounds back up quickly
>"You can call me Mae! Just think about my offer for a bit, okay?"
>you stand up on the steps
"Alright. I'm Anon. I'll think about it."
>you turn to start climbing out of the pool, but with the slight sound of splashing, you feel Mae's tail wrap around your ankle
>"Hang on! I just had one last exercise I wanted to try. To get you used to moving in deeper water. It will only take a few minutes and you'll be completely safe."
>you tug a bit, but find her tail's grip on your ankle quite strong
>what's the hurt in a few more minutes?
>you step with your other foot back into the water and Mae releases you to swim further out
>she continues to dance through the water, weaving circles around you as you march toward the middle of the pool where the floor drops out and the water rises
>you make it to where the water is at chest level
>but you can't go any further
>already your body sways with the slight motion of the water, and you're afraid of losing your footing
>Mae bursts out of the water in front of you, splashing you with a torrent of her usual giggles
>"Okay! Just turn around for me, okay?"
>you do as she says, turning slowly until you're facing away from her and the deep end of the pool
>suddenly something hits your legs and sweeps them out from under you
>you tilt back, arms flailing
"Whoa fuck--"
>instead of sinking under the water like you expect, you feel the softness of your instructor's body at your back
>her arms go under yours and wrap around your chest
>her legs catch your lower body
>and you both start to drift into the deep end
>"Just hold still for me, Anon. Trust me."
>her breath tickles your ear as she drifts further and further
>you don't have much of a choice as she's brought you quite literally out of your depth
>"You humans. So silly, so cute. You all want to try so many things you're just no good at!"
>more of that giggling
>it feels a bit more sinister now that she has you completely at her mercy
>"You wanted to learn how to swim! That's adorable! You wish you could swim like an otter, don't you?"
>you try to focus on your breathing, keeping your body rigid so it floats on top of Mae's
>"It's okay, Anon. I'm in control of everything now. I won't let my little otter sink when I'm having so much fun teasing him!"
>her paws trace over your chest, tickling and teasing you
>she even pinches on of your nipples, forcing a squeak out of you
>"Oh but you have no fur to keep you warm in the water like an otter. You can use mine."
>you want to question her, but you get your answer when Mae's arms leave your body
>you flail and kick your legs, trying to stay afloat as your ballast suddenly leaves you
>when that giggling voice returns, it comes with the sensation of fur against your back
>"Isn't that so much better?"
>you feel her breasts pressing into you as her limbs go around you and she squeezes you again
>"Feel my fur? Don't you like it?"
>her paws start to tease you once again, and she slowly returns you to the center of the deep end
"It's--It's nice! Please don't let me go again."
>"Yes it is very nice. Don't worry, I've got you Anon."
>that wasn't a promise not to let you go again
>coming to these lessons was an awful idea
>her paws continue to explore, working their way downward to the waistband of your swim trunks
>"Do you still want those private lessons, Anon? I think I could find a way to convince you..."
>Mae starts to undo the knotted string at your waistband
"Mae wait, wait!"
>you start to struggle again, and she stops her assault for a moment
>"Oh? You want me to let go of you then? That's very brave of you! I think I might just leave you to do some swimming on your own."
>her threat makes you want to thrash around more
>but you force yourself to remain still
>so she doesn't leave you again
"No. No I'll do private lessons. Please Mae, I can't swim."
>that giggle rings in your ear, now clearly sinister and dominant
>"Good boy. You'll come home with me to finish our lessons. And if you do well, I'll reward my favorite little otter."
>one of Mae's paw slide down your trunks to fondle your cock
>the chill of the water keeps you flaccid, but she clearly enjoys making you squirm more than any pleasure you might feel
>"So soft. So weak. My sweet little otter needs me to take care of him. You do need me, don't you?"
>how else can you respond
>you know the consequences if you disappoint the otter

>you whine, instead of finishing you off, she simply strokes you at a teasing slow pace
"Come on Mae..."
>she giggles again, though with less force and malice
>"Oh I'm sorry Anon, but we really are out of time. Maybe if you're my good little otter, and come to my private lessons, we can finish where we left off~"

Ok I know you’re trolling but a story about an anthro clan war over humans sounds pretty good

>Rabbit hordes that all speak in cockney bri'ish acents
>Holy knight Dogs with laughably spokesperson tones
>Assassin foxes that speak engrish and weeaboos
>The one wandering secretary bird monk
>dozens of species waging war over the remaining few humans
>And anon just wanders the countryside trying (and failing) to avoid the conflict
Basically Casshern Sins, but with anon.

>Rabbits could kidnap him for the den
>Fox assassin would likely be pump and dump
>And the holy dogs could probably set up a gilded cage scenario
I particularly like the idea of Dogs, known for being domesticated by humans, simultaneously putting anon on a pedestal and never letting him leave that pedestal. A group of mindless langomorphic idiots that all work to kidnap anon before devolving into petty bickering among themselves over who gets the first go sounds like a fun read. Also I don't know about you but the idea of assassings shouting death threats in bad English will never not get a chuckle from me. Especially if they also can't understand the God Dogs' overly verbose manner of speaking.

>You know...because you needed to prove those nerds wrong. Definitely that and NOT because you were horny as hell.
>The instructions were a lot simpler than you thought, and in less than a half hour and one trip to the crafts store later you had a pretty nice summoning circle.
>You felt a bit silly kneeling before it and chanting. And you're sure your neighbors were going to complain.
>But you already put nine whole dollars down. You weren't going to stop now.
>When the smoke began to actually fill the circle, you nearly tripped over your own tongue. When a shapely hand formed in the haze, only to pull the rest of itself through the floor and into your bedroom, you definitely did stutter.
>That pause was all the hand needed, apparently, to reach through the circle and grasp your throat.
>A spectral hand lifted you up, before hurling you to your bed with enough force to send the headboard into the wall and knock the wind from you.
>As the world stopped spinning, you took in what was happening in front of you
>The smoke that filled the circle was now collecting into a decidedly feminine shape, before connecting to the hand that hand tossed you before.
>It approached, and even though you couldn't see its face, you knew it was looking at you.

>Judging you for some unknown trait.

>Your name is Anon and you're a southerner that's spent the last four years in the north getting a college degree
>After such, you've decided to move back to your parents' farm to work off some of your crippling debt
>When you arrive, you're greeted by familiar faces and places from your childhood
>However, one face is new...but not really. She seems so familiar but you can't for the life of you remember where you met an eight-foot she-wolf before
>She's wearing daisy dukes, a flannel shirt, and not much else besides a shit-eating grin
>And yet, you can't place who she is until she traps you under her arm and gives you the most aggressive hair-ruffling of your lifetime
>Ah. You remember this loving headlock now! It's none other than your childhood frenemy Nancy. Equal parts your partner in crime and source of at least two scars and several bruises over the years.
>You're released from your merciless noogie to the chorus of cackles from your cocky canine conspirator
>But, as you look up her absolute size, something seems much different
>When you ask her about how fucking huge she is, she says simply "I'm a wolf, you dweeb."
>Oh.
>The rest of your day is spent with Nancy, catching up and finding out about life after highschool
>You tell her about your BS and your plans on working as a professional pill pusher, and she tells you about her years as a farmhand
>Though she shows more than tells, flexing and showing off as she walks you through her daily tasks
>Suddenly an axe is shoved into your hand and she tells you to go chop some wood for her while she goes to get the two of you some refreshments
>You're used to her shoving her chores onto you, so you figure it's less effort to argue than to have a reason to bug her about free soda for a year
>But...man. You were NOT cut out for this, it seems
>A few logs in and your arms are heavy
>You can just barely hear the rustling over your own panting
>Wait..rustling?
>This is also a familiar game, and you kick yourself for not realizing her scheme earlier
>You, all alone in the forest, and a mischievous do -wolf in an unknown location
>You drop the axe and listen, trying to figure what direction she's coming from
>Left? Right? Is she right behind you again about to suplex you?
>Turns out your answers were all wrong: the attack came from above
>You look up just in time to see hundreds of pounds of fur and muscle barrelling down own you with a maniac smile
>The impact sends the two of you rolling, and you get a second to watch as one of your shoes is knocked loose and sent flying along with you
>The two of you roll, wrestling until you finally pin her down
>Only for her to roll the both you you around and reverse the pin
>And...you're stuck. There's basically no way she's getting off until you call uncle
>Which you're about to do right until you notice two things
>First, is that she doesn't have a single drink on her!
>Second is that she also doesn't have a single scrap of clothes on her!!
>While you try to figure which one is worse, your mouth works for you
>You tell her that she's naked
>She nods
>You ask her if she's gonna do the thing
>She nods again, smile growing wider
>Memories flash back to where your wrestling always inevitably went: dry humping in the woods
>But something tells you she's not all too dry
>You can all but feel it soaking through your jeans
>"Hey...anon." Nancy asks, still grinding herself against you, "I wanna try something new."
>The grinding intensifies, until your groin is just as hot and soaked as hers is
>You aren't sure when your hands started to unbuckle your jeans, but she's already one step ahead of you
>You learned something about those claws that was both terrifying and exciting: denim didn't mean shit
>Your jeans are replaced by tatters and tossed past the trees
>Your shirt's buttons go flying as it's torn open
>"Been waiting years for this. Was gonna hunt you down in the city!"
>Your boxers go next, but not before they're brought up to her snoot and aggressively sniffed
>She gets a fullbody shudder from that, juicing herself even more
>"When you left, I was devastated you know?"
>A rough paw starts stroking your half-hard shaft
>"My favorite chew toy just up and left to become a doctor."
>You're rigid in seconds, and she returns to grinding against your length
>"Years I was alone here. Nobody wanted to play with the 'big bad wolf' without Anon to protect them."
>Your ankles were hoisted up, and your entire lower half is brought up with it
>She sits on your lap like that, careful not to rest her full weight on you
>Her arousal is running down your chest in a steady stream
>"But now you're back! Back where you belong!"
>She takes your manhood in her hand, guiding it up to touch against her heat
>She's practically on fire!
>"Now I ain't gonna let you get away again!"
>She lifts her hips, before guiding then back down with your shaft embedded in her
>She gives another shudder, and you can feel her already wringing you for your seed
>You want to ask if she really just came, but you're too distracted by the hot wet embrace swallowing up your most precious tool
>The two of you linger there for a second, basking in the feeling of each other, before her hips start to move
>"Gonna give me a pup, anon!"
>And gets more intense
>"Gonna make me a mom tonight, anon!"
>Her voice is almost feral, and she's practically slobbering as she gets lost in her own fantasies and the sensations you're inflicting on her
>"You'll make..."
>Another shuddering release as she wills her eyes to meet yours again
>The look is both filled with absolute love, and terrifyingly lusty
>All capped off with a predatory grin
>"Such a perfect father!"
>And she starts back again, with double the effort
>Your brain is frazzled. The position, her intensity, and adrenaline combine into a mind-frying mixture that has you say one thing again and again
>Yes.
>Hell yes!
>You weren't sure where you planned to go, but you were sure you had to take her with you
>Your heart and head had made that choice before your mind could catch up
>You gripped the grass beneath you as your body surrendered finally to her frantic assault
>You howled
>She actually howled
>And the two of you raced each other to the peak
>This time, her legs did give out
>And the two of you collapsed into a tangled mess of limbs, flesh and fur
>Finally your mind caught up to the last few minutes
>To the blissed-out wolf who probably just fucked herself pregnant on you
>Part of you is hoping she was joking
>Part of you is hoping she wasn't
>The idea of her carrying your child gives your member new life and Nancy is quick to respond
>"More."
>She climbs back on top of you, guiding your back to where you rightfully belong
>"I need more anon..."
>Her hips start to move again and your higher thinking cuts off
>...
>The rest of the afternoon is a bit of a blur, but a month later your suspicions were confirmed by a remarkably ecstatic Nancy kicking your door in at 2am
>After the two of you made love again, the following morning you let your parents know
>They were wondering if you were still going to work
>It was at that point, a month after knocking up your childhood friend, that you finally learned that "working as a farmhand" was more "gaining ownership of the whole estate"
>The idea of Nancy as anything other than a meathead unnerves you to this day
>But you still want to work.
>Because you'd hate to disappoint your soon-to-be wife
>And also because she's right: you're going to be a perfect father

>Visit dog gf
>As soon as you walk through the door she runs and plants her front paws into you, pressing you against the wall.
>Begins nuzzling and licking you.
>You start scratching her belly in defense, she crumples to the ground on her back to let you keep going.
>Later as you're chilling on the couch together you notice she's staring at you intensely.
>You raise your right hand with palm open, and she immediately bites at it.
>You dodge it, she bites at it again and again.
>She only likes to play rough with you.
>You keep sliding your hand side to side dodging her bites at it.
>Eventually she catches your hand in her mouth a few times, she's growling the whole time but when she catches it she chomps gently, nibbles on it a little.
>If you ever wince or let out a sound like it hurt she immediately lets go and starts licking your hand and starts apologizing and comforting you.
>You dont mind the slight pain. You like it when she gets riled up.

>Your girlfriend was complaining about her gums being sore while crushing you into the corner of the couch with her weight.
>You, trying to be the good boyfriend, wanted to try massaging them given heard online about it.
>It took 20 minutes for you to worm your way out of the couch.
>Even then it was because she let you out during a commercial about some kind of medication.
>She had fun watching your futile struggles and that's what mattered.
>Her head bore a grin as it tilted slightly while you straddled her lap.
>Starting by placing your hands on her shoulders, you slithered them upwards through her fur to the end of each side of her muzzle.
>In turn, she planted her clawed paw on your back.
>You'd done something like this before, but you kissed her instead.
>Sliding your thumbs through her lips and to her gums tore a slight rumble of surprised pain from her.
>She instinctively jerked away from you, but the couch prevented her from going anywhere.
>However, the couch didn't stop her claws from digging into your back.
>That rumble quickly passed as you began massaging her with your thumbs and petting her muzzle with your other four fingers.
>She makes happy and relieved noises as you work on her gums.
>After a few minutes, you pull your hands from her jaws and lift one to the top of her head to pet her, taking special care to not smear your drool covered thumb against her.
>Your other hand goes to rest on her side, after you'd wiped it clean of course.
>The petting gets her tail to thwap against the uninhabited half of the couch.
>Unfortunately, the thuds bring her back to her senses and she pulls you away.
"What'd I say about petting?" she asks with a mock stern tone, "You're the only who gets petted here."
>She spins you around on her lap and lays a paw on your head to rub.
You are both silent for a moment before she says, "Thanks, it doesn't hurt as much, but you should warn me in the future though. I don't want to bite you, by accident at least."

>Before you stood a demon in all of her terrible glory, slender body straddling the remains of your summoning altar while her amber eyes pierced through the veil of perpetual shadow that cloaked her.
>Eventually you ran out of floor, and your back met the wall behind you.
>She cleared the distance in two strides of her hooved legs, and bent down to take your throat in her grip.
>She lifted you like you were made of paper, and threw you to the bed like a pillow.
>While you recovered from the room spinning, you found yourself pressed further into the bed and harder into the headboard by her weight settling atop you.
>Before you could even plan an escape, she was already there.
>"What was your name again? Anon, right?"
>She waited for your answer, which you gave with a dumb nod. Her clawed fingers caressed your chin and brought your gaze up to meet hers.
>"Tell me anon: are do you like pain?"
>You try to shake your head, but find it held fast in her grip.
>You tried again, much to her amusement, but your face was fixed to the spot.
>With dread creeping up your back, you tried to nod. The movement came freely and fluidly.
>Oh no...
>"Oh GOOD! I was hoping you were just my type. A foolish man who summons someone they can't quite handle, but..."
>A single finger of her free hand traced down your chest, and the shirt that covered it came free from where her claws cut it.
>Following such, a stinging line of red bloomed along your chest from where she scratched you.
>"You're a big guy, right? I'm sure you can...learn to like it."
>You really wanted to deny her, but your mouth stayed shut. Whether through fear or something else, you lacked the will to defy her.
>She took your silence as a prompt to continue.
>"Oh don't worry, dear Anon. I won't do anything too severe this time. Training works by increments, and while I'd like to simply throw you into the deep end..."
>She eyed the pentacle behind her, and you understood her intentions more clearly than you wished to.
>"I'll simply settle for giving you a taste of what our Pact entails. So..."
>Three more lines appeared on your chest, each one bringing a new sensation of pain with them.
>Akin to a cut with salt rubbed into it, they stung and made themselves known.
>However, true to her word, it wasn't the worst feeling. It hurt, but if this was the worst, you'd survive.
>As if sensing your thoughts, she leered at you. "See, Anon? I'd never lie to you. Just a little for now. And with this pain..."
>She leaned down, bringing more tongue than you expected that caprine muzzle to contain flowed out.
>Nearly a foot, if not more, oozed out before setting near the cuts' ending points.
>Then slowly, so very slowly and with such a deliberate attention that it threatened to become vulgar, she ran that devilish length up each one.
>Blood you didn't know you bled was cleaned up, as your captor made your chest as clean as she could.
>Each run up the cuts brought a new stinging sensation, but this time something new was added.
>"...pleasure is given."
>She ran a claw down your arms, drawing fresh lines of red that you recoiled from. These were deeper, and your lifesblood flowed freely from the throbbing marks.
>"More pain..."
>That tongue ran across each gash, practically tasting you as the tapered tip dove into the space created.
>Again, you winced from it. Wanted to pull away from the sensation she forced on you.
>And, again, it was soon replaced by a feeling of warmth and relief. As if a balm was poured onto the worst of the fire blooming in your flesh.
>"...brings more pleasure."
>"Do you understand, Anon?"
>Her hand left your jaw, giving your much-needed freedom.
>Giving you the choice to answer as you really wanted.
>You though about it: you were in pain, but she seemed to wick away the worst of it soon after she inflicted it.
>And, much to your surprise, the feeling wasn't all that bad.
>You'd even...possibly consider it pleasant.
>You watched her carefully, looking to your demon as she watched you in kind.
>Her cruel smile was still there, but you could tell she was waiting.
>You felt like this was an absolutely bad idea.
>Slowly, against your better judgement, you nodded.
>If her eyes were shining before, they were practically flames as the stared into yours.
>"Oh, Anon. Such a brave man!"
>She was practically giddy, taking your head in both hands.
>"Then, Anon my dear summoner, let us make this official!"
>Goat-like lips sealed around yours as that mercurial tongue explored your mouth.
>Then, pain bloomed as something pierced your tongue.
>You yelped, feeling a hint of true agony for the first time as your mouth filled with blood.
>Her claws dug into you as they held you still.
>You tried to pull away, but to no avail.
>But, as that devilish appendage roamed around your innards, the pain ebbed away.
>A pleasure bordering on the carnal replaced it, and you found yourself moaning into her embrace.
>Your head felt...fuzzy, as new feelings were placed inside.
>New thoughts flooded your head.
>And something hard was attached to your tongue.
>"Now, my partner. Let this onyx ring seal our pact. And when you awake, you'll know how to summon me again~"
>She pulled away, a line of drool connecting you two.
>And then darkness took you.
>You awoke in your bed, drenched in a cold sweat.
>The pentacle, the demon, and the scars were gone.
>but something remained.
>Your tongue was pierced with a simple silver ring, and a single thought filled your head.
>"See you tonight, Summoner~"

Yeah, he's hot and everything, but he was my best friend and now I dunno what the fuck to think or feel. I do want him, but what I really want is for things to just go back to the way they were.
> "Yeah well, guess what? That ain't happening, so you might as well try and make something of it. He owes you for fucking with your head, and you like him. I'm not saying you gotta pin him down and rape him or anything, but get a date out of it or something at least. Don't worry, you can be totally fucking lame on it if you wanna be."
I don't want him to know any of this. He specifically kept it quiet because he didn't want thirsty anthros finding out. It's fucked up enough that I feel it without him finding out.
> "Yeah, I thought you might say that. It's why I just copied and pasted the last ten minutes of this convo in a DM to him. Figured you could use the kick in the ass"

> Due to their secretive nature, not much is known about the tactics or beliefs of these cults, but what we do know is that their system of belief is based off of the belief that a human’s place is by the side of an anthro
> And that Anthros were put on this world ‘to guide humans to a brighter future
> Because all the victims were all human men, and similar cults having a record of kidnapping and assault, these claims may or may not hold water
> While all we can do right now is wait for evidence to be found, human citizens would do well to familiarize themselves on ways to avoid a cultnapping

> Now then……
> Most of these abductions aren’t done in broad daylight, rather by luring unsuspecting humans to an isolated location
> Pack anthros tend to work in groups usually by having one of them lure the human while the others cut off means of escape
> Even if they don't adhere to pack rules each cult usually has an area they control that they use to prowl for humans
> Usually a business that one of their members own is used to stream in a steady supply of humans for their members
> Some common ways to spot businesses controlled by the cults are unexplained discounts given to human patrons and employees asking human customers for “help in the back”
> Another way these cults acquire their prowling grounds is by establishing gated communities with suspiciously low housing costs for human residents and creating “wellness” programs for troubled humans
> Now that I’ve established how they operate lets go over what to do when being targeted by these groups
> Avoid mentioning any dangerous professions, while they hate doing things in broad daylight the more protective of their rank will feel desperate to “save” you if she feels you’re in danger
> Try acting like you have an anthro partner, if you are convincing enough they will immediately leave you alone. DO NOT MENTION ANY HUMAN LOVE INTERESTS THEY WILL TAKE YOU ON THE SPOT

what's the tourism policy of the anthrostate?

Humans of both genders are allowed. But in practical terms, only human women can travel there without an anthro partner.
If a male went there, he's practically guaranteed to be kidnapped. Even if he was with his wife, if she happened to be human.
They respect the property of other anthros, but are less respectful of the bonds between humans.
After all, a core tenant of the anthrostate is that human men belong with anthro women.

> While humans were allowed in the military, it was mostly things like air recon or things that made sure of their safety
> This was the first time the humans would see active combat
> Of course, both anthro soldiers and civilians protested against the creation of the 16th Division
> Anthro Soldiers claimed that humans were smaller, slower and somewhat weaker
> Their generals said that most of the humans in the 16th would face things like harassment or possible sexual assault
> Civilians meanwhile simply didn’t want to see Their loved and cared humans injured or living in the conditions the soldier often lived in
> The military responded with how they were going to make sure living conditions were improved, as well as assuring that any form of harassment would be punished
> Soon the Infantry Division was created, and soon, sent to battle
> After the battle, only 3 humans were killed, and 59 were injured in some way or another, but it was tiny compared to estimated losses
> Soon, many began to see humans as a possible Morale booster
> If your coddled Human can pick up a rifle and fight, why can’t you?

> because of their animalistic nature most Anthros tend to be more attuned to the body language of others.

> Due to Anthro and human integration over the past few years most Anthros are aware of the physical differences they have to consider when interacting with humans
> Because of this Anthros tend to fuss over humans more.
> more so if they have an established relationship, romantic or platonic.

Why exactly ? What kind of reactions anthros have to humans on down, bad or upseted mood ?
How risk is to get close to one while in a doomer headspace ?

Refer to paragraph 43 of volume 21
> Depending on the species of the affected anthro, they can have a myriad of reactions
> Anthros of canine or feline origin may attempt to pull you into an embrace and you could get a face full of fluff
> If they are of reptilian origin they may attempt to share body heat with you
> most reactions tend to involve close physical contact
> but it is not unheard of for Anthros to attempt to drag humans to another location for “other” activities
> while everyone loves a good hug, getting forcefully embraced by something twice as large as you can make some uncomfortable or be seen as embarrassing.
> not to mention these “reactions” can last from a few minutes to hours, thoroughly interrupting one’s day.
> the longer ones tend to end in a soft kidnapping as they also have day to day business
> yes an Anthro’s empathy can be a strong thing.
> which is why it must always keep it in mind when integrating into their society.

Anon’s guide to Anthros Volume #22: Dating etiquette
> Anthro culture is a tad different from human culture, it is complex with multiple sub groups under each species
> So if you want to build enough rapport to date an Anthro romantically you must keep a few things in mind
> Traditionally in anthro culture the woman will pursue out the man, some may prefer the man be more direct, but dropping hints instead is a much safer bet as some Anthros may see this as cocky and want to “put you in your place”(refer to volume 13)
> recognize the signs of being courted.
> Different Anthros will have different courting methods
> foxes and wolves attempt to cuddle potential mates and give gentle “love bites” as a precursor to marking with an actual bite and to scent them
> Avian Anthros tend to dance for their potential mate. Along with giving them gifts of shiny objects or food, accepting such gifts will lead to more serious stages of courting where the avian will attempt to preen their mate(essentially trying to brush them).
> Gators tend to try to get their mate into a pool of water and circle them while making rumbling noises. Some like to use their teeth but most avoid doing so because of their jaw strength
> while i cant list the entirety of Anthro courtship because of its diversity, i can say that some universal signs of courtship are prolonged physical contact, abrupt gifts or grooming, and scent marking.
> Now you know everything i can teach you about courtship, but slow down there Casanova
> when you’re actually dating an Anthro there's another set of rules you have to learn
> Every species treats their mates differently, some are similar to traditional monogamy, while others(rabbits,rats,mustelids) will likely expect you to be shared(with your partner’s consent of course).
> Anthros like foxes or wolves tend to lean towards monogamy and can get extremely territorial over their mate and get agitated when their mate is alone with other anthros
> Foxes and wolves also tend to mark their mates via sex ,cuddling, or biting.(have some bandages on standby for that last one)
> this is done to alert other anthros of your status as theirs
> on very rare occasions Anthros will fight each other over a potential mate, if this happens it is recommended to attempt to break it up from a safe distance or vacate the area(adrenaline fueled sex can be less than gentle)
> Anthros of prey species tend to be more docile but their passive aggressiveness and guilt tripping is not to be trifled with
>lastly, some general tips on anthro relationships
> do not try to wash yourself immediately after scent marking, while you won't be able to get the scent out, you will hurt her feelings.
> Avoid unnecessary physical contact with other anthros, the scent might lead your wife to jump to conclusions
> If she wants to mark you with a bite, make sure she knows where to do it, so that she won't tear your jugular.
> Read up on their heat cycles, some can get particularly aggressive during spring so you should prepare accordingly
>with all that said, stay safe and have fun,

>/adhg/ version of a game
Animal Crossing. Being trapped in a village full of mean anthro girls sounds pretty great. Either that or Stein's Gate because that sounds like the best sort of fun. Just change all instances of CERN with the the Anthrostate or something

A few ideas on how I’d like a game like that to play
> instead of being the mayor you’re just a normal resident
> Isabelle acts as mayor and Tom nook got r63’d
> all your favorite personalities like mommy, false sense of security, and bully
> loan terms are a thing now so better get paying before you get whored out
> complain about anything to Isabelle and she’ll give you a few nice words but not much else
> invest in reinforced doors before spring comes(spring essentially turns it into a survival horror)
> get close to some villagers to protect you from others
> don’t get too close though, lead them on and you’ll suffer the consequences
> cultivate a nice life out in the countryside while keeping your pelvis intact

> While befriending villagers during the other three seasons can help you cultivate your fortune and home
> it can bite you in the ass during spring
> Villagers with high relationship values will seek you out with greater ferocity
> don’t think you’re safe with the “sane” ones either
> hormones are a helluva drug
> they’ll lure you in with the promise safety, fuck you into oblivion, and feel bad about it later

Spring in villageville
> all villagers other than the mayor and shopkeep become hostile
> there are multiple types of anthros pursuing you, familiarize yourself
> Brutes: bears, elephants, and the like. They can crash through any obstructions with ease and can easily pin you with one hand. AVOID
> Stalkers: felines, foxes, etc. will watch from cover and wait to down you in one strike. If you hear heavy breathing, run to the nearest open area
>Bait: rats, deer, anyone you are close to. Usually cares about you somewhat, may offer aid but they could snap at any moment. Approach with caution

> upgrade your house to max
> have a large stockpile of food and water
> there’s no way any of them can get you
> they start working together
> goodbye pelvis

waifur whit hight relationship comes and try convincing you to let her in to spend heat with you

> Anon is cowering in a corner waiting for night to end
> he hears a knock at the door
> “Anon? Its me, I have some supplies for you”
> Finally a familiar voice, and one that isn’t soliciting him
> Anon grasps the lock but freezes once he comes to a realization
> She’s also in heat, but he needs the supplies
> can he trust her, or is she going to pounce him at the first opportunity

I think it should have an option for anon to "surrender" to the heat and try to brace himself through the waifurs, the only way of surviving on this rout would be preparing you health and physical condition, even so would only be able to endure one girl a day

Surrendering and getting captured
> spring is a time of opportunity and danger
> since anthros are usually not home you can snoop around their houses and learn their likes/dislikes/secrets
> with the trade off being the threat of pelvis break
> let’s say you want to surrender or fail to stop them.
> after the initial antics you will be taken back to a “nest” where they’ll attempt to keep you until they regain their senses on the first day of summer
> if you are captured you must find a way to escape their clutches without your items and with the bruised pelvis debuff
> if you manage to escape then you can pick up your items at the spot you were first taken
> if you are caught you will either be roughly fucked(worsening your bruised pelvis) or forcefully cuddled (wasting the entire day)

an open world porn game of some sort maybe a mix of like pokemon arceus and kenshi or botw

>safe in walled off towns/cities, but some beast women can sneak in or there's special events
>wandering outside in the wild for supplies or material to make a living
>all sorts of animal women roaming around in different biomes like wolves in forests, otters near rivers, seals in ocean, etc
>night time is proper dark in dragon's dogma making it really important to get to safety before that happens
>don't want being caught to be a game over, but a different play style where you're with the anthro(s) that caught you
>living out in the wild with them where some stuff is easier and other harder
stupidly ambitious, but if since we're pipe dream style stuff why not go all out

>you want to be viciously screwed by waifur
>she's severely worried about not wanting to hurt you/take advantage of you
>shenanigans of you putting yourself in vulnerable positions trying to get raped by her
>doing all you can to show how much you want and are willing for it go down

>she was sitting at the counter's end, eyes obscured by only the passing senses of the bar.
>yet despite this, they were always fixated.
>fixated on you.
>threatening an invitation, a predatory smolder just out of sight.
>yours met hers first once, then twice.
>and by the third time, her mark was made.
>and your life was hers, forever taken. forever smitten.

I think my favorite part of /adhg/ scenarios is the idea of being pursed/hunted by an anthro turned savage fuck beast from your scent and the chase
>running from her
>she can smell you're turned on and want to be caught
>basically your scent reeking like a bitch in heat asking to be fucked by her
>hearing you pant from the excitement and thought of what she'll do when she catches you
>going to places where she can really go feral in chasing after you
>needing to be carried back once she's down since you can barely walk
>being covered in her saliva and bite marks

>hyper autistic wolf gf
>obsessed with you
>terminator level durability which is good due to her autistic ways getting her in stupid stupid situations that also tend to drag you into it too
>may kill from going too hard in sex, but the not sticking with her raises the chance of being grabbed by worse groups

Yeens seem like they would be natural doms. It's in their DNA to find a man to dominate.

>all their friendly play and interaction involves a lot of light biting and mouthing
Poor little humies gonna get "bullied" and accidentally flirt at big yeen girls. Imagine how many high school human nerd boys end up snatched up by jock yeen girls. That or you think you're being mugged by a yeen only for your submissive behavior basically consenting to her and now you're dating.

>Be poor anon, a freshman in high school with few friends and even fewer prospects
>As if life couldn't get any worse a big hyena girl started stealing your lunch money almost every day
>She would always corner you in some deserted hallway then lean in real close with that toothy smile of hers and gloat about how she'll beat you to a bloody pulp if you don't give her what she wants
>It's not like you could do much against the 200 pounds of fur and muscle other than try to avoid eye contact and not piss yourself as she towered over you
>So with self preservation kicking in you always give her the money and she fucks off
>But not today!
>Today you're going to stand up to her!
>You stand confidently in one of the more common spots she ambushes you in
>Sure enough she struts up to you a few minutes later, that familiar confident grin plastered on her mug
>She stops real close and rests her arm on the wall above you
>"So pipsqueak, got my payment for today? I could really go for some gatorade out of the vending machine, gym class kicked my butt. Almost as hard as I'm going to kick yours is you don't cough it up."
>You look her right in the eye, puff up your chest, point a stern finger at her, and state your rebuttal
>"No. Fuck off."
>Her eyes go wide and head recoils back

Well, there's this game called Sequel and maybe there are some elements of that game's story you can take inspiration from. So basically from memory
>A very long time ago natural sources of mana start running out.
>This is extremely dangerous as mana is pretty much that setting's version of oil.
>Now one source of pure mana is human semen.
>Due to this event it steadily goes from a minor source of mana, to the only reliable source.
>This initially leads to human men being highly valued.
>However eventually people start noticing that the number of men being born declines every generation, especially human men.
>As a result, while men are still highly valued, over time they become valued more as a resource than as a demographic.
>Typically nations with a high human population start treating human men as strictly controlled 2nd class citizens.
>While nations with low human populations go a step further and start treating them as slaves or even cattle, with a few nations erecting "Mana Ranches" where human men are gathered up and systematically "milked".
>This of course also leads to conflict between nations, conflicts that further cut into mana stores
>In a rare bit of good news, they develop methods of artificially growing people to combat the dropping population.
>Unfortunately attempting to grow males using their process usually fails, once again this is especially true for humans, and on top of that these methods still need a small amount of mana.
>Thngs continue to spiral out until eventually, the world settles into a somewhat stable state.
>But that this point we went from what was a magitech science-fantasy setting when mana was plentiful to a clssical fantasy setting and a bit of post-post-apocalypse.

Medieval fantasy idea
> Anon is grievously injured, it’s the dead of night and he’s desperately trying to get to a temple or apothecary
> after hours of running, a temple to an unfamiliar god on the outskirts of town is in sight.
> Anon is too weak from blood loss to climb the stairs and collapses at the foot of the temple
> In anons sleep he starts to dream about being held by an angelic figure, draped in light and white as snow fur
> the figure starts musing about whether or not she should keep you, but ultimately decides it’s not your time
> Anon isn’t really paying attention and is simply burying himself into her fur
> Anon awakens to a very concerned nun trying to get his attention.
> Anon is confused until he sees the pool of dried blood he left on the temple stairs
> He goes to check himself but finds that he has not a single cut nor bruise
> Anon, not being the ungrateful type, decides to give an offering and a heartfelt prayer to whatever saved him last night
> little does he know this would seal his fate
> it starts out innocent enough, he would find more bountiful patches while foraging, always feels well rested no matter how long he sleeps, and he hasn’t had even a cough since he was blessed.
> but things take a turn when he starts getting approached by clerics and knights asking for the story of his blessing
> he keeps getting offered positions in the temple and many anthros try to persuade him to stay there
> Last week Anon passed by a temple to a different god and stayed the night.
> now he can’t go 10ft out of towns without some knight or cleric running into him, claiming that something compelled them to walk in your direction.

> because nothing says success like paying 500$ for a 20$ drink.
> the pay was great, the hours were fair(hell they even provided dental)
> but the one thing he didn’t like about the job was the customers
> even though Anon had a degree in mixology(yes it’s a real degree shut up) that’s not why they hired him.
> The place was in an area with a high anthro population, so to cash in on that, the owners needed to hire a human

> every hour of every fucking shift is filled with the same old lonely widows, narcissistic billionaires, and vulgar mobsters.
> every shift filled with the same gross remarks, solicitations, and outright harassment
> He despised them all, but the pay and benefits were too good to lose
> So as he clicks in at 10am sharp he takes a deep breath and puts on the best painted smile he can manage
> he was having a normal shift, when a familiar face walked in
> this woman named Sandra, Bear woman, twice your age, childless but had the body of a prime Milf, probably a gangster.
> she started showing up a few months ago, said she lived in Alaska, said she owned a business there, never specified what sort of business so he can only assume it’s illicit.
> she babbles on about the usual stuff: general life stuff, trouble finding a mate, thinly veiled innuendos.
> Anon simply did his usual schtick of playing along and laughing along when she got handsy
> He genuinely liked talking to her(when she wasn’t trying to get in his pants) but he still held his quiet distain for these Rich pricks
> Eventually she asks to see his boss like she does every time she visits
> Anon simply points to the door to the staff area “second door on your right past the pantry”
> She thanks Anon and disappears down the corridor.
> Not 10 minutes later Anon runs out of limes while serving some mustelids with a thing for margaritas, he politely excuses himself to grab some more from the pantry.
> as soon as he’s past the door to the staff area he lets his painted smile fall into a disdainful look of irritation, he’s tired and just wants to get through his shift
> Anon gets to the massive pantry and starts rummaging for the limes, 3 minutes in he starts talking to himself because that’s definitely what a mentally healthy adult does
> “gotta find the stupid fucking limes, for those stupid fucking stoats, so I can get back to my stupid fucking job”
> “cause god knows I’m excited to get back to dealing with Rich assholes all night”
> “Can’t wait to have to act like I relate to someone with 5 private jets and a mansion”
> “BOY do I love dealing with people who never had to work a day in their lives”
> right as his bitching was reaching its crescendo Anon finally procured his limes
> Anon turns to go back to his post when he freezes
> Standing in the doorway is none other than the 7”9 BILF herself
> Anon scrambles to put his customer service smile back on, but is too nervous to be convincing.
> Anon stands there with his clearly forced smile being stared down by a BILF with a frigidly neutral look on her face
> Anon fumbles over his own words trying to figure out how to defuse this timebomb of a situation.
> “Oh……h-hey Sandra….how long have you been standing there?”
> Sandra doesn’t say a word. She slowly and deliberately starts making her way towards him
> “S-Sandra wait! I didn’t mean it! I wasn’t talking about you”
> she’s not listening
> All Anon can do is slowly back up trying to get away from her
> eventually he hits the smooth concrete wall
> cornered, afraid all Anon can do is watch in horror as she grows ever closer
> she stands not 2 inches away from him when he regains a sliver of courage to try to speak again
> “S-Sandra…….I”
> Anon doesn’t get another word in before Sandra slams her fists into the walls on either side of him.
> whatever courage Anon had left in him melted away and reduced him to silent compliance.
> Sandra leans in close and starts whispering
> “rich prick huh….? Never worked a day in my life have I?”
> “let me tell you something Boy, I worked hard and gave my blood sweat and tears to get where I am now, and I’m not gonna let some bartender spit in the face of all my hard work”
> She starts tracing Anon’s face with one of her claws, not hard enough to draw blood, but hard enough to remind him of their edge
> “Normally I’d just break your legs and call it a day, but I like you Anon, which is why I’ve thought of a different way to punish you”
> she starts to unbutton her shirt to reveal her massive bear tiddies.
> “Now we can do this the easy way, or the hard way Anon. If you’re good enough maybe I’ll be gentle”
> Anon’s heart is racing, he’s about to get molested by a giant bear woman
> The dining area isn’t too far from the party, if he was quick he could make it back into the open where he was safe
> Anon takes a deep breath, looks Sandra dead in the eyes, and ducks under her arm towards the pantry door.
> unfortunately Bartending doesn’t exactly train your agility
> Sandra grabs Anon with one arm and slams him into the wall, lifting him to her eye level
> “I was hoping you’d try some stupid shit like that, momma likes things rough”
> in one fluid motion she slices off Anon’s clothes
> Sitting bare, Anon can only stare down the hungry maw of his assailant
> with no further ado Sandra digs her claws into his sides and starts slamming herself into the wall and Anon
> Lost in a storm of pleasure and pain: Anon can only endure, as Sandra haphazardly slams her voluptuous form into him.
> Anon is so overtaken by the sensation he didn’t even notice he was on the ground being rode cowgirl style
> as they both reach their climax Anon can only scream as her motions become more sloppy and feral.
> when the slamming ceased Anon could only sit there in a puddle of their combined fluids and wait for his mind to come back to him
> at some point Sandra pulled him into her embrace, being delicate with his tender form
> Anon wouldn’t think to fight back as he’s too blissed out of his mind to react.
> so there two laid, enjoying the afterglow and each other’s embrace
> Slamfucking tends to make a good bit of noise so shortly after they ceased the owner, a small rabbit woman.
> “WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HE- oh shit”
> the rabbit looks wide eyed as she sees who she’s yelling at.
> “I’ll come back later” she says meekly before trying to scurry off
> “HEY” the rabbit stops in her tracks to look at the bear currently spooning you
> “I’m taking this one”
> the rabbit looks as if she wants to argue, but simply gives a frightened nod and scurries away.
> “Don’t think I’ve forgot about you mister” she says to your barely conscious form
> “this was a good start, but I don’t think you’ve learned your lesson yet, we’re going back to my place”
> Anon is in no condition to argue so he simply lies there without any resistance
> Sandra wraps her overcoat around Anon and carries him bridal style
> She carries him out the backdoor, into the alley and into her car
> As Anon is drifting off he is content to lie next to Sandra as her chauffeur drives them to her mansion and his new home

>the female anthro guards keep raising their tails when you're looking their way giving you an eyeful
>teasing and tempting you
>hiding rumors from other humans is easy enough
>but anthro's sense of smell make it really hard to hide the "fun" you like to indulge in some of your anthro staff

imagine going to nerd cons as humie guy
>getting hit on by anthro girls
>having creep shots taken of you
>maybe cosplaying which gets more sweaty anthro girl's attention
>also attention from the anthros cosplaying stuff from the series you are too
>egging them on into molesting you or flustering them

Imagine
>You are Anon. Less than twelve hours ago you were practically kidnapped by your cougar friend
>She, and by extension you, were going to "HumaCon 20XX"
>She already got your ticket, and packed your bag while you were at work
>The last thing you recalled before getting shoved into the back of a van with two other anthros were the words "...a bit revealing, but you'll look great!"
>You spent most of the ride being eye-fucked by the platypus sitting next to you
>You wouldn't know it by the way her mouth (bill?) flapped in a lispy rant about some human-centric cartoon from the anthroverse
>She keeps mentioning some group cosplay, one you've been wrangled into, so you ask her what it was
>It's some perverted harem anime with a human MC in a school full of anthro girls with magical powers
>You watched an episode on her laptop; by the end you could identify each of the seven girls by what panties they wore with how often they were flashed
>Also your head's been shoved against her frankly terrifyingly large chest the entire time
>Her bill lowers to the side of your head not muffled by boob to whisper "I've got the same pair on right now"
>Oh god...
>You try to telepathically call your friend for help, but she can't hear you over the J-Pop
>You call God, but he can't find you in the abyss
>Now, three hours later, you FINALLY make it to the hotel room
>There's only two beds
>You look to your companions: your cougar friend, your platypus molester, and a beanpole of a weasel who was passed out the entire trip and was all but carried into the room
>You then shoot a glare at the cougar, knowing what she did
>She tells you that "it was cheaper this way"
>You tell her she makes more than enough to afford extra-
>"It's CHEAPER this way!" she says with more teeth showing
>...point taken.
>You claim the shower before the others can mess it up with fur
>This proved to be a mistake, as the beds were already claimed
>No surprise, you're shacking up with the platypus...
>Once again you call G-man for some help and once again your prayers are left unanswered
>At least the beds are made for big anthros, so there's plenty of space
>You opt for a couch...but there is none
>You take an awkward sit on the opposite side of the bed, only to be dragged platypus-ward to watch another episode
>This show, you realize, is borderline pornography
>How the MC isn't walking around with an erection with how often his face is shoved into someone's crotch is amazing
>Especially with the nosebleeds. So many nosebleeds...
>The humaboo next to you seems to have forgotten that she's got you in a gentle headlock as she gets lost in the show
>Mel, your cougar friend, continues to ignore you as she claims the shower next
>She tells your captor to put some pants on
>You suddenly realize she's not wearing pants
>just a pair of panties that seem to just barely be hanging on around those massive hips
>You stare into Elysium for longer than you want to admit
>The rest of the episode is a blur, but it seems there's some kind of transformation sequence
>Oh FUCK no, you aren't going to wear that
>A loincloth barbarian is modest by comparison
>Just as you're getting ready to object and find a ride across the country, the bathroom door opens and a cleaner cougar emerges
>She tells...Cheryl, apparently, to let you go and wash her ass
>She complies, and you're released into the space her ass used to be
>So much of it, hidden by that tail, waddles into the bathroom
>You're free
>You hear moaning
>You hear Cheryl moaning!
>The weasel is snickering
>Mel is banging on the door, saying to keep it down
>"Cheryl" yelps, but no more moaning can be heard
>Just a steady thudding against the part of the wall where the shower is...
>An hour later she emerges from a wall of steam
>Her eyes lock onto yours and you barely get to register the white shirt clinging to her body as she re-captures you
>You, at least, TRIED to dodge
>Your blood wasn't in your legs at the moment
>Still chuckling at your situation, the weasel takes her cue to take her shower
>Apparently her name is Alyx?
>She looks to you and mouths "good luck, homie" before the door closes
>God damn it, she did that thing with her hand below her waist!
>Cheryl's nipples are diamond hard
>If you thought she was into the anime before, then she's absolutely LOCKED on now
>You can all but see the fog of her breath as the action ramps up
>Turns out the MC's outfit gets destroyed in some way during most fights
>He's bare-chested and blushy as the BDSM-flavored villainess monologues
>Strangely enough the fights are pretty good
>By the time the scene ends in a cross-counter, you don't even NEED to be headlocked
>You're about to ask how many episodes this is, when the weasel emerges
>Alyx is in a nightgown that, thanks to her long and lanky form, looks like a windsock with arm-holes
>She gives a faint "'night' before tipping over into the bed
>She's out in seconds. You envy her on some level
>Mel suggests everyone gets some lights out so that they can hit up the merch hall tomorrow ASAP
>Ah...you realize
>THAT'S why she went cheap on the room
>Before you can object, the lights are out and you're freed from your latest lock to stumble into your side of the bed
>You're wary about having your back to the platypus but you decide to risk it
>If you had to stare at all of that you might do something stupid
>...
>You wake up from a strange dream
>Something about being tied up in the panty-quest anime's dungeon
>You're in protag-kun's outfit, on a wall
>You're ranting about the power of friendship
>But suddenly a whip lashes out, pulling you from your slumb-what the FUCK?
>Your head is wedged between Mel's massive mammaries
>Her bill rests on your head
>At some point she yanked you back over to her side of the bed, where she proceeded to spoon you
>Her breathing is a gentle snore
>However, massive platytits aren't your main focus at the moment...
>It's whatever is currently latched onto your groin and currently sucking like its only source of nutrients are in there
>You groan, turning to muffle your voice into a pillow a second before remembering that Mel's tits are currently your pillow
>Oh god she smells good...
>That didn't exactly help your situation as new life is given to your junk thanks to your unintentional olfactory induction
>A pleased sound comes from beyond the sheets, and you recognize that sleepy groan from before
>"Alyx?!" you shout-whisper
>The sucking stops
>There's a rustling under the sheets
>A white-furred head pokes out to look you in the eye
>"Kept ya waitin' huh?"
>You stage-whisper, asking what the hell is she doing here. She was asleep before everyone else and-
>"Exactly. I slept the longest and I was bored. I was going to steal Cheryl's laptop but noticed that she had a new cuddle buddy. And also that YOU..."
>She said, jerking you off while smirking, "Were enjoying the company. Have a nice dream, Anon? Think about anything warm and wet?"
>Tiny weasel claws played over your groin
>"Cheryl was really looking forward to this year's HC, you know."
>Her paw moved a little faster, and her grin got a little sharper
>"She really likes that show you two were watching, you know..."
>Her attention to your tip gets a little tighter, and she leans in a little closer
>"It'd mean a lot to her if you went through with that cosplay...you know?"
>You aren't sure what to think, or whether you CAN think
>Not enough blood in essential parts to form sentences
>Not enough sleep to think straight
>"I'm just saying. If you need some more convincing, I have some ideas...I'll be dressing up as Lady Lash, and Cheryl will be dressed as the female lead Noko. You two will get a lot of time together..."
>She leaned over, and you had to stifle a yelp as she nipped at your ear
>"But....I wouldn't be much of a bad guy if I didn't do something shady, right? Make a deal with the hero like...ah. Spoilers~"
>She chuckled, before scrabbling back under the sheets
>If you thought she was serious before, you were mistaken
>That mouth went to work in making a new argument towards wearing that battle bikini
>One that involved lots of tongue, and the deceptively shallow muzzle of hers
>Another pause and the sheets lifted enough so that you could catch the faint gleam of her eyes
>"This goes without mention, but since you don't really have a choice anyways, you might as well enjoy it. Cheryl will definitely thank you in her own way later."
>You try and fail to stifle a groan as Alyx went back to work on her bargaining
>Every once in a while, she'd bring her teeth into the mix
>Never enough to actually do damage, but definitely enough to be felt
>Either she's a sadist or you're a masochist
>Maybe both
>Either way she gained an understanding of your weak spots at an alarming rate
>Moving from a slow lick on the underside, to nursing at the tip just long enough to pull a fresh bead of pre
>to letting you scrub the back of her mouth as her lips lavished attention to your base
>All the while, her own pleased little hums were their own stimulation
>You only met this woman half a day ago and she knows your most intimate parts
>You were getting close
>You tried to babble something to Alyx, but she seemed to get the memo
>Speeding up and swirling that demonic oral appendage around you until..
>Nothing
>She stopped dead in her tracks
>Your breath caught in your throat as you were dragged down right before your peak
>You wanted to scream, but you would alert everyone to what was going on
>The covers lifted, revealing Alyx nuzzling the side of your dick
>Her grin was shit-eating at the bare-minimum
>"So, Anon. I can expect you to show up in costume tomorrow, right?"
>You ask God for divine vengeance, and when none comes you instead strike a deal with the devil
>You nod
>She doesn't lower the cover, nor break eye-contact as she facefucks herself on your cock
>You were deflating before, out of shock and what you thought was a ruined orgasm
>Instead you realize exactly the depth to her cunning as you're brought back to your peak again
>And this time, you're slowed, but aren't hindered
>She takes your length again, swallowing at the tip while the tongue massaged the underside
>You unloaded, grabbing the weasel's head like she wasn't back to being superglued to your groin
>You turned and groaned into platytit as she coaxed everything out of you
>Every twitch met with an appreciative buzz of her own humming
>Until, finally, you were able to take a breath in that wasn't ragged or reeking of breastsweat and fur and finally come down
>You looked down to your partner in crime
>Aside from a tongue licking a few stray strands from her muzzle, she looked like she hadn't tried to drain your soul out of your groin
>Without much ceremony, she slid up and pecked you on the forehead
>She definitely kissed your own cum back onto your forehead there
>"A'ight, bro. I'll see you tomorrow morning with a couple of red-bulls and your bikini armor."
>She approached the laptop, and smacked Cheryl on the arse
>The yelp wasn't from someone who had been woken up, but from someone who was surprised
>"And next time, don't just sit back and watch, you weirdo. If he weren't distracted, he'd definitely have heard you schlicking behind him."
>Wha-
>Cheryl's sheepish voice whispered from above you, notably breathy "T-thanks, Anon."
>An absolutely soaked hand curled over your torso and shoved themselves into your mouth
>And question on what was going on is shattered immediately
>Your member is back from the dead and looking for round two
>However her moment of fingering your face is over as soon as it starts
>"Let's get some sleep. Mel will be upset if we slow her down..."
>...
>There's basically no way you're getting any sleep this night
>SOMEONE owes you an energy drink when six-o-clock rolls around
>"What the hell?"
>Mel looks over the three of you, in various states of sleeplessness, as 7am rolls around
>Two hours. You got two hours of sleep last night.
>Cheryl fell asleep after molesting your face, and Alyx was already overslept before her "negotiations"...
>You were so revved up on platypussy that you couldn't think of anything else
>Eventually you blinked and it was daylight so you had to have sleep, right?
>Cheryl spoke up first.
>"Sorry. I had a stomach ache and couldn't get to sleep right away..."
>"I was doing ninja shit in the halls." Alyx provides
>You ask what is sleep, anyways.
>Mel faceplams, before grabbing her badge and tossing yours to you
>She even had your screenname added to it...
>"Anyways, let's go. If we're lucky we can still make the opening rush if we jog there
>You look from Mel's athletic body, to Cheryl's girth and Alyx's lack of horizontal mass
>Mel seems to have the same idea
>"I'll drive, but you're all paying for parking!"
>The drive there wasn't supposed to be long, but traffic made it longer
>This time Cheryl sat in the front seat and the backseat was shared by you and Alyx
>You didn't notice how much she had to hunch over in Mel's car
>"So," the weasel said to nobody in particular, "Anything you guys are looking forward to?"
>Cheryl chimed in, saying how she wanted a new shirt and something called a "daki"
>When you shot a confused glance in the rear-view window, Mel explained "Hug pillow with an anime character on it."
>"You know...like you?" Alyx chided
>Your face burned with the reminder of last night
>Mel shot a raised brow at you, but said nothing more of it, "I'm looking for the rare stuff. Comics, games, and such, that someone doesn't realize they have. Also...there's a doujin I want."
>Alyx added "I'm just here for cosplays and photos. But If I can find something cool I'll spend my meager funds on it."
>You suppose, if you had to, you wanted something functional. Like a shirt or hoodie...
>"Don't worry about spending your own cash, Anon. I basically disappeared you, so if you see something you like that's not TOO expensive, let me know." Mel says as the traffic slows again
>Huh, that's was actually kind of considerate of her considering you had to basically beg your boss to let you use a few sick days to even come here.
>Suddenly missing a shift is no laughing matter, even if your roommate handles most of the bills anyways
>Cheryl looked over her shoulder, flashing something on her phone
>Too small to read, but it looked like a schedule
>"I have some events I think you'd enjoy. I can show you around!"
>"Yeah of course Anon would like to go. But we've got that photoshoot first..." Alyx said
>The weasel and the platypus exchanged a conspiratorial glance and a smile in your direction
>You weren't sure what they had planned, but it probably had to do with the duffel bags the two of them crammed in the back of the car when they thought you weren't looking
>It DEFINITELY involved some sort of rapid texting between the two shortly after
>...maybe you could still take a bathroom bre-
>"We're here! Finally!" Mel whooped, pulling several illegal maneuvers that left your head spinning and her van neatly parked in a structure
>After strongarming the three of you for a third of the parking fee each, the four of you marched towards the convention proper
>Well...you, Alyx, and Cheryl marched. Mel transitioned from a power-walk to a full-on sprint when she noticed the time
>"Gottagetmoving,I'llcontactyouwhenI'moutofthemerchhall!Bye!"
>And before you could process what she said, she vaulted over the edge of a fence and disappeared from sight
>Leaving you alone with the others
>"So..." Alyx began with a head-tilt that made your neck hurt to look at, "Got any plans? Anything you might've promised within the last twenty four hours?"
>You were kind of hoping she had forgotten that
>You tell her you can't think of anything in particular...
>Wrong answer
>"Oh good!" she said, clearly hearing exactly what she wanted, "because Cheryl and I were thinking of taking some cosplay photos. You know...of that show you two were watching yesterday."
>Cheryl hefted both duffel bags on her shoulders for emphasis. "We brought your costume, too..."
>Alyx flashed a camera that looked more expensive than everything you owned combined, and a grin to match "And It'd be a shame to waste this premium device, right?"
>Cheryl nodded, agreeing a bit too eagerly. You noticed that she was starting to poke through her shirt again..
>A white arm settled on your shoulder as the weasel leaned down to look you eye to eye
>A large toothy grin settled into place as she asked, "Anon, you want to help us, right? It wouldn't be a very good shoot with just the two of us, you know..."
>Cheryl leaned in from the other side, making you feel very claustrophobic all of a sudden. Her hot and heavy breaths ACTUALLY visible in the cool morning air. "I'd really like for you to join us, too..."
>You were thinking of a way to politely excuse yourself on reasoning of "my dick was speaking for me", when they both hooked their arms around yours
>You found yourself being lifted, feet dangling uselessly beneath you
>The nodded to each other and began to march back towards the parking structure
>"Trust me, Anon: you are absolutely not going to regret it."
>Memories of prettyboys in bikini armor under the heels of leather-clad femme fatales and cotton-covered crotches came to mind
>You weren't sure whether you were or not, just that you were past the point of no return before you knew it
>The pair of them escorted you to an empty corner near the top of the structure
>Alyx was fine but poor Cheryl was reduced to a gasping mess by the time the three of you reached your point
>You barely had time to get back onto your feet before she set the duffel bags down immediate after and started to practically tear her shirt and shorts off
>Alyx followed suit, unzipping her tracksuit lazily in comparison to cheryl's self-imposed clothing exodus
>Meanwhile you stood there, dumbfounded as the pair of them stripped
>The stairs weren't even a meter away from them and they were already down to their underwear!
>Your jeans WERE getting kind of uncomfortable...
>Cheryl collapsed against a fence, fanning herself off and desperately trying to cool down
>That tail of hers trying to help, but really just succeeded in smacking the ground a few times
>You could faintly see steam rising off of her
>Alyx was busy folding her clothes into a pile before shoving the pile into a backpack haphazardly
>She turned to the fuller of the two duffel bags, extracting many bits of leather and a handful of props
>Looking over her shoulder, she smirked and wiggled her hips a bit
>You didn't realize you were staring, since you had made an effort NOT to stare at the hot and sweaty platypus massive rack
>Which was just behind you, radiating heat and a familiar sweaty scent that did nothing to diminish the growing tightness in your jeans
>"You haven't seen THIS outfit yet, but it's the one you'll probably see the most fanart of." she paused, before the weasel added, "And also the most smut."
>You manage to get enough blood pumping back to your brain to ask what this photoshoot was meant to be, anyways
>Seeming cool enough to think straight again, Cheryl answered with a scene you weren't familiar with. She asked if you were okay with spoilers
>You said you would probably forget them by the time you got to that point
>Alyx sniggered "If you forget this, I'll be insulted..."
>Ignoring her, Cheryl continued to explain that the scene involved the hero's defeat at the hand of Lash
>A scene where she tempts the hero into trying to join her
>And, to your surprise, he accepts and ends up becoming the main threat for the next season
>You actually regret hearing that, now. But Alyx's comments made more sense
>A bundle hit your face
>Unraveling it from itself, you see...very little
>Black and silky, and kind of stretch, the cloth looked intentionally tattered in several spots
>It wasn't until you saw the burnt-looking bow-tie that you realized this was a battle-damaged version of MC-kun's outfit
>You look back to Alyx to voice your thoughts, but she's already slipping the last bits of her costume on
>A tight-fitting leather getup that looked like the unholy fusion of a rose garden, a gothic lolita's dress, and a dominatrix getup covered most of Alyx's body
>And yet left absolutely nothing to the imagination as it hugged her curves and bloomed out in other places
>You DEFINITELY don't remember that outfit
>"It's Lash's 'Springtime Goddess' form. It's basically when she goes berserk and starts trying to capture the hero to use as seedbed for her dark army. Cool stuff. Tons of art made from it and lots of...'what if' comics made. Cheryl's probably got a few stashed away under her pillow or something."
>You look back to the platypus in question, who's fastening an armored skirt and corset on.
>Like your outfit, hers is missing chunks in places and looks scratched up as if she were in a fight
>More importantly, her already formidable chest was given a significant power-up
>God might not have answered your pleas, but he sent a blessing in seeing those so close
>You weren't sure how long you were staring but when you came to again, they were staring back
>"Well?"
>"You're gonna get changed, too, right?"
>What do they...oh. Oh yeah...
>You still have to put on that bath towel pretending to be an outfit
>You slink off to the stairwell to have some semblance of privacy, before Alyx moves to stop you
>That she can move at all, much less so well, in that outfit caught you off guard
>"No way, bro! You got a show, so now we get one too!"
>They played you like a fiddle
>You tried to negotiate, but Cheryl displayed some surprisingly quiet moves
>She managed to get behind you and yank your shirt up
>In your blind panic, you felt your pants being pulled down at the same time, exposing a lot of you to the air
>Your shoes and socks went next, being slipped off along with your pants and tossed somewhere behind you
>Your shirt finally came off, just in time to see Alyx eyeing your raging semi
>She looks to you
>You look to her
>She kisses your dick before maneuvering your legs into the leg-holes of the battle-kini
>You are about to say something when another bundle of cloth is pressed down over your head
>Your arms are forced through some sleeves, and then your head is forced through another one and the light of day greets you again
>You look down to see Cheryl's bust in your face as he fastens something to the bits Alyx pulled up your waist
>Several metallic-sounding clicks and a very worryingly heavy click later and they back off
>You eye yourself
>More skin than you'd like is being exposed no matter how you hold yourself. Both legs are fine, even if your groin appears to be partially torn open
>Also the material is so tight on your legs it's like you're exposed everywhere else as well
>Your chest is fully exposed, sans spandex, save for a pair of star-shaped pasties covering your nipples
>You aren't even sure when those got there, but...
>This outfit...
>YOU LOOK LIKE A DAMN STRIPPER!
>"What? And we don't?" Alyx asks, posing alongside Cheryl
>The former was a masochist's wet dream, while the latter looked like someone who liked dark fantasy and high-school drama put both into a blender and mixed vigorously then added an equal amount of cleavage on top of it
>You...Jesus Christ there wasn't a safe spot to look
>EVERYTHING was sexual
>You felt a familiar stiffness returning to your kind-of leggings, but without the blessing of denim your arousal was clear and obvious
>Alyx looked down to it
>You looked to Alyx
>Cheryl looked at it, then to you
>"You've got..."
>"Yeah we can't exactly go out with him like this... Cheryl, go ahead and take care of this!"
>For once, you and the platypus were on the same page and looked to Alyx in disbelief
>"What?" she asked, "Look at me, I can barely move in this thing!"
>That's bullshit, and she knows it!
>"After all, you're in a skirt. It'd be easy for you to just pull it up a bit and let him have a go."
>Wait a second
>"Might even be more realistic, right?"
>She's seriously not about to
>"The protag and Noko really hit off during the show, so it's just roleplaying..."
>What is this feeling of dread?
>"After all a humie like you must be creaming herself at the sight anyways, right?"
>You look to Cheryl
>You expected a meek embarrassed look
>Instead you saw the deranged smile of an addict finally getting a hit
>Her breath was even heavier than when she hauled you up here
>Her beak was curled up in as much of a smile as it could be and her shoulders were trembling
>Her voice, despite that, was frighteningly calm when she said "Hold him still."
>You're so fucked
>"You got it, boss~!" cooed the dom-dressed weasel as she moved with WAY more grace than she implied earier
>She slipped behind you like a trained assassin, looking her arms under your and hoisting you up off the ground
>Your feet dangled as you tried to form an excuse
>But you weren't thinking clearly and neither was Cheryl...you think
>The way she confidently circled around you, it was like a switch was flipped!
>Right until she hooked a finger around a clasp you weren't aware of
>Your groin was exposed in seconds, hard and eager for whatever was coming up next
>You silently curse at your traitorous brother, but...you weren't exactly objecting
>Until that beak burrowed under your ballsack and took several uncomfortably long sniffs
>Each one ended in a shuddering gasp
>You could practically hear her juicing herself over you
>"Cheryl..." Alyx said somewhere above you, "Mind hurrying this up? Even Mel will notice something is up if we're gone for too long."
>Cheryl sighed "Yeah..."
>She stood up and turned around
>Once again you found yourself staring into Elysium
>A vast expanse of ass, covered in a thin layer of cloth and cotton that did absolutely nothing to diminish the sheer size of it, approached your groin
>And the absolute dominance of it made all the more clear as she bent over
>"Alyx" Cheryl asked, "If you don't mind..."
>A chuckle, followed by a leather-covered hand gripping your member
>A dollop of spit falling from in front of your face to land on top
>That quick, but targeted handjob that had you achingly stiff in seconds
>Feeling that same hand hold your member level with the dripping heat in front of it
>You felt Alyx's hips press forward, pressing yours in turn and shoving you into the platypus in one slow thrust
>Your hands braces against that massive tail, groaning into it as you were pressed from both sides
>leather behind, and lace in front
>All you could see was the darkness of that tail, forcing your to focus on your other senses
>Your hands moved to that ass, gripping as much as you could as it pulled forward
>Only to sink back down onto you harder than before
>You moaned, mouth working on its own as Cheryl wound up to a steady pace
>Alyx helped from behind, making sure to push your hips forward with her own so that you met Cheryl's pace
>All you could do, as these two force-fucked you as a team, was to hang on to dear life
>While you were trying to keep quiet, Cheryl did no such thing
>Her moans echoed into the distance along with the sounds of flesh meeting fur
>You could only hope nobody knew
>You were practically a dildo for the platypus's pleasure and weasel's amusement
>And, as your found your own hips trying to move to meet hers faster, you were fine with that
>Some part of you even dared to revel in the sensation
>At some point Alyx's grip moved to one arm looping around your torso while the other busied itself down below
>You could feel it bumping against your ass as she tended to herself
>"Hey rudderbutt..." Alyx gasped during her own self-inflicted pleasure, "This is hot and all but the first event is in fifteen...."
>Cheryl looked back, and the unfocused, lust-glazed look regained a bit of sharpness
>And her hips slammed back into yours even harder
>"Come on, Hero." Alyx groaned, nipping at your shoulders, "Don't you want to make your childhood friend happy?"
>Her hips moved to fuck you harder into Cheryl
>The hand that had been busy flicking her bean came up to finger-fuck your mouth
>"Maybe you want to fall? To truly give into the darkness and taste true power? I can give you that, as well..."
>You were forced to grab onto the mass of tail again as it started to slam into you
>"Stop holding back. Just give in and let your desires rule you."
>She leaned in, and Cheryl looked back to you
>By some unspoken signal, they both commanded "Come, Hero!"
>The situation was too much, and you couldn't control your voice any longer. You pulled her back, to press your loins together as hard as you could
>You swore you could see stars as you pumped yourself deep inside
>You would have collapsed onto her if you weren't being held up at the moment, but your hips made their own weak attempts to get even deeper into her
>Which Alyx helped, pushing you to the point where you felt the impressions of buckles against your back
>The three of you stayed like that, catching your breath and coming down from your highs
>You...definitely needed to...
>You passed out
>Your dream was short and sweet, thrusting your sword into the heart of a dragon and rescuing a princess
>But suddenly the princess was the dragon
>A clawed hand found your throat
>A long tongue CLAIMED your throat
>"...the dubs were redone to match the intention of the original mangaka..."
>You awoke in a chair in the middle of a large room
>Cheryl sat on one side of you
>While Alyx sat on the other
>In front of you, behind a podium and in front of a screen, someone discussed a show you've never seen
>You wonder where the hell are you
>"Oh good. You're finally awake."
>The weasel sniggered as she passed you a booklet
>"This is a panel about the way dubs are handled in shows. Cool shit, actually. Cheryl's got some taste in technical dealings."
>You meant what happened afte-
>"We got cleaned up," Cheryl interrupts, a blush under her fur, "And then made our way here."
>"We also took some pictures along the way. If you see me standing over your KO'd body dabbing, then that's why."
>You ask if she's joking
>She flashes you a gang-sign
>You ask her if your dick was at least put away
>"Of course! We can't let randos see the goods, right?"
>Somehow that doesn't assure you
>You asked about your clothes
>"We packed them in the duffel bag. Mel packed them back with her goods on her way back to the car..." Cheryl whispered
>Then that means...
>"Yup! Sorry, buddy, but you're going to be a combat stripper all day!"
>....she planned this, didn't she?
>Her silence speaks volumes.

Anon is an astronaut and is stuck with 7 anthros in a tin can for half a year. all there heats sync you and anon must raise moral

Even funnier if he isn't remotely qualified for being an astronaut.

What behaviors and actions that would be considered innocuous/normal by humans but would trigger anthros's "must protect/cuddle" instinct hard?

>Anon skips a few meals in the morning
>Cat anthro, usually lazy and docile, thinks he doesn't know how to fend for himself
>Anon is woken up at the crack of dawn by a very strict version of his roommate
>She drags him out of bed, forces him to get himself ready, and shows him how to shop
>Also won't let him do anything until she's sure he's eating properly
>Will physically restrain him and forcefeed him until she thinks he'll be fine
>Anon, being a borderline neet, is never fine
>"The forcefeeding will continue until morale improves!"

Shaving, seeing a soft fleshy human run a sharp metal blade over their throat would probably freak out most anthros. Species like sheep instead would probably get turned on or bitch you're doing it wrong and want to take the razor from you to do it properly.

that would be pretty funny

>she just has to lick, nuzzle and kiss you at that point, especially since you got her all worried
>she does this every time

> being lonely or alone for long periods of time around pack animals
> Anthros like wolves, dogs, deer, lions, etc all get very anxious without their pack
> so when they are forced to move away from their original pack they tend to make new ones with Anthros suffering from the same issue
> So to them a human who lives alone or likes to keep to themselves is seen as someone silently suffering

> if you live alone or are seen as a loner Anthros like them will try to invite you into their pack

I like to think the pair would eventually drag anon away and double-team him as soon as they get him into an even vaguely private space

Honestly I’d read 50 chapters of just “Anon tries to live his life, but horny anthros….”.
I think that kind of slice of life stuff would be fun

>Go to your office job.
>Still sad about something that happened last night.
>You try to hide it as best as you can.
>Not long after you arrive at your desk there's already a knock at your door.
>A large wolfess opens it before you can answer.

"Don't to lie to me little man, you need someone right now"
>She lowers herself to pull you into a hug.
>Pulling your head into her smooth fur.
>Instead of ending the hug she lifts you up and carries you to her desk.
>Denying the empathy and care of a wolf can lead to them feeling distress themselves.
>Which would lower their productivity tremendously.
>For this reason your office has provided specialized desks that house two computers.
>It comes with a pull out table that allows you to use a keyboard and mouse while sitting on the lap of her.
>She sits down with you ontop of her and pulls it out far enough for you to reach and adjust it into a comfortable position yourself.
>A large paw gently ruffles through your hair while the other holds you close as both of your computers boot up.

I kinda hate that this general is filled with grug tier thinking like this.
First of all height =/= strength
Second of all there are many ways to be dominated
>she controls you with your own arousal, she's so good at teasing you that you're absolutely wrapped around her fingers (my favourite)
>she has some kind of mind control powers/behaviour trained into you

>being one of the few human workers has you sweating for a different reason

>The heady scent of roses fill the air and her large brown eyes stare past heavy lids
>A knowing smile greets her face as she approaches you
>Her size, position, and demeanor are all various levels of intimidating
>But the biggest threat she can make isn't to raise her voice

I imagine humanity would have a very isolationist and xenophobic view of the galaxy seeing as how every other alien race is basically a rape monster that's trying to kidnap them.

Humans still have to work and deal with them due all their prior tech and knowledge plus they'd be the ones who built most of the out there space stations/ports. And they would be fine to be around, but just have a very different view on dating/marriage/getting a hubby. Some species' methods would be more subtle like pheromones slowly wearing you down until you come to them. There would also be willing guys, but human women would very much not like aliens.

>She spoke with a tone that sounded both duty-bound and absolutely tired
>Which is why you had hoped she'd let you go when you explained that you were trying to die, and somehow even fucked THAT up

>"Boy, did you just admit to trying to take your own life?"
>You nodded
>"And you truly think your life is so worthless as to throw it away?"

>It touched the floor, before looping back up to the nun's clenched fist
>You were unceremoniously dropped, hitting the ground without too much pain
>"If you feel your life to be worthless..."
>She gripped the chain harder, and a golden glow traveled from her fist along it to your neck
>Where, you felt a heavy collar resting

Not a writer but i had a very good fap this morning so i decided to write down what i fapped to, basically.
>"I've been thinking about something fun we could try" she'd said
>She'd just made you cum, and you were too love drunk to ask too many questions
>"I think you'll like it more than you think"
>In this state, that was enough to get you to agree
>The elegant wolfess couldn't help but grin slyly as she explained her terms
>"This week, I want to be in charge"
>"And promise you won't jerk off, it'll ruin it"
>The next 3 days didn't go quite how you expected
>whenever you were home, she'd flirt with you
>she'd flick her tail at you, or pinch your bum when she walked past
>She was being very touchy in general
>She was even wearing her stockings around the house, and seemed to enjoy stretching her legs out across your lap whenever you sat on the lounge together.
>But whenever you hopped in bed she didn't want to ride you like you expected
>Instead she'd pull out a book and ask you to read with her
>It had only been 3 days but you were already losing it
>You basically wasted your entire day at work daydreaming about wolf pussy
>And you couldn't help but eyefuck every woman you came across on the way home
>You walked in the door to find her waiting for you
>She was wearing a see through nightie with with a lacey garter belt and stockings underneath
>The two of you savored a kiss, before going back in for another
>Your hand began wandering down to her butt
>But she grabbed your wrist before you could give it a squeeze
>"Ah ah ah"
>You looked at her in surprise
"Did I do something wrong?"
>She took you by the hand and began leading you to the lounge
>"No, you've been good so far"
>Her cryptic behaviour was starting to annoy you
>But she was very deliberately swaying her hips as she walked
>And you were you mesmerized by how perfectly her garters framed her butt
>"It'd be very good of you to give me a massage"
>she stretched out on the cushions and looked back at you with an expectant smile that you couldn't resist
"Fine"
>She slipped her nighty down her arms as you kneeled down beside her and began to work her shoulders
>"Mmm, that feels good"
>You honestly had no idea if you were good at giving massages, but she always made you feel like you were, and you couldn't help but feel proud of it
>honestly, rubbing your fingers through her coat like this was almost its own reward
>She had insisted on you buying her some very expensive beauty products for her birthday this year
>You had been against it at the time
>But you relented, and self evidently, it was worth every cent
>Her voice snapped you back to reality
>"Can you do my legs next?"
>She didn't even look around to say it, she'd pulled out a book and was reading it while you worked
>As she rolled over her nightgown hung loose from her body, fully revealing her tummy and the generously curvy thighs that lead down to the graceful, swooping shapes of her legs and her perfectly manicured paws
"God you're beautiful"
>She looked up from her book and just smiled at you, adoration evident in her eyes.
>She giggled mischievously before going back to her book.
>"She's lucky she's pretty" you thought to yourself
>You didn't waste much time before getting to work on her calves
>You slowly kneaded your way up each calf, one then the other
>They had a decent amount of fat on them, but not much, she wasn't a gym nut, but she was still a wolfess
>You could feel her muscles softening and relaxing under your hands as you worked
>You were surprised at how gratifying it felt
>It felt good knowing you were making this beautiful creature feel good
>Slowly you moved up to her thighs, the layer of fat was more evident here, and you could feel her fur here had a bit of extra fluff to it
>You found yourself running your hands over them more for your pleasure than for hers
>You were rock hard, and so pent up that you could help but let out a huff of arousal
>"Kiss them" she said, quite abruptly, and she worked herself up on her elbows to watch you
>You kissed them, you could help but let out a breathy, satisfied grunt before you continued planting kisses all over them
>You loved the smell of her coat, it smelt beautiful and flowery and earthy, it smelled like her.
>It did feel like a small release of pressure, but your cock was practically dripping with pre cum, you wanted more, you felt almost frantic
"Baby, we need to fuck right now"
>"Oh I don't think you've earned it yet"
"Honey, that's not fair"
>"You agreed I'd be in charge didn't you?"
"And you get off on torturing me?"
>"I just like seeing how much you want me"
>She showed her teeth in a grin "and I know you like it when I tell you what to do"
>She slowly stood up, you knelt there as she stepped towards you
>She drew you in closer, firmly taking hold of the top of your hair as she pushed her thighs into your face
>She towered over you, and she had a presence that she didn't quite have before
>It made you feel a mix of complete adoration and complete vulnerability, like a priest standing before his god
>"Kiss" she said
>And despite yourself, you did, without even thinking
>And it felt good
>"Good boy"
>You felt a little fat give way under each kiss, which only spurred you further into your frenzy, only stopping to lick or to take in the wonderful scent of her fur instead
>"I was right wasn't I? My mum always told me that no human ever gets tangled up with an anthro unless he wants to be tamed"
>You were too drunk with arousal to do anything but nod between kisses
>The wolfess let out a satisfied growl and sat back down
>You followed her, cuddling her waist and planting kisses all over her tummy
>She laid back, keeping one hand possessively cradling the back of your neck, the other running its fingers through your hair
>"Such a good boy" she said it as if she was just making an observation
>You crawled your way up her body, tracing kisses over her chest and neck as you went
>Finally you reached her mouth, this time you kissed her and she kissed you back, again and again and again
>As she did so, her hands began roaming your body, rubbing and squeezing everywhere they could
>Eventually, she pulled away, and you dropped back down to deliver more kisses to each of her breasts while she cradled the back of your head
>"You're going to worship me all week, then I'm going to make you cum harder than you've ever cum in your life"
>She reached under one of the pillows and rummaged around before pulling something free
>"I'm going to be waiting at the door every day with this"
"A collar?"
>Normally you might have balked at something like this, but you were too horny to have inhibitions right now
>"You're going to wear it for me"
>She continued as she lifted your chin and began to buckle it around your neck
>"And its going to remind you that you're all mine"
>As soon as she finished tightening it, she used it to pull you into a deep kiss
>Eventually you pulled apart, just slightly, to stare into each other's eyes and share breath
>"You look so handsome wearing that, by the way"

>Be me
>See birb anthro on street
>Asked if she was okay, see her run off
>Be hours later
>Be in bed
>Birb anthro finds my house and sleeps with me
>Woke up with my face in her chest fluff and breasts
>Wondering what happened

would bird anthros make you wear bright clothing and have you do funny dances?

As male bird usually have bright color comparing with females that have usually dull color, most bird anthros would see males not going for bright colored clothes almost like crossdressing or they trying to ba a tranny
Just imagine a birb waifur going nuclear after seeing most blacks/browns/greys/ or other mute/bland colors in your closet, desperate thinking that you are becoming a tranny and she must do something to save you

>Handshakes, a few photos, and the like took place before he noticed her staring at his sweater
>"Anon...that's...QUITE the fashion you've got going on. Very..."
>Her grin was that same ultra-wide sneer he loved from the show
>The kind that showed off those beartrap-like chompers in full

>The white fleece rimming the edges helped against the cool autumn air
>"I never signed your disc, did I?" she mused, reaching into a glove and pulling out a magic marker
>She hooked an arm over your shoulder, pulling you close as she signed your prized possession
>You could feel her fur against your cheek, and the way her chest pressed into your sides
>You noticed her arms stretching just that little bit to make the distance
>And you found yourself getting lost in the moment
>You would never wash this cheek, or your hoodie, again!
>"There you go, Little Lamb, one gen-yoo-ine John Handcock from yours truly!"
>Her fingers drifted across your back for a second before backing off
>"See you soon..."
>You were already being shooed off by security, so you weren't able to ask her exactly what that meant
>But as you went to take a picture of your now-signed disc, you realized exactly what she ment

"I mean, you just seem so smart, why'd you pick a school like that fresh out of high school?"
>you're laying it on thick
>Della eats it up
>"You're going to make me blush. The school was close to home, and I only needed a couple semesters to finish my degree. Plus I wanted to get out there and try to meet new people! Try new things!"

>far more than just a fear boner

>you can only picture what those very sharp teeth might do if you displease this ravenous beast of a woman
>Della's claws dig into your thighs as she switches between bobbing her head on your cock and drenching your entire crotch with massive licks from her tongue

>"Hah...hah...tashtes goog..."
>you whimper, as the tips of her teeth play along your shaft while she speaks around it
>that makes Della cackle, her hot breath washing over your still twitching manhood
>the hyena takes your shaft in one paw and spends a few seconds lapping at the beads of pre-cum she teases from your tip

>"Look at you. Weak, whimpering, a young pup turned into my plaything. You're a slut, I could tell from the moment I saw you. Say it."
>your mouth doesn't seem to be working right now
>but hers still is, and she snaps her jaws

"A slut! I'm a slut Della!"

>Della snarls her victory, adjusting her hips to mount you, her drooling cunt teasing at your cock head

>you nod fervently
>"Yes mistress Della! I'm yours, I'm yours!"

"Please mistress Della! Please fuck me until I can't walk, smash me into the bed until it breaks! I'm a slut for my beautiful hyena owner!"

"I'm...I'm a slut."
>Della cackles
>then kisses you gently
>"You're Della's slut. Don't forget it."
>a little bit of that sweetness you saw when you first met comes through in her gentle treatment
>but it doesn't last long as she wraps her arms and legs around you, rolling over to let you on top
>she still holds you tight
>"Okay, round two bitch! Do a good job and I might let you take another break before we're done."
>using her legs, Della starts forcing you to thrust into her
>but it doesn't take much to get you going on your own
>it's going to be a long night, and you're going to enjoy every second of it
>you don't know how long you and Della went at it
>you just know at the end you passed out still inside Della
>when you wake up, its to the sensation of her paw gently stroking your hair
>she's already dressed and cleaned up
>"Good morning sweetie. I had so much fun last night, and you were looking so cute all tuckered out, but I have to get going to class. Feel free to go back to bed once I'm gone."
>she smiles warmly, and kisses your head
>"Help yourself to anything in the house, I imagine you'll need some water. When I get back I'll make dinner and cookies for dessert!"

>some sort of shrine or church out in a backwoods town

>the land the shrine is on is withered and lifeless as if cursed
>all over the land is seals and statues places around
>none come to visit them
>the father spends most of his time maintaining the shrine
>the son is usually too weak to help with much
>the father goes into town every now and again to get food/supplies
>one day he ends up having an accident and dying
>the sickly boy is left alone to deal with the shrine
>starts hearing whispers and having visions while sleeping
>they lead him to a secret entrance that leads under the shrine
>what he finds down below is a large raccoon beast woman/demon/spirit
>she's sealed and bound in the room
>she explains she was sealed long ago and with her sealing the land withered too
>saying she's a nature spirit/demon
>she also reveals her being sealed is the reason he's so weak and sick all the time
>the seals is draining his life energy to maintain it
>she start to try to coercing him into unsealing her, but all he wants to know if he'll get better if he does
>she assures him his health and the lands will both improve when she's freed
>he doesn't even care if she's lying or not and just wants to stop feeling like this all the time

>can't help but lean into her soft fur and warmth
>has to stop for the day to rest fully, but he can feel a difference with some of the seals undone already
>even leaving open the entrance to her chamber has an affect
>when he comes again she bids him to also remove the seals around the land to aid her and his endeavor

>he jumps at the chance
>she orders him to drink from her while nodding her head towards her rear

>nearly drowning him in its amount
>thick and viscous with a spice and sweetness he can't place
>the raccoon she-beast makes herself very vocal about how well he's doing and her enjoyment
>her juices cover most of his face already
>but when she cums his body gets covered
>between pants she tells him to not wash it off and let it seep into his skin
>that night his dreams are filled with the feeling of fur on skin and many visions of ringed tails
>when he awakes he finds many fruits left on the entrance of the shrine
>also the in dirt he can see the paw prints of feral raccoons
>he can tell the land is improving with how the dirt feels softer and he can spy some small plant life in beginning to grow in places
>he also can feel his health improved too

>after eating some of the fruits he brings some down for the raccoon beast
>she turns down the fruit saying she hungers for something else while eyeing him

Adhg religion
What would that be like?
Ritualistic tribal stuff with an emphasis on nature teaching how humans are meant to be subservient due to our weaker physical attributes?
Cult-like groups that believe long ago humanity was corrupted and must bring them back into the light via pelvis abuse?
Religions in places with few humans portraying humans as divine gifts that must be protected(but not free)?
The possibilities are ENDLESS!
Or you know you could be lazy and swap the gender roles of Christianity

Suddenly a pack of wolf gyarus is asking you weird questions about being a human, they start out innocently enough but start teasing you with invasive sexual questions about human dick and such, then before you know it one of them has hopped up onto your desk and her skirt is so short you can see her thigh and ass... She knows it, too. What are you gonna do?

This is an interesting premise. Her being a tribal or at the very most an iron age villager and him coming from a civilization with interstellar travel, she is a blunt and ignorant primitive, while he is a terrified stowaway trying to get off this alien world, though the only way he can do that is if he survives long enough to find a way to get of this rock, and she is his only means of survival because he's almost out of ammo, plus she's familiar with this world. This could be an interesting beauty... er-handsome and the beast story, with hardcore cavewoman fucking somewhere in it.

>worker at anthro tavern
>spend your nights serving drinks
>the tavern is quite exclusive, and the patrons are entitled to special service from any waitstaff at their leasure, anything short of penetrative sex
>being ordered to your knees and forced to use your tongue on big anthros while they chat with other patrons or just savor their drinks
>at the end of the night, the tavern matron takes you to a back room and fucks you on a table
>just so you remember who you're working for

>Today was Friday, the last day before two days of rest and recuperation.
>as you enter the clinic you worked at, your boss sneaks up behind you and locks the door.
>You turn around to see her holding up a piece of paper in front of your face
MANDATORY PENIS INSPECTION DAY FRIDAY **/**/20**
>She gives you a wolfish grin as she and some nurses corral you into a medical bed
>You are forcefully stripped of your clothes and underwear as your boss and coworkers surround you
>Some choose to simply hang back and look
>Your boss chooses to poke and prod your penis until it becomes erect
*Fade to black*
>The girls giggle and you get a kiss on the cheek and are let go.
>just another Friday

>The guards had left you alone a good 5 minutes ago now, but the sound of gunfire was still getting closer.
>Not like you could do anything about it though.
>You couldn't even try to hide against the wall in your present state.
>your wrists were bound behind your back, and then hoisted up towards the ceiling with a rope and pulley, leaving you awkwardly hunched forwards.
>The exchanges of gunfire seemed to be happening less and less frequently though, and you thought you heard one of your captors voices cry out in the distance.
>It had barely echoed through the dusty hallway outside the solid iron door, and left an eerie silence in its wake.
>A few tense minutes tick by before the faint sound of stomping boots starts to float into your cell through the small barred window centred just above eye level.
>Your anxiety only grows as it gets closer, but the tension is broken when you hear a voice speaking in an accent you haven't heard in over half a year.
"Look. Holding cells."
>Is all he said, but its enough to light the brightest glimmer of hope you've felt in your entire life.
>The boots seem to be stepping much more softly now, but you can hear them plain as day in the hallway outside.
>Two figures rush past your door in quick succession, and your heart skips a beat as they fail to stop and look inside.
>You try to shout after them, but before you can muster the breath to make more than a pained wheeze, a third figure darkens your tiny window.
>Pausing to look in for only a moment, their head turns sharply and silhouettes their snout off to one side as they call out:
"Sam! Over here!"
>There's a sudden commotion just at what you assume is the end of the hall, by the way that the pounding of boots grows louder as it approaches.
>The silhouette in front of you stands aside, and another indistinct, but somehow more familiar form peers in at you from under their identical ballistic helmet.
>But it can't be, it's been so long...
"Anon! ANON! OHMYGODITSHIM! SOMEBODY GET ME THE DOOR RAM"
>Relief washes over you for what feels like the first time in your life.
>That voice, it is her.
>Sam, an experienced DEVGRU operator, and your wife of 6 years.
"RAAHH! FUCK IT! GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!"
>The desperation in her voice spills over, and the shadow at the edge of your door retreats just in time.
*CRASH*
>The iron door shudders on its hinges.
>Solid as it is, the frame it's hung on is very old.
>It's not giving up that easily though.
*CRASH*
"Jesus fuck Sam, you're gonna-"
*BANG*
>the first voice started to say, but was quickly cut off by the final resounding impact as the door crashed open on its hinges.
"ANON!"
>Sam shouted as she burst into your cell, quickly being followed up by 2 other marines sweeping their tac-lights around the small dingy room.
>She started to rush straight for you, but diverted herself upon taking in your restraints.
>Swiftly pulling the combat knife from the front of her plate carrier, she took one step to the side and cut the heavy rope where it was tied off to a pipe jutting out of the wall.
>Her other arm shoots out to catch you as you fall, and she drops the knife in her hand as she hastily side-steps back to take your whole weight in her embrace.
>You can feel how desperate she is to hold you as tight as she can, but she's mindful enough to know you've probably got enough internal injuries as it is.
>Sinking slowly to her knees, she lowers you to the floor.
>Rather than placing you down on it however, she kicks her legs out one at a time to sit on the hard concrete, and lays down on her back, gently pulling you forwards and on top of her.
"Oh Anon..."
>she says softly into your shoulder, and you notice that she's gently sobbing.
>You're still too in shock to feel much but the most profound sense of relief, and of course, adoration for the professional soldier who held you so gingerly.
>The one you had married.

>"I've been thinking about something fun we could try" she'd said
>She'd just made you cum, and you were too love drunk to ask too many questions
>"I think you'll like it more than you think"
>In this state, that was enough to get you to agree
>The elegant wolfess couldn't help but grin slyly as she explained her terms
>"This week, I want to be in charge"
>"And promise you won't jerk off, it'll ruin it"
>The next 3 days didn't go quite how you expected
>whenever you were home, she'd flirt with you
>she'd flick her tail at you, or pinch your bum when she walked past
>She was being very touchy in general
>She was even wearing her stockings around the house, and seemed to enjoy stretching her legs out across your lap whenever you sat on the lounge together.
>But whenever you hopped in bed she didn't want to ride you like you expected
>Instead she'd pull out a book and ask you to read with her
>It had only been 3 days but you were already losing it
>You basically wasted your entire day at work daydreaming about wolf pussy
>And you couldn't help but eyefuck every woman you came across on the way home
>True to her word, the next day you found your wolfess waiting for you, clad in lingerie
>With your collar in her hands
>She led you to the bedroom, letting go of your hand as she delicately hopped up onto the mattress, she'd arranged some pillows to prop her up a little when she laid back
>All planned out beforehand
>She tapped a footpaw against you before laying it out on a small cushion
>"Now, worship me" she commanded
>You moved to obey, you were so pent up, even the thought of kissing her paws was making you rock hard
>Taking hold of her leg, you planted a kiss on each of her stocking covered toe beans in turn
>She'd obviously spent time rubbing oils into them today, they smelled like flowers
>"Bow down for them honey, i don't want your chest to leave the bed while you kiss them"
>Her words set something off inside you, you instantly complied, trying to bring yourself as low as possible before her perfect paws
>The motion pushed your burning hot cock up against your body, causing a drop of precum to pump out
>Your mind felt blurred, you licked and kissed at her paws in a frenzy, quietly groaning every time you stopped to take a breath
>The wolfess looked down at you, head angled forward and her eyes taking a predatory aspect
>"Good boy"
>She kept her eyes on you as she slipped her fingers beneath her panties
>The sound gave away how wet she was
>To make this perfect creature feel good seemed like the most important thing in the world
>She pulled her paws away from you, lifting them in the air
>Then she slipped her panties up her legs and threw them to the side, a string of her gooey juices holding on as she pulled them away
>Her pussy was soaked
>Part of you wanted to jump her right now, but more than that you wanted to obey
>With her free hand, she beckoned you up
>"Slowly"
>You made your way up her leg, animalistically licking at her stockings with intense need
>As soon as you were close enough, she took hold of your collar and guided you the rest of the way
>She stopped you just short of her groin, and pushed your face into her upper thighs
>Her finger rubbed either side of her clit while you worshiped her thighs
>So close you could smell her arousal
>It made your mind feel drunk with need
>Agonizingly, she held you there while her fingers rubbed faster and faster, eliciting soft moans from her muzzle
>You stared up into her eyes as you mouthed at her fur
>"Beg me for a taste of my wolf pussy" she demanded
"I want it so bad"
>"Then beg, say: please let me taste your cum goddess"
"Please goddess, please let me taste your cum goddess"
>"Good"
>She took your collar in both hands and pulled you towards her
>You were all too eager, you drove your tongue between her lips, kissing and lapping at her cunt like a rabid dog
>"AH, Good boy" she moaned
>Arching her back, she took hold of your hair to drive herself harder against you
>You let her take you, licking her out deep and clean, exploring every inch of her pussy
>Soon, you changed rythm, making long and forceful licks from her perineum up to her clit
>As your tongue passed over her clit you slowed down and savored the taste before returning to the start of the motion
>Her moans were getting more frequent, and thighs were lifted against your head as she enjoyed your attention
>It felt amazing knowing that you were worshiping your goddess well
>Soon she was grinding against your tongue, she was getting close
>You wanted her to cum, you wanted it more than anything
>Taking a long shuddering breath, you began to lavish even more attention on her clit
>Kissing and gently sucking at it, your mouth was watering and your face was coated in a mixture of her juices and your own saliva
>"Good boy, good boy" she repeated, rocking her hips faster each time
>Then she locked her legs around your neck, you moaned into her clit, she replied with "Mmmm"s of her own
>She went over the edge, and you could hear her muttering more "good boy"s as she rode out her orgasm
>You greedily lapped up your reward
>After calming down, her legs released you, and her arms flopped down on the bed either side of her
>She looked dreamy, and somehow more beautiful than ever
>You climbed up face to face with her and kissed her deeply
>"I love you so much" she said between kisses
"I love you too"
>It felt like her whole body was relaxing in your arms, and the two of you just laid there holding eachother and kissing for a few minutes before she swung her legs over the side of the bed and stood up
>She narrowed her eyes, grinning like a naughty schoolchild
>"Now, its not time yet.."
>"But you've been such a good boy"
>"I need to see how much you want to fuck me"
>Pulling down your pants, your cock sprang out fully erect
>It was coated, and a big string of precum seeped out and dripped down your length in a thick string
>The sight of it seemed to please her greatly
>"So much, just from worshiping me?"
>She leaned in close to you, so her nose touched yours
>"I'm going to have you *screaming* for me"
>As she climbed on top of you she folded your legs and pushed your knees apart
>drawing herself up until her knees had your thighs pinned open
>Then she reached a hand down between your legs
>And took a firm grip of your balls, just tight enough to make you feel a tiny wince of pain
>"Who do they belong to?" she asked, a mischievous grin breaking across her muzzle
>You gritted your teeth, her grasp was forcing more precum to drip down your cock
"You.. fuck, i need my goddess to own me"
>The grin widening across your she-wolf's face told you that was exactly what she wanted to hear
>A single finger felt its way up the length of your shaft, and it made your cock twitch hard
>"A nice, thick, human cock for me to play with however I want"
>She licked some precum off her hand
>"And its so obedient for me.."
>tracing her way up your body, she continued
>"Every inch of you is mine" she softly hissed
>As she said it, you felt the tickle of her fingers softly caressing your neck
>It was as if you were sinking into the mattress, she was unraveling tension you didn't even know you held in your body
>An intense sense of relaxation washed over you as you accepted her control
>"You're all mine"
>Gently she lifted your chin and began to softly play her fangs across your skin
>your breath shuddered
"I need you"
>You wrapped your arms around her hips, pulling her close
>It felt as if you were operating on pure, lust filled instinct
>"You're always going to have me"
>she took your hands in her own and laid them out on the bed either side of you, her tail slowly swung back and forth, its fur gently brushing against your tip with each swish
>With a low growl your wolfess bared her fangs and began to mouth at your collar
>kissing your bare neck between every few bites
>"Its so hot seeing you wear it"
>"Knowing you want to wear it for me"
>"Knowing you want your girlfriend to collar you"
>You strained against your collar, savoring its tightness against your neck
>You really were a freak
>but it felt too good to care

>they're so late I have to spend the night in a lounge attached to the bus station?

>she gets closer and closer, though I don't actually see her until I actually look up
>see something like pic related except she's in a black bra and panties

>Anon is a weeaboo who channeled his power level into actually learning how to use a sword
>To the point where he's actually gotten really good over the years
>One day, on his way home from work, he finds a thrift store he hadn't noticed before
>The place is old and dust-Oh shit a cool sword!
>Anon buys it immediately, wanting to hang it on his wall and swing it around while shouting cool things
>The moment he steps outside, he hears a voice shouting at him
>"CRIMINAL!"
>He looks to his left, and it's some weird-ass cosplayer
>Some wannabe Usagi-Yojimbo looking woman is approaching him
>Nope! Not about to get dragged into some cringe-inducing roleplay
>He's about to turn to get into his car, when he hears rapid footsteps approaching
>And the sound of steel leaving a scabbard
>He managed to dodge back just in time to watch as the space he occupied a moment ago gets skewered
>And, much to his horror, his car door
>That's a real fucking sword!
>And this lunatic is swinging it overhead to make him into meat
>Anon moves on instinct, bringing the shitty sword up to parry the strike the best he can
>But something is off: the sword is way too well balanced and the steel is...
>Holy shit this is an actual sword!
>Anon and the rabbit assailant cross blades before she backs off
>And anon immediately takes the chance to dip, running into a nearby alleyway
>He's familiar with the area enough that he's sure he can lose her
>As he navigates the twisting paths behind the stores and houses, he...might've gotten lost himself
>The ground is way too dusty, and the buildings are looking weird
>And he can't have been running for that long if the sky looks so red already
>But even though he's lost, he hasn't lost his pursuer, who's shouting for him to "Come back and fight, you coward!"
>Anon sees the light at the end of the tunnel
>He'll exit the alleys, and dip into the nearest store to lose her
>What he finds is...not even close to familiar
>Nothing he sees makes sense
>It looks like a renaissance faire was invaded by an anime convention and a furry con at the same time, and they somehow established peace
>Guys and girls in tunics and robes running around in what has got to be the most convincing LARP he's ever seen
>...Doesn't matter. Got to run and hide from the crazed cosplay killer on his heels
>To late, as she makes her reappearance sword-first and forces anon to a quick retreat
>He's just...barely hanging on as she keeps the pressure up
>A quick thrust leading to a feint leading to a low swipe that brings itself up and back around
>Anon, as he sees more of his shirt get demolished is super glad that he was a weeaboo with a hobby instead of just a fatass
>But he's getting tired
>The crowd of people watching this attempted murder part around him as he tries to get some distance
>But this seemed to be what she was waiting for
>Faster than he could have expected, she lunges, burying the tip of her blade into his shoulder
>And her fist into his jaw
>Anon realizes he's going to die in the middle of a fucking LARP because one rando had a meltdown and took it out on him
>That was the last thought before he was out
>...
>Something fucking hurts!
>His shoulder and face feel like they've been tossed into a blender, and tenderized respectively
>He tries to get his arms under him, but as he finds he can't move them,
>a fresh shot of fear makes him much more awake, and has him take in the situation
>He's tied up
>In a dark room
>The floors are wood and he can smell mildew
>There's no noises outside, so nobody's around...
>Oh god she dragged him back to her basement
>Son the lights are going to come on and everything is going to go red
>As if on cue, a door opens, blasting anon's eyes with daylight
>It burns!
>The silhouette of the same girl from before fills the doorway
>Anon needs to get away, but his legs are tied to something, limiting their movement
>Slowly, the figure approaches
>"Anon, yes?"
>The voice, a harsh rasp that was vaguely feminine called out to him
>He wasn't sure what to make of it, and with his silence, it called back out to him
>"You are Anon, are you not? The man who picked up this artifact through unknown means?"
>She shifted her stance, showing that she was holding his freshly acquired sword
>Notably, she was holding it with a layer of cloth between her fingers and it
>The sheath looked like absolute shit from the way her sword hacked at it and he realized exactly how often he came close to dying
>If any of those strikes had connected...
>"I'm going to assume you're Anon, since that's what the scroll says. I'll be direct: you are in possession of a highly illegal cursed relic. I'm not sure HOW you've come to possess it, but by touching it with your unguarded hands, you've bound yourself to it."
>he's not sure where this is going
>"I'm sorry to say that your life is likely over. I've been tasked by my superiors to drag you to a containment cell so that your corpse doesn't run wild once this thing takes you over."
>What the hell is she saying?
>"As such, I'll be dragging you back there myself. It shouldn't be more than a few days of travel from here."
>Where is 'here', exactly?
>Who is she?
>Will she stop this godawful roleplay already? He isn't going to play D&D with her!
>Anon says all of this, partially out of desperation, partially due to wanting a last fuck you before he's skinned alive or whatever
>The kidnapper just watches as Anon burns himself out again, exhausting his second wind in a tirade
>She raises her finger, and a single flame winks into existence above it
>The light it gives off is disproportionately bright, forcing him to look away from it, but what he sees only confuses him more
>That's either the most amazing costume he's seen, or...
>Anon asks her, much more calmly this time, what the hell she is
>Your compliance seems to satisfy her
>"I am nobody, just a blade sent to retrieve a criminal."
>...lame!
>Anon says as much, telling her that she has to have some name and not some vague descriptor that says absolutely fuckall
>His sudden irritation catches her off-guard, much to his satisfaction
>After a moment, she recomposes herself
>"I...suppose you deserve a name, since I'll be watching over your last days..."
>She removes her hat, revealing more of that frighteningly realistic rabbit costume
>Which he quickly realizes isn't a costume at all, as the eyes focus on his, and the mouth moves way too smoothly
>"Hana. Call me Hana."
>She stoops down, kneeling before him and looking into his eyes
>"We've already established which one of us is going to end up as the victor, have we not?"
>Anon nods
>"And I've taken your weapon, so you're unarmed. You understand that, right?"
>He nods again
>"So, when I release your binds, you'll come peacefully so I don't have to put more holes in you?"
>He briefly considers throwing a sucker punch, but realizes that it's a terrible idea
>He nods for a third time
>"Good. Hold still."
>She places the sword on the ground behind her, then leans foreward
>That furred face brushes against his as her hands reach behind him to...
>To simply snap the rope! She just fucking snaps the rope!
>Christ, she's strong...
>Christ she smells goo-NO!
>Anon's conflicting feelings clash before reason takes control
>Next she moves to his feet, and rips the cords binding him in a similarly brutish fashion
>Anon is free!
>But also god-damned terrified...
>He stands, slowly as to not alarm her and give her a reason to use more of that power against him
>And he immediately regrets it, as his legs haven't caught up to the rest of him
>He stumbles, forward, into her arms
>And she uses the momentum to hoist him over her shoulder
>The movement was so fluid and easy!
>"...this is probably easier than having you walk."
>She says, hand grabbing his legs, thankfully not groping him
>"Let's go, Criminal."

>it's only a few intersections away from a supermarket, easy enough to walk since you weren't planning on stocking up at the moment
>you turn a couple corners, passing by several human/anthro couples out enjoying the nightlife
>suddenly a spotless black SUV and limousine closely behind it stop against the curb where you are
>a couple large canine anthros get out of the SUV and approach you swiftly
>you don't even have time to try to be civil before they grab you and muffle your attempted shout for help
>they throw you into the back of the limousine
"I hope you won't disappoint me tonight."
>you steady yourself and process where you are
>you see a, certainly elegant anthro woman, yet looking very suggestive, sitting in front of you
>she flashes lewd gazes at you and licks her lips a little
>she states to you with no lack of confidence
"I'm in need of a companion tonight, and you've caught my eye."

I know its stereotypical to complain about men going to sleep after sex but for me there's nothing more romantic than drifting off to sleep together after both of you are thoroughly satisfied.
>Go a few rounds, then eat her out a few times while she jerks you off
>after the final time, neither of you move, just basking in the afterglow
>You've just got arms around her waist, head cozying up to her tummy
>she notices you drifting away so she pulls you up to eye level and cuddles you to sleep
>wake up still holding eachother

>Walking the streets at night
>Notoriously dangerous for guys, hear about the rapes every day on the news
>See a hyena woman and two other rough looking types down the street, obviously up to no good
>Decide that it'd be better to just try and take a detour through the alleyway
>It's dark and dirty, really not the place you want to be this time of the day
>Or any time of the day for that matter
>As you hide, you hear the rowdy hyena and her two friends drunkenly talk about how they wish they'd find some cute guy to eat all their cunts
>They pass you and you hear their lewd conversation fade into the buzzle of the night
>Looks like you dodged the bullet this time
>As you sneak out from hiding behind a few bins, you spot someone up ahead
>As she approaches, you see it's a wolf
>She's about a head taller than you, and dressed in a trench coat of some sort
>She looks dirty, you can smell yer all the way from where you're standing
>Smells like wet fur, alcohol and something musky, like a pungent sexual odour
>She looks at you with a sort of giddy, desperate expression, licking her teeth
>"W-what do you want?!", you ask her, trying and failing to sound assertive
>"I just wanted to show you something~" she said with a slurred attempt at flirting
>Opens up the coat, flashing her tits and her dripping, nasty pussy
>"Ngh~ like what you see bitch~?" she moans out as she furiously starts touching herself
>You try to sidestep her but she just blocks your path as she continues
>"L-leave me alone!" you mutter, as she comes closer
>"Mhm you smell nice..." she says as she shoves you against the wall, attempting to kiss you as you struggle to break free
>She pushes against you, holding her right arm against your neck as she shoves her tongue into your mouth
>She tastes like booze and blood, not a particularly pleasant combination yet one you have no choice in enduring at the moment
>Her left hand remains firmly placed between her legs, furiously stroking her clit with a lewd wet sound as she humps forwards against your pants
>You continue struggling but she appears to be determined to continue her molestation
>She shoves a series of whining, animalistic grunts straight down your throat as you feel her teeth brush against your lips in that awkward kiss
>You feel her suddenly tense up, letting out a louder growl as you feel something warm and wet soil the lower part of your shirt and crotch
>She pants and continues to get off for a couple of seconds before coming to a stop with a deep whine and hurried breath
>She just keeps her muzzle pressed against your lip, her eyes rolled back in post-orgasmic bliss
>You see your opportunity, and in her post-nut haze you kick her in her oversensitive cunt, eliciting a pained whine from the wolf as you bolt
>"Ngh you fucking slut!" you hear her groan in pain and anger, clutching her groin
>You continue down the street in the general direction of your home
>Looks like she could give chase, you lost her for now
>You come to a stop, panting, as you feel yourself coated in her fluids, reeking of dirty wet fur and wolf pussy
>It won't be long before another one feels the scent of a rival and decides to claim you for herself

Human worlds are only good for breeding colonies.

> no matter, it seems as though diplomatic relations are going well, hell on my way to the grocery I saw a man and a cobra lady cuddling on a bench together

> in a surprising move, billionaires have donated millions to social programs and public projects
> I can’t for the life of me figure out what inspired this generosity but I’m not complaining
> 2048 March 2nd
> Aliens must really love earth, you used to only see them in big cities or places of note, but now there’s always at least one in every town big and small
> other than that nothing really of note has happened…..well that’s not true
> I’ve noticed some weird changes over the past year
> news outlets that would normally be at each other’s throats every hour if the day are preaching about all the good things the alliance has brought and opportunities to go off world

The idea of this grand alien conspiracy having a rather mundane and harmless truth of space anthros just wanting husbands would be kinda funny. More so with a protag who has read too many old scifi books/movies and thinks the worst only for him to end up being cuddled and called a good boy which is making him feel funny and warm.

humans are fairly adaptable to most environments because they are creative and are always ready to breed, a star faring anthro race would use that to improve their expansion across the galaxy
id imagine if reptilian athros needed you youd end up on a tropical world looking after lots of eggs

> “abusive?!? How dare you, it’s just how we did things back then”
> “don’t bring my divorce into this”

>It's your supervisor, Annette, a snow leopard woman
>She's looking down at you with her arms crossed across her chest
>"In her office," she elaborates
"Oh, uh, alright."
>Arms remaining crossed, she disappears back into the sterile whiteness of the hallway she came from
>Normally her indifference rubbed you the wrong way, but all you can think about is why the president of the company is summoning you to her office
>Surely she has more important things to do than speak to a janitor?
>You do your job just fine like everyone else
>You've hardly interacted with her, either
>She introduced herself in passing not long after you took the job and you see her around the building occasionally
>You've never seen her outside of working hours
>It's not like company administrators get drinks with custodians after work
>Different reasonings come and go as you make your way to the upper floors
>You'll be alright as long as you leave her office without losing your job
>Seeing the door at the peak of the stairwell pulls you from the mess of thoughts in your head
>You push through the door into the top floor of the building
>With the exception of your footsteps and the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, it's nearly silent
>You pass the rooms on either side of you
>Down to the ornate double doors at the end of the hallway
>You haven't been up here before, but it's not hard to intuit which room says "company president" the most
>Steadying your nerves, you give a few light knocks
"Ms. Austin?"
>"Come on in, Anon."
>With more effort than expected, you ease the slab of mahogany open and gingerly step into the office
>Given how extravagant the doors were, the inside isn't a huge surprise
>A wall-length bookcase, a desk of some exotic wood, and the smartly dressed wolfess standing behind it are all that populate the room
>This is some Mr. Burns shit
>You make your way towards the opposite end of the room
>As you do, you begin to make out a familiar melody
>"Aja, when all my dime dancin' is through, I run to you..."
>Approaching the desk, Ms. Austin turns around, revealing a glass of brandy in either paw
>She extends one to you, and you take it with a nod
>You'd be thinking about why she's offering you liquor halfway through the work day
>But your focus is entirely directed on the record player off to the side of the desk
>Spinning a copy of Steely Dan's 1977 classic, Aja
>"So, Anon... You've been working here for a while now."
>She runs her finger along the rim of the glass as she continues
>"I've been told you do such a good job, so I've been thinki-"
"Wow, good choice on the music, Ms. Austin!"
>You pause for a moment as the next verse starts
"Christ, the drum solo on this one is fantastic. Steve Gadd was a fuckin' machine."
>She gives you a blank stare as you continue your autistic rambling
"I'm personally a bigger fan of The Royal Scam, but this is still a great pick."
>"Anon."
"You've gotta get a different turntable, though. Suitcase players like this destroy-"
>"ANON."
>Shit.
>On your first time actually meeting the company president, you've completely blown her off
>And put your livelihood at risk in favor of the musical genius of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker
>Bracing yourself for the worst, she kneels down slightly and firmly rests her paws on your shoulders
>You bring your head up to find a mischievous grin on her face
>She seems more entertained than anything at your outburst
>"I want you to work for me. At my home."
>Oh
>What?
>"You always do such hard work keeping the building clean, so I figured you'd do just as well tidying up around my house."
>"Of course, you'd have some extra responsibilities, but you'll do just fine, won't you?"
>You hesitate for a second while she looks at you expectantly
"I'm not sure, could I have some time to-"
>She cuts you off
>"Hmmm, that's a shame. I suppose I'll have to find someone else who can clean for me."
>The amusement on her face has been joined by a hint of mock sadness
>She hasn't really given you a choice in the matter
>Just as long as you don't have to start job hunting again
"Never mind Ms. Austin, that sounds good to me."
>The apprehension in your voice was far from subtle, but that didn't seem to phase her
>Her grin grows into a full toothy smile and she stands back up to her full height
>"Perfect!" she exclaims, punctuated with a clasp of her paws
>Her swaying of her tail increases in pace
>"I'll send someone tomorrow morning to pick you up and have you moved in to the guest house."
>You were imagining a new commute at most, but this is a bit much
>Not like anything you had to say would've mattered
>"I'm glad you can be so flexible for me, Anon."
>"Why don't you take the rest of the day to head home and pack your things?"
>Again, not much of a choice
>You take a sip from your drink while giving a nod
"Yeah, I'll get going. Enjoy the rest of your afternoon."
>You put your drink down and retreat back to the hallway
>While you're closing the door, she speaks up one more time
>"I'll see you tomorrow!"
>You could still hear the smile on her voice as she said it
>The door latches shut behind you, and you're left with the same silence from earlier
>At least you haven't lost your job

Can I just say that Female Samurott is embodiment of /adhg/?
>Big and strong
>A brave warrior willing to kill, protect and serve a human prince who’s weak and gentle
>Has a rough childhood and the only emotions she has is anger, cautious, and quietly fearful of every fight she has to endure and hope she can survive just to protect her human prince
>Get’s slowly to finally feel comfortable thanks to the human prince’s touch and tender aura he brings with him
>And finally dropping her tough warrior knight and starts bawling at the human prince’s shoulders as her tears cascades and finally admits she’s scared of dieing in the field and bring disgrace into her family line as the human prince caresses her white hair and soothes her with his soft voice and let her tears putting wet stains all over his regal coat

I find the Anthrostate to be utopian, and I would happily live there.
People are wicked and treacherous. I find a certain satisfaction in our total subjugation by an iron-fisted, but ultimately benevolent, force.
Anthros deserve to rule us, because they are better than us. We're lucky that they love us enough to bother.
I would actively and shamelessly surrender humanity to our rightful masters.

Normal re-education is mostly for minor offenses. Non-violent one time escape attempts, infrequent offenses of disturbing the peace, and generally those who just need a little nudge to the right path
Normal re-education includes: homemaking classes, life counselors, education on how horrible life was before the state, and “contact therapy” where you’re essentially strapped to an anthro’s chest for an hour or two in order to make you more comfortable with them
Intensive re-education is for major offenses like frequent or violent escape attempts, repeated offenses, and tampering with state affairs.
Intensive re-education is dealt with on a case by case basis and usually requires much more extreme measures. Before undergoing intensive re-education you are examined by a professional to see if your current self can be salvaged or if you need to be broken and rebuilt better.
Anything else about the process is hush hush kind you

“Thank you Ma’am. I’m grateful for everything you’ve done for me.”
>The sharply dressed lioness that was your headmistress continued.
>”Oh Anon you charmer. It’s almost a shame that your rehabilitation is complete. I’ll miss seeing you, and you’re a good influence on the others. Maybe you can come visit sometime!
>You know just how to respond. You’re much better at conversation since you came here.
“I should certainly hope so. But I trust wherever you’re sending me, I’ll be okay.”
>”Actually Anon, that’s why I brought you here. I wanted to be the one to tell you that on account of your shining success, you have been moved into the preferred assignment program. Your caretakers and I have gone to the trouble of interviewing and selecting your wife from among the most eligible in the state.”
>You can’t contain your excitement.
>You weren’t even supposed to be eligible for preferred assignment.
“Preferred Assignment!?! But I’m just-”
>Headmistress took your mouth in her paw to silence you .
>Her warm smile parts to finish your thought for you.
>”What you were before doesn’t matter. We’re all very proud of you here, and you should be proud of yourself.”
>”Now why don’t we go meet Ms. Right?”
“Now!?!”
>”Why not? You’re ready now. Look at you, collar all polished up. No one had to ask you, you did it yourself.
>She led you down the hall to the reception area.
>Everyone was gathered around there
>In the center of them was a lithe anthro.
>You had never met one like her before, but thanks to your voracious consumption of state literature you knew she was a civet.
>She sported a grey base coat of fur, with elaborate patterns of darker fur across her body.
>There were stripes like the tiger you loved to play chess with
>Rings like the nice leopard who fixed your teeth
>A band across her eyes reminded you of the Racoon who dragged you in off the street
>Her weasalish face reminded you of the lanky librarian who suggested all those great reads.
>And she had a magnificent tail. It wasn’t as fluffy as the fox who tought you ballroom dancing, but it was longer with beautiful rings.
>It was too much
>You teared up right then and there

>you're sweating bullets and stare at your counselor for help

if they're like most hive insects then 99% of them would be females where males would be kept far away from battles and their only purpose would be to breed with the queen
reminds me of an old greentext I wrote
>bug hive aliens make contact and ally with humans/Earth
>they're like bees/ants/etc with hives mostly being females led by a queen/breeding caste and a handful of males being born for breeding purposes
>suddenly all these female bug aliens are now interacting with many human males when before they'd be lucky to even see a male in their whole life
>all that exposure to male pheromones, even if alien, start to have an affect on the lower castes
>their bodies get flooded with chemicals to change into breeder castes or partial changes into breeder lower caste sort of hybrids
>when humanity accidentally the whole hive into horny breeders
>even worse their instincts make them just as overprotective of human males as their own minority of males
>Earth/humans get put in pretty much protective custody of the bug aliens whether we like it or not

>You were planning on setting out on a hike.
>It's nothing too intensive, just checking out a new trail you haven't tried yet.
>You think about bringing a light pack, but from what you've seen on your map, it's probably not worth it.
>Clipping a bottle of water onto your belt, you set off.
>Huffing a little as you crest the hill, you pause a moment to sip your water and admire the meadow.
>On both sides of the winding path are some wildflowers, a whole array of purple, orange, and yellow flowers spatter the grass.
>Clipping the bottle back on, you prepare to continue forward, but what looks to be a campsite catches your eye.
>It's about ten feet off the beaten path and rather small, a small fire pit and tiny wooden tent platform.
>Feeling adventurous, you cross the grass and look around.
>The fire pit is nothing special, just a stone ring with a metal rack partially in it.
>The tent platform is barely big enough for a two-person tent, but it doesn't have any nails sticking up and is in good general condition. Much nicer than camping on the ground.
>A beech tree stands at the edge of the campsite with the clearing continuing around it.
>Out of curiosity, you walk up and around the tree looking for carvings.
>However, in your distracted state you failed to see the hole in the ground and fell in.
>Your reflexes were sharp enough to make it so your arms landed in such a way that you didn't break them.
>Kicking your legs in hopes of finding something to lift yourself up, you found nothing.
>Emboldened by terror of falling into a bottomless pit, your struggles to escape intensified, but to no avail.
>Cries of help soon started flying from your lips as you desperately tried to scramble up.
>The flailing of your left leg is stopped by something grabbing it, your right leg is also grabbed a second later.
>With the fear of being eaten alive replacing your fear of falling, your panicked struggles only increase.
>It takes a minute before you run out of energy and can no longer keep trying to break free of the grips of whatever is holding your legs.
>You can’t put up much resistance as your legs are moved to a straighter position.
>It starts with your boots and socks, both removed so quickly and deftly that you didn’t have time to think before they were gone.
>Whatever is below you then grasps the top of your pants and gives it a few tugs.
>The belt stymies it, but it’s unbuckled and removed swiftly in spite of your weak kicks.
>Your pants, no longer protected by your belt, are pulled down.
>The grasping paws have to shuffle themselves up your legs so that your pants can be fully taken off.
>The sensation of soft fur upon your skin is shocking and ticklish, making you kick your legs and nearly escape the clutches of one of the sets of paws.
>At last, the final barrier is pulled off and your member is exposed to the underground air.
>Within moments of the final barrier's fall, what feel like dozens of whiskers rub against your thighs and pelvis.
>A paw coated in fine, soft fur snakes up from behind to cup and toy with your sack.
>The rolling and toying is strange, but pleasant, due to the ticklishness of the fur, however the occasional pinching is not as... enjoyable.
>Interspersed between the fondling were tongues, darting about and lapping to taste the skin of wherever they pleased.
>Most notable of the bunch was the one who'd locked their paws on your hips and was sampling your meat with long licks.
>Such drawn out licks turned to energetic suckling as you stiffened.
>Enduring an onslaught of many paws and an eager mouth with a swirling tongue was impossible.
>Your vision started to swim and the grassy view in front of your eyes faded.
>Eventually, you erupted into the gleeful maw.
>Halfway through, it stopped being that you were releasing in their mouth and more that it was getting forcefully sucked from you.
>After you'd partially returned to your senses, you realized that you were getting pulled into the earth.
>With arms still twitching, you tried to resist the pull but were inevitably dragged in to face your assailants.
>Accompanied by a small deluge of soil, you looked up from your prone position to see many rabbits staring at you in the lantern light.
>All of which are female, it slipped your mind that it was spring.
>They're atop of you immediately.
>A minor brawl breaks out over who gets dibs on your dick, with a clever girl breaking off to claim her spot on your face with her fluffy rear.
>The heat pheromones coming off the bun on your face makes you stiffen again for the brawl winner and makes your mind blank out as your instincts tell you start licking.
>Time itself starts to loose meaning as it starts to blur with your orgasms and the changing of who you're eating out being the only distinguishable events.
>After who knows how long, you start to come to.
>Around you lies a pile of sleeping rabbits, many of which have a stream of white fluid drooling from their lower lips.
>Staggering to your feet on your legs of gelatin, you search around for your clothing as best as you can without disturbing the resting rabbits.
>First you discover your water bottle, and you nearly drain the remaining water in it.
>Then you discover your pants and belt, followed by your boots and a sock.
>For the life of you, you cannot find your underwear, no matter how thoroughly you search.
>Eventually you consign yourself to knowing that you'll be walking home commando.
>Searching for a way out, you stumble across a stepladder of sorts.
>Placing it under the hole is easy enough, climbing out of the hole is more difficult and takes several tries before you finally succeed.
>Stepping past the beech tree, you turn back and make a mental note of that's where the 'pit of bunnies' is.
>Then you continue forth past the fire pit and on the way back home.

>Shit! Shit shit shit!
>The sounds of footsteps were getting closer
>Your own ragged breath and heavy running pace all but drowning it out as you ran down the hall
>You were a fool
>A god damned idiot!
>How could you have been fooled by that sweet face?!
>How could you ignore the one thing you were told repeatedly before moving to an anthro town
>Rule 1, 2, and 3: NEVER go out alone during estrus season. Even when you think it's safe. Even when SHE tells you she's able to manage it
>Never, EVER, go out alone!
>And yet you were here.
>The note was flowery and pleasant
>Words and perfume worked their wonders on your mind as you met the mysterious girl alone in the office
>A confession. A bona-fide confession in this day and age.
>The meek fox girl seemed so nervous when she slipped it onto your desk before dashing away
>You though...you had hoped she was different. You were near the end of February so you thought you could be safe!
>And yet, you ran like you've never run before
>Your shoes squeaked along the floor as you rounded the corner
>You made a mistake
>You looked back
>Wide, feral eyes that locked onto yours
>A thick bushy tail waving behind her
>Naked except for a shredded shirt and stockings
>And running on all fours
>The secretary ran towards you as a literal beast
>You faltered, fear getting the best of you
>The ground came up to meet you, and you did your best imitation
>Instinct was ruling you, moving your hands to catch you
>You rolled and found your feet again, before turning and leaping into an office
>You thanked your lucky stars that the doors didn't need a key to lock from the inside
>You were so glad that the filing cabinet was easy enough to move
>These two formed the barrier between you and...that animal. That thing that was hunting you like
>"Little mouse~"
>A chill ran up your spine
>Your feet moved you away from the door as the voice called out again
>"Come outside, Little Mouse! I'm so hungry~"
>Your back hit the desk, and you didn't dare turn your eyes away from the doorway
>"Oh my sweet Little Mouse. My precious love!
>A pause, before the sound of claws grinding against wood filled your ears
>"My d e l i c i o u s prey!"
>"Don't you want me? Aren't you interested in me as more than a friend?"
>Her eye peered through the gap in the blinds towards you
>It was somehow hungrier than before
>"Don't you WANT me like I NEED you?"
>The doorknob rattled once, then once again with more force
>"Let me in, Little Mouse. Let the vixen have her fun!"
>You couldn't stop the shaking
>You shook more as she bashed against the door
>"I promise you, I won't bite. I won't leave a mark on that pretty little head of yours."
>You thought about moving the desk as well, even as she was staring back at you again
>"However...that's only if you come out, my sweet Mouse."
>The doorknob turned a little more, the level dipping a little lower as she put her weight and wild strength behind it
>You were pushing the desk before you realized it
>The second bit of weight seemed to be what you needed as the rattling stopped
>"Only a matter of time, Mouse. You can't hide forever, you know."
>"Surely you had to know what you were getting into, right?"
>The doorknob snapped, and the door moved an inch with the items placed behind it
>You were pushing back against it
>Trying to keep it shut and ignore the laughter that filled the air
>You were pushing back
>And losing
>"You can't resist forever, anon. You're only human after all."
>The strength became greater
>"A perfect font of seed that can quench my heat. The perfect lover to warm my bed~"
>A sudden burst made you lose a few inches, and her muzzle pressed through
>Her tongue ran along its length as she looked at you through her claimed space
>"I can drain you dry, Little Mouse. Just eat you up and never get full~"
>Another inch
>"All night..."
>Two more inches
>"Every D A Y !"
>You scrabbled to press it closed gain
>Your own instinct was working with you, regaining space and forcing her to pull back her snout and go back to pushing
>No. No no no! You couldn't let yourself get trapped in there
>You dug in and pushed to keep that door closed
>You managed to gain another in ch back before she gave a wild cry
>Your progress was undone in an instant
>You were losing ground even quicker as her snout came through
>"I can smell your fear, Mouse. I can F E E L how desperately you want to keep me away."
>The desk's edge dug into your palms
>"I know you're frightened..."
>Four more inches
>"I KNOW you think I've become some sort of...monster, right Little Mouse?"
>Your shoes slid across the carpet, trying to gain any sort of purchase to put more of your own strength behind
>She was a full foot shorter than you, how was she THAT strong?!
>"But I really do love you, Little Mo- Anon. I really do care for you!"
>Her face slid more and more into the gap she made, eye meeting yours again
>"That's why I CAN'T let any of THEM have you!"
>"What they have is just baseline LUST!"
>Her entire head came through and your strength was failing you
>Please no
>Not like this...
>"They can't...they WON'T" love you like I can!"
>Her hands came to pry the door open, claws digging into the wood on both sides
>Her grin grew wider
>She knew she won
>"I swear, Anon Mouse, I will love you so well! I won't ever let you go-"
>Her eyes finally left yours as she looked behind her
>Rage and fear
>Despair and surprise
>She flashed through so many emotions in a second as something gripped her collar
>"What are YOU doing here?! Get awa-"
>She was yanked through the door and you manged to push it shut
>The sound of a struggle could be heard from the other side
>A new voice could be heard
>"I told you it was a bad idea! You're letting your instincts have the best of you!"
>"No!" the fox shouted, "It's meant to be! He wouldn't have COME otherwise!"
>More struggles
>Furniture crashed
>SOMETHING bashed up against the door, but there wasn't a secondary force
>You could hear the newcomer's voice shouting "Cool down and stop giving HR a reason to write you up!"
>The fox's wailing could be heard, along with grunting
>Then silence
>A pregnant pause, where you took your shoes off to get more of a grip in case the pushing started
>"It's okay, Mous." the new voice said, "She's zip-tied and can't get to you."
>A knock, in the rhythm of "Shave and a haircut" broke the tense silence of your nonreply
>"You can come out, Mous."
>You waited, for anything to happen
>No crashes against the door, no deranged laughing
>Just the sound of the fox whimpering in the background
>The desk came free easy enough, and the cabinet was righted in a second
>You tensely opened the door, and saw your boss sitting there
>She was in casual clothes, with some rope over her shoulder
>She looked at your face, before looking you over
>"Did she hurt you?"
>Aside from a need for new pants, no
>"Good. I'm going to leave your...admirer here until morning. So she can ride this out and think about what she's done."
>A pause
>"Or, at least TRIED to do." Then to her she added, "The damages are coming out of your check, by the way!"
>The fox's head hung in shame
>nothing but soft wimpers
>"Come on, Mous, let's get you home."
>The two of you walked in silence, making your way back through the halls
>As you eyed your scuff marks on the floor your boss looked around and sighed
>"Idiot girl. That's predators for you. They think they could just run down anything they want."
>You could barely believe you...wait how did she know you were there
>"You didn't notice that was my office? Security pinged and I was alerted. Looked on the camera and saw that shameful display."
>Her hand patted your shoulder
>"Seriously...trying to chase down a man like prey..."
>The grip tightened
>You saw a familiar hunger
>"After all. There's better ways than that."
>"Right?"

>You scramble for the remote the moment you've moved the bookshelf over.
>Flicking through the channels as fast as you could as your girlfriend shoulder bashes the front door.
>The sound of wood being turned to splinters washes across the rooms, peeking over you see the new cracks in the wood.
>The bookshelf is the only reason why she didn't immediately break through, even though the door was made of solid oak.
>But that doesn't mean it'll hold, you've got another charge or two before she'll be on you.
>Twitching fingers make you skip over channels in your fright.
>A thunderous crash and scream of protesting wood, you fumble the remote but see that she didn't yet break through.
>Your shaking only makes things worse, you finally came across your love's favorite show, but overshot it by four channels.
>Clicking it back, you overshoot once more by a single channel.
>Whether the pounding in your ears was your heart's beat or her hooves is anyone's guess.
>The door goes flying and the bookshelf is smashed into little more than scrap planks as it slams against the floor.
>Your girlfriend can't stop herself fast enough and crashes into the wall opposite of the door.
>By the time she recovers, you've put on the show that you've bet your pelvis' intactness on.
>As she stands back up, you can see her in her full glory.
>Standing there pants-less, in a shredded shirt, panting with sweat and drywall dust drenching her hide, she bears a face of indecision.
For a moment you worry that your gamble failed, but she soon answers with, "One, just one. Then you're putting foals me, got it? No more running from your responsibilities."
>Your answer is the only one possible, frantic nodding.
>Accepting your reply, she drops herself on the couch and brings you close to her.
>Now you have until the end of the show, or maybe until the next commercial break, to find a way to be on top.
>Anything else will just have your hips shattered like the door.

>some of the anthro villains are creepers
>on more than one occasion a dastardly team up was foiled by the villains fighting over you
>but at least you get the exclusive stories at the end of the day
>except for the Super Dragon stories
>for some reason the mild mannered small town vixen you work with always beats you to those

>It's getting near to the end of your shift and the customers are drying up due to how late it's getting.
>You serve the coffee and ordered pastries and meat strips to one of the last few tables of the night.
>Why they want the half-stale pastries and cold strips of meat at 8:30pm escapes you, but they're here and you're on the clock.
>The signature cheery grin on your face gets slightly more forced as one of the wolves tries to sneak a feel at your flat, smooth stomach.
>You probably wouldn't have cared if she didn't go under your shirt.
>Resisting the urge to jump when touched unexpectedly is difficult enough even with a layer of cloth.
>You don't really want to have an issue where you splashed someone with half a pot of hot coffee.
>Wrapping up the table by asking if they need anything else and getting answers in the negative, you look around for any other tables with someone sitting at them.
>In the corner of the room, there sits a sulking panther.
>As you approach, you realize that you were incorrect, she's not a panther.
>It's just a lot of black fur dye, she must've bathed in it.
>Her spots are barely visible
>You want to say she's a jaguar or leopard, but she's too spindly for that.
>Coming to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter, you walk up and ask if she's ready to order.
"Coffee. As black as my soul," leaves her muzzle in reply.
>By the Omnifur, has she not had a good day in months? The deadness in her voice is... just depressing.
Trying to be glib, you answer with, "So one vanilla latte then? Anything else to go with it?"
>The deathly glare you get in response makes you instantly regret your attempt at lightening her mood.
>With a wilting half-smile you nod and turn away.
>A few minutes later you return to the sitting void with two cups of coffee, one of the blackest coffees you could make, it's almost sludge with how you've made it, and the vanilla latte you tried to joke about.
>Having escaped her baleful glare, your carefully cultivated desire to get customers be content, if not happy, with your service makes you set down the latte first.
>It takes her a moment to comprehend what's in the mug before she returns her gaze to your weakly grinning face.
>The moment her claws start to slide out you all but slam the cup down.
"The latte's complementary!" you panickily stutter out.
>A huff escapes her and she upends the cup of sludge into her muzzle.
>Through some unfortunate twist of fate you've gotten yourself a front row seat to a girl trying to give herself second or third degree burns down her throat.
>Despite what you feared, she didn't choke or sputter on the sludge and choked it down without a problem.
>You swear a slight smile of contentment crossed her face, but it could've been nothing more than a trick of the light.
She offers up her credit card and after a moment asks, "Well?"
>It's an embarrassing moment to you to comprehend what she's telling you to do, you accept her card, and head up to the register to pay.
>Returning to her table, you hand her card back and she gets up and leaves without another word.
>As she's the last customer you start closing up once she's out the door.
>Wandering your eyes back to the formerly filled table, you see a dollar bill left on the table and a noticeable lack of the latte.
>Your eyes flicker to the door and you surreptitiously check the trash can to find that there wasn't a full cup of coffee on top of the pile.
>Hopefully she enjoys the latte, she needs a bit more sweetness in her life.

>It's dangerous to go into the sewers
>Not because it's old or falling apart, nothing like that
>Nor does it have any of the hard grime like in sewer systems in the older cities
>No, it's the rats
>Absolutely huge one's that could go toe-to-tail with a grizzly and win, probably
>Not that they'd harm a hair on the heads of any humans that went down there
>Far from it, they'd do everything in their power to protect the comparitively small humans
>From anything or anyone
>Including other rats
>Tales were still being told by older embers of the various utility companies of the times they HAD to go down there, be it a busted pipe or wire
>Damage that almost looked recent, by the look of it
>And then the lights would go out
>And then they's hear it, the sound of a hundreds paws or more scrabbling on wet concrete and metal, overlaid by a chorus of feminine shrieks and the glow of red eyes
>And then all they saw was a sea of fur in various shades, brown, black, gray, even white once in awhile
>First the fighting, as soon as each man was seperated, groups or "gangs" of rats formed, forming a wall of fur and muscle with the (un)lucky man in the exact center
>If one "gang" was low in number, then it was entirely likely, after a rather feral fight, that their human captive might be captured and join their fellow in the center, the losing "gang" being driven away into the tunnels
>Then came the mating
>Fast, Hard, Wet
>These are the words most commonly describing the sensation of being the center of attention of what amounts to a rat orgy of near-feral proportions
>For untold hours, these men would be forced to fuck, fuck and fuck some more, unleashing again and again as each member of the respective rat "gang" rode them to climax, sometimes several at a time.
>Dick, face, tongue, hands, feet even, it didn't matter, they had them, they used them.

>One interviewee, several months before having been involved in a similar incident, and subsequently escaped through a street-level sewer drain, shared some of the photographs taken at the time of his recovery, that of such frequency was the fingering he delivered, combined with the large amount of resulting fem-cum, that his fingers, and to a lesser extent, his toes, had become severely pruned.
>Following this incident, and the recovery of the entire work crew, extremely exhausted but unharmed a few hours later, a new program was implemented, for the sake of safety of the underground population of the city, and for keeping the utilities in fully functioning order...
The lights in the meeting room slowly grew back to normal brightness as the narration ended, and a single man stood, dressed in a bright yellow utilities jumpsuit, outlined by the light of the projector on the screen behind him.
"Gentleman", he said, before the room full of volunteers. "Before we get to work, as your new supervisor, I want to personally thank you for volunteering for this position in our company".
"I want you all to know, while it may not be like your regular work, you, as representatives of Fulson Utilities, will nonetheless be contributing greatly to not only the welfare of Walker City as a whole, but by providing a necessary service to an otherwise invisible portion of the Walker City population that results in their continued well-being and safety."
"Now then", he said, picking up a stack of papers."Once you sign these non-disclosure agreements, you will proceed down the the hall to locker room 3, there you will proceed to dress in your work attire" "Don't bother writing your names on them or otherwise marking them, they won't be needed, and will be promptly discarded once you start your "shift".
"And one more thing", he said as several turned to enter the hallway, his passive face turning into a smirk.
"Don't run, the girls love a good chase"

>on the icy moon of Europa was where the house of salvation made refuge
>their leader, eremis, told of a new power, given by the darkness
>with it, they could fight back on equal footing
>but a guardian went to stop it
>unfortunately this guardian was fresh, with no experience in dealing with stasis
>soon enough, he was nearly frozen by the icy powers, but eremis had other plans
>”so, you are the one the false machine sends to stop us?” She questions
>the guardian stays quiet, any guardian worth their salt knows to keep quiet when enemies are close
“Not Speaking are you? Don’t worry, I’m not here for questioning” eremis says in a brooding voice
>”I want to see you break, but I don’t want you to die.” She says
>before he knew it, eremis suddenly ripped of the crotch part of his trousers
>”but I have other ways of breaking you” eremis retorted
>soon she began to fondle the guardians nether region
>”they feel very heavy, don’t have much time for yourself, don’t you?”
>before the guardian could make a peep, eremis had put the guardians member inter her mouth, and despise the odd feeling, it was heavenly
>soon he began to buckle, and eremis noticed
>soon she took his member out her mouth, leaving it in the cold air, before beginning to mount onto the guardian
>soon eremis began to ride on the guardian, slow at first, but soon began to speed up
>the guardian meanwhile was simply in bliss, it was wrong, but it felt good
>soon he felt like he was going to release, but before that, eremis began to whisper to his ear
>”you love this don’t you? Yow want to give in to your primal urges, I don’t mind, give in, give me a bastard brood, cum for me, ‘guardian’.”
>soon the guardian shot his load deep within eremis
>”mmhm, nice and deep, I’m sure you’ll give me a big brood, you’ll know in a year or two.”
>”stay with me, and find out.”
>the city “lost” a guardian, but eremis gained a new brood father

Anon has always been a supporter of anthros dominating humans, assigned marriages, etc. can’t wait for his turn, when something happens to someone close to him that puts him on the fence. He wants to submit to a large and in charge anthro, but can’t go through with it due to the hypocrisy of said event. Dodges assignment. Runs from appointments. Finally gets caught and put in special assignment pool for violent and anti-state males (even though he isn’t really violent). Shark lady comes to see the pickings and takes a liking to him. Something something they only allow predator species to pick from the special assignment pool and there’s a conflict he has with them despite being all over it in the past. Shark lady is caring but firm and doesn’t take shit. Shelby is way more patient with her anon but I plan for my shark to be the tough love type. She still loves the guy but doesn’t have the patience that collies do.
