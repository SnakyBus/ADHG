I want nothing more than to have a big beautiful bodacious bountiful bear wife. I want to pump her full of cubs then watch the sun set over a scenic forest, the bump on her belly growing alongside the pride in my chest I feel every time I gaze upon her fecund form. When I put the finishing touches on the cabin we'll call it home, a safe but comforting speck of paradise hidden amongst the vast untouched nature that surrounds us. As we watch our cubs grow and mature she will keep a gentle, but firm, paw on their development. They may stumble, and fall, and try our patience, but with a well of unconditional love that proves limitless we'll all make it through the tribulations of child rearing mostly unscathed and a whole lot wiser. There will come a time when the cubs are all grown up, and our joints seem creaky, and the small joys in life seem to be all that's in reach, and she'll feel like passing time just sitting on the front porch counting down the days until she's not around to count them any longer. And you know what? That's fine. Just as long as you're right next to her.

>anthro goddess grabs random human souls when on their way to heaven, fucks them til they're numb and then takes them to her personal corner of the afterlife where they will live in her bliss for the rest of eternity

>gets inironically snu snu’d
>goes through the whole process again now he’s dead

>CRACK!
>"agh.. oops.. you okay mortal?... uh.."
>wheezing anon writhes in agony under her hips, having just been broken in half
>"ahh... d-don't worry! I'll make this quick!"
>Goddess lifts her butt off his hips and slams it down on his head with full force, anon barely knows what hit him.
>Suddenly his eyes shoot open, was it a dream? No...
>Sitting on fluffy clouds, a gorgeous permanent sunset sky above
>Goddess stands before him with a sheepish expression
>"So.. funny thing, you got lucky so you get to go round two with me!"
>"You're already dead so it's not like I can accidentally kill you this time, ready when you are, mortal"
>spend what feels like hours letting the goddess ride you
>being slammed into the clouds by her is probably the best thing you've ever felt. unironically a religious experience.
>once all is said and done you feel exhaustion creeping up on you.
>as you're dozing off she picks you up in a bridal carry. resting your head on her heavenly breasts
>"come on mortal. let's get you home". the last thing you hear before falling asleep
>you wake up in your bed. with your body intact
>huh. was it really a dream?
>you look out the window, the sky is cloudy
>just then the clouds part. the sky is awash with heavenly lights and you see the goddess in the middle of the clouds
>she speaks to you in a booming voice. "good to see my favorite mortal awake. I had a great night, we should meet up again sometime"

>she shoots a lightning bolt at your front yard and disappears into the clouds
>confused, you go to check the spot where the lightning bolt hit

>a new planet begins to grow in her womb
>you're not quite sure how to feel about being partly responsible for birthing a world

>Viper waifur who loves to roleplay cheesy scenes from her "ADVENT Occupation" pornos
>Both of you struggle to keep a straight face staying in-character
>The shit-eating grin you give when she calls you a "disgusting rebel"
>The fanged smirk you see when you call her a "vile beast"
>It never lasts, though
>By the end you're laying there together as you did on your first meeting
>She still teases you about how easy it was to catch you that night
>How eager you were to lay with her in exchange for your life
>Spending the rest of the war "indefinitely detained" in her quarters
>And being here for her now, when she needs you most

>Your workplace went out of business so you have to find a new job.
>Go out searching for anyone who will hire you
>All of the jobs that even pay something near acceptable require a doctorate.
>You have 10 years experience and a bachelor, why the fuck won't they even call back?!
>Your impending existential crisis is averted when you find a job that pays well.
>Suspiciously well at that given the job description.
>Well, if you could call it a job description.
>It's literally just 'Chair, human men only' and then the pay.
>Well that's really descriptive.
>Well fuck, even if it is a scam it's not like you have something else lined up.
>You arrive at an office building.
>It's half a dozen floors tall with the stereotypical shiny windows.
>You walk, greet the receptionist, who was some kind of deer, and tell her your there for a job application.
"What job in particular?"
"Uh, all it said was 'Chair.'"
She gets an odd smirk on her, "Ah, the HR head told me that she's jumping right to the interview. She's in office 236 on the right."
"Thank you."
>Jesus, they're either extremely desperate or going to rob you blind.
>You stand outside the office and check the time, it's 2:29 pm.
>Entering the HR head's office, you see a tigress filling out papers, she tells you to enter but doesn't say a word to you for a few minutes.
"So, why are you here today?"
"I was looking for a job and saw the 'chair' position, but the description was unclear so I wanted some more information."
"Oh? Didn't you check the website?" she inquires with a coy tone.
"I did, but I couldn't find it."
"What a shame. Would you like a hands-on demonstration?"
"What do you mean by that?" you ask tensely.
"You'll have a ten minute trial experience, just so you can get a good grasp."
>Nervous but curious, you agree to the demonstration.
She gets out of her chair and sets a 10 minute timer in front of you, "Just as a show of good faith."
>She pushes her chair off to the side and extends something from the desk.
>She walks over to where you're sitting anxiously and pulls you out of the chair and walks you behind her desk with her hand on your shoulder.
>With a sudden move she sweeps her legs out from under you and places you onto the desk extension.
>It feels like a bed, a thin bed but a bed nevertheless.
The 'pillow' extends vertically on the sides of your head with a hole in them so your ears aren't blocked.
>She sits down and forces your head back into the 'pillow' groove before you can get up or even protest.
>You know that the job description said 'Chair' but you expected to be an Ikea chair assembler or something.
>Not being the chair.
>You attempt to push her off, but she's just too heavy, the only thing she does is release a content growl and wiggle her ass side to side.
>It has the side effect of her getting right where your lips would be touching hers if there wasn't a cloth barrier in the way.
"Ah, those side cushions are nice. Makes it so I don't have to worry about crushing you."
>You attempt to reply but are too muffled under her to make anything intelligible.
"Don't do that!" she states irritably, "...Yet at least. You'd be doing it a lot once you accept the position."
>Your attempts at getting her off your face all end in failure and her huffing contentedly.
>You lay there for a minute, your will to fight being sapped by your sheer inability to push her off.
>She did state that she'd get off you in ten minutes, what time did she start it?
>When last you checked it was 2:31? That means she'll get off you around 2:41 then, hopefully.
>You lay there for a few minutes and begin breathing normally.
>This wasn't what you thought it was going to be, but really what were you expecting for it to have such high pay?
>You untense, there's nothing you can do right now but wait.
>Perhaps this isn't so bad.
>Frankly it could be worse.
>You could not have this whole 'bed' type thing, sitting on the ground with your head at this angle in a chair would be awful.
>Hell even those- what'd she call them- side cushions are nice to have.
>Eventually you hear an alarm ring and she climbs off of you.
>Checking to see if she kept her word, you pull out your phone and check the time.
>It's 2:46.
>5 minutes later than you thought, but you probably spent that talking with her.
>Surprisingly, it seems like she kept her word.
"Will you accept the position or will you need to think about it at home?" she asks and upon seeing your relaxed expression she continues with a grin, "Or will you require another ten minute demonstration?"
>You mull it over in your head for a minute or two, thinking about the pay and such.
>It takes you another minute to decide on the wording of your response.
>She doesn't seem to like how long you're taking and waits impatiently.
You open your mouth to reply, "Another demonstration would help me come to a more, informed decision."
>She sets the timer again, shows it to you, and then makes herself comfortable on your face once more.

>pay a gorgeous deathclaw for a night of company
>she's cheap, but beautiful, and cuddly to boot
>but there's a catch of course
>you rub your eyes, feeling the sun on your bare skin
>you can hear shuffling around
>as you glance around you see the lady of the night tying a tarp around all your stuff and slinging it over her shoulder
>she blows you a kiss before walking off into the wasteland
>you can barely walk after all the incredible things she did to you
>worth it.

>your rabbit friend seems kind of down lately
>trouble with boys you think
>next time you're hanging out, you give her a hug and tell her that you're there for her
>she bursts into tears and buries her head in your chest
>refuses to let go of you until she's soaked your shirt through with tears
>you're not sure how to react
>when she finally lets go she whispers 'I love you'

>this is the story of a girl named buncel
>buncel went to a public high school on a street corner marked 427
>her daily routine was simple,
>she diligently ensured passing C grades in class
>sat alone in a corner at lunch time
>and angrily grumbled at anyone who got too near as she walked home
>this is what buncel did every day, of every month of every year.
>and although many would consider this a self destructive lifestyle, buncel was sure she would luck into the ultimate prize.
>a human for a boyfriend
>and buncel was miserable.

>you will never be smothered under a quarter-ton of big cat
>your entire body will never vibrate as she purrs and gently scratches your head with those sharp, sharp claws

every time i read shelby for some reason it makes me think about a similar plot where anon is dtf but his assigned wife is worried she will lose control and hurt him, even though hes hot for it. he tries to seduce her and tries to make her lose control.
>what are you worried about honey?

>massive court case
>prosecutor thinks anon could be the star witness, gets pushy and tries to guilt trip him to take active involvement in the case

i imagine anthros still rely heavily on scent so if someone leaves their life for long periods of time it would be hard for them to be recognized followed by the anthro freaking out.
>"Hey, it's me! Back from when we were kids and played together!"
>suspicious anthro grabs the guy and shoves her snout into his pants and inhales deep
>then a moment of clarity from the anthro
>"Now I recognize you! It's been forever! Also noticed you're single too~"

>You are Daniel
"Attacking them head on is the stupidest thing we could do."
>and you are in the woods with a bunch of hick tweakers hiding from the Daxy.
>Charles glares at you for a moment before responding.
>"And do what else? Eat away at our food supplies and do nothing? While they pick us off? We should be getting revenge for New York!"
"How, exactly would we do that? We have no military support. The army never showed up here they just let the scales roll into town. We don't have artillery. We don't have air support. We have a handful of deer guns and shitty mall ninja ARs. If you want to run off and get killed or captured by them then you do you. I'm going to survive."
>"Fuckin' coward."
>Charles takes a drag from his cigarette and continues. "There is nothing for us out here. We got almost no food left and it's like every day that someone up and disappears to the fuckin' dinosaurs. I want to go out on my own terms, high as a kite and guns blazing. I've always wanted to kick in the doors of the courthouse with a gun anyways. That's where they're holed up."
>You look around the camp
>All men in various states of physical fitness, most of them not fit for service else they would have been drafted into the continental army.
>All of the women had been carted off by the Daxy as soon as the scales arrived in town almost completely uncontested.
>Some of the men tried to hastily form a militia but it was a worthless endeavor.
>out numbered at least three to one with inferior technology, weapons, communications, and training.
>Running out into the forest was the smartest option, despite it being the middle of winter.
>You sigh and decide to change the subject with Charles.
"James is on patrol now right? Who is he with?"
>"Fuck if I know. I think he left with the kid." Charles is just being petty now.
>You grab a radio and try to hail James and wait for a response. After two more tries with only a crackle of static as a response Charles chimes in bitterly. "Maybe they got him too. We should attack now before numbers dwindle anymore."
>You decide not to respond. There are more pressing matters to attend to anyways.
"I'm gonna go do what a bear does in the woods."
>Charles looks at you like you're an idiot.
>It sounded cooler in you head.
>You grab a roll of toilet paper and head out of the camp.
>On your way out you see Charles packing a glass pipe with what looks like, but is certainly not small crystals of ice.
>You would be more confident in you chances of survival if these guys were not all constantly drinking or getting high.
>you've been out here over a week, how do they still have a supply?
>Snow crunches underfoot but otherwise the woods are quiet. You find a spot behind a tree and do your business.
>As you are cleaning up you hear several muted pops from the direction of the camp.
>Did someone start shooting?
>You run back but as you approach the camp a billow of smoke wafts towards you.
>It smells faintly of bitter citrus. You don't know what it is and you don't want to be breathing it in but you need to get to camp.
>You turn and run perpendicular to the cloud's direction but something is wrong. You feel sluggish and the cold that was nipping your face before is notably absent.
>As you keep moving past the cloud it begins to dissipate so you turn again to head closer to the camp.
>By this point you feel sleepy and disjointed.
>You have to slow down so as to not trip on the uneven soil.
>You push drunkenly through the undergrowth and trip while trying to push between some bushes.
>You can see the camp from your place on the ground covered by the foliage.
>several canisters are embedded in the earth with small wisps of gas still escaping them
>everyone is laid out on the ground. Some are unresponsive, some are groaning like they're in the middle of receiving an expert massage. One guy was unlucky enough to be near the impact point of a gas canister. He is curled up holding tightly to his calf as blood seeps between his fingers but his sedation is overpowering the pain.
>Whatever that gas was, they took a full dose. You're the only one that can still move
>You still have enough of your faculties about you to call James and tell him not to return but as your fumble for the radio you see across the camp a squad of a half dozen daxy emerge from the treeline.
>They are all armored in navy blue kit aside from the one leading them who wears all black with thick gold accenting.
>She has James in tow with a claw around his neck and behind them another daxy has a teenager in tow.
>She is too far away to be heard but she leans down to coo something sweet to him.
>Bizarrely he seems to try to rub up against her like a cat looking for attention.
>The kid just looks scared. His attention split between James' unusual behavior and the camp full of laid out men.
>You do your best to stay quiet and sink into the bush. You didn't carry your rifle with you into the woods but its not like it would have helped at all against a half dozen daxy.
>The daxy stream in to the camp and start searching tents until one finds the man clutching his leg.
>"Male harmed! Salis get over here, bring the kit!"
>Two of the daxy rush over and begin caring for him. One tears off the leg of his pants with her daunting claws while the other begins preparing antiseptic swabs and gauze for clotting the wound.
>One of them starts saying soothing things to him about his safety and happiness but your attention is cut short by the swift sound of a zipper being tugged
>Charles steps out of a yet unchecked tent wearing a gas mask and levels a shotgun at the nearest daxy who happens to be the gold fringed apparent leader.
>She sees him and throws James away from the immediate danger just as Charles catches her in the leg with a slug.
>He's jittery as he tries to rack the shotgun for a second shot and manages to catch the spent shell in the ejection port.
>At the same time the wounded daxy draws a pistol from her side and puts a round in Charles' gut.
>He falls on his back and you see a large syringe with a plume for a tail sticking out of his belly.
>He went out the way he wanted to.
>It amounted to even less than you expected from his plans.
>He tries to lift the gun again but he treats it like it's a hundred pounds heavier. Before he can do anything else the wounded leader and another daxy are upon him, pulling the gun away and holding him down against his insignificant drug suppressed fight for a moment until he loses consciousness.
>Whatever was in that syringe was strong stuff to cut through the meth he was smoking when you left.
>At least they didn't kill him.
>The leader daxy stands up and holds he thigh with a groan.
>James crawls over to the daxy that had just thrown him away a moment ago. "Tassis are you alright? You're bleeding! He hurt you!"
>He tries to grab on to her but she leans down to him with a grimace and holds him at arm's length by his shoulders. "I've had worse, don't you worry about me."
>Its creepy how sweet she is to him.
>She motions to another daxy to take care of him. The daxy pulls him away despite his protests.
>Its even creepier that he's like a blithering pet to her.
>Tassis stands with another grunt and checks over her leg. "Salis I know males are important but you better leave enough supplies in that kit for me."
>Salis finishes tying off a bandage and stands up with the pack. "One of the plates from the pheromone mortar broke off from the impact and embedded in his leg. It's not life threatening and he'll be up and walking in time for our mating ceremony."
>Tassis raises an eyebrow at her. "'Our'? You already laying claim to him?"
>"I touched him first. Doesn't that mean he's mine by right?"
>The medic removes Tassis' thigh armor and inspects the wound. "No penetration from the slug. It looks like your armor shattered and some of it's in your leg. We'll need to get back to base to get it all out of you."
>Tassis hisses through her teeth as Salis injects something into the wound area and begins applying a bandage. "At least wait for the commander to sign off on your mate before you start talking like that. We're calling a transport ship in, I really don't want to walk all the way back to base like this and we shouldn't stress the males anymore."
>A daxy who is bridal carrying a man who is more than willing to cuddle her pipes up from across the camp. "So I got time to take my new mate for a spin?"
>Tassis deadpans. "You really want to take your armor off in this weather?"
>The daxy falters. She looks at the man trying to bury his head in the crook of her neck then at a tent for a moment. "Shit, yer right."
>"You should be looting the camp for more than just a mate anyway." Tassis presses a button on her helmet and calls in for transport as the daxy continue to clean out the camp of any supplies they deem valuable.
>Charles begins to stir from his unconscious state.

>While documenting leopard seals in Antarctica for a 2006 National Geographic magazine story, photographer Paul Nicklen had an experience that he says "will stay with me forever"
>"Leopard seals are the most incredible animals I've ever had the pleasure of photographing," he said. "When you get in the water with a wild animal, you're essentially giving yourself to that animal because, as humans, we're quite helpless and vulnerable in the water. You're at the seal's mercy. You're at the predator's mercy.
>"Not only did the leopard seals not attack as some predicted they would, they fed me penguins, followed me around, and generally put on a nonstop show."
>In the video above, Nicklen explained how an encounter with one particular female leopard seal was especially poignant. The animal had a head larger than a grizzly bear's, and it took his camera and his head into its mouth. But instead of harming him, the seal began to "nurture" him. It began to bring him penguins, first alive, then dead, perhaps assuming that he was a "useless predator in her ocean."
>The top predator apparently tried to feed the weaker Nicklen for four days as he scuba dived in the area, working on the assignment.

I’m glad this new show called Deltarune didn’t make the human boy as the main love interests and plot between these two anthro girls! It’s nice to see a human male being treated as a character and not be used as a female gaze for fan service and be more than just some boy. Glad they didn’t try giving him a shirt that expose their shoulders. That’s the most sexualized design on a human male. Best of all, they remain friends and refuse to do the typical “Anthro girls competing for humie boi’s heart” trope that plagues the entire mainstream entertainment!

Actually, speaking of horror movies there'd be even more genres to play into different species. Prey species horror movies would usually have pred anthros has the villains/monsters. Pred species horror movies might have an even bigger predator as the villain or having it focus more on the humie boys being danger.

Was just struck with such a beautiful epiphany because of this post:
>Greenland Shark banshee, over a thousand years old
>a prolific and almost quasi-mythical serial killer and harvester of men, she has stalked the coast inland of Western Iceland since the days of the island's first major settlement, and by the whispers of century-old tales told by the Norse who landed previously, much longer
>completely blind, her eyes have long since whitened over with an almost imperceptible sky-blue iris, parasites are embedded in and flagellating about on the eyeballs in various spots, starved for water, some already hanging limp, like distended lashes that flick and whip as she turns them
>normally rigid in the water, she drifts several meters below off-shore beneath the tide in a torpor state
>can "taste" the blood of living things from over a kilometer way, and as such, her infamy and such stories have found that any man who recklessly wanders the coasts at night seldom return
>her hunt is unerring and supernatural, the shark's body first finds itself "drawn" towards the man's closest point at the shore, where she is beached for a moment before hunching forward, standing and shadowing the victim(s) with a vague gait that embellishes her head and torso, as they lock forward in such a way that she would be severely straining any abdominal organs, as though one were really and truly puking up their guts
>is known to bury herself within the beaches, a practice which is said to have inspired the Greenlandic tradition of curing regular greenland shark meat before letting it hang out to ferment, sickening, half-rotten digits vibrating unnaturally through the sand to grab at one's vulnerable point, eliciting as little activity as possible
>due to her reliance on conserving as much energy as possible, most of her tactics revolve around hiding in plain sight, the only for sure tell being that unmistakable scent any true Icelander would know, the acrid stench of hákarl

>anthro who asks her humie bf if he would like to try something "kinky" in bed
>the human agrees
>she starts off with rather light stuff. some scratches and maybe light biting
>all is going well but then she accidentally gives him a severe injury. maybe she accidentally bit his neck too hard or something like that.
>she's angry at herself as she feels like she betrayed her bf's trust.
>tries to make it up to him the next day

anthros who want to give you a claiming bite but wait for your consent first.

That reminds me of something.
Let me tell you all about the disappointment of Frozen Homes.

>Probably shouldn't have taken that doll
>Finally mustered the courage to explore that run down building you'd stared at for years
>Once you were inside, it practically called to you
>Now it just stares at you, no matter where you put it or what angle you turn it
>You never see it move but its always looking at you

>Amateur paranormal hunter
>Haven't managed to find anything paranormal yet but I know they are stalking the night.
>Investigate abandoned Japanese-themed restaurant due to reports of spooky noises coming from inside at night.
>Restaurant is mostly empty besides the group cat doll thing that just seems to stare at you.
>You take it home it eventually reveals it is alive and has imprinted on you.
>After draining your balls it vows to be your wife and desires to help you in your crusade against the paranormal.

>Even since you took that doll home, you've been having nightmares.
>Dreams of blood and gore.
>Falling to death.
>Drowning, the fluid you drown in changes sometimes, there was once where it was beer.
>Another was honey.
>There was also that odd non-water water.
>You thought about tossing it out.
>And you did.
>But after a single night of dreamless sleep, you awoke to find it in your living room.
>That night you had the longest and worse nightmares of your life
>You attempted to destroy it with a hammer and you shattered it to pieces and were rewarded with a pleasant night of rest.
>The next day it was back again and whole.
>It seemed to give off a smug, or perhaps amused, feeling, despite its expression not changing.
>Yet again, you had a nightmare.
>This time of you being vivisected and your bones being methodically broken with a hammer.
>You try everything you can think of but the result is still the same.
>It comes back smugly and takes revenge on your attacks.
>Even putting it back from where you took it didn't work.
>At wits end, you give up trying to destroy it.
>Nothing you've attempted has worked.
>As all modern men do when they want to drown out their sorrows, you surf the internet.
>Going to shady sites, you see an advertisement for sex dolls and body pillows.
>Both of which give you ideas in your post-nut clarity.
>You go into the living room and think aloud.
"The nightmares get worse whenever I try to get rid of it..."
>You feel the amusement and smugness oozing off the doll.
"...Maybe if I bring it closer the nightmares will lessen."
>The smugness abates for curiosity.
>You walk over and scoop up the doll, you can feel it try and resist you moving it, but it cannot stop you.
>You carry it over to your bedroom and place on your bed.
>You get under the covers as the doll remains above them.
>The nightmare bit of your sleep seems to have been delayed, but it was outlandishly realistic and brutal.
>You move seems to have caught the doll off-guard, you'll have to go with a more intense strategy.
>The next night, instead of having it on top of the cover, you have it under the cover and spoon with it.
>That really catches it off guard if your nightmares are anything to go by.
>They had the late start of the previous night, but seemed... less real.
>It's actually kind of nice.
>It feels more like a first-person movie than a torture session.
>Waking up you do your subconscious stretching and roll your hips forward.
>Then promptly realize that you were hotdogging her with your morning wood.
>She seems a bit flustered, she's likely never received any treatment like this before being a cursed doll and all.
>...Wait, 'her'? 'She'?
>...Eh, given what you were doing you think she's probably earned being called a she instead of an it.
>You continue spooning her nightly for the next few days and the nightmares keep lessening in intensity and frequency until you have a night where you aren't getting them anymore.
>Perhaps it's linked to your grinding against her as you sleep.
>You've woken up a couple of times because you felt your orgasm building in your sleep because of your passive rubbing.
>About a week or two later, you'd had an odd dream.
>It was the first wet dream you'd had since you were... a teenage.
>Given the dream stuff the doll has done, you chalked it up to it being her doing.
>Still you took it as a sign and started dressing her down before bed.
>Also dressing her when you woke up, because why the hell not? You can't dress her down if she's not clothed.
>You joined her in nudity as well, just for that extra bit of sensation.
>Also to not get cum on your clothes and have it dry, that's a bit of a pain to get out.
>Naturally, you begin having wet dreams nearly every night, sometimes multiple times if you woke up.
>The general theme is that you're tied or otherwise locked down as something rides you.
>Some of them look pretty horrifying, or at least they might've been if she hadn't given you weeks of nightmares to desensitize you.
>She seems unable to resist adding in pain, in the lewd dreams she sometimes makes you experience the sensation of your hip getting broken repeatedly.
>Again, you have to thank her for the torture as it gave you the ability to bypass that dream pain.
>One night as you're getting the both of you ready for bed, you notice that she's had changes made to her previously featureless bumps.
>A set of nipples and a pussy.
>If she's going to provide such a tempting offer, do you have any option to not take her up on it?
>Naturally, you probe her pussy with your fingers, both to act as foreplay and to check for traps or anything.
>You don't feel any spikes and she's not getting any wetter so you line yourself up.
>You take it slow for a bit, more for your own benefit as you want to enjoy this.
>It feels much like you'd expect, except a little warmer and slightly lubed.
>When you do cum, you catch a glimmer in her eyes but it's gone before you can place it.
>You lay down on top of her and pass into the realm of dreams.
>The first thing you note upon entering the dream is the heavy weight on your hips.
>Looking up, you see the doll sitting atop you.
>Meeting your gaze, she shifts from a sitting position into more a looming one with her hands pinning your shoulders.
>You give a couple of testing struggles and find her grip to yield as much as concrete.
>Her face looks down upon you with possessiveness and a set of predatory eyes.
>She stares you down for at least a minute or two, rolling her hips as to prevent you from forgetting what your position is.
>She eventually starts pummeling you into the ground and you feel the illusionary feel of your pelvis cracking under her.
>You've had enough experience with that trick that it doesn't phase you anymore.
>What does catch you off guard is her not stopping after pulling an orgasm out of you.
>She simply continues on, well aware of your overstimulation.
>And she does it again.
>And again.
>And yet again.
>It isn't until your tenth that she finally stops and leans down to whisper her first words to you:
"Mine."
>You awake.
>This time with the seed of nearly a dozen rounds seeping out of the doll.
>You start cleaning her and the bed up, much to her amusement.
>Well, this is certainly better than the nightmares she gave you before.
>You can live with this as part of your routine from now on.

>I’ll never be bought off the black market by a rich queen bee to be her private sex slave
>She’ll never make me her 24/7 dickthrone as a power play, so any other queens visiting for negotiations have to see her tits bounce as she rides.
>She’ll never let the royal guard gangrape me on days she has to be at a different hive

Imagine getting seduced by a colony/hive forming anthro and before you know it your surrounded by a countries worth of daughters and they wont let you leave.

A colony built a hive around you while you slept after having sex with the queen?

don't worry she will take good care of you
you'll of course be living with her and sleeping right next to her since she only has 1 bedroom

Food and lodging cost extra. You can take on extra duties to cover the cost.

>Insists on rubbing her entire body over your face and neck before you go outside to make sure none of those giant hussies try to claim her man, despite this her scent is still barely noticeable and you have to turn away anthros that think you're unclaimed, often having to resort to showing them her little red "claiming bites" she leaves on your neck to prove that you're with someone

Cats lend themselves to a dominant nature, and make Ideal assigned wives

Do you think Canines and felines wouldn't like each other?

Absolutely
>Canines see felines as pretentious, lazy, entitled, selfish, whorish, sneaky, and extravagant
>Felines see canines as annoying, loud, clingy, dirty, unsophisticated, brutish, stupid, and ugly

>she's so big and scary
>think she's dragging you off to eat you
>gets you into her den and starts taking all your freezing, soaked clothes off
>here comes the death
>you can't do much to fight back, you're a half dead shivering wreck
>then she embraces you
>She's so warm and soft
>you let out an involuntary moan as the heat returns to your body
>she starts licking your face while a low growl rumbles through her
>one of her big paws squeezes your ass
>you gulp
>at least she isn't going to eat you

>some anthro keeps stealing my dirty clothes when I shower
>go to the police
>bunny cop at the front desk asks for proof
>show them the hair the thief leaves behind
>says its not enough to go off of
They're probably probably because their fur is the same color, but I'll catch that thief one day!

>Be human adventurer.
>Constantly lose to bigger female monsters.
>Get snu snu'd constantly.
>Consider becoming a prostitute instead

Nah just become a monster tamer/Bard find monsters willing to fight for you.

On that note, I like the idea of (you) being a summoner and accidentally summoning an anthro who wants to fuck you.
>Be anon, human studying to be a mage
>Final exam comes where you're required to summon a monster to serve you.
>You need to pass this exam to actually graduate so it is do or die.
>Everyone keeps summoning fantastic beasts that listen to their every command.
>Your turn eventually comes and you can feel all the eyes on you.
>You begin the ritual and the largest, nasty shewolf you've ever seen pops out of the summoning circle.
>You try to command her but she won't respond to any of them.
>Things like, "I'm your master beast".
>The wolf gives you a smug smile and tells you, "This is a contract that we'll have to negotiate. I refuse to do your bidding without proper compensation"
"Compensation?"
>She walks over to you and takes a huge sniff on top of your head.
>The shewolf continues, "Your virginity, offer it to me and I will do a task for you."
>It was stated loudly enough everyone is laughing.
>You're going to have to accept if you want to pass the class

> Only been a few years since humanity discovered basic FTL travel and has begun exploring surrounding star systems
> You are among the survey team that very unexpectedly makes first contact with the Fenrisians
> Despite none of you being trained for this, it goes amazingly well, the all-female crew of Fenrisians is a bit reserved, but tremendously welcoming all the same
> They treat you a lot like precocious children
> Given their comparative tech level and physiques, it's not entirely unwarranted
> As the awkwardness begins to fade, they start smiling a lot more, patting humans on the head, that sort of thing
> Maybe not entirely respectful, but clearly affectionate
> Several months pass and formal diplomatic relations are opened
> As part of the initial First Contact team you are included, more as a formality than anything else
> Eventually you are invited to a tour of their home planet, which you accept
> En route aboard their ship, the crew get increasingly familiar, almost cooing at you quite often
> Evidently humans are absolutely adorable to them
> They really seem to enjoy picking you up or otherwise showing off their strength
> Sometimes seem a little.... flushed when they do it
> You're just projecting
> .... You are.... right?
> Fenris is far enough away that it takes a couple of weeks to reach even with their FTL drives
> One of your assigned guards comes to you one day and informs you with a very sour look on her face that due to a logistical screwup they will have to make a brief stop at a neutral refueling station along the way
> You assure her you don't mind, and even beg her for permission to disembark and look around during the stop
> Officially humanity hasn't been introduced to any other races yet, but you're feeling adventurous
> Your guard looks like she's just eaten a raw lemon
> But despite how they treat you like a kid, they've yet to actually refuse any of your requests
> You go aboard the station under the close watch of four Fenrisian bodyguards
> It's an uneventful as your first stop at an alien gas station can be, for the most part
> You do get a lot of odd looks but that's not exactly unexpected
> The Fenrisians seem pretty uncomfortable with you being exposed like this, but since they're bodyguards and you're technically a diplomat that's not exactly unexpected either
> You're almost back to the ship when it goes wrong
> Apparently the one angle your guards didn't think to watch, was straight up
> You jump in startled fright as the bat-like anthro lands only inches away from you, but don't make it too far before she grabs you tightly and pulls you against herself
> All four Fenrisians immediately fall into clear attack stances, but hesitate with you directly in the way
> You know enough of their language at this point to understand the murderously growled command to let you go on the authority of the Fenrisian Empire
> The bat gives off an amused laugh and responds in a language you don't understand, but sounding unimpressed
> The leader of your detail steps forward and says something you have a harder time parsing, something about diplomat status and...
> Uh... you're not sure, actually
> You think you made out the root-sounds for the words.... 'guard' and 'race?' And...
> ... 'Love?'
> At that the bat's grin slackens
> A couple of uneasy seconds of silence later, she lets you go and you are RUSHED by two of your guards, one of whom physically picks you up and starts carrying you off back to the ship
> Just barely, as you lose sight of the bat and your remaining two guards around a corner, you hear something you manage to understand a bit more clearly
> The translation is a bit crude, but in English you suppose it'd be something like 'spread the word'
> Just as soon as you've parsed that, you hear the *SLAM* sound of something hitting the wall very hard
> You feel a hand gently turn your chin away from where you'd been craning to hear the voices behind you
> The guard carrying you smiles down gently, and tells you not to worry about any of that
> You're in very good hands

>Anthrostate assigns you a bear commissar as a wife named Alina
>Get a fancy dress uniform lined with medals for who knows what, officers cap, polished leather shoes, etc. all for free in the assignment center
>Turns out your job is to follow Alina around as she does inspections of local communities making sure that silly humans don't try to run from their furry guardians, that anthrostate propaganda is proudly displayed in all public areas, and keeping unwanted foreign influences from polluting the minds of anthrostate citizens
>You take your job very seriously helping to convince your fellow humans of the inherent superiority of the anthrostate and giving loud impassioned speeches about the benevolency of our furred superiors, often citing experiences with your wife as examples
>She doesn't smile much, but when you give your speeches she's always in the back of the crowd where she thinks you can't see her, a poorly suppressed smile on her maw
>During a routine inspection of a home you find traces of illegal food products smuggled over from the neighboring republic of trashnistria prompting a much larger investigation leading to several arrests of foreign spies
>This act earns you and your favorite she-bear a few new medals, not to mention a spot in a newly built government housing unit!
>Life is good for the next several weeks, more arrests, more speeches, more commendations from your superiors
>After another day hard at work hanging up some new banners at a local market you stop to buy some groceries while she goes back to headquarters to fill out some paperwork
>A paper bag full of food in each hand you make your way back the apartment, get your keys out, open the door and-
>Your consciousness returns painfully
>There's a throbbing pain on your forehead, must have been where someone knocked you out
>You try to stand up only to realize your ankles are tied to the chair you're sitting in and your wrists are tied tightly behind your back
>Your gaze rises and Alina is standing in front of you in her full dress uniform, you seem to be in one of the interrogation rooms deep in the bowels of the state police headquarters
>Beside her are three other commissars, you recognize two of them as a paired human/anthro couple just like you and your wife except the anthro in this case was a lanky arctic fox
>They're lower ranking than you and Alina, not having as made nearly as many arrests or investigations
>The third commissar is your superior officer, a grizzled older wolfess with piercing blue eyes and smoldering cigarette hanging from her mouth
>You look back to Alina
>Her expression is stoic but you detect just the faintest hints of panic behind her eyes
>You try to speak only to find a piece of cloth has been tied around your mouth, muffled half words are the best you can manage
>Noticing you're awake the wolfess hands a paper to your wife
>"Read it to him." She coldly commands
>She takes the paper and begins reading
>"Attention, attention, Commissar Anon Anonov has been accused of the following crimes: illegal storage of prohibited items, conspiracy to commit espionage against state assets, conspiracy to assassinate state representatives, illegal consumption of prohibited literature, and...high treason against the state."
>Her hands begin gripping the paper so tightly her claws puncture it
>"After a period of lawful deliberation the justice department of the state has found Anon Anonov guilty of all crimes. Due to his association with the commissariat punishment shall be determined by his superior officer."
>She looks up to you with shocked expression and the paper drops from her paws
>Your CO shakes her head and spits out her cigarette, grinding it against the cold concrete floor
>"Anonov I had so much faith in you, you were doing so well, then I order a random inspection of your new domicile and I can't believe what they found. Documents linking you to foreign spy networks, illegal weapons, pamphlets encouraging human male and human female pairings, and all these items covered in your fingerprints! It's utterly unthinkable one of my own would do this."
>She turns to Alina
>"Luckily for you everything they found could only be linked to Anon, otherwise you would be in the same position he is. You're a nice girl, never given me or the state any trouble, and for your loyal service I'm willing to classify all of this for your sake. You shouldn’t expect any more promotions in this lifetime but you’ll always have a roof over your head. However, I do have one little favor to ask. Just to make sure you really are on the right side."
>The wolfess takes her pistol out of its holster and turns it around so Alina can take it
>"The Justice department left his punishment up to me and I say this traitor gets the death penalty. One shot to the head to be administered by you. Keep it clean."
>Alina just stares at the pistol for a few moments before hesitantly taking it, pointing it down by her side
>”But Senior Commissar how can we be sure the items the other two found are legitimate? I’ve known Anonov for quite some time and I have no reason to suspect-“
>The white furred vixen cuts her off
>”Do not argue with the senior commissar bear! The evidence me and my husband found is irrefutable!”
>The man beside lovingly rubs the top of her head causing her eyes to go half lidded
>”That’s right honey, irrefutable.”
>Alina stares at the wolfess for guidance
>”What the other two say is right, I inspected everything they found myself.”
>In a split second everything makes sense to you
>The two junior commissars, they planted the evidence against you to try and gain promotions by fucking over their comrades instead doing things the right way like you and Alina
>They probably planned on implicating both of you but since you arrived at the house alone they couldn’t put her fingerprints on anything
>Not that it mattered, your life and Alinas career are over at this point
>You struggle against your bindings with all the strength you can muster while shouting muffled pleas to Alina and the wolfess, desperately trying to get them to do anything other than continue with this insidious plot
>They all watch you struggle, the fox and her husband with smug grins and Alina with a despondent expression
>The wolfess just glares at you silently
>Eventually she’s had enough hesitation from Alina
>”Commissar Alina! Fulfill your duty to the anthrostate and terminate this traitor. Prove your loyalty.”
>”Ya! Do it already she-bear! We’re getting tired of waiting.” The fox’s husband shouts
>”Y-yes senior commissar.” Alina says, her voice on the verge of cracking
>You watch Alina raise the pistol through your tear soaked eyes
>Your muffled cries have devolved into muffled whimpers and with one last impotent struggle against your restraints you give up and remain still
>All you can do is look into Alinas eyes and softly shake your head side to side as she points the muzzle right at your forehead
>The fox and her husband say something but it fades into the background as you choose your last words
>You know she won’t be able to understand you through the gag but you decide to say them anyway
>”Alina, it’s not your fault. I still love you. We’ll meet again in the next life. I know it.”
>Her finger curls around the trigger
>Her grip tightens
>Then she suddenly brings the pistol up to her face
>”Oh, I forgot to take the safety off.”
>”Stupid bear, stop procrastinating and kill him before I have to.” The fox spits
>She flicks a switch on the pistol
>”Okay, safety is off.” She turns to the fox and points the pistol at her. “Why don’t you check it for me?”
>The vixen can only give her a confused look before Alina pulls the trigger twice, shooting her square in the chest
>The fox’s husband tries to get his own pistol out but is shot down before he can even open his holster
>Your superior grabs at her own holster only to realize the bear already has her sidearm
>Instead of shooting her like the others Alina closes the distance between them and gives her a knockout punch right to the head
>She crumples to the ground, blood dribbling out of her nose
>Alina walks in front of you and cuts your gag off with a claw
>She puts two paws on either side of your head and stares into your soul
>”Is what they said true? That you’re a traitor?”
>”No Alina! It’s all bullshit! Those bastards planted the evidence after I came back home.”
>She continues staring at you for several tense seconds before giving you a mighty bear hug and cutting your restraints
>She helps you to your feet
>”So what now? The courts still think I’m a traitor and you just murdered two commissars. We’re totally fucked.”
>”Baby steps Anon. First we need to get out of this building. We’ll make our way to the garage then acquire one of the police cruisers. With a full tank of gas we should be able to make it to the border.”
>You shake your head in disbelief
>”The border? And then what? Even if we make it past the last checkpoint no country is going to take in a couple of murderous former commissars from the anthrostate. And there’s no way we’ll blend into the populace for very long.”
>Alina begins methodically looting the bodies on the floor for their pistols, wallets, and spare ammunition
>”We’ll drive to the uninhabited zone then.” She states confidently
>”Nobody lives there Alina. It’s all just wilderness, we’ll die of starvation or get eaten by wild animals.”
>”Better than getting sent to the gulag mining rocks for the rest of our lives.”
>Well, she has a point
>”Okay fine, we’ll steal a cruiser then make a run for the uninhabited zone. But how the hell are we getting to the garage?”
>”I’m doing a prisoner transport on the orders of the senior commissar and you’re the prisoner. If anyone asks I’ll just show them the paper with your conviction.”
>You snatch the paper off the ground and present it to her
>”Good idea, but what’s the plan if they don’t believe you?”
>She retrieves the paper and hands you a couple of pistols
>”We’ll each have two pistols with plenty of ammunition. Enough to put up a decent fight as we dash to the garage.”
>She strips a bullet from a spare magazine and hands it to you
>”But keep one for yourself, just in case we don’t”
>You stare at the shiny piece of metal in your hand before closing it in your fist
>”Alina, either I’m making it to the garage with you or not at all.”
>She places a paw gently on your shoulder
>”Same my dearest Anon, same.”
>After both of you gather your nerves and fix your uniforms you stand by the door leading out of the interrogation room, and open it

Just gonna get this out of my system.
>You were absolutely against the current situation.
>Tall, lanky, with milk-white scales and blood-red eyes, the snake woman peered down at you from the doorway.
>Her eyes looked past you to your one-bedroom apartment while you read the letter she passed you for the umpteenth time in five minutes
>"Anon. I'm sending over a co-worker to stay with you for a couple of days. She's been relocated to your city, but her apartment has an infestation and is being fumigated. Letting her borrow your couch is cheaper than a hotel, so please show some kindness. ---Dad"
>"P.S. I know how you feel about anthros, but try to man up for a couple of days."
>You really hated when he did shit like this...
>"Sso, as you can see, your father has given the okay. I promise I won't be a bother."
>You want to close the door and wash your hands of this, but you already know you'll be getting an earful from the old man if you did
>Also, you guess, it'd be kind of a dick move
>Crumpling the note and tossing it in the bin, you step aside and let the beanpole into your home
>"You won't regret this." she says as she ducks under the doorframe, a set of bags rolling behind her
>The rest of the afternoon was fairly uneventful. You gave your sudden roommate the tour of the place, let her know about your early wakeup times, and told her about what foods not to touch in the fridge
>To her credit, she seemed to absorb everything, nodding along with your explanations and respecting the boundaries you set up
>When all was said and done, you settled back down and resumed your zombified movie watching
>At some point you heard the shower start, and felt satisfied that she was doing her own thing
>Nearly an hour later she...was still in the shower
>You would be concerned, but you can hear her off-key singing from here
>Fuck it, you need sleep and no amount of weird snake lady singing is going to stop you
>You give one last look towards the bathroom door, then retire
>That night, your dreams took on a strange tone
>You were being dragged off to some pyramid by guards and mummified
>All the while some cat they worshiped danced in the background to the music a camel was playing past the smoke of his cigarette
>You were going to die
>You were so cold...
>You woke up, but a scaly hand covered your mouth and scream
>"Sssh." hissed a voice in your ear, making your skin prickle
>Something tightened around your legs
>"Just let me sleep here. Where it's warm."
>Who the hell...oh
>Oh god it's the snake!
>Your eyes adjusted to the darkness, and a white form could be seen moving around your
>And sure enough, the ruby orb of her eye watched you from the side as something wrapped around your legs
>You would guess it's HER legs but that amount of flexibility wasn't normal, right?
>Every breath brought her body closer to yours, pressed her form closer to yours and stopped your struggling a little bit more
>You wanted to shout, to tell her to fuck off, but that hand stayed tight
>She was WAY stronger than her wiry frame had implied
>"Just relax. I won't bite." she paused, and added, "Not unless you want me to."
>Maybe it was the tone of her voice, maybe it was the way she pressed against you. Maybe it was even the adrenaline going to the entirely WRONG part of your body
>But the one part of you that wasn't being constricted sprung free from your boxers in defiance
>You would hope that she didn't notice during her molestation, but her chuckles let you know otherwise
>A cold finger grazed against you, stealing away the heat but doing nothing to remove its rigidity
>More followed, coiling around you there as well
>You felt your face flush, only for that heat to be wicked away by her other hand as she turned your face to hers
>"Your father warned me that you were...opposed, to nonhumans. That you'd slam the door in my face."
>Her neck coiled around behind yours, head resting on your other shoulder
>"Perhaps he was wrong."
>You looked down to your traitorous erection
>She did as well, touching as your arousal leaked out
>Slow and nimble fingers spread it around, gliding further and further down as they slicked the scales and skin
>Your breath came out in a shudder, and you felt her laugh vibrate through you
>"Should I keep going?"
>NO! She should absolutely not! She should let you go and go back to the couch before she gets kicked out and has to return to that gas chamber of an apartment
>Is what you wanted to say. Instead you nodded, much to your own surprise
>That devilish tongue flicked your ear, sending a shock through your head
>By then, you'd been completely lubed up from the fluids of your own making
>The hand gripped your head, just enough pressure to be felt without being painful
>The descent down was tortuously slow
>You couldn't control your breathing as she watched your reaction from her perch on your shoulder
>You had to bite your lip to keep from groaning from this attention
>All the while she whispered things into your ear
>Terrible things and vulgar praises
>Each second felt like hours as she claimed your manhood for herself
>At some point her fingers started to constrict, milking you in steady wave against
>By the time her palm made contact with your groin, your hips moved what little they could to meet it
>You were shamefully clo-
>"Let me stay for the month."
>What?
>"You can have more of this, if you do."
>Is she REALLY-
>Her fingers reached down to massage your testes
>This time you couldn't suppress it, groaning in defeat
>"You could feel so much better."
>The milking intensified
>"You could indulge in this...shameful act."
>...
>"It doesn't count if you're forced, right?"
>...you guess...
>"You have no way of controlling this, right?"
>Yeah. Yeah, you were completely overwhelmed..."
>"So you should let me stay. That I can't blackmail you."
>...guess you don't have a choice
>She chuckles again
>"Good boy. Forbidden fruit is so sweet, isn't it?"
>You aren't aware of what exactly happened past that point
>Only vague sensations surface in your memories
>You remember claws in your shoulders and legs around your waist, as you tried to push against something impossibly tight and heavy
>You recall sibilant whispers in your ears that promised all sorts of terribly wonderful and wonderfully terrible things
>You kind of remember the feelings of fangs in your neck, mind reeling with the idea of someone seeing your "mark" as you go about your day
>You can still feel the shape of a forked tongue against yours, while your moans were muffled by infinite white
>The visage of two red orbs bobbing above your crotch, and two white hands holding yours down is especially prominent
>But most of all, the thing that you couldn't forget if you tried, was the morning after
>You awoke alone, drenched in sweat, and half hanging out of your bed
>Your entire body ached, and your swear you could taste something weirdly familiar at the back of your throat
>As you stumbled into the living room, your roommate seemed to be snoring peacefully on the couch
>Your memory from last night came flooding back and were summarily pushed back down
>You needed coffee. Strong coffee.
>"Make me a cup too." hissed a voice from behind
>You didn't even hear her move, but the feeling of her head on your shoulder was too familiar
>"You look like hell." she observed, "had a rough night?"
>Of course. She-
>"I slept great, in case your were wondering. Your couch is surprisingly comfortable."
>Wait...
>"You seemed to be talking in your sleep, though."
>Hang on...
>"Whatever you were DREAMING about, it must have been intense."
>You pause mid-pour and make eye contact with your roommate
>"By the way...I might need to stay here a bit longer. Maybe a month, maybe more."
>A scaled hand rest on your other shoulder, thumb tracing over a particularly tender spot
>"You don't mind, right?"
