I want nothing more than to have a big beautiful bodacious bountiful bear wife. I want to pump her full of cubs then watch the sun set over a scenic forest, the bump on her belly growing alongside the pride in my chest I feel every time I gaze upon her fecund form. When I put the finishing touches on the cabin we'll call it home, a safe but comforting speck of paradise hidden amongst the vast untouched nature that surrounds us. As we watch our cubs grow and mature she will keep a gentle, but firm, paw on their development. They may stumble, and fall, and try our patience, but with a well of unconditional love that proves limitless we'll all make it through the tribulations of child rearing mostly unscathed and a whole lot wiser. There will come a time when the cubs are all grown up, and our joints seem creaky, and the small joys in life seem to be all that's in reach, and she'll feel like passing time just sitting on the front porch counting down the days until she's not around to count them any longer. And you know what? That's fine. Just as long as you're right next to her.

>anthro goddess grabs random human souls when on their way to heaven, fucks them til they're numb and then takes them to her personal corner of the afterlife where they will live in her bliss for the rest of eternity

>gets inironically snu snu’d
>goes through the whole process again now he’s dead

>CRACK!
>"agh.. oops.. you okay mortal?... uh.."
>wheezing anon writhes in agony under her hips, having just been broken in half
>"ahh... d-don't worry! I'll make this quick!"
>Goddess lifts her butt off his hips and slams it down on his head with full force, anon barely knows what hit him.
>Suddenly his eyes shoot open, was it a dream? No...
>Sitting on fluffy clouds, a gorgeous permanent sunset sky above
>Goddess stands before him with a sheepish expression
>"So.. funny thing, you got lucky so you get to go round two with me!"
>"You're already dead so it's not like I can accidentally kill you this time, ready when you are, mortal"
>spend what feels like hours letting the goddess ride you
>being slammed into the clouds by her is probably the best thing you've ever felt. unironically a religious experience.
>once all is said and done you feel exhaustion creeping up on you.
>as you're dozing off she picks you up in a bridal carry. resting your head on her heavenly breasts
>"come on mortal. let's get you home". the last thing you hear before falling asleep
>you wake up in your bed. with your body intact
>huh. was it really a dream?
>you look out the window, the sky is cloudy
>just then the clouds part. the sky is awash with heavenly lights and you see the goddess in the middle of the clouds
>she speaks to you in a booming voice. "good to see my favorite mortal awake. I had a great night, we should meet up again sometime"

>she shoots a lightning bolt at your front yard and disappears into the clouds
>confused, you go to check the spot where the lightning bolt hit

>a new planet begins to grow in her womb
>you're not quite sure how to feel about being partly responsible for birthing a world

>Viper waifur who loves to roleplay cheesy scenes from her "ADVENT Occupation" pornos
>Both of you struggle to keep a straight face staying in-character
>The shit-eating grin you give when she calls you a "disgusting rebel"
>The fanged smirk you see when you call her a "vile beast"
>It never lasts, though
>By the end you're laying there together as you did on your first meeting
>She still teases you about how easy it was to catch you that night
>How eager you were to lay with her in exchange for your life
>Spending the rest of the war "indefinitely detained" in her quarters
>And being here for her now, when she needs you most

>Your workplace went out of business so you have to find a new job.
>Go out searching for anyone who will hire you
>All of the jobs that even pay something near acceptable require a doctorate.
>You have 10 years experience and a bachelor, why the fuck won't they even call back?!
>Your impending existential crisis is averted when you find a job that pays well.
>Suspiciously well at that given the job description.
>Well, if you could call it a job description.
>It's literally just 'Chair, human men only' and then the pay.
>Well that's really descriptive.
>Well fuck, even if it is a scam it's not like you have something else lined up.
>You arrive at an office building.
>It's half a dozen floors tall with the stereotypical shiny windows.
>You walk, greet the receptionist, who was some kind of deer, and tell her your there for a job application.
"What job in particular?"
"Uh, all it said was 'Chair.'"
She gets an odd smirk on her, "Ah, the HR head told me that she's jumping right to the interview. She's in office 236 on the right."
"Thank you."
>Jesus, they're either extremely desperate or going to rob you blind.
>You stand outside the office and check the time, it's 2:29 pm.
>Entering the HR head's office, you see a tigress filling out papers, she tells you to enter but doesn't say a word to you for a few minutes.
"So, why are you here today?"
"I was looking for a job and saw the 'chair' position, but the description was unclear so I wanted some more information."
"Oh? Didn't you check the website?" she inquires with a coy tone.
"I did, but I couldn't find it."
"What a shame. Would you like a hands-on demonstration?"
"What do you mean by that?" you ask tensely.
"You'll have a ten minute trial experience, just so you can get a good grasp."
>Nervous but curious, you agree to the demonstration.
She gets out of her chair and sets a 10 minute timer in front of you, "Just as a show of good faith."
>She pushes her chair off to the side and extends something from the desk.
>She walks over to where you're sitting anxiously and pulls you out of the chair and walks you behind her desk with her hand on your shoulder.
>With a sudden move she sweeps her legs out from under you and places you onto the desk extension.
>It feels like a bed, a thin bed but a bed nevertheless.
The 'pillow' extends vertically on the sides of your head with a hole in them so your ears aren't blocked.
>She sits down and forces your head back into the 'pillow' groove before you can get up or even protest.
>You know that the job description said 'Chair' but you expected to be an Ikea chair assembler or something.
>Not being the chair.
>You attempt to push her off, but she's just too heavy, the only thing she does is release a content growl and wiggle her ass side to side.
>It has the side effect of her getting right where your lips would be touching hers if there wasn't a cloth barrier in the way.
"Ah, those side cushions are nice. Makes it so I don't have to worry about crushing you."
>You attempt to reply but are too muffled under her to make anything intelligible.
"Don't do that!" she states irritably, "...Yet at least. You'd be doing it a lot once you accept the position."
>Your attempts at getting her off your face all end in failure and her huffing contentedly.
>You lay there for a minute, your will to fight being sapped by your sheer inability to push her off.
>She did state that she'd get off you in ten minutes, what time did she start it?
>When last you checked it was 2:31? That means she'll get off you around 2:41 then, hopefully.
>You lay there for a few minutes and begin breathing normally.
>This wasn't what you thought it was going to be, but really what were you expecting for it to have such high pay?
>You untense, there's nothing you can do right now but wait.
>Perhaps this isn't so bad.
>Frankly it could be worse.
>You could not have this whole 'bed' type thing, sitting on the ground with your head at this angle in a chair would be awful.
>Hell even those- what'd she call them- side cushions are nice to have.
>Eventually you hear an alarm ring and she climbs off of you.
>Checking to see if she kept her word, you pull out your phone and check the time.
>It's 2:46.
>5 minutes later than you thought, but you probably spent that talking with her.
>Surprisingly, it seems like she kept her word.
"Will you accept the position or will you need to think about it at home?" she asks and upon seeing your relaxed expression she continues with a grin, "Or will you require another ten minute demonstration?"
>You mull it over in your head for a minute or two, thinking about the pay and such.
>It takes you another minute to decide on the wording of your response.
>She doesn't seem to like how long you're taking and waits impatiently.
You open your mouth to reply, "Another demonstration would help me come to a more, informed decision."
>She sets the timer again, shows it to you, and then makes herself comfortable on your face once more.

>pay a gorgeous deathclaw for a night of company
>she's cheap, but beautiful, and cuddly to boot
>but there's a catch of course
>you rub your eyes, feeling the sun on your bare skin
>you can hear shuffling around
>as you glance around you see the lady of the night tying a tarp around all your stuff and slinging it over her shoulder
>she blows you a kiss before walking off into the wasteland
>you can barely walk after all the incredible things she did to you
>worth it.

>your rabbit friend seems kind of down lately
>trouble with boys you think
>next time you're hanging out, you give her a hug and tell her that you're there for her
>she bursts into tears and buries her head in your chest
>refuses to let go of you until she's soaked your shirt through with tears
>you're not sure how to react
>when she finally lets go she whispers 'I love you'

>this is the story of a girl named buncel
>buncel went to a public high school on a street corner marked 427
>her daily routine was simple,
>she diligently ensured passing C grades in class
>sat alone in a corner at lunch time
>and angrily grumbled at anyone who got too near as she walked home
>this is what buncel did every day, of every month of every year.
>and although many would consider this a self destructive lifestyle, buncel was sure she would luck into the ultimate prize.
>a human for a boyfriend
>and buncel was miserable.

>you will never be smothered under a quarter-ton of big cat
>your entire body will never vibrate as she purrs and gently scratches your head with those sharp, sharp claws

every time i read shelby for some reason it makes me think about a similar plot where anon is dtf but his assigned wife is worried she will lose control and hurt him, even though hes hot for it. he tries to seduce her and tries to make her lose control.
>what are you worried about honey?

>massive court case
>prosecutor thinks anon could be the star witness, gets pushy and tries to guilt trip him to take active involvement in the case

i imagine anthros still rely heavily on scent so if someone leaves their life for long periods of time it would be hard for them to be recognized followed by the anthro freaking out.
>"Hey, it's me! Back from when we were kids and played together!"
>suspicious anthro grabs the guy and shoves her snout into his pants and inhales deep
>then a moment of clarity from the anthro
>"Now I recognize you! It's been forever! Also noticed you're single too~"

>You are Daniel
"Attacking them head on is the stupidest thing we could do."
>and you are in the woods with a bunch of hick tweakers hiding from the Daxy.
>Charles glares at you for a moment before responding.
>"And do what else? Eat away at our food supplies and do nothing? While they pick us off? We should be getting revenge for New York!"
"How, exactly would we do that? We have no military support. The army never showed up here they just let the scales roll into town. We don't have artillery. We don't have air support. We have a handful of deer guns and shitty mall ninja ARs. If you want to run off and get killed or captured by them then you do you. I'm going to survive."
>"Fuckin' coward."
>Charles takes a drag from his cigarette and continues. "There is nothing for us out here. We got almost no food left and it's like every day that someone up and disappears to the fuckin' dinosaurs. I want to go out on my own terms, high as a kite and guns blazing. I've always wanted to kick in the doors of the courthouse with a gun anyways. That's where they're holed up."
>You look around the camp
>All men in various states of physical fitness, most of them not fit for service else they would have been drafted into the continental army.
>All of the women had been carted off by the Daxy as soon as the scales arrived in town almost completely uncontested.
>Some of the men tried to hastily form a militia but it was a worthless endeavor.
>out numbered at least three to one with inferior technology, weapons, communications, and training.
>Running out into the forest was the smartest option, despite it being the middle of winter.
>You sigh and decide to change the subject with Charles.
"James is on patrol now right? Who is he with?"
>"Fuck if I know. I think he left with the kid." Charles is just being petty now.
>You grab a radio and try to hail James and wait for a response. After two more tries with only a crackle of static as a response Charles chimes in bitterly. "Maybe they got him too. We should attack now before numbers dwindle anymore."
>You decide not to respond. There are more pressing matters to attend to anyways.
"I'm gonna go do what a bear does in the woods."
>Charles looks at you like you're an idiot.
>It sounded cooler in you head.
>You grab a roll of toilet paper and head out of the camp.
>On your way out you see Charles packing a glass pipe with what looks like, but is certainly not small crystals of ice.
>You would be more confident in you chances of survival if these guys were not all constantly drinking or getting high.
>you've been out here over a week, how do they still have a supply?
>Snow crunches underfoot but otherwise the woods are quiet. You find a spot behind a tree and do your business.
>As you are cleaning up you hear several muted pops from the direction of the camp.
>Did someone start shooting?
>You run back but as you approach the camp a billow of smoke wafts towards you.
>It smells faintly of bitter citrus. You don't know what it is and you don't want to be breathing it in but you need to get to camp.
>You turn and run perpendicular to the cloud's direction but something is wrong. You feel sluggish and the cold that was nipping your face before is notably absent.
>As you keep moving past the cloud it begins to dissipate so you turn again to head closer to the camp.
>By this point you feel sleepy and disjointed.
>You have to slow down so as to not trip on the uneven soil.
>You push drunkenly through the undergrowth and trip while trying to push between some bushes.
>You can see the camp from your place on the ground covered by the foliage.
>several canisters are embedded in the earth with small wisps of gas still escaping them
>everyone is laid out on the ground. Some are unresponsive, some are groaning like they're in the middle of receiving an expert massage. One guy was unlucky enough to be near the impact point of a gas canister. He is curled up holding tightly to his calf as blood seeps between his fingers but his sedation is overpowering the pain.
>Whatever that gas was, they took a full dose. You're the only one that can still move
>You still have enough of your faculties about you to call James and tell him not to return but as your fumble for the radio you see across the camp a squad of a half dozen daxy emerge from the treeline.
>They are all armored in navy blue kit aside from the one leading them who wears all black with thick gold accenting.
>She has James in tow with a claw around his neck and behind them another daxy has a teenager in tow.
>She is too far away to be heard but she leans down to coo something sweet to him.
>Bizarrely he seems to try to rub up against her like a cat looking for attention.
>The kid just looks scared. His attention split between James' unusual behavior and the camp full of laid out men.
>You do your best to stay quiet and sink into the bush. You didn't carry your rifle with you into the woods but its not like it would have helped at all against a half dozen daxy.
>The daxy stream in to the camp and start searching tents until one finds the man clutching his leg.
>"Male harmed! Salis get over here, bring the kit!"
>Two of the daxy rush over and begin caring for him. One tears off the leg of his pants with her daunting claws while the other begins preparing antiseptic swabs and gauze for clotting the wound.
>One of them starts saying soothing things to him about his safety and happiness but your attention is cut short by the swift sound of a zipper being tugged
>Charles steps out of a yet unchecked tent wearing a gas mask and levels a shotgun at the nearest daxy who happens to be the gold fringed apparent leader.
>She sees him and throws James away from the immediate danger just as Charles catches her in the leg with a slug.
>He's jittery as he tries to rack the shotgun for a second shot and manages to catch the spent shell in the ejection port.
>At the same time the wounded daxy draws a pistol from her side and puts a round in Charles' gut.
>He falls on his back and you see a large syringe with a plume for a tail sticking out of his belly.
>He went out the way he wanted to.
>It amounted to even less than you expected from his plans.
>He tries to lift the gun again but he treats it like it's a hundred pounds heavier. Before he can do anything else the wounded leader and another daxy are upon him, pulling the gun away and holding him down against his insignificant drug suppressed fight for a moment until he loses consciousness.
>Whatever was in that syringe was strong stuff to cut through the meth he was smoking when you left.
>At least they didn't kill him.
>The leader daxy stands up and holds he thigh with a groan.
>James crawls over to the daxy that had just thrown him away a moment ago. "Tassis are you alright? You're bleeding! He hurt you!"
>He tries to grab on to her but she leans down to him with a grimace and holds him at arm's length by his shoulders. "I've had worse, don't you worry about me."
>Its creepy how sweet she is to him.
>She motions to another daxy to take care of him. The daxy pulls him away despite his protests.
>Its even creepier that he's like a blithering pet to her.
>Tassis stands with another grunt and checks over her leg. "Salis I know males are important but you better leave enough supplies in that kit for me."
>Salis finishes tying off a bandage and stands up with the pack. "One of the plates from the pheromone mortar broke off from the impact and embedded in his leg. It's not life threatening and he'll be up and walking in time for our mating ceremony."
>Tassis raises an eyebrow at her. "'Our'? You already laying claim to him?"
>"I touched him first. Doesn't that mean he's mine by right?"
>The medic removes Tassis' thigh armor and inspects the wound. "No penetration from the slug. It looks like your armor shattered and some of it's in your leg. We'll need to get back to base to get it all out of you."
>Tassis hisses through her teeth as Salis injects something into the wound area and begins applying a bandage. "At least wait for the commander to sign off on your mate before you start talking like that. We're calling a transport ship in, I really don't want to walk all the way back to base like this and we shouldn't stress the males anymore."
>A daxy who is bridal carrying a man who is more than willing to cuddle her pipes up from across the camp. "So I got time to take my new mate for a spin?"
>Tassis deadpans. "You really want to take your armor off in this weather?"
>The daxy falters. She looks at the man trying to bury his head in the crook of her neck then at a tent for a moment. "Shit, yer right."
>"You should be looting the camp for more than just a mate anyway." Tassis presses a button on her helmet and calls in for transport as the daxy continue to clean out the camp of any supplies they deem valuable.
>Charles begins to stir from his unconscious state.
>He is groaning and seems to act like he's relearning how to use his arms.
>"Th-this is incredible! I've never felt so good! This shit rocks, what did you give me?"
>A daxy that was looking him over for wounds speaks to him in a motherly tone. "That's pheromones, baby. With this stuff you'll never want to fight again."
>"You're right, I'm sorry! I'll get more right?"
>He grabs at her and tries to hold himself closer.
>Her tone turns raunchy. "Honey I'll give you all you want back at base."
>Whatever happened to the other men nearly happened to you.
>You try to imagine the pheromones as a poison in your body. You wish you felt sick but instead you feel warm. You feel as if you're hugging someone important that you've been missing. You know that the effects of their weapons should be disgusting but you cant muster up any negativity.
>A small piece of you wishes it was you being coddled by one of the daxy right now.
>A few minutes later a ship descends and makes no effort to avoid crushing two tents under its belly as it lands.
>The men, still docile from the gas are herded or carried onto the transport.
>You wait in the bushes until you can't hear the engines of the transport ship anymore.
>In your pheromone suppressed state you decide to wait a little longer.
>Eventually you wake up feeling far colder than you were when you accidentally fell asleep.
>No more feelings of warm hugs or safety. You are left freezing and alone.
>You curse yourself as you pick over whats left of the camp.
>it's already far past midday.
>Plenty of rations and canned food
>A deer gun for when the food starts getting low
>You select the best tent and pack it up.
>By the time you're set to leave the camp there's probably four hours of light left.
>You think about the men that inhabited this camp.
>you couldn't call them friends but you still felt bad for them in a way
>More casualties made into slaves.
>What they did to James and Charles.
>You cant let that happen to you.
>The sweet demeanor of the daxy picks at your mind again.
>This time you feel disgusted.
>You suppress the small part of you that misses the pheromones.
>Twenty minutes after leaving the camp towards the mountains you hear the low distant rumble of ship engines again.
>They came back for you but you got out just in time it seems.
>The tree canopy is heavy enough that they wont be able to spot you from above.
>There is nothing out here but untamed forest between you and the Appalachia mountains.
>You have no plans other than evade daxy.
>You grew up exploring these woods. You'll be fine. Probably.

>She made you a deal, she'd take you along, but there wasn't going to be no free rides.

>As in, the ringmaster, whose ten foot tall Tiger woman is currently riding you while your buried underneath her massive caboose.
>You might have been living in the bumfuck middle of nowhere, but now your stuck bumfucking her in the middle of nowhere.

>Why did you have the insane feeling that there was something under it?
>Why we’re you certain you saw something move?
>You take a deep breath, and force yourself to turn on the light.
>You push the stupid thought away, and undress, walking up to your bed.
>Just as one leg settles to hoist you onto the rest of the bed, you feel something heavy grab your ankle.
>Before you can scream, you hear a deep, fumbling voice.
>”It’s about time you turned those lights off~”

>While documenting leopard seals in Antarctica for a 2006 National Geographic magazine story, photographer Paul Nicklen had an experience that he says "will stay with me forever"
>"Leopard seals are the most incredible animals I've ever had the pleasure of photographing," he said. "When you get in the water with a wild animal, you're essentially giving yourself to that animal because, as humans, we're quite helpless and vulnerable in the water. You're at the seal's mercy. You're at the predator's mercy.
>"Not only did the leopard seals not attack as some predicted they would, they fed me penguins, followed me around, and generally put on a nonstop show."
>In the video above, Nicklen explained how an encounter with one particular female leopard seal was especially poignant. The animal had a head larger than a grizzly bear's, and it took his camera and his head into its mouth. But instead of harming him, the seal began to "nurture" him. It began to bring him penguins, first alive, then dead, perhaps assuming that he was a "useless predator in her ocean."
>The top predator apparently tried to feed the weaker Nicklen for four days as he scuba dived in the area, working on the assignment.

>*BANG*
>You did it again, fucking AGAIN.
>Popped him before he could squeal.
>These trifilin' fleshbags... always digging into you like ticks.
>And they always get that last fuckin' bite.
>Some Godmother you turned out to be...
>"Oh padre, weep for the family, but weep not for me."
>"I ain't your daughter. Not anymore."
