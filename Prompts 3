>Hey guys, Scud from HPS here, I just finished dueling a horse anthro for the custody of her human significant other, it went great!
>I wish you guys could have seen her face after she lost. She was crying and begging for mercy saying things like "Please, I promise not to kiss him or tell him I love him without his permission ever again, so don't take him from me!" or "I'll do anything, just please let me see him again!". It was hilarious!
>The standard procedure of the dueling division is to duel in order to take the human into custody, but if the other party agrees you can add whatever other stakes you want. So when I broke down the door I said, "I am from the Human Protective Service and if I win this duel HPS will take that human into custody and the human is mine!". The dumb horse didn't realize she could refuse the last part and accepted the duel terms!
>Anyway, now that I own him I was thinking of making him into the newest member of my gang.(pic related is me and my gang)
Sincerely, HPS Scud

In high school one of my sisters feline friends was always such a bitch to me. One day she asked my sis if she could sleep over. Turns out that was an excuse, she thought her friends humie brother was hot and just wanted to sneak into my room to pound me into my own bed. When I tried talking to her at school she'd be her usual bitchy self and act like nothing happened. She'd lick her fangs and wink at me though. That's how it went every time she slept over. We're married now.

Halt! Where's your wife?

I have a virgin humie permit. Now, leave me alone.

Did you remember to renew it?

Yeah, I just did a week ago. But, i'm getting worried that the official who signs my permit is getting more and more pushy with every renewal. She keeps flirting with me and literally asked If I was sure that ''I didn't her to spread my legs open.'' I get nervous every time I go there because of that.

You are lucky! They finally decided to not renew mine... She started on the spot...

>and another
>your fight-or-flight response reacts for you, your body breaking into a full adrenaline-fueled sprint
>it's not long until you begin to hear footfalls behind you
>terrified you veer off the path as you sprint through the trees
>"HUMAN!!!" you hear voices howl from behind
>your heart is slamming like a jackhammer in your chest
>this is the scariest fucking moment of your entire life
>and also beyond any doubt the most fun you've ever had

That's how it starts.
>she shares her interests and asks you to indulge them
>wearing a collar in the bedroom, a little dirty talk, nothing crazy
>then it leaves the bedroom
>she sneaks your collar on by surprise, or suddenly commands you to stay off the couch, and it leads into the usual
>just a little spontaneous foreplay, surely
>it becomes more frequent and she encourages you to keep the game going after sex, so you find yourself just leaving the collar on, wearing less clothes around the house
>it's fine, she really likes it and its your house.
>before you know it, the petplay becomes the new normal inside your home
>she starts pushing beyond your comfort zone: "What if you wear the collar underneath your work clothes? Nobody would notice.", "Some people wear collars in public for fashion, and who cares what strangers think anyways"...
>you push back a bit, she eases up a bit, and things settle into a safe, comfortable, fun pattern
>it starts to feel less like a sex thing
>she gets a call
>her family wants her to move back to her home country
>tons of anthros, almost no humans, and it will be "so much fun" because your little game is "totally normal" there
>you're reluctant, but you love her and she jokingly tells you that you don't have a choice in the matter anyways
>she was right, it is normal there
>you see several 'couples' like you on your first day
>always humans on leashes without clothes.
>suddenly there are many more rules about how to interact with anthros and how to behave outside the house
>you meet her family, though you're not allowed to speak to them
>they coo over you and congratulate her on her "conquest"
>you find that humans have few actual rights in this country and your "game" is something much more official here
>you wonder when it stopped being a game
>you wonder if she would even let you go if you asked
This shit happens every day. Not sure how I feel about how it turned out for me, but it's too late for regrets.

>Demons and hell actually exist
>Despite what humans believe, hell was not an afterlife where the evil go to be tortured for eternity, but another dimension
>The transdimensional creatures known as demons had powerful sex drives, and men were the best fit for feeding their desires
>Admittedly, teleporting men to their homes and forcing themselves on the frightened souls was probably not the best way to do it
>No one knows why, but eventually they just stopped
>Humanity thought they were planning something, but after many years they became mere myths
>It turns out demonkind had some sort of magic shift which screwed with their spells for many years
>After things returned to normal, humans were myths to demons
>The perfect mate, the most attractive beings who can be played with for hours and hours
>Until someone found one of the old summoning books, and managed to snag the mystical creature known as a human
>Now that spell is being revived and spread to the rest of demon society, and they are more than happy to revive the tradition of taking a human husband

>big polar bear waifur

>chat for a bit while eating, eventually after a while I bring up the question about us being completely alone
>''Well, you see dear....''
>and then she jumps on me
>get 2koma'd and mating pressed for what feels like hours
>after she finally gets off me, i'm still laying there completely exhausted
>Hear someone yell ''AND CUT! You two did great!''
>I realize that this was a set up for a porn

>"Sure, I'd love to meet your sisters."
>"I hope you got a strong pelvis!"

>And one day, some soldiers come to his house
>Oh
>Oh no
>I can hear the crying

>Pills, alcohol, smoking, he's done it
>He's an empty shell, a husk
>We try to help him, but he's so apathetic
>He's given up
>And it hurts so much to see
Why do we let soldiers claim humies? They shouldn't have to deal with the trauma that comes with the loss of a loved one, so why are anthros who work to die claiming them? To see the little guy so broken, it's horrible. I just hope that one day he can move on, and hopefully find a new girl to claim him.

In Greek mythology, the Minotaur is a mythical creature portrayed in Classical times with the head and tail of a cow and the body of a woman or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, a being "part woman and part cow". Minotaur which fed on human seed and could not be controlled.
She dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. While the Labyrinth would hold the monster there was still a danger of the beast escaping to sate her hunger.
Since Minos was hardly interested in feeding his own people to the creature, he taxed the city of Athens with tribute which included sending seven young men to Crete every year who were then released into the labyrinth and taken by the Minotaur.

And your lack of rat social behavior has led to you being dominance groomed the whole time and having all their scents all over you. Every rat female in town now sees you as their bitch and belonging to rats.

>Well girls, he`s pretty well domesticated by now...Soooo...Who goes first?

>..OH!! I figured we`d go for a team effort. It`s worked out fairly well so far.
>No way. We have spent months on this. I wont ruin this romantic setup with a tawdry orgy. That`s for later. So who goes first? I say i do. I found him and i took the first step.
>Well, you make a good point, But i got a few compelling reasons myself. They are nearly D cup. Lets lure him in with my charms and your...lesser offerings...
>Screw that. I`m the biggest and baddest so i should get him first.
>Please, you are five foot four. And being writ up for smoking on the school premises is not exactly grand larceny. If size mattered we should let Olga have a crack at him, she is seven feet tall and wrestles polar bears.
>Olga is a polar bear and also a wrestler.
>My point exactly.
>What?!! We cant let Olga steal our man!!
>No, Lani, that was just an exa...
>But, that`s OK. I`ve seen how some of the other skanks looks at him. So i spent the last week in shop class making shanks for us. Look, Mala, i laquered yours with purple and orange slashes...Heh...Slashes.
>Soooo, i guess Lani goes first.
