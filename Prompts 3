>Hey guys, Scud from HPS here, I just finished dueling a horse anthro for the custody of her human significant other, it went great!
>I wish you guys could have seen her face after she lost. She was crying and begging for mercy saying things like "Please, I promise not to kiss him or tell him I love him without his permission ever again, so don't take him from me!" or "I'll do anything, just please let me see him again!". It was hilarious!
>The standard procedure of the dueling division is to duel in order to take the human into custody, but if the other party agrees you can add whatever other stakes you want. So when I broke down the door I said, "I am from the Human Protective Service and if I win this duel HPS will take that human into custody and the human is mine!". The dumb horse didn't realize she could refuse the last part and accepted the duel terms!
>Anyway, now that I own him I was thinking of making him into the newest member of my gang.(pic related is me and my gang)
Sincerely, HPS Scud

In high school one of my sisters feline friends was always such a bitch to me. One day she asked my sis if she could sleep over. Turns out that was an excuse, she thought her friends humie brother was hot and just wanted to sneak into my room to pound me into my own bed. When I tried talking to her at school she'd be her usual bitchy self and act like nothing happened. She'd lick her fangs and wink at me though. That's how it went every time she slept over. We're married now.

Halt! Where's your wife?

I have a virgin humie permit. Now, leave me alone.

Did you remember to renew it?

Yeah, I just did a week ago. But, i'm getting worried that the official who signs my permit is getting more and more pushy with every renewal. She keeps flirting with me and literally asked If I was sure that ''I didn't her to spread my legs open.'' I get nervous every time I go there because of that.

You are lucky! They finally decided to not renew mine... She started on the spot...

>and another
>your fight-or-flight response reacts for you, your body breaking into a full adrenaline-fueled sprint
>it's not long until you begin to hear footfalls behind you
>terrified you veer off the path as you sprint through the trees
>"HUMAN!!!" you hear voices howl from behind
>your heart is slamming like a jackhammer in your chest
>this is the scariest fucking moment of your entire life
>and also beyond any doubt the most fun you've ever had

That's how it starts.
>she shares her interests and asks you to indulge them
>wearing a collar in the bedroom, a little dirty talk, nothing crazy
>then it leaves the bedroom
>she sneaks your collar on by surprise, or suddenly commands you to stay off the couch, and it leads into the usual
>just a little spontaneous foreplay, surely
>it becomes more frequent and she encourages you to keep the game going after sex, so you find yourself just leaving the collar on, wearing less clothes around the house
>it's fine, she really likes it and its your house.
>before you know it, the petplay becomes the new normal inside your home
>she starts pushing beyond your comfort zone: "What if you wear the collar underneath your work clothes? Nobody would notice.", "Some people wear collars in public for fashion, and who cares what strangers think anyways"...
>you push back a bit, she eases up a bit, and things settle into a safe, comfortable, fun pattern
>it starts to feel less like a sex thing
>she gets a call
>her family wants her to move back to her home country
>tons of anthros, almost no humans, and it will be "so much fun" because your little game is "totally normal" there
>you're reluctant, but you love her and she jokingly tells you that you don't have a choice in the matter anyways
>she was right, it is normal there
>you see several 'couples' like you on your first day
>always humans on leashes without clothes.
>suddenly there are many more rules about how to interact with anthros and how to behave outside the house
>you meet her family, though you're not allowed to speak to them
>they coo over you and congratulate her on her "conquest"
>you find that humans have few actual rights in this country and your "game" is something much more official here
>you wonder when it stopped being a game
>you wonder if she would even let you go if you asked
This shit happens every day. Not sure how I feel about how it turned out for me, but it's too late for regrets.

>Demons and hell actually exist
>Despite what humans believe, hell was not an afterlife where the evil go to be tortured for eternity, but another dimension
>The transdimensional creatures known as demons had powerful sex drives, and men were the best fit for feeding their desires
>Admittedly, teleporting men to their homes and forcing themselves on the frightened souls was probably not the best way to do it
>No one knows why, but eventually they just stopped
>Humanity thought they were planning something, but after many years they became mere myths
>It turns out demonkind had some sort of magic shift which screwed with their spells for many years
>After things returned to normal, humans were myths to demons
>The perfect mate, the most attractive beings who can be played with for hours and hours
>Until someone found one of the old summoning books, and managed to snag the mystical creature known as a human
>Now that spell is being revived and spread to the rest of demon society, and they are more than happy to revive the tradition of taking a human husband

>big polar bear waifur

>chat for a bit while eating, eventually after a while I bring up the question about us being completely alone
>''Well, you see dear....''
>and then she jumps on me
>get 2koma'd and mating pressed for what feels like hours
>after she finally gets off me, i'm still laying there completely exhausted
>Hear someone yell ''AND CUT! You two did great!''
>I realize that this was a set up for a porn

>"Sure, I'd love to meet your sisters."
>"I hope you got a strong pelvis!"

>And one day, some soldiers come to his house
>Oh
>Oh no
>I can hear the crying

>Pills, alcohol, smoking, he's done it
>He's an empty shell, a husk
>We try to help him, but he's so apathetic
>He's given up
>And it hurts so much to see
Why do we let soldiers claim humies? They shouldn't have to deal with the trauma that comes with the loss of a loved one, so why are anthros who work to die claiming them? To see the little guy so broken, it's horrible. I just hope that one day he can move on, and hopefully find a new girl to claim him.

In Greek mythology, the Minotaur is a mythical creature portrayed in Classical times with the head and tail of a cow and the body of a woman or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, a being "part woman and part cow". Minotaur which fed on human seed and could not be controlled.
She dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. While the Labyrinth would hold the monster there was still a danger of the beast escaping to sate her hunger.
Since Minos was hardly interested in feeding his own people to the creature, he taxed the city of Athens with tribute which included sending seven young men to Crete every year who were then released into the labyrinth and taken by the Minotaur.

There's nothing more adorable than a humie who doesn't know how to react to being called a good boy for the first time in his life. Sometimes, they may even break down crying at how nice you are to them because they've never felt the same kind of affection from their own ''females.''

god I wanna be in the fascist humanthro state so badly if this is what happens

It's only natural, anon. We were always meant to serve our anthro superiors and allow them to offer their love and protection to us in return. I can tell you, there's nothing I love more than knowing my place and being a good hubby for my waifur. Spending the day cleaning, cooking and taking care of the home and spending the nights under my waifur, moaning in pleasure as she conquers my cock.

Sounds like a paradise to me, will I need to seed my wife every years to produce anthro daughters for the war machine? We always have to defend ourselves from the human "freedom fighters" for god anthro and country.

Of course. Make sure to breed with her a lot like a good hubby should. We need as many anthro daughters and human sons as possible. Your daughters will grow up to be strong soldiers and help protect us from the misguided anti-anthro forces. Your sons will grow up and get strong anthro wife's of their own to submit and surrender their seed to. Plus, I bet your waifur loves nothing more than to relish the cute moans you make in the bedroom. So make sure she hears them as often as possible!

Can anthro bears or dogs stop calling humies who are younger or scared of them “cubs” or “runts”, it’s embarrassing and rude

-Excellent at roleplay in bed, she's a girl in uniform

Listening to her recordings of soft human boy breathing.

How much could a humie make off selling recordings or videos of himself breathing, moaning, sleeping, etc. to thirsty anthro girls?

all the anthros would be simping for him, but the problem is his most adoring fans would be trying to find where he lives...

Jacob was twenty years old, in good health, and had absolutely nothing to worry about. His parents were wealthy beyond any possible way they could explain it to him, even as an adult. When he was a kid, he had almost everything he could ever want. But as a man, he barely took any money from his parents, instead busying himself making his own work.
However, he always had enough from his parents, in terms of gifts, an allowance, or just money he had saved from his childhood to spend money on frivolous things. But despite all that, the biggest expense was from his father, who wanted him safe.
Diana was nearly seven feet tall and three hundred pounds of solid muscle, broad shouldered and heavily built. She was rarely not by Jacob's side. Some observers would say that Jacob's father was ruining his social life, but he didn't mind at all. He, in fact, would go as far as to ask her to stay around, even when she was off work.
Diana would usually get rather stressed after a day of standing around anticipating all sorts of horrible things happening to Jacob, and he quite liked to relieve her stress. Tonight was no different as he wandered to his room and winked at her, giving her the go-ahead. In an instant, she had slammed him onto the bed, forgoing pretty much any form of foreplay as she discarded her clothes and straddled him, looking down at him. He smiled up at her, still a bit sheepish, despite the regularity of this act. Almost nightly, he would go through this routine with her. She rather carefully removed his pants, then dropped down on his length with a grunt, feeling him grip at her rear, and she grinned down at him, rocking her hips back and forth roughly, knowing that he wouldn't do anything to stop her.
Yes, Jacob liked to lose control every now and then. To submit to someone a fair bit bigger and stronger than him. As she grabbed his hands and pinned them over his head, riding him roughly, he tipped his head back in bliss.

You just gave me an idea of what happens to female Humans. They are turned into slave, personal servants and maid for the female Antros.

>Accompanying him to the newly established antro kingdom.
>Due to their recent expansion, you now border each other.
>So your lord wishes to establish non-aggression pacts and trade deals.
>When you arrive at the palace you see entourage of antro guards (Hyenas, Horses, Bears and a few Moose).
>You quickly notice that they're all female.
>They are a matriarchal society, and if it works and they prosper, who are you to judge.
>As you enter the palace you see most maids most are Human women, but few are female Cats, Dogs, Foxes and Deers.
>You are approached by the captain of the guards a giantess of a Hyena (over 7 feet tall), and are told that 'She will lead your lord safely to the meeting.'.
>You immediately speak up about simply leaving your lord alone without any protection on foreign soil.
>He say that you and another guard will escort him to the meeting chamber.
>Leaving rest of your men behind in the grand entrance hall, you spot the captain giving a subtle nod to the other palace guards.
>You think nothing of it, as you follow the captain.
>When entering your greeted to sight of an female Moose discussing about something wither her ladyship.
>She was a tall Dire Wolf, taller even than the captain.
>Only thing you could think of was that 'Is this how antros chose leaders, by size and physical strength.'.
>As the monarchs started to discuss politics, you didn't notice as the captain was slowly coming close to you.
>Then suddenly there was a thud that alerted you and and your lord.
>It was your fellow guard on top of him was the Moose advisor, pressing his head between her giant breasts, while slowly undressing him.
>You heard sudden yelp from behind you.
>As you turn around, you see the queen on top of your lord.
>She's completely dominating him and slowly striping him.
>As your about to jump to your lords rescue.
>Your suddenly face first on the floor, and turn on your back.
>Seeing the captain on top of you, would make anyone aroused in a normal situation.
>But now you had more important matters, than thinking about large breasts.
>As you are about to strike her, she grabs and holds both of your hands over your head, with a single arm.
>Then as you struggle she says something that makes you a bit fearful.
>'Oh, I love it when they struggle.' She says in a lust filled voice.
>Looking around you see your fellow guard in a amazon position, getting dominated by the moose.
>Your lord didn't fair any better.
>Stuck in a mating press with her on top, constantly kissing him and saying.
>'Come breed your new queen. Give me a strong heiress. I can't wait when, I will be breastfeeding our children.'
>Your captor seemed to be looking what her fellow antros were doing as well.
>'Huh, I knew queen had it bad. But to be this aggressive, is quite surprising.' She said it in mild surprised tone.
>As you look back at the guard captain, she gives you a toothy grin, as she whispers in your ear.
>'Why don't we make their screams look quite in comparison.'
>She said it while ripping the frontal groin region of your trousers.
>'I hope that the my guards hear my scream. Maybe if you impress me enough, I might let one of the maids ride you. With me present of course.'
>You suddenly realized that the nod she gave to the rest of her guards.
>She was grinning as you realize that your men were in the same position as you.
>Slowly positioning herself above your dick.
>You start saying that you can't do this, your married, you have a son and so on.
>All she says makes you terrified a bit 'Good she'll watch and clean my pussy. As for your son, I know a few ladies who would like a young husband.'.
>That day you learned that antros take what they like no matter what.
>Few days after your arrival a matrimonial marriage between your lord and the Dire Wolf queen was announced.
>He looked like he didn't sleep much, which was better than what he usually looked like.
>After all ruling wasn't just listening to people complain and sitting on a throne.
>By nights he always done the paper work and wrote letters to surrounding monarchs.
>It was also announced that he will be staying along with his guards, and letting one of his younger siblings takeover as ruler.
>'Heh more letters to write.' Was all you thought with a slight grin.
>Then along with your men clapped at this news, though many of them looked tired and some even broken.
>Some even collars and leashes like you.
>Looking to your new mistress, who starts affectionately rubbing your cheek with her claw.
>This was going to be your new life, being nothing more than a glorified guard for your new queen.
>At least your son will grow a normal life, maybe without a father, but still a normal life.
>And who knows, he might even marry into nobility, become a merchant or follow in his fathers footsteps.
>As you were lead by your new mistresses or maybe 'wife' is more appropriate to your new life.

Most dragons probably see themselves as above and beyond other species, and probably only see other dragons as their only real competition. Imagine two gazillionaire dragon mommies competing for you by showing off how wealthy they are, and getting into pissing contests over who can provide the nicest things.

It is every anthro's fantasy to rescue a cute humie boy from danger and have him cling to her for comfort.

probably a common fantasy with variation depending on species and their niches like water/snowy/desert/etc

>water; save a humie from a shipwreck
>snowy; obvious, but add variety with it being an ice breaker getting stuck
>desert; rehydrating a human with breast milk
>mountains; goat or bird saving a human from falling
>space; Von Neumann probe wAIfur(s) save the crew of a stranded ship in deep space
>void; give into the void

Well, my last endeavor ended with me going insane at the hands of an eldritch abomination, but I have not given up yet on creating a world that fits my perfect human supremacist vision! Behold!

We believe it's because the males took longer to change, and they required the females to keep them safe. The females didn't seem to take too well to the modern male anthros though, oddly enough. I suppose it's a species wide example of not wanting to accept change, but we aren't sure. Maybe I should make my next paper on...- hey, what did I just say! Keep those paws out of his pants!"

I'm kinda worried about her. She hasn't been eating as much as she usually does and I don't know why, I think maybe one of the drunk women said something mean about her weight and she felt self concious about it (she's REALLY shy.) She looks like she's gained her normal amount of winter weight, maybe a bit more, but I'm still afraid somethings wrong. Should I just ask her?

I never thougt about it until now, but do you think that anthros of predatory species would do something like this to get rid of a love rival for a human they like?
I like the idea of the anthro government having paperwork they have to fill out when they eat an anthro that was making moves on the human they were planning to claim as theirs, snakes or frogs would probably be doing it a lot more than other species.
