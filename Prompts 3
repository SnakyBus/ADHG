>Hey guys, Scud from HPS here, I just finished dueling a horse anthro for the custody of her human significant other, it went great!
>I wish you guys could have seen her face after she lost. She was crying and begging for mercy saying things like "Please, I promise not to kiss him or tell him I love him without his permission ever again, so don't take him from me!" or "I'll do anything, just please let me see him again!". It was hilarious!
>The standard procedure of the dueling division is to duel in order to take the human into custody, but if the other party agrees you can add whatever other stakes you want. So when I broke down the door I said, "I am from the Human Protective Service and if I win this duel HPS will take that human into custody and the human is mine!". The dumb horse didn't realize she could refuse the last part and accepted the duel terms!
>Anyway, now that I own him I was thinking of making him into the newest member of my gang.(pic related is me and my gang)
Sincerely, HPS Scud

In high school one of my sisters feline friends was always such a bitch to me. One day she asked my sis if she could sleep over. Turns out that was an excuse, she thought her friends humie brother was hot and just wanted to sneak into my room to pound me into my own bed. When I tried talking to her at school she'd be her usual bitchy self and act like nothing happened. She'd lick her fangs and wink at me though. That's how it went every time she slept over. We're married now.

Halt! Where's your wife?

I have a virgin humie permit. Now, leave me alone.

Did you remember to renew it?

Yeah, I just did a week ago. But, i'm getting worried that the official who signs my permit is getting more and more pushy with every renewal. She keeps flirting with me and literally asked If I was sure that ''I didn't her to spread my legs open.'' I get nervous every time I go there because of that.

You are lucky! They finally decided to not renew mine... She started on the spot...

>and another
>your fight-or-flight response reacts for you, your body breaking into a full adrenaline-fueled sprint
>it's not long until you begin to hear footfalls behind you
>terrified you veer off the path as you sprint through the trees
>"HUMAN!!!" you hear voices howl from behind
>your heart is slamming like a jackhammer in your chest
>this is the scariest fucking moment of your entire life
>and also beyond any doubt the most fun you've ever had

That's how it starts.
>she shares her interests and asks you to indulge them
>wearing a collar in the bedroom, a little dirty talk, nothing crazy
>then it leaves the bedroom
>she sneaks your collar on by surprise, or suddenly commands you to stay off the couch, and it leads into the usual
>just a little spontaneous foreplay, surely
>it becomes more frequent and she encourages you to keep the game going after sex, so you find yourself just leaving the collar on, wearing less clothes around the house
>it's fine, she really likes it and its your house.
>before you know it, the petplay becomes the new normal inside your home
>she starts pushing beyond your comfort zone: "What if you wear the collar underneath your work clothes? Nobody would notice.", "Some people wear collars in public for fashion, and who cares what strangers think anyways"...
>you push back a bit, she eases up a bit, and things settle into a safe, comfortable, fun pattern
>it starts to feel less like a sex thing
>she gets a call
>her family wants her to move back to her home country
>tons of anthros, almost no humans, and it will be "so much fun" because your little game is "totally normal" there
>you're reluctant, but you love her and she jokingly tells you that you don't have a choice in the matter anyways
>she was right, it is normal there
>you see several 'couples' like you on your first day
>always humans on leashes without clothes.
>suddenly there are many more rules about how to interact with anthros and how to behave outside the house
>you meet her family, though you're not allowed to speak to them
>they coo over you and congratulate her on her "conquest"
>you find that humans have few actual rights in this country and your "game" is something much more official here
>you wonder when it stopped being a game
>you wonder if she would even let you go if you asked
This shit happens every day. Not sure how I feel about how it turned out for me, but it's too late for regrets.

>Demons and hell actually exist
>Despite what humans believe, hell was not an afterlife where the evil go to be tortured for eternity, but another dimension
>The transdimensional creatures known as demons had powerful sex drives, and men were the best fit for feeding their desires
>Admittedly, teleporting men to their homes and forcing themselves on the frightened souls was probably not the best way to do it
>No one knows why, but eventually they just stopped
>Humanity thought they were planning something, but after many years they became mere myths
>It turns out demonkind had some sort of magic shift which screwed with their spells for many years
>After things returned to normal, humans were myths to demons
>The perfect mate, the most attractive beings who can be played with for hours and hours
>Until someone found one of the old summoning books, and managed to snag the mystical creature known as a human
>Now that spell is being revived and spread to the rest of demon society, and they are more than happy to revive the tradition of taking a human husband

>big polar bear waifur

>chat for a bit while eating, eventually after a while I bring up the question about us being completely alone
>''Well, you see dear....''
>and then she jumps on me
>get 2koma'd and mating pressed for what feels like hours
>after she finally gets off me, i'm still laying there completely exhausted
>Hear someone yell ''AND CUT! You two did great!''
>I realize that this was a set up for a porn

>"Sure, I'd love to meet your sisters."
>"I hope you got a strong pelvis!"

>And one day, some soldiers come to his house
>Oh
>Oh no
>I can hear the crying

>Pills, alcohol, smoking, he's done it
>He's an empty shell, a husk
>We try to help him, but he's so apathetic
>He's given up
>And it hurts so much to see
Why do we let soldiers claim humies? They shouldn't have to deal with the trauma that comes with the loss of a loved one, so why are anthros who work to die claiming them? To see the little guy so broken, it's horrible. I just hope that one day he can move on, and hopefully find a new girl to claim him.

In Greek mythology, the Minotaur is a mythical creature portrayed in Classical times with the head and tail of a cow and the body of a woman or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, a being "part woman and part cow". Minotaur which fed on human seed and could not be controlled.
She dwelt at the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. While the Labyrinth would hold the monster there was still a danger of the beast escaping to sate her hunger.
Since Minos was hardly interested in feeding his own people to the creature, he taxed the city of Athens with tribute which included sending seven young men to Crete every year who were then released into the labyrinth and taken by the Minotaur.

There's nothing more adorable than a humie who doesn't know how to react to being called a good boy for the first time in his life. Sometimes, they may even break down crying at how nice you are to them because they've never felt the same kind of affection from their own ''females.''

god I wanna be in the fascist humanthro state so badly if this is what happens

It's only natural, anon. We were always meant to serve our anthro superiors and allow them to offer their love and protection to us in return. I can tell you, there's nothing I love more than knowing my place and being a good hubby for my waifur. Spending the day cleaning, cooking and taking care of the home and spending the nights under my waifur, moaning in pleasure as she conquers my cock.

Sounds like a paradise to me, will I need to seed my wife every years to produce anthro daughters for the war machine? We always have to defend ourselves from the human "freedom fighters" for god anthro and country.

Of course. Make sure to breed with her a lot like a good hubby should. We need as many anthro daughters and human sons as possible. Your daughters will grow up to be strong soldiers and help protect us from the misguided anti-anthro forces. Your sons will grow up and get strong anthro wife's of their own to submit and surrender their seed to. Plus, I bet your waifur loves nothing more than to relish the cute moans you make in the bedroom. So make sure she hears them as often as possible!

Can anthro bears or dogs stop calling humies who are younger or scared of them “cubs” or “runts”, it’s embarrassing and rude

-Excellent at roleplay in bed, she's a girl in uniform

Listening to her recordings of soft human boy breathing.

How much could a humie make off selling recordings or videos of himself breathing, moaning, sleeping, etc. to thirsty anthro girls?

all the anthros would be simping for him, but the problem is his most adoring fans would be trying to find where he lives...

Jacob was twenty years old, in good health, and had absolutely nothing to worry about. His parents were wealthy beyond any possible way they could explain it to him, even as an adult. When he was a kid, he had almost everything he could ever want. But as a man, he barely took any money from his parents, instead busying himself making his own work.
However, he always had enough from his parents, in terms of gifts, an allowance, or just money he had saved from his childhood to spend money on frivolous things. But despite all that, the biggest expense was from his father, who wanted him safe.
Diana was nearly seven feet tall and three hundred pounds of solid muscle, broad shouldered and heavily built. She was rarely not by Jacob's side. Some observers would say that Jacob's father was ruining his social life, but he didn't mind at all. He, in fact, would go as far as to ask her to stay around, even when she was off work.
Diana would usually get rather stressed after a day of standing around anticipating all sorts of horrible things happening to Jacob, and he quite liked to relieve her stress. Tonight was no different as he wandered to his room and winked at her, giving her the go-ahead. In an instant, she had slammed him onto the bed, forgoing pretty much any form of foreplay as she discarded her clothes and straddled him, looking down at him. He smiled up at her, still a bit sheepish, despite the regularity of this act. Almost nightly, he would go through this routine with her. She rather carefully removed his pants, then dropped down on his length with a grunt, feeling him grip at her rear, and she grinned down at him, rocking her hips back and forth roughly, knowing that he wouldn't do anything to stop her.
Yes, Jacob liked to lose control every now and then. To submit to someone a fair bit bigger and stronger than him. As she grabbed his hands and pinned them over his head, riding him roughly, he tipped his head back in bliss.

You just gave me an idea of what happens to female Humans. They are turned into slave, personal servants and maid for the female Antros.

>Accompanying him to the newly established antro kingdom.
>Due to their recent expansion, you now border each other.
>So your lord wishes to establish non-aggression pacts and trade deals.
>When you arrive at the palace you see entourage of antro guards (Hyenas, Horses, Bears and a few Moose).
>You quickly notice that they're all female.
>They are a matriarchal society, and if it works and they prosper, who are you to judge.
>As you enter the palace you see most maids most are Human women, but few are female Cats, Dogs, Foxes and Deers.
>You are approached by the captain of the guards a giantess of a Hyena (over 7 feet tall), and are told that 'She will lead your lord safely to the meeting.'.
>You immediately speak up about simply leaving your lord alone without any protection on foreign soil.
>He say that you and another guard will escort him to the meeting chamber.
>Leaving rest of your men behind in the grand entrance hall, you spot the captain giving a subtle nod to the other palace guards.
>You think nothing of it, as you follow the captain.
>When entering your greeted to sight of an female Moose discussing about something wither her ladyship.
>She was a tall Dire Wolf, taller even than the captain.
>Only thing you could think of was that 'Is this how antros chose leaders, by size and physical strength.'.
>As the monarchs started to discuss politics, you didn't notice as the captain was slowly coming close to you.
>Then suddenly there was a thud that alerted you and and your lord.
>It was your fellow guard on top of him was the Moose advisor, pressing his head between her giant breasts, while slowly undressing him.
>You heard sudden yelp from behind you.
>As you turn around, you see the queen on top of your lord.
>She's completely dominating him and slowly striping him.
>As your about to jump to your lords rescue.
>Your suddenly face first on the floor, and turn on your back.
>Seeing the captain on top of you, would make anyone aroused in a normal situation.
>But now you had more important matters, than thinking about large breasts.
>As you are about to strike her, she grabs and holds both of your hands over your head, with a single arm.
>Then as you struggle she says something that makes you a bit fearful.
>'Oh, I love it when they struggle.' She says in a lust filled voice.
>Looking around you see your fellow guard in a amazon position, getting dominated by the moose.
>Your lord didn't fair any better.
>Stuck in a mating press with her on top, constantly kissing him and saying.
>'Come breed your new queen. Give me a strong heiress. I can't wait when, I will be breastfeeding our children.'
>Your captor seemed to be looking what her fellow antros were doing as well.
>'Huh, I knew queen had it bad. But to be this aggressive, is quite surprising.' She said it in mild surprised tone.
>As you look back at the guard captain, she gives you a toothy grin, as she whispers in your ear.
>'Why don't we make their screams look quite in comparison.'
>She said it while ripping the frontal groin region of your trousers.
>'I hope that the my guards hear my scream. Maybe if you impress me enough, I might let one of the maids ride you. With me present of course.'
>You suddenly realized that the nod she gave to the rest of her guards.
>She was grinning as you realize that your men were in the same position as you.
>Slowly positioning herself above your dick.
>You start saying that you can't do this, your married, you have a son and so on.
>All she says makes you terrified a bit 'Good she'll watch and clean my pussy. As for your son, I know a few ladies who would like a young husband.'.
>That day you learned that antros take what they like no matter what.
>Few days after your arrival a matrimonial marriage between your lord and the Dire Wolf queen was announced.
>He looked like he didn't sleep much, which was better than what he usually looked like.
>After all ruling wasn't just listening to people complain and sitting on a throne.
>By nights he always done the paper work and wrote letters to surrounding monarchs.
>It was also announced that he will be staying along with his guards, and letting one of his younger siblings takeover as ruler.
>'Heh more letters to write.' Was all you thought with a slight grin.
>Then along with your men clapped at this news, though many of them looked tired and some even broken.
>Some even collars and leashes like you.
>Looking to your new mistress, who starts affectionately rubbing your cheek with her claw.
>This was going to be your new life, being nothing more than a glorified guard for your new queen.
>At least your son will grow a normal life, maybe without a father, but still a normal life.
>And who knows, he might even marry into nobility, become a merchant or follow in his fathers footsteps.
>As you were lead by your new mistresses or maybe 'wife' is more appropriate to your new life.

Most dragons probably see themselves as above and beyond other species, and probably only see other dragons as their only real competition. Imagine two gazillionaire dragon mommies competing for you by showing off how wealthy they are, and getting into pissing contests over who can provide the nicest things.

It is every anthro's fantasy to rescue a cute humie boy from danger and have him cling to her for comfort.

probably a common fantasy with variation depending on species and their niches like water/snowy/desert/etc

>water; save a humie from a shipwreck
>snowy; obvious, but add variety with it being an ice breaker getting stuck
>desert; rehydrating a human with breast milk
>mountains; goat or bird saving a human from falling
>space; Von Neumann probe wAIfur(s) save the crew of a stranded ship in deep space
>void; give into the void

Well, my last endeavor ended with me going insane at the hands of an eldritch abomination, but I have not given up yet on creating a world that fits my perfect human supremacist vision! Behold!

We believe it's because the males took longer to change, and they required the females to keep them safe. The females didn't seem to take too well to the modern male anthros though, oddly enough. I suppose it's a species wide example of not wanting to accept change, but we aren't sure. Maybe I should make my next paper on...- hey, what did I just say! Keep those paws out of his pants!"

I'm kinda worried about her. She hasn't been eating as much as she usually does and I don't know why, I think maybe one of the drunk women said something mean about her weight and she felt self concious about it (she's REALLY shy.) She looks like she's gained her normal amount of winter weight, maybe a bit more, but I'm still afraid somethings wrong. Should I just ask her?

I never thougt about it until now, but do you think that anthros of predatory species would do something like this to get rid of a love rival for a human they like?
I like the idea of the anthro government having paperwork they have to fill out when they eat an anthro that was making moves on the human they were planning to claim as theirs, snakes or frogs would probably be doing it a lot more than other species.

But I like my men nice and weak~ Feelin' em squirm and BEG under me~ While I ride their little poles. Those looks they make! It's even better than the actual sex at times~'
>I gave her a look of utter terror, tears forming as she stared back into my eyes much like I was a piece of free bloody rare stake. Which I probably was for her.
'Like that one~ Like you're about to cry and beg for mommy, before I lean into your ear and say 'I'm your mommy now~''
>She suddenly leans back and releases me, cackling as she threw her head back
'Ah! Haaaah~ It's like I someone up there likes me. Anyway kid, Name's Sheva. You better remember that name. You're likely gonna be saying it alot from now on~'
>For the rest of the day we stayed inside her Cell, sitting on her bunk (The bottom one if you wanted to know)
>She just had one arm wrapped around my side, her muzzle in my ear constantly growling and mewling at the same time
>Her other paw roughly touching me through my pants, rubbing my no-no area
'You're ssssoooo lucky right now. You see this collar? This damn thing is the only think keeping me from ripping this suit off with my teeth and taking you right now~ It monitors my pulse, making sure I don't get too excited. Which is REALLY hard to keep myself from getting any more of. If I pass a certain level, It'll send off an alarm and have the guards come down and save you~'
>She hissed and growled into my ear, her breath was moist and heavy, feeling it on my skin
'But... I've been training myself to keep myself in check . To hold back my 'urges' since they locked me in hoping they may let me out early... But with you here, I may never wanna leave~ I may loose my mind and get too hyped up if I actually took you... But I can still keep myself in check while I play with you all I want~ Maybe if I get REALLy good at it, I may actually get the chance to it~ Rape your cute lil' humie cock~'
>I whimpered and tried to keep from tearing up as Sheva licked my cheek, tasting my tears
"LIGHTS OUT IN TEN! ALL PRISONERS REPORT BACK TO THEIR CELLS OR FACE SOLITUDE!"
>I jumped at loud crackle of the intercom
"Oh ya hear that! Our first night together~ All night, I don't think I'll sleep a wink~ Do you? All I know is that you're gonna be a nice and snuggly litle body pillow~ Maybe we can even cuddle in the nude~'
>Second day, woke up to her molesting me and nibbling my ear lobe raw. Thought she might actually near it off
>Morning routine consisted of this - Her molesting and cuddling me, listening to the few howls and calls from the their cells in the block cat calling me or begging Sheva to let them use me later, and her giving me a ten minute bathroom break while she looked away
>Then came lunch time, female Prisoners turn - I was shoehorned in with them
>Sheva firmly clamped her arm around my neck and herded me around with her, receiving many sour and jealous stares in the lunch line
>She made us sit in one of the few empty tables near the entrance to the inmates yard
>She ate her tofu take and peas while I picked at my herbivore meal, steamed carrots & mashed potatoes, with that little carton of chocolate milk (I was allowed to choose)
'C'mon kid, Eat up~ You'll need to get your fill before he head out.'
>Sheeva reached over and kissed my cheek, leaving a small bit of slobber
'Yo! You the bitch with the humie boy?'
>We both turned our heads to a towering and black bear, one of her eyes replaced with a scar and her jumpsuit zipped down and tied around her waist to reveal her very stretched out tank top. A mix of bear fat and hard muscle, and a healthy amount of big bear tiddy
'Fork 'im over. He's my humie now.'
>Sheeva bared her teeth and let out a mix of a loud deep growl and a skin crawling hiss
>Standing up and popping her knuckles, she got in front of me and before the bear
'Fuck off, ya hairy cunt! This humie is MINE!'
>The bear showed her teeth as well, leaning in and snarling
>Many inmates turned and watched the stand off
>Even more spheggti shat out of my pocket
>After a few moments of this noise the bear leaned back, an angered look on her face
'Watch your back, short stack... When you ain't lookin' I'll knock you down and steal that boy.'
>I \watched as Sheeva sat back down and continued to eat and gulped
>Recess came, again she herded me to the back where no one really went - near the wired fence
>She mostly kept mewling and snuggling me on the bench next to the abandoned basket ball area
>She had her head over me as she nuzzled and held me saying more stuff about how she would rape and fuck me if given the chance
>Sheeva seemed to recieve equal pleasure from both touching me & the numerous jealous and envious states she got from the man inmates, many making threatening or vigor expressions towards her
>One approached one
>...A Small, yet shady looking Fennec with a bandaid across her muzzle, looked like a sort of loan shark or even a dealer
>Sheeva paused and stared down the fox, eyes borrowing deep inside her little forehead
>The Fennec only gave a shit eating grin that showed on of her fangs was silver.
'Hey Sheeva, I see the rumors are true. You did get the new Humie boy. Heard you didn't claim him yet. Why's that?'
>The lioness sighed annoyingly and pointed a clawed finger at her
'You know why you lil' shit, what do you want? You never talk unless you want somethin'...'
'Yeah, I do. I wanna get a round with him. Quick ten minute rump in my cell before lights out.'
>The Fennec unzipped her jumpsuit to reveal her petite chest and lain white bra, reaching in and pulling out an unopened carton of cigs
'Name your price. Ten, fifteen packs? Hell I'll even bribe the guards to get you some even better prices if you want-'
'Piss off, Runt! I'm keepin' him for myself. He ain't for sell and I'm no pimp!'
>The Fennecs' muzzle twitches as her eyes narrow, My blood freezes as she gave me an odd stare before huffing and zipping up her suit
>I felt Sheets tail whip back and worth behind my back as the fox left
>We were left alone besides the stares for the rest of the Recess
>Recess ended, we walked back to her Cell
>I could feel of of the women crounded around us in the hallway grope and try to squeeze my thigh and ass as we passed by
>Sheeva caught most of them with a bloodthirsty glare or a sharp snap at their hands with her whip-like tail
>We settled back in and-yet again, resumed her longing groping and cuddling
>I was getting use to it far too quickly
>Feeling the thin layer of silky fur and fat over her tight and tuned muscles around me, her arms holding me in place as she held my head against her ample chest
>Her soft paws stroking my cheek as she purred like a kitten
>She pulled me back and cupped my chin, licking her soft black lips again
'Hm~ Honey, you got no idea how much I want to do it~ Even if you think you do. How I wanna just push you down and make you cry my name, hearing you cry and moan while the scent ot our sex riles up everyone on this side of the Prison~ Maybe one day~'
>She leaned in, I felt her hot breath on my face as she stared into my eyes with lustful bedroom eyes, like that of a lover who had been away for war and just returned. With the obvious hints of a horny rapist underneath as well
>She suddenly forced her muzzle agents my lips
>I felt her large rough tongue force itself past my teeth and invade my mouth
>Her loud muffled moans mixed with the sloppy smooching over powered my cries
>Drool leaked past her lips and invaded mine as she forcefully continued her messy kiss
>Her tongue dancing and wrapping around mine as she forced me to explore her mouth as she forced herself down my throat
>I closed my teary eyes as I licked at her fangs, tasting her predatory saliva,
>I felt her claws rip the back of my jumpsuit as the cries and howls of the other inmates start to grow in volume
>Soon guards came by to tell everyone to quiet down
>Yet not us, They didn't even bother to get Sheeva to stop depriving me of oxygen
>Our make out session continue with sparse breaks to breath
>That night consisted of grinding and groping, and even more kissing
>I felt the spot between Sheeva's legs become soaking wet as she grinded against my thigh, if her hushed growl didn't give any more hints as to what happened
>I received even less sleep that night because of it
>I woke up still tired and groggy
'TODAY IS PRISONER VISITS! PLEASE STANDBY IN YOUR CELLS FOR ANY NOTIFICATION OF VISITORS!'
>I shook my tired head and listened
'Oh! Goodie! Mother should be visiting!'
>Mother?
'Yeah, my mom! She's a wonderful woman! You'd love 'er! She usually visits every month too, you could even meet her!'
>I stared up at her with my tired eyes, raising my brow - She wanted to show her new prison bitch to her Mother...?
>I half listened to her go on about her wonderful mom, trying to pass out again while she held me in her lap
>Sadly I was interrupted by a guard clacking our cell bars with her night stick
'Lion girl's mother is visiting.'
>Sheeva grinned wildly, not in a rapist or creepy fashion, more like something akin to a giddy child
>As the guard unlocked the cell, Sheeva locked her arm around mine and pulled me along with her
>It seemed I was going to meet my Sexual Predators mother
>Here's hoping she's of actual sanity

>Typical Tuesday mid-morning for Sam, a mid-level AR drone
>Sipping coffee and reviewing options for lowest cost bidder for next year’s health insurance options
>Glad he wouldn’t be the one having to answer questions during the all hands meeting
>Knock on the open office door
>It’s Dave, a young human who started at the company around eight months ago
>Sam and Dave weren’t friends per se, but sat with each other at lunch every so often
>Not too many humans in an anthro heavy industry like this. Human brotherhood and all that.
>Dave looks pale, uncertain, even younger than his fresh from college face would lead you to believe
>Concerned, Sam stands up and invites Dave in, closing his office door tightly behind him
>Dave collapses into the guest chair in front of Sam’s desk, and declines the coffee Sam offers
>He’s silent for a long while, staring hard at the corner of Sam’s desk while wringing his hands
>Sam gently asks him what’s wrong, and then is silent, waiting for Dave to talk
>Eventually, talk he does
“I-I’ve got an HR incident, I have to report, I think.”
>Sam sighed and pulled out a pen and pad of paper
“Did someone threaten you, or is someone making inappropriate remarks?”
>Dave bit his lip, looking like he was about to cry
“No. It … It was s-sexual in nature,” he ended in a near whisper.
>Sam’s eyes sharpened.
“Go on.”
>Dave stared down at his hands as if he’d never seen them before
“Well, it happened yesterday. Yesterday morning, right before lunch. I’d just gotten back from the mail room and was handing things out.”
>Sam began jotting down notes
“My director is um, Miss Fulton, and there was a package for her, so I went to deliver it. She -” Dave’s voice rose and he licked his lips after lowing it back to his previous conspiratorial tone. “She invited me into her office, and then she um, she asked me how things were going. You know, how well I was fitting in, if I enjoyed my work, if there was anyone giving me a hard time. Things like that. And then … and then she, she um, offered me a drink. I refused it because we were still at work. She told me that I didn’t need to be so uptight around her, that I could … relax. Then she started unbuttoning her blouse.”
>Sam’s pen stopped
>Both he and Dave took a deep breath before Dave continued
“It-it was just the top few buttons, but it caused me to realize that she wasn’t wearing a bra.”
>Sam set his pen down and leaned back in his chair
“Then she forced me to sit down in a chair and she,” Dave laughed nervously. “She straddled me, and began to pet me. On the head. I didn’t know what was going on, but then I tried to push her off. I told her I didn’t like what was happening, but she just laughed and caught my hands like I was play fighting. She told me that I was a tease and that I should stop pretending that I didn’t want it, and … and that she was going to make sure that I got everything that I deserved.”
>Dave’s hands were shaking
“She held my wrists with one hand and then she ripped my shirt open with the other, and she put her, um, mouth, on my-my nipples and began to use her tongue on my … chest. Then she began sniffing my neck and ears, and she uh, she bit me, right here.”
>He indicated where his shoulder met his neck
“And she kept licking it until the bleeding stopped. I … I was crying by then. I couldn’t do anything to make her stop. And when she saw me crying, she … she laughed. She called me a ‘cute little bitch.’ Then she stood up and lifted me up by my belt buckle. She forced me onto her desk, and then used her claws to cut my belt. Then she put… she put her hand … down my pants.” Dave had begun to lean forward as he spoke, and was now hunched over, speaking almost to the carpet, his voice getting lower and lower until he finished in a hard to hear whisper.
>Sam still didn’t say anything
>He pushed his box of tissues toward Dave when tears began to spill from Dave’s eyes
>Through sniffles, Dave continued
“She grabbed my genitals, and began making comments about how I should be glad that someone like her was taking an interest in someone like me, and that all men get hard when a women is aggressive. She was rough, and it hurt. But … eventually, I did get hard. She seemed proud that I did. And then, she said she knew I was a slut, and that I didn’t need to do anything, just lay back and relax. She pulled my pants down, and I covered my eyes. She got on top of me. I kind of focused on one of the ceiling tiles between the gap in my fingers. I just stared at the black little spots up there, focusing on them while she … while she ...”
>Dave had a fistful of tissues
>went back for a few tissues more
>through his tears, went back to the good, the bad, and the ugly
“It was hot and wet down there, and tight, really tight. It was my first time. I don’t recall how long it lasted, but eventually I ejaculated. I didn’t mean to. I didn’t want to, but I did anyway. A little while later she let out a roar and then began petting my hair again. She told me that I did a good job. A while later she let me put my clothes back on. They were wet and torn. She smirked and told me I could take the rest of the day off. When I left, she smacked my butt and told me that I should start wearing more durable clothing. On the way out, Mrs. Grayson, Miss Fulton’s secretary, she just smiled at me. It was a nasty smile. She knew. Everyone knew. I went home and I took a shower until the water went cold, and even then, I stayed in until my body had become so numb I couldn’t feel anything. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep. I just thought about what happened over and over again. Why did it happen, did I do something I shouldn’t have and give her the wrong signals? And then I thought that I needed to report it, like it says in the employee handbook, so that’s … that’s why I’m here.”
>Sam takes in the pitiable boy in front of him
>Forces him to drink a glass of water and calm down
>Eventually Dave’s sobs turn into the occasional sniffle
>His wet, red rimmed eyes look up at Dave trustingly
‘Listen, Dave, what I’m about to say may be a bit hard to hear, but maybe the next time Miss Fulton calls you into her office, you should try to enjoy it.
>confusion.png
‘Anthro Resources aren’t here to help you Dave, we’re here to help the company, and honestly it’s in the company’s best interests for you to bend Miss Fulton over and give it.
>Dave looked as if his last friend had just shot him in the back
>Well, Sam hadn’t ever really been his friend
>But he was feeling enough pity to give him the truth
‘The way the company sees it, she is a stellar directory with years of experience, enough awards to line a wall, and on the fast track to a vice president seat. You on the other hand are just another guy in an entry level position. They’ve invested a lot of resources into her, you they can replace with one of a million other guys who would do what you had to do with a smile on their face.’
“Isn’t there anything -”
‘Not really. This can go one of a few ways. You can force me to make an official report, and I will, and the company will go through it’s normal procedures. Miss Fulton will be assigned sexual harassment training, and you’ll be assigned to another department. In time her record will be forgotten, while yours will not. You’ll never get another promotion, and you’ll forever be known as the office slut. Due to company policy, cases of this nature must go through internal remediation. So, if you decide to hire a lawyer and make an official case, not only would you be violating the terms of your employment, but you’d be causing a headache for the company. Best case they’d fire you and settle for a pittance. Worst case, they’d make an example of you, giving you your day in court, burying you in legal fees, making you go over what happened again and again, in excruciating detail, in front of the whole world.’
>Dave stared dazedly at nothing in particular, as if the ground he’d though was solid had turned into quick sand
‘Or, you can simply quit, go someplace else where the same thing will probably happen again. It’s not just Miss Fulton, it happens all the time, everywhere, Dave. An attractive guy like you, well … Anyway, if I were in your position, I’d go back to work, forget that you even came to see me this morning. Maybe see if you can get a raise out of the deal, learn to at least live with it, if you can’t enjoy it. Think of it as one of those other duties as assigned that was in the job description.
>Dave silently stared at his shoes, deep in thought for a long time
>Eventually he apologized for taking up Sam’s time
>Still looking rattled, left Sam’s office
>Sam balled up the paper he’d started taking notes on and tossed it in the garbage
>Went back to perusing healthcare plans
>Just another Tuesday

I don't like going to the zoo, all the animals there keep eying me up and they don't have guard rails, I'm constantly afraid I'll fall into one of the enclosures.

A setting where the animals are anthros, but still make animal sounds and generally act like animals is a fun one to play around with. Just make them slightly more smarter and a tendency to go after humans as mates.

Tanuki or Kitsune?

They have to win in a competition on who would make me the happiest. Several stages, including cuddling, sweet talk, sex, and gifts.

Imagine if you invited a bunch of single anthros over to your place so that they can all compete for your marriage.

why do kitsunes threaten to steal your soul if you don't agree to be their wife?
im scared.

Because they like to seduce you as a human first, then live their entire life with you as a “human” couple. They’re usually terrified of being discovered and convinced their husbands won’t love them anymore.
If you stumble across Kitsune you’ve never met before in humanoid form, there’s a good chance you know her as a human. And that “human” has a crush on you. If she doesn’t just flee, she’s gonna flood the whole prefecture with spaghetti. That’s where you get stuff like
>Ah, human! How dare you trespass in this sacred place?!
>N-now your soul is forfeit, unless you agree to be my wife!
>Husband! Husband, I’d be your-
>Unless you accept my hand in marriage!
Just say yes and receive tailhug.

>ywn I get raped by a kitsune because she doesn't know how to just ask you out on a date
>ywn have her spilling her spaghetti all over you as she's riding you on the floor

>"Uh... hey there."
>Hi.

>Do I know you? Do you nee-
>"hOW DARE YOU COME TO T-THIS SACRED PLACE HUMAN! YOU DISTLUR-DISTURBED THE HOLy mountain shrine and uh.."
>Woah woah woah! What the hell are you talking about?
>"...will you marry me? please?"
>What the fuck? No?
>"I'm sorry"
>"Really and- but you see uh"
>"That wasn't really the "right" answer."

I wish my noodle gf didn't have such a god complex. She's always going on about how she's a 'divine dragon' and that I owe her sex at a moment's notice because it's my 'divinely appointed duty'. I'm so tired from being forced to fuck her every day and night I just wanna rest

Kneel down, place a tender paw on the boy's shoulder, embrace him as the hysterics pick up, sustain breast-to-head/face contact along with an intimate backrub, soothing and cementing the depth of his new situation. No words necessary, no questions asked, no ifs, ands or asses accepted. The young man shall then be guided to your home, where a hearty meal is prepared, discussions had, emotions rise and various lubricated and massaged body parts rise higher. For the betterment of both parties.

>needing some guiding in snu snu until they get going and just give into instinct and the pleasure
>lucky ones getting their human to dress up like the characters from their shows/games or even go to anime/comic cons

Imagine her feeling ashamed of her scarred and disfigured appearance until some cute humie tells her she's beautiful and that he'd marry her on the spot if he could. I bet that even the slightest compliment would convince her to fold you like a pretzel and fuck your brains out.

Should I be worried? I don't want anything on my record.

I need help. My personal trainer is a horse anthro and shes working me to death. I'd tell her but shes always so cheery and encouraging me to get one more rep. I just wanted to shed the quarantine weight, not train for the Olympics! Just the other day she had me doing 9 sets of hip thrusts as a warm up. Aren't those supposed to be an accessory?

Anthros love nothing more than seeing a little humie cut loose and embrace the pleasure of being mated. Hearing those sweet moans and cute little squeaks lets them know that you're feeling good. And they want you to feel good.

"You know... It'd be hotter if you weren't naked."
>Deathclaw lady pauses, thinking, "What?"
"You know, if you left something to the imagination."
>"Wait... But don't you guys like seeing females nude, like we're ready to mate?"
"Kind of, but if you're all naked all the time you get used to it. Like if you had cake everyday, then having cake for a special occasion wouldn't be special."
>You could see she was heavily considering that
>"So... You don't want to see any of this?" she asks, motioning to her body
"I do, but not all the time. Guys used to like working for it, you had to put a lot of effort into it to get to see some titties. Now it's everywhere, I don't even have to use the internet to see some titties, I can just look outside."
>"That's good, right?"
"Right up until you get desensitized to it."
>"Why are you so complicated? Other men aren't like this."
"Some are, but we live in interesting times. Most anthros can just rape a guy, but there's a thrill you can get in having someone pursue you. And I can just walk into any ghetto and get yeened, but an anthro who wants you to work for her is exciting and challenging."
>"That's stupid, if you like sex then why are you trying to avoid having it?"
"Men are complicated creatures, we like to feel accomplished and life becomes dull when the challenge gets taken away."
>There's a moment of silence
"Come back in a swimsuit and then we'll talk."

Can someone tell me what exactly makes an anthro a better partner for a human man than a human woman? What can they do that human women can't or won't do for their mates?

Innumerous reasons, all tailored by the preference of the mate. To note the essentials:
>increased sensory perception to varying degrees depending on the animal, with somatosensory, auditory and olfactory typically being the strongest. for aid in cooking, situational awareness (through the identification of certain scents/hormones and sounds) which includes threat detection, empathy, cleaning, etc.,
>extensive traversal capabilities in areas pertaining to the animal, whether air, sea, land or earth. perfect for vacays where that perfect scenic shot must be achieved or summertime activities (why board the waves when you can ride a shark?)
>should you subscribe to the superior "big girl" worldview, increased physical mass which on its own lends greater coverage, strength, dexterity and promotes athleticism, natural dieting and habits and other pro-health decisions to best ensure the potential of each individual, ideally reflecting on the partner
>also overseeing bolstered primary and secondary sexual characteristics; higher degree of breast growth, maximum bust size and wider pelvic region/hips = easier delivery of children and well-fed children at that
>all the appeal of diversity with the integrity to not leave it entirely to uncultured, unrelenting minds
>exotic morphology which accounts for a wide variety of aesthetic preferences
>natural capabilities for self-defense with claws, fangs and technique
>any string of erotic fascination that blooms from the aforementioned listing
>paws

>wonder too close to /pofg/ space
>get caught by yeen slavers and put up for auction
>"Human male, virgin, needs breaking in, no reserve, let's go ladies"

>dragged off stage for the exchange
>new master is a rough looking wolfess, she growls aggressively at the yeen slaver, yanking you away
>taken naked through town and bundled into the footwell of her craft, it's spacious but not a 2 seater
>shivering from cold and what fate awaits, you feel her legs wrap around you, warming, squeezing you gently she strokes your hair. her voice calmer now
>"Relax, your safe with me"
>dock on larger vessel in orbit. hers. she unclips your leash, leading you to her cabin by gentle hand hold
>pretty messy inside, dimly lit. wolf rummages around before finding a tool for releasing that slave collar. gives you a set of her old clothes to wear, a lil baggy with a musty dog smell but it's better than nothing
>turns out she's a bit of a freelancer, an alpha wolf, hates the slave trade, couldn't leave a human to that vampire bitch, believes no one should be chained
>you simply hug her
>she seems surprised at first but cuddles you tightly back into to her breasts, licking your sore neck. sleep all curled up together in her bed
>dunno how to repay her. clean up the room for a start
>she wakes up and stops you
>"No anon, free humans don't clean up after anthros" guess she likes the mess...
>her face suddenly lights up
>"Free humans learn to blast slavers!"
>get practically carried to the ship's upper gun turret
>pair of you just fit into the seat. sat on her lap the view of stars is amazing
>spend the night tossing drink cans out the garbage chute and taking turns at the controls
>her paws softly guide your hands at first, slipping down around your waist as you get the hang of it
>wind up stargazing for hours
>gradually learn more about /pofg/ space, wolf pack and this ship
>crew is all female, mostly canines, they just chill & laze around the stars in silent running mode. listening out for the next big score
>not all of them think a human should be walking around in clothes but you smell like the boss, puts you off limits for most
>turns out the doc is rather unruly
>taking great delight in getting you alone for a thorough examination
>"Say, do you see any fur boys strutting around hummie?"
>first came a body scan, you strip off for it
>"You know this whole galaxy is female? 99.9% they say. Till we found humans-"
>there is an odd look in her eyes, something primal flickering beneath the surface. now her razor sharp nails tapped menacingly upon your nude chest, a wicked smile creeping over her face...she wouldn't dare hurt you
>would she?
>using her weight to firmly press you against the scanner she started to grope with her paws, resisting risked a nasty cut
>"-Which means you or more specifically-"
>her pads brush over your balls, making them tense up. muzzle nudging into your ear
>"-These juicy orbs, unf yeah. Hot commodities"
>then came the stern command:
>"Pups. NOW!"
>this crazy girl was not messing around! seemingly reveling in the mixture of fear and arousal she was inflicting upon your body
>"In my paws or pussy boy. The only choices a human need make"
>just then a deep growl from behind made the mad doctors fur spike up, her paws fell away from caressing your trembling sack

>alpha breeder should do it: mated to you first and foremost but also tending to your sisters needs
>he'd love it!
>freedom to be a traditional male, raising pups, den making, supporting you, protected by you and your pack
>you must be coming into season day dreaming like this
>these extra hormones are distracting
>discarding some logistics report you head back to your cabin
>your body demanding you tackle the boy and ride him to oblivion
>yet your mind knew he'd come to you, there was no need to force him
>...he wasn't there!
>and your off duty hoodie was gone. he loved to sleep in that, looked so cute on him to boot
>the archives were right about males. they naturally seek out quiet places to unwind, monasteries in the old days, leashing them used to be considered cruel
>he had to be in the upper turret. it was usually left on remote control and empty
>even better
>peeking into the dimly lit compartment you could just make out a hooded human in the chair, bobbing along to some music broadcast from the planet below, in his own world
>stripping off you quietly released the door lock, sneaking in. he'd never hear your soft pads approaching
>the turret was covered in his sweet scent, stalking closer made you so excited. almost dripping wet with the anticipation of making an alpha mate of him
>with a slow, smooth motion so as not to frighten him too much you pull the hood over his eyes
>"gotya!"
>his partial squeal was adorable. tensing up in shock then quickly relaxing into the safe touch of his alpha
>so trusting he didn't even lift up the hood as you sat bare furred on his lap!
>accustom to long cuddles together his hands hugged your hips, not finding any fabric to hold onto they began to wonder up and down
>leaning into him you nuzzled under the hood, guiding the boy into a deep kiss. his head tilted to the side for your tongue, arms securing themselves around you. no words were needed. he wanted this
>slickness dripped from you onto baggy top, quickly soaking in
>he let out a muffled moan. were you hurting him? with a gasp the kiss was broken
>"hot" he panted "too hot"
>oh, it was just your higher body temperature cooking him. easily fixed
>a single swift motion had the human nude and the hoodie sailing down the corridor
>it was all he had on!
>the look on his face was adorable, surprise, awe, excitement
>taking his hands in your paws you hunkered down upon him. grinding against his groin. getting it utterly drenched
>growling lustily as his cock hardened and he squeezed your paws
>the slick shaft was easy to claim
>such a wonderful set of noises came from the boy as you did, desperate squirms, sharp breaths, whimpering moans. seemed like he really hadn't been bred before!
>it was just too much for the poor guy
>you tried holding him back from instantly orgasming to your heat
>that only worked for a moment. betrayed by your own desire to breed instinct boiled to the surface
>letting loose a possessive growl your body clamped the human to his chair, pounding wildly on his cock, tail thrashing with joy as it erupted in cooling cum
>more MORE!
>he let out a cry as you bit hard onto his shoulder. marking him yours. getting an extra load of spunk out of him
>wait! that must have hurt him!
>snapping back to reality you relax over the limp human, gently licking the hard love bite
>his face has a dazed, glazed over look. beads of sweat are trickling down him. heavily panting while his eyes roll around

>8ft tall waifur forces your head through the leg of her shorts
>trapped by her massive arms
>forced to grind your face against her sopping panties until she finally lets you eat her out

But yeah holy fuck the idea of being trapped in your waifur’s clothes with her is mega hot. There’s no escape from her heavy scent, no reprieve from the near-unbearable warmth, but alongside all that is an undeniable level of comfy. 69ing especially in this scenario would be heaven and hell.

>"Can I take you home and patch you up?"
>You cry from the sensory overload, sending them into a maternal panic
>Now you're in a pile of hugging anthros calming you down
>"Shush, it's alright~"
>It was just supposed to be a walk

>Waifur shoves your face against her panty covered cunt and tells you to get her off
>Use your tongue, nose and face to massage lick and prod her twitching cunt
>Watch the dark sticky spot right in the center start to grow bigger and darker, juices start to leak out and run down her legs and your face
>She's so wet now you can clearly make out every fold in her pussy and her throbbing, needy clit clearly silhouetted through the panties
>All of a sudden her pussy starts jumping harder and faster
>With one finally kiss to the desperately spasming button at the top, she lets out a massive torrent of squirt, filling your mouth and soaking your shirt, and absolutely ruining that pair of panties

> She has your wallet. You must have dropped it out of pure nervousness
> She's reading into your ID with a smile
> Fuck. Now she knows your personal details and address first hand.
> "You look really cute in here. Almost as much as yesterday."
> She begins to close the distance between you two as she puts the ID back in the wallet
> Uh-Oh
>You turned to face her, but couldn't muster the energy to back away.
>She stops right before you, looking down with the same prideful grin. Given the size difference, you barely see her face above her well-sized rack.
>However, it's the grin that gives away her intentions.
> A noise in one of the stalls shifts her attention for a split second.
>She looks back at you, the grin gone but still radiating confidence and dominance on equal parts.
>Leans on you, one paw forward with your wallet, another taking your hand so you don't drop it.
>"Meet me after work at the back. That is, unless you'd rather meet me at your place." her whispering voice carries a deep tone reinforcing her attitude.

>she picks you up into a rib creaking hug
"Oh you must have been so scared my little humie! I heard you liked living out the woods so I asked for you special! Come on, you'll be sharing my cabin while we get you settled in!"

>Private club for anthro socialites
>they have private human servers
>all you wanted to do was pay off your debt fast
>rich anthros are happy to help if you are willing to do some "extra service" for them

>I'm wandering through the forest, lost as hell
>I fucked up my arm in some climbing, so I have it in an improvised sling
>Walking through the night, I use a crappy flashlight to illuminate my path
>I only walk in pain for some time, until I hear a growl
>Aiming my flashlight, I get a glimpse of the beast before me, just before the flashlight dies
>I slowly walk backwards, all I can see is the whites of it's eyes
>Only fear and sadness is in my mind right now
>Backing up as it follows me growling, I slip on a puddle of water and land on my back
>With the pain of it all, the cold water all over me, the growling of the beast, and the knowledge that I was going to die, I cried
>And suddenly the growling stopped, yet my tears dropped even faster
>I jump at the feeling of a paw on my back, but I am soon lifted into the air
>"Human not cry. Me make human good."
>I'm horrified as the beast carries me away, and I am brought into a cave
>It soon lies next to me and hold me close
>The warmth of the fur would save me from hypothermia
>I don't know why this she-beast saved me, but I only thank her as I whimper
>"Human no thank. Human need warm. Human now mate."
>I soon fall asleep as I lie with this bear beast, happy that she decided to spare me
>Even the pain in my arm feels lesser as I am next to her presence, perhaps this isn't as bad as I thought it would be

>Made into a servant for a famous mercenary
>She wants more than just a servant
>Well, fuck

Among the most critical relationship roles between human beings and anthropomorphs is that of a foundational sort; overseeing what lacks in capability, and allowing the maturation of a trust system observed from the beginning of life to the end. In this way, life is permitted to continue in the purest sense that a female can express, with a nipple in another being's mouth to beget. A Freudian approach, and yet one so poignant as to inspire an entirely new outlook on love, itself. Where humans go, anthros shall follow. And where men hunger, milk shall flow.
This is the naturality of the world.

>human girlfriend dumps you, says you're a loser and you're just dragging her down
>next night she gets a text from your phone
>it's a pic your cock being licked and kissed by some stacked she-wolf
>the next is your face being shoved into her groin, servicing her cookie
>then a comes a video of you on your back, eyes rolled into the back of your head as you get pounded into the mattress
>sultry, husky voice asks you to say hi, but all you can manage is desperate, breathy moans and whimpers as your cock is milked
>the final pic is of you, asleep on a pair of huge, soft wolf tiddies, accompanied by a single text
>'thanks for the free husband, skank'

>Walking home from the clinic
>My arm is in a cast, I damaged it in a workplace incident
>To make it home before dark, I take a shortcut through a yeen neighborhood
>Not the best idea, but I was tired
>Partway through, I hear a whistle
>"Hey! What's a cutie like you doing here?"
>I turn around, a hyena girl is walking towards me, eying my crotch
>Attempting to put out a response, I only stutter
>But her glare of lust turns to worry when she sees my cast
>"Woah. Hey little guy, you alright?"
>I tell her that I'm just heading home
>And she walks right up to me, picks me up, and makes me tell her where my house is
>I open the door, and she runs in, closing it
>She spends the night in my house, taking care of me
>But eventually, she decides she wants payment for this
>So she tosses me onto the bed, and rides me all night long
>And that's how I met my wife

consider
>you, a human boy
>stuffed under a kotatsu, with anthro ladies all around
>its hot and you have the biggest softest paw pads/feed pressing and rubbing against every inch of your body as the sit about enjoying themselves on wine
>and occasionally one of them slips her foot in your mouth

>Wolves get nuts during a full moon
>Poor Anon has a wolf wife
>Spends the night with the roughest sex there is
>Biting, slashing, pelvis destroying, the ultimate show of power for her, the ultimate show of submission for him
>Wakes up to his wife freaking out about the cuts, and crying for him not to leave her
>Sighing, he assures her he isn't, after all, Anon did his research
>And throughout the day, his wife helps him whenever possible
>Whether it be treating his wounds, making his favorite meals, or cuddling
>But she'll get payment for this at the end of the night
>But with her being gentle out of fear from hurting poor Anon once more
>And so ends one moon cycle, leaving it to repeat, so, so many more times

>anon bringing his girlfriend to introduce to his parents
>they expect some cute human girl to show up
>they only hear the loud motorcycle as they come to greet you
>tall ass hyena significantly larger than you
>her arm around you and your head brushing her breast and under her armpit as you introduce your girlfriend.

>Mother is glad because she will soon be grandmother
>boomer dad just cracks open his monster ultralight and thinks you have good taste
>Everything is wholesome as you hug your gf rides you two home afterwards on her motorcycle
>once home she will ride you in the bed instead

>Anthros create special "submissive girls" bars to lure in guys
>They wear sexy clothes and call the men "master"
>In reality it's to give men a false sense of security and they can bring them to a bed room and slap a collar on those uppity men

>See man in suit drinking quietly
>"Oh, hello master, may I help you?"
>He stutters and stammers about only being here for a friend, he 'doesn't do the master stuff', and 'I don't want to bother you'
>Suddenly the need to bring a humie down to earth is erased by the need to take him to a back room
>So, you give him the time of his life, plus a phone number and a bite mark to remember you by
>Anon is now yours

>friend decides to throw birthday party at the new “submissive girl” bar that recently opened
>friend and mutuals all decide to go to get some poon
>anon decides to tag along, figuring that perhaps it wouldn’t be too bad having someone to unload some burdens on
>anon finds a cute wolf girl and spills his guts to her
>meanwhile all the other patrons disappear one by one
>toward the end of the night anon notices he is the only one left of his group and decides that they all left without him
>thanks the wolf girl for helping him and sets out to leave
>wolf gal quickly grabs his arm before he reaches the door and practically drags him to the back rooms, stating that she needs to show him something urgently
>the moment they reach a back room that looks like a mini lounge she slams the door shut and pounces on anon
>she curls anon into her lap and starts running her paws through his hair telling him everything is going to be all right and that he will be safe and happy with her.

>giant ass gnoll warriors with flimsy loincloths that leave nothing to the imagination

>"Slow down please. Mmf..."

>"Ah! P-please slow doaaaaahh!"
>"I can't hear yoooou~" WHAPWHAPWHAPWHAPWHAP

>It's an urban legend that all humies need to survive is lots of love, cuddles, and sexual fluids for sustinence
>It's not too uncommon for humies to be admitted to hospitals for severe dehydration for this reason
> Local governments have had to hold meetings, press conferences and put out PSA ads to try and stop this harmful rumor

>Your name is anon and lately life hasn’t been so great
>in fact so great that your most prominent what if fantasy isn’t being famous or getting revenge
>it’s killing yourself
>not for attention… or at least you don’t think so
>but because living just sucked
>with every moment being alive and conscious being disorienting, hopeless and painful
>like that feeling that
>Granted up to now you didn’t really believe you were actually gonna do it but you still made plans
>plans in the same vein as zombie apocalypse survival or winning the lottery but plans none the less.
>mostly because you’d feel horrible for making the very few people who cared about you sad
>even if they were currently on the other side of the country
>but you still wrote a will, not that you owned much of interest
>and you even had a location and everything.
>on a bridge between two buildings on an east west access
>at either sunrise or sunset
>with a rope.
>you hadn’t bought the rope yet
>not that you hadn’t tried
>it’s just that you always found an excuse not to get said rope,
>like you had taxes to do, or had to throw your garbage out, or vote.
>sometimes you wondered if you put this shit off just because part of you wanted another excuse to stay alive
>but now you had everything out of the way..
>and a big enough fight with your folks back home that they hopefully wouldn’t be that sad
>you’re finally going to buy that fucking rope
>you show up at the store after spending about an hour on amazon checking for items frequently bought with nylon rope
>the money didn’t really matter now, you wouldn’t be needing anymore than two drachmas anyways.
>you made sure to bring a backpack too, one for convenience and two carrying a rope around might get you accused of planning a hate crime.
>and telling people “Oh no this is just to kill myself with.” Isn’t the greatest excuse
>you climb the stairs avoiding eye contact with everyone, with your huge ass backpack
>as said it’s early enough that there aren’t many people here yet, so you shouldn’t draw that much attention
>you reach the bridge after passing by the mandatory indoor starbucks which was amazingly still closed
>now you’re here,
>looking 10 stories down.
>if the rope breaks the fall will kill you instantly
>This is it luigi
>You begin to tie the rope, it’s a lot harder than it was practicing at home
>maybe it’s because of nerves, maybe it’s because it’s cold and wet and miserable compared to your apartment.
>plus the fact that you’re actually tying it to something isn’t helping
>in fact it takes you about a good ten minutes to get it set up and stable.
>time flies when you’re having fun
>then you here a holler from below you
>oh fuck the onlookers are here
>it starts as one voice but soon it’s a cacophony of strangers saying they care about you and have something to live for.
>of course what they really care about is being able to sleep at night and not having any guilt of blood being on their hands/
>hell, half of them are probably waiting for someone to insult you just so they have someone to blame besides themselves if you go through with it.
>none of these people would have given you a single fucking ounce of attention before this,
>nice to know they’d at least feel bad for killing someone though
>as you put the noose around your neck and look down one last time you see one of them bend over, kick their legs
>and then start climbing the building
>not rush into the building or rush towards the stairway
>no this person is actually climbing the outside of the building
>and they’re making damn good time, about a story a minute.
>you stop due to your instinctual curiosity overwhelming your drive for self termination as the figure gets clearer and clearer
>they’re an anthro for one thing, judging by the fact the tail and the covering of blondish white fur on the parts not covered by their jacket an pants.
>by the way the tanktop is jiggling and the hips are swaying you can also tell this anthro is a she
>still not sure what species though a cat maybe, no she climbs differently
>a racoon? No tail’s wrong
>Either way you’re going to find out soon enough
>you turn around to look back at the crowd formed on the other side of the causeway.
>when you look back down the figure is gone..
> “Hey.”
>You’re startled by the voice causing you to jump just a bit closer to the fence.
>judging by the fact it’s a woman’s voice this is probably the woman who climbed the building to see you.
>you turn slowly before locking your gaze with two big, brown and yellow eyes.
>On a mostly hairless muzzle flanked by long straight hair.
>she’s a monkey.. or maybe a tarsier or a lemur or something
>certainly not an ape because she has a tail
>admittedly primatology was never your strong suit
>she’s seems to be a couple inches taller than you, though neither of you is exactly standing up straight.
>she’s wearing skinny jeans which certainly couldn’t help with the climbing
>a Japanese style motorcycle jacket
>and a blitzkid tank top that was just small enough to reveal a little too much of her boobs and way too much of her stomach.
>her expression is casual but with a hint of concern
>nothing like the hysterical displays going on below you
>you wait around 30 seconds for her to break the silence, her hair being blown by the wind.
>”So..” she asks in that same light contralto she startled you with, “what exactly brought you up here?” her casual tone still present.
>”If this is some kinda publicity stunt, you can fuck off!”
>You say with a surprising bit of venom which still doesn’t seem to phase her
>She blinks a few times before leaning further back onto the railing her tail swinging back and forth lazily.
>”No just curious.”
>you slump over sighing
>”It-it’s a long story.”
>she swipes some of her long hair out of her face with one of her similarly bare hands.
>”I have time.”
>You take the noose off your neck letting, throwing it aside over the railing
>the crowd cheers
>”So you aren’t gonna do it?” She asks, a little surprise seeping into her voice
>You shake your head
>”No.. it’s a long story and.. and if you wanna hear I guess I might as well tell you.”
>She straightens up with freakish agility before taking a few steps closer.
>”Can you tell me somewhere more comfortable?”
>You hesitate before looking back at the hanging noose sans cadavers
>”I can leave the rope here if it helps, in case you decide you uh, wanna go back afterwards.”
>You nod as she walks to the door and opens it for you expectantly
>
>the walk back is uneventful save for the bit where she had to go outside to get her shoes back
>about the only person she acknowledged was the smiling Doberman cop who was handing her back said shoes.
>besides that the two of you stayed mostly silent as you make your way to the back of a building towards a garish green Kawasaki.
>you were a little taken back on accepting a ride from a complete stranger
>even one who did save your life.
>”Hop on.” She says brusquely
>”But.. But I don’t even know your name!”
>”You said you were willing to go with me somewhere more comfortable.”
>She looks at you expectantly and a bit annoyed
> “I thought you meant inside the building!”
>She huffs
> “It’s Tara, now are you going to get on or what?”
>fuck it, it’s not like you can go back and finish the job now.
>”Uhh.. my name is anon by the way.”
> “Nice to meet you anon.” and with that the two of you are off with Tara at the front and you riding bitch
>The way she drives is terrifying, almost running a red, cutting off trucks and hitting every yellow light in town
>but the feeling of her tail wrapped around you and your hands dig it into her waist make it somewhat comforting
>feeling her back shake with calm breaths through her jacket.
>Her long hair hitting your face
>for once in your life you sort of feel… nice
>the bike jerks to a halt in front of coffee shop, it’s on the other side of the downtown area
>”Can I at least get a drink?’
>She shakes her head still not looking towards you as she dismounts, her tail movements causing you to lose balance briefly.
>”Alcohol is a depressant.”
>”I mean if it bothers you I can pay for it.” You say feebly
>”I’m paying.”
>with the way she said it you didn’t feel like arguing
>once again she opens the door for you
>and they say chivalry is dead
>the place isn’t too full, about ten other people in a place that looks like it can seat thirty,
>there’s an empty stage with a microphone and some amps, with the obligatory overdrawn octopus mural behind it
>you decide to sit in the booth across from it, it gives you something to focus on before Tara gets back
>maybe you should go to places like this, when the bands are actually playing
>no, that’s dumb
>you were the wrong kind of pretentious pseudo intellectual
>not that they’d hate you
>just you’d have nothing in common and they’d drift off as usual
>Tara is back carrying two beverages and a brown bag which she deposits in front of you before taking her seat
>she takes off her jacket brushing it aside with her tail
>she’s naturally lanky, but decently filled out though what’s fur, fat or muscle is hard to get.
> “You could’ve asked me what I wanted..”
>”You wanted Alcohol, besides it’s an Americano.”
>you stare at her confused
>”What?”
>”Americanos are the middle ground of coffee, everyone is neutral on them.. I also got you scone.”
>You pull it out
> it’s blueberry
>”You could’ve asked if I had any allergies.”
>She leans back again and blows on her hair
>”Well you were gonna kill yourself twenty minutes ago so I doubt you’re very health conscious.”
>she pauses looking at the way you grab the pastry
>”Besides it was cheap.”
>you don’t respond instead choosing to greedily devour the scone between slurps of coffee
>prepping for suicide must really be draining on the stomach.
>she sipped her Coffee with a level of dignity and collectedness you weren’t even able to pull off right now
>”So what’d make a guy like you want to do it like that?”
>if not for the context it would sound like a pick up line
>You swallow
>”A guy like me?”
>you’re incredulous
>”Am I too good looking for suicide?”
>she leans back looking you over, her tail still moving lazily
>”Well you just don’t seem like the hanging type..”
>You were beginning to get irritated again at her nonchalant demeanor and her
>”Do you think I was faking?!”
> “No you seemed pretty legit.”
>She put her hands on the table clasped as if she was a detective telling you why every theory on a murder suspect you had was wrong.
>”For one most hanging deaths are done by people in there 40s to 60s at home. Most people your age try pills.. or a gun.”
> “You seem to know an awful lot about this.”
>she takes another sip of her coffee.
>”Let’s say this isn’t my first rodeo.”
>you can detect a bit of sadness in her face before she goes back to her neutral but determined expression.
>”Well to answer your question I don’t own any handguns, and the highest point in my apartment is about 9.. maybe ten feet.”
>you had once thought about using your dad’s old shotgun but with the recoil, you doubted you could pull it off clean.
>”That doesn’t explain why you didn’t choose an overdose, and seeing as you were serious and not just an attention seeker that means you-“
>You cut her off still miffed about her empirical tone
>”I had a negative history with drugs.”
>”By the way you say that.. I’m guessing it was very bad right?”
>she seems a bit more empathetic now, her eyes are wide open and her eyebrows are raised
>”Let’s just say those memories are just another thing I was trying to escape.”
>”Well you said you’d tell me.”
>She had a point, and with that you started..
>Tara had not taken a single sip for your entire story
>her calm demeanor replaced with genuine shock as you finished up the story of the last few years.
>”27..” she muttered, “Jesus, no wonder you wanted to kill yourself.”
>it was like she had gotten second hand shellshock
>”Uh huh. Anyways now that you know my deal, can I leave.”
> “Where?” she asks, “you’re five miles away with no ride back besides me.”
>”I’ll walk or take a bus or something.”
>she snorts rolling her eyes
>“Do you really want to get away from me that much?”
>you’d say yes, but that wouldn’t be the right or true.
>she’d done more for you in an hour than most people had done for you in years
>You shake your head, eyes cast towards the remains of your scone, “No.. no It’s not that.”
>”Then why?”
>that was a good point why did part of you want to leave?
>was it a defense mechanism, did you leave the stove on? Or did part of you just want to finish the job?
> “I-I don’t really know.”
>You gather your thoughts
> “Maybe it’s because you wouldn’t have given a shit about me if I wasn’t up there- I mean as much as both of us would like to think this means anything. I can guarantee we’ll stop talking in a month and I’ll be right back up there.”
>”Well that’s one reason for me not to loose touch with you.” She says with just an ounce of sarcasm
> “Yeah but I just.. I’m tired of relationships made up of guilt and obligation. Yknow. And I can get those from multiple people besides you.”
> “Boring people don’t go that far with suicide attempts.”
>”So you have some kind of fetish for this?” You ask taken aback, the last drop of Americano in your mouth turning a bit sour.
> “God no..” She says waving her hands as she realized the distress she was causing, “It’s just that a lot of interesting people committed suicide, Mark Rothko, Van Gogh, Patrick Bruce. Not even counting the amount who attempted.”
> “That’s a lot of abstract painters.” You say noticing the pattern
>”Yeah well I’m an artist. Besides how do you know that they’re all painters?”
>a bit of the tense feeling leaves your body with this revelation of what may be a bit of common ground.
>”What kind?” You ask now genuinely interested.
>She takes her first drink in a while lifting her head up as the coffee goes down like her non anthropomorphic kin
>”Tatoo. But I try to paint in my free time.”
>you wonder if she could even get tattoos, well maybe on her face stomach and hands
>though from little you gleaned about her it seemed doubtful she’d go for that kinda thing.
>”I assume you do something too.”
>”Well we’re doing something now.”
>You couldn’t resist messing with her for her imprecise words.
>”I mean art.” She was now a bit frustrated
>”How could you tell?”
>she takes another sip almost gargling it in her mouth
>”The fact you didn’t immediately ask if I could paint you.”
> You nod, you’ve definitely had enough people accost you when brought your sketchbook around town, sometimes going as far as to shove money in your face just for a picture that they would inevitably be insulted by.
>”I’m an architect.. or at least I work at an architecture firm.”
>”Really?” Her ears perk up
>”That’s actually really badass.”
>You smirk a bit finding her excitement both amusing and endearing
>”Trust me it isn’t.”
>"It probably beats drawing skulls on fat dads and horses on sorority girls."

>acquaintance of yours became sick and gave you his ticket for a week on cruise ship. For modest fee of course
>your cabin is below the car deck one of the cheaper ones
>still you had time for it and the for how little you had to pay wasn't that bad
>There were lot of affluent anthros on the ship.
>CEOs, Capitalist sharks (some literally) and other wealthy and powerful people
>head for the bar in the evening
>pricy but just order few and then head for the dutyfree store to buy cheap alcohol and head for your cabin
>that was the plan, but you notice two dragon anthros looking at you
>before you snap out your thought they are already heading your table
>they said you looked lonely and asked if you could keep them company
>little shamed you just admit that this place isn't really on your budget limit
>better come out clean than spill spaghetti later
>They say that isn't a problem and they offer to pay the bill
>ok then. Try to say that you don't need anything expens...
>Champagne, luxurious brand costing up your monthly income

>The two scaled beauties see you acting anxious like everything around you would be broken from lightest touch
>The purple dragoness embraces you in to a hug, your head nestled between her large bosom
>”aren’t you just precious! Don’t be scared. You will be safe with us~”
>Soon the blue one followed her partners and hugged you from behind. You are now buried under large scaled orbs
>They fall and pull you with them on the bed
>It doesn’t take them long to remove their clothes
>You are greeted by slimy and hot touch of their tongues on your cheek
>the purple one takes her time to pull down your pants while the blue one opens your buttoned shirt in more aggressive manner
>finally something snaps inside your head as you let them completely take control of you
>both of them seem to enjoy your reactions
>The purple one enjoys your moans as she teases you while slowly milking your member
>The blue one has a large grin on her face as she pounds on you with her whole strength and you can’t help but pant in exhaustion
>You lost count how many orgasm you had that night
>scratch that. It seems that your one week cruise is over
>you spent the whole week in their room with small food and drink breaks, some sleep and lot of time founding out on how many surfaces they can fuck you on
>They leave you on their room as when you return to the dock, but not before giving you a parting kiss and saying you will meet again
>…
>after few days your vacation is over and you return your job
>you hear that your workplace is under new management
>soon you are called to the office to meet the new bosses
>You meet the familiar dragons again
>”From now on you will be working directly under us, your station is our room”
>One licks her lips while the other bites her lower lip

Reminder: Humie boys are small and thus don't produce sizeable loads, so multiple orgasms from this is necessary for reliable impregnation. Simply ignore their cries for mercy. Also, it's scientifically proven incessant teasing will get them to produce larger loads.

>Trudging into your home, you nearly collapsed at the door. A few steps into the towards the bedroom and you'd already lost your boots and coats, and ditched your pants on the way on to your bed. Laying on your back and inspecting the insides of your eyelids with dull disinterest, you heard her.
>"Well someones home late." She said in a tone halfway between banter and bedroom talk. Cracking open an eye to look at her, a pleasant sight greeted you.
>Your Badger wife, wearing nothing but an undershirt that hugged her broad yet curvaceous form with affection, and nothing else. Her crotch covered in a healthy bush of soft badger fur. She marched over to you and clambered up on to the bed. She was barely shorter then you, to be expected of a Badger, but she was broader then you by far. Her arms were broader then yours, and not for lack of trying on your part.
>Staring into her half-lidded eyes past her snout as she laid on top of you, you could already smell her.
>That Badger musk that had occupied at least some part of your mind since first you met her. Feminine yet strong, pleasant and overpowering all in one, it was a scent you instantly connected to the sensation of pleasure.
>"I was working myself all day waiting for you, and those shitheads at your job kept you late, didn't they?"
>Words failed as she fished your stiffening dick out of your pants and let it throb to length inbetween her well-padded thighs, so you settled for a grunt of affirmation.
>"Forget about them for now hubby" she said breathily, speaking directly in your ear as she began to hump at your cock, feeling her soaked puss grind against your dick, noting the small little nub that was her clitoris sliding up and down your member.
>"I want you to think about nothing but me." She said, her smile audible as she picked up the pace and started huffing at your scent as she stuck that sensitive badger snout into the neck of your shirt, even as she painted over your musk with her own needy humping.

>You've been in this situation before
>Pinned beneath the weight of her dense frame, all thick muscle and padded fur as she pampers your dick with her thighs
>You're just a sensory treat for her like this, your every inch grinding against her pussy, your scent being huffed like a drug, your sweat being licked off in between long pulls of your smell, and her ears perking up as she enjoyed every grunt and whimper as your cock turned the nicest shade of overstimulated red while buried between the incredibly soft and form-hugging fur of her thighs.
>You try to resist making noise, to suppress the urge to buck your hips forward, to give her any indication that you were close as she gleefully humped away.
>But all it took was the incessant pulsing of your cockhead to tip her off. She leaned back, breaking off contact with your member and fixing you in her predatory gaze.
>"Aww, you thought you could hide that from me? You should know better by now hubby~"
>Every syllable was sweet as honey, even as she flashed fangs with a villainous smile.
>She slid back, placing your dick against the soft fur of her belly as a long badger-claw traced the curve of your cockhead as she looked at it with animal hunger. With an impeccable eye for detail she waited until the urge to cum had subsided, before dragging her hips up your length with agonizing slowness before sslloowlly taking every throbbing inch inside of her, eyes tilting upwards and cute badger teeth biting her lip as her pussy spasmed around every inch, tight internal muscles gripping down on you, your cock pushing past those tight bundles of flesh and nerve as she swallowed up everything you had.
>Sitting now, fully impaled on your cock and staring down at you fully transfixed by pleasure, she smiled.
>"Now why would you want to finish between my thighs..."
>"And not inside me?"

>badger gf about to go into heat
>start preparing a week in advance

>random anthros from acclaimed actresses to politicians and random citizens inbetween are all unknowingly implanted and monitored with experimental technology which stimulates their responses and opinions towards humans on demand, known as "Suggesters"
>it's all part of a highly confidential governmental plan to further encourage human on anthro breeding and general relations, all covertly founded and sponsored by the various proud anthro wives of human elites
>to outstanding results
>despite the success, years of conspiracy theories are all but confirmed as one prominent anthro senator running for presidential office seemingly has a meltdown during a live debate, the result of a glitched Suggester, suddenly screaming aloud about "needing to sheath some fat humie dick" while stripping and aggressively raping one of the young human cameramen
>all in front of a terrified audience
>she's eventually carted off by security and the media promptly buries the event in plausible deniability, bold-faced lies and misdirection as the government quietly scraps the remainders of their plan, all before it can go global
>a process that takes many years and billions of dollars in planning
>not long after the incident, reports of people being assaulted and violently molested spiked around many of the nature trails and outdoor rec areas, all in the late afternoon or night and all against lone, notably unclaimed human males, with similar accounts of being bitten and scratched after being suddenly tackled from behind by a furred female assailant, where they were then forced to engage in sexual acts ranging from stimulation to penetration
>needless to say, the senator was never heard from again

>Pushing her hips out, grinding herself into her humans face she smiled.
>"Do a good job and I'll share my beer with you."
>She grunted as he picked up the pace, already becoming familiar with what she liked and seemingly eager to please.
>"Fuck, you can't even look at human women the same anymore, can you?"
>No response, just a dutifully working tongue
>"You live for this cunt, don't you?"
>A pause, then his hands gripped her thighs tighter and he began to work even faster
>"Nngh. O-oh yeah. Work it hun, you know I'm right."
>His thumb found it's way to her clit and began to rub in small circles
>She sighed, groaned, and let her newest toy keep working.
>Inbetween her thighs, the humans face was as red as could be
>It wasn't the fact that he was eating her out
>It's that his cock had never been harder then it was right now

>have a large gender imbalance with more females than males
>females tend to be aggresive when courting a male and will tend to just pick one up before proposing sex
>very heavy on scent and licking with their large long tongues
>due to the size difference and lack of males to go around the females have a sort of crop/false stomach they will keep a male in so another female can't steal them
>since they've moved past the tribal phase the crop is now more just a pleasurable spot to keep males and show off to other females when full
>the crop is very sensitive and the females can tell a lot about the male they have in theirs
>heartbeat, taste, awake or asleep, small movements, health, etc
>is coated in thick slime/slavia that also coats the tongue and throat to make it easier to swallow and spit out the male

>take special care with virginity and taking it

>they can fit human males small enough in their crops too

>It is a known fact that human hyena hybrids are highly viable, healthy and combine the best attributes of both species. Unfortunately human blood is rather week and hyena genes very dominant, so a clan needs a very steady supply of human breeding stock in order to not let human admixture not dissipate and for a clan to remain competetive on the savanna. Of course the clans are competing with each other to secure the best and the most human males to procreate with, which makes human seed the most prized resource of the steppe.
>All human genes become recessive with a Hyena mate.
>Not only they can physically dominate human males easily but human genetic were also wired in such way that they always get overwritten by hyena genes
>This results in male humans only able to procreate more hyena females and in consequence forces hyena tribes to depend on the male population of human settlements
>Basically, every 5 years or less, hyena amazon tribes have to raid human villages and "harvest" their males to turn them into sex slave or husband trophies, this is done to ensure the tribe mantains a certain number of births per year, otherwise they go extinct.
>Female anthro prey species like zebras, giraffes or gazelles who can live along perfectly with humans as their genes are more adaptable have to endure and watch powerless how their human husbands get dragged into the gangbang of fem Hyenas to forever be lost.
>Due to that, the anthro-human villages encourage their prey females to consummate their marriage with their human mate as soon as as possible, conceiving all the children they can before the next hyena raid begin.

Most of the stories of the Hyenas being cruel and barbaric and even prone to consuming human flesh are stories spread to prevent males from engaging in peaceful contact with the hyenas and being seduced into marrying a hyena and joining her clan voluntarily. Hyenas are indeed very physical and at times violent, but they have their softer and more social aspects. Many accounts of human males integrated into a clan described their lives as harsh and straining, but at the same time wholesome and fulfilling.
With the discovery of the outstanding qualities of the crossbreeds the clans started to pursue human suitors very actively. Eventually losing more and more manpower in these foreign lands the humans by decrees stopped dealing with the hyenas directly as much as possible.
With most human settlements and merchant enclaves at the shore of the continent having enforced complete segregation from the Hyenas, the once steady birth of hybrid cubs subsided. Unwilling to lose their edge against hostile clans, other locals and the new arrivals, the clans recruiting mates by more forceful means.
Human mates being in short supply has made a human male and the cubs fathered by them an immensely valuable asset, both practically and as a status symbol.
Hyenas demand complete submission from their mates. They consider the semen of a fertile human male to be so valuable that masturbation and subsequent waste of the precious substance is rather offensive. This is not too much of a problem since Hyenas are not adverse to recreational sex and some are rather forthcoming with it. Some of the more gentle and generous hyena females relieve their males without wasting their precious seed by extracting it orally. In some clans the human semen are used for tribal religious ceremonies and such. Since the hybrids have such favorable attributes over the purebloods, human semen in most clans is seen as an essentially magical substance. Mythology varies widely from clan to clan, but a widespread belief is that human men were created by the hyena gods and ancestors as a reward for their strength, bravery and virtue. In this line of belief the sole purpose of the human male's existence is to breed with very best of hyenakind and ascend the species to new heights. That explains why some clans are rather forceful with their pursuit and capture human men. From their point of view they are simply taking what was theirs all along.

What do anthro women look for in a human slave?

Well, obviously they'd want them to be obedient and follow orders, but it probably comes down to what they intend to use them for. If they planned of keeping them as a sex slave, they'd probably want someone young and virile. Someone who's eager enough to submit and be used for their mistresses pleasure. Or maybe, they'd like their human to be feisty like >>34452945 said and determined to fight back, so that they can have the satisfaction of overpowering their human with force and ''breaking them in''.

Young - Naïve, never fully capitulates between falling face first into her corruption and being a wide-eyed doe to everything she proposes. An open mind with high consideration, to catch her fawning over his genial tendencies with an iron-clad poker face that he'll seldom see beneath. Moderate height with a greater preference for shorter boys than taller. Likely will share at least one habit with her father or brother(s) when applicable, and expresses a situational bravado which will usually be overturned. Sanitary habits vary depending on the animal and individual. Massive cuddleslut. Finally, someone easily relatable to the fears of quarter-life crises and relatively comparable in worldly outlook and understanding, making life far more interesting for a young couple.
Old - Vigorous, lively and not without a sharp mouth... but has his share of weaknesses that keep him acquiescent, which she plays on like a kid with a microwave. Generally higher standards, neat, physically active and outgoing, collegiate/grad or tradesman as a minimum but also ignorant to many of life's intricacies, which she will proudly instruct him on. Age range leans towards the younger end as a result, although older males are acceptable once in a blue moon, he must never exceed her age. Tall boys are especially fancied by shorter anthros, who find their situation somewhat akin to a grown man visiting his mother. Easily receptive to spiciness, more accepting of equal displays of raunchiness in private and loves nothing more than taking the brunt of her body on top of him, which he will handle easily.
Both - Enjoys movies, gossip and the smell of freshly-cleaned fur.

>wolf wife has tough exterior personality, rough with you physically, blunt with you verbally, loves you dearly, essentially tsundere
>you love it
>your wife having sharp claws at the end of her digits and being exponentially stronger than you, accidents are bound to happen
>bruises and claw marks/cuts are a regular occurence that you enjoy, athough the pain is significant in a couple instances you hide and savor your pain(pleasure?). Your wife always apologetic when discovering them, often visibly upset, almost to tears, that she hurt you. You feel shameful in secretly enjoying both the punishment and the moments you get to hold and comfort your powerful wife in these rare moments her soft soul is revealed, assuring her you're healthy and hardly felt a thing in soothing whispers, massaging her muscles, kissing and petting her head and neck as she reclines into you.
>As time passes the interval between her injuring you increases from both her conscious effort and your growing familiarity with each other, to your dismay, but thankfully accidents are bound to happen when your wife is a killing machine
>After playfully teasing your wife on an occasion your wife goes to shove, or jostle you, in the moment she misjudges the distance between the two of you, adding far more power required for the shorter than thought space between you and her. For a brief second you think you've hit the love lottery as her right hand strikes down your face, in the next second realizing something is off.
>You see your wife's face is horrified, her jaw agape. This expression from your tough wife is alien to you, and you have the sudden realization you cant see clearly. You're a bit shocked. All five claws from her right hand have carved a deep gash down the left side of your face, from the eyebrow, down across the eye, the cheek, and almost to the jawline. The five new valleys drowning the side of your face.
>Your wife begins to panic, tears welling in eyes, fumbling over words explaining it as an accident. She moves to grab you but you stop her not wanting to stain her coat with blood.
>Fast Forward a few days later. You meet her in the waiting room. Face swelled but stitched up, covered by medical dressing. The doctor informing you the deep scarring would almost certainly be permanent. Your eyesight now permanently gone in the left eye. You lie to her, telling her your eyesight is intact, afraid she will become too distraught. The two of you arrive home a short while after. You're wife breaking down into sobs as soon as you get through the door. Falling on her knees begging you not to leave her, promising to never hurt you again. You are in shock, your stomach rolling over. You have never seen your wife vulnerable, her hard exterior completely gone. You reach down to lift her up, while coaxing her to her feet, knowing you cant lift the big wolf to her feet. Once standing you lead her to a sitting area still distraught. Inwardly you feel sick seeing your wife so upset. You begin the process of comforting her. Drying her tears, and stroking her with all the love you can muster, even holding her hand at some points. You tell her how much she means to you, how much you love her, and then confess your dirty secret; you're a glutton for punishment, and have always loved her marking your body with scars and how you have relished comforting her in the times she was upset from marking you. She accuses you of being ridiculous, of lying, but you recount some of the many times you've been guilty of relishing the opportunity to comfort her raw emotion from loving you. You tell her the truth, that you're honestly grateful for the new scars on your face. They serve as a clear mark for anyone to see you belong to her.

imagine some special benefits for living with/dating an anthro
>government gives reptiles reduced heating bills due their coldblooded biology
>cold environment species also get deals on cooling bills
>large species get special deals on buying bulk amounts of food to support them and housing deals for scaled up housing
>dating a ferret means you can get registered as her heat relief support and get more days off work/school so you can fuck and prevent her from literally dying from not having sex
>housing by sources of water are cheaper for aquatic anthros
>free access to high quality self produce produce like milk, wool, coffee beans, or silk depending on species

I mean the human deserved it for raising the provincial taxes. No shit he gets revolts against his ass. But he is lucky that he rules one of the more rural provinces. I heard the nobility in the capital got it worse.

There various different flavors of rape worthy humans that appeal to different types of anthros. Some of these include
>The Wallflower: Shy, timid, soft spoken. Easily intimated into doing what he's told and won't put up much of a fight beyond begging her to stop. Due to low self esteem he might fall into self-loathing for not being strong enough to fight back, but can also be won over with some affection and compliments.
>The Brat: Loud, arrogant, opinionated, and maybe just a smidge bigoted, his abrasiveness and vulgarity just scream 'fuck me till I learn my place'. Will definitely try to put up a fight, even if he's hopelessly outmatched, will scream insults and slurs at his rapist, even as she mounts him wring hot load after hot load out of him. Will eventually breakdown into a sobbing mess, whimpering how much he hates her.
>The Oblivious Tease: Kinda dumb, sort of like himbo (male bimbo) Dresses in a ways that seem slutty to anthros but doesn't realize it. Unknowingly puts himself in lewd and comprising positions. Probably won't feel to bad about it, he's too dumb to feel sad.

>new years party at the base
>your company CO and XO both get wasted and start manhandling you
>the lieutenant you could understand, seeing as how she's always been the flirty, bubbly type
>but the captain really surprised you, she's always been such a grim faced hardass and desu she scares you a little bit
>seeing her drunken smile is actually kinda unnerving
>but she was the one to shove your face into her massive bosom and call you cute, while the lieutenant nibbled on your and felt up your goods
>they end up dragging you back to...well you're not quite sure whose room it is exactly
>the night is a sloppy, steamy blur, they take turns between riding your cock and riding your face, and with either of them alternating to licking your shaft and gobbling your sack
>wake up the next morning, head pounding and pelvis bruised, sandwiched between the two of them
>your face is buried snuggly in the captai-Peggy's uber soft chesticles, while Lt. Thott spoons you, still cupping your twig and berries

>Anthros are always using nonhuman sounds
>Whether it be a simple growl of anger, or affectionate purring
>But lately this bovine girl has been following me around
>And she's been awfully quiet
>Something has to be up, so I get lost in thought worrying about her
>Is she a stalker? A mugger planning something? What's her game?
>Being so lost in thought, I don't notice a can on the floor, leading to my clumsy ass falling down quicker than Malaysia Airlines flight 370
>As I try to pick myself up, I hear a quick series of footsteps behind me, before a hand grabs my back and pulls me up
>I notice it's the bovine girl, and I'm surprised by her kindness, all the women I knew back in the human only districts would look at me in annoyance
>Before I can apologize, she makes only one sound, somewhat stereotypical for her species.
>Moo
>Goddamn, take me home and hug me, please

Higher educational establishments, particularly preparatory, often take pride in the honors provided by their staff and alumni volunteers; dauntlessly following in the footsteps of tens of generations established by Anthro-Human traditions. It is here we may observe one rite practiced since antiquity; the so-called "Penis inspection day" whereupon the active male student body is grouped into sections relative to their future educators, these sections being known as "Claims," and are then tasked with disrobing and presenting themselves en masse to the assigned "Mistress," that is, teacher, who also bares herself. This activity has been valued as cornerstone in establishing a perfectly healthy, natural and personal relationship between pupil and preceptor, while aiding in the erasure of anxieties and body inequality so that each child may develop at an optimal rate. Afterwards, each student is filed into a line and faced Eastward, where they are individually addressed by their superior, who is provided each boy's name, age and a personal interest or hobby. Following introductions, the teacher places one hand underneath the student's genitals, allowing his testicles to lay flat atop her padded palms and applies two fingers extended lengthwise adjacent to either visible side of the penis, fingertips meeting at the base, producing a "V" sign. She then stimulates the young man into developing an erection by applying a pressure into the side of his base, alternating from one finger to another, slowly repeating the motion down his shaft, curling her fingers and reeling in until the tip is fully enclosed between both wrapped fingers and hidden beneath the palm.
This is repeated until total arousal is achieved, initiating the final step of fanning her wet nose with the boy's enlarged tip in order to acquaint herself with the male's most private scent, and an orgasm can be achieved via a more classic maneuver: ending with the stiff penis being inserted into the superior's mouth for a round of swift, studied fellatio, semen being fully consumed and consecrated pupil drinking from his teacher's heavy chest for a short period. It is not unusual to observe expressions of awe, jealousy and secondhand arousal in anticipation of one's turn, and boys are encouraged to stimulate their own sexes in preparation for this very intimate "inspection," establishing classroom hierarchy and full pleasantries in a culturally inclusive fashion, without regard for differing sizes, colors or functions. This marks just one of the many exciting displays of historical relations occurrent on the prestigious campuses of today.

>For her, that was the straw that broke the camel's back, as she begins to cry uncontrollably.
"I-I-Ahh-*breath* -I'm sorry." She sobbed out, breathing heavily between her words. "I-*breath*-I liked you-*breath*- and I didn't know-*breath*- what to do.
>There's a lot of pressure on my shoulders, as nearly the whole food court is staring at us. I feel a bit flustered, but I remember my practice.
>"Well, Maki I don't feel the same way. Now please, stop." I calmly say, as I get up and leave.
>Like a week ago, I felt the feeling of the weight of the world falling off my shoulders, slipping down my back, and disintegrating. It was near orgasmic. A feeling that could rarely be replicated.

Hours pass, and we spend the day playing games, as school was off. I was just on the couch next to Liz.

>"What is it?"

Ever since then, me and Liz always hung out, and did stuff together. We got along great, and we did eventually become more close, after we graduated. What we did after that... I'll leave that up to you.

Good stuff. I feel like living in an area where most of the anthro population are mustelids would be really "interesting", especially when they're in heat. I figure they'd be responsible for a lot of thirsty comments and DMs on humans' social media (not to mention tit pics out of nowhere).
Otters probably take advantage of their playful reputation to get away with shit that other anthros can't.
Despite being the shortest of mustelid anthros least weasels are probably among the most sexually voracious (and deceptively strong) - IRL they're absurdly tough and regularly take on animals bigger than them and win.
And imagine how smug ferrets are about being able to just grab any man they like off the street during mating season...

>he went through a growth spurt as well, but nothing like hers, she towered over him now, she was big enough now that she could just pick up like a little kid (he hates when she does that, but his reaction is too funny for to stop)

>he was sputtering and yelling, but she silenced his mouth with hers, while she ripped off his sweat pants, before slipping off her own shorts
>she let out pleased growl when she saw him twitching and throbbing
>the next few minutes were blur, all she could really make out was the bliss of feeling him inside her, his legs wrapping around her hips, and his voice crying out her name, before the best feeling in the world hit her like a freight train
>when she finally came back down to earth, she was still on top of him, panting, legs shaking, and a wonderful, warm, full feeling in her stomach
>his eyes were glazed over and rolled back, his tongue hung out as he panted and gasped, his trembling legs were still locked around her hips
>she had no idea what she had just done
>but whatever it was, it felt right
>when he finally came to, he was laying on something soft and warm
>he soon realized that he was laying atop his best friend, his head cushioned by her soft bosom, and her massive paw stroking up and down his back
>he then remembered what had happened
>the hot, tight embrace of her cunt, her voice growling out his name along with the word "mine" over and over again, her muscles flexing and tensing like spun steel underneath her fur
>he remembered crying out her name, just as he exploded inside her, and then his vision went white
>he craned his head to look up at her

I might have a few Ideas on how some of the females of armello would react to a human (they are probably shit though)
>Magna (wolf clan) would realize that since you are the only one of you're kind she would most likely protect you >from anyone who would try to take or harm you
>Sana (bear clan) would mostly see you as a Divine being from the Wyld and try to keep you pure from the Rot >and hide you from the dragon clan so they won't corrupt you (fertility rituals with wyldsingers and those most devoted to the wyld are included)
>Griotte (rat clan) being the butcher baroness she would hire some rats to kidnap you and turn you into her little >boytoy and possibly defile you in every way possible (at least the bed you will be chained to will be comfy)
>Oxana (Dragon clan) will try and convince you to follow in the path of the worm and say that the wyld isn't all that cracked up to be as they sacrifice Newborns in some of their rites (though magic cancer isn't any better)
>Agniya (dragon clan) would accompany Oxana to help kidnap you forcefully if you refuse (Think for a minute
giant turtle with an axe vs small human with no protection)

>sharp-fanged anthro has a fetish for eating donuts around a guy's erect penis
>and for how much they're always pissing themselves over the act
>picks up guys off the street and takes them back to her place to keep the experiences fresh
>always kind enough to finish them off afterwards, helping herself to all that tasty "glaze," along with any leftovers

>remote or extreme environment locations
>underwater sealab, antarctic base, ocean oil/drilling rig, remote space station/base, a lumbar mill up in the mountains, etc

Be you, anon
Married to your waifur
You have 4 daughters and they are your pride and joy.
you have no regrets about them, although you will admit a longing for the time when they weren’t yet born
A time in which you and your wife christened every room and just about every piece of furniture in the house with your passions
You’re at the park
Sitting with your wife under the shade of a tree, watching your daughters playing from in the distance
Your wife looks at you with a smile, and you smile back
You make each other happy
She leans over and speaks
>”oh hey I think I forgot to tell you, our girls aren’t gonna be home tonight.”
You perk up and turn to her
And she leans closer to you
>”they’re staying at a friends house for a sleepover, so the second that they’re gone I want you on our bed wearing those tight shorts I like.”
She leans closer, practically whispering in your ear as she slips her paw into your pants and begins fondling your manhood
>”and you’d had better brace yourself slut, cause Im gonna make you make all those cute noises you made during our honeymoon.”
She slips a little bit of her tongue into you ear
Eliciting a shudder from you
>”and you’d better not ask me to be gentle, cause I’ve been gentle for too damn long. I’m gonna fuck you like the cheap whore that you are until you squeal.”
Jackpot

Idea
>Matriarchy dominates Earth men are reduced to 2nd class citizens due to being misogynistic
>Send men out on long range colony ships through ftl to get everything set up
>Destinations are chosen at random, ships are stocked with everything to ensure the colony gets working
>Gene labs, embryos, manufacturing and mining equipment, automated security
>Trips will take years to reach destinations, even longer to set up a viable colony
>Politians see it as way to get rid of unwanted extra male population
>On anthro planet, great evil is sealed away by the various tribes for a time
>Evil gets a last laugh, causing male children to be born 1/2 as often as females
>After a century or so of this, male anthros are much rarer, and are treated as precious and fragile
>Females have gotten brawnier and have taken over much of what was the men's work
>Tribes are starting to engage in fierce wars over the dwindling male population
>Tribal shamans gather and ask creator for a miracle, so they don't die off
>At same time, Colony ship gets caught by magic field of planet, creating comet like display in low orbit
>Ship's MTHR Computer sends out spy drones to scout the planet, finds already under matriarchal rule
>Landers dispatched with human men to surface, eventually come across female anthro scouts
>Gene labs on ship can make the men and female anthro compatible, while gene samples of male anthros are preserved
>Men are more or less skittish around women due to experience, shocked by kindness of the locals
>Locals think the human's Goddess took pity on them and offered them salvation
>Men a little torn on issue, but mostly happy to be treated like people and loved
>Evil begins to slowly break free of its bindings, the dread Karen's return is coming

>use to live in a small beach town 15 years ago
>not a lot of people lived there but not that many visited here

>get a call out of the blue
>"Hey there anon its me Taylor how are you doing, hope you're doing fine. I know we haven't had the chance to catch up in a long time but I hope we can rekindle the friendship we had back then you know? Other than that I hope you can take some time to visit the town again hell I give a tour if you decide to come.
>she sends a picture of herself by the pier with a large sign saying Annual Crescent Festival
>she has gotten pretty tall and muscular since then
>maybe I should visit the town to see how different it's gotten
>decide to pack up my things and move back into town
its a four day drive so gas stops and rest stops were visited to refuel and stock up on food
>im curious about the sign in the photo she sent me "Annual Crescent Festival" I'll probably get some answers when I get there
>eventually reach the town, first thing I see is a small dollar store
>I enter the store and see a mature border collie woman by the cash register
>"Well hiya there honey, I suppose you're not from around here are you? Name's Clover by the way"
>tell her that I'm not from here but I want to know where I can sleep at because I'm moving here
>Clover-"Well then, I guess there is the inn two blocks from here but other than that there's not much else I can do."
>tell her thanks in advance and head for the door until a familiar face enters the store
>Taylor-" Well if it isn't my long awaited friend!" she says with a grin as she gives me a big hug "God its been long without you Anon, but now that you're here I can show you where you'll staying and after that I can that tour I promised.

>Be me
>Parents divorced a couple years ago
>My dad remarried to an anthro tiger lady
>She is really sweet
>My mom moved to another city and offered to let me stay with her while im going to college
>I was the odd ones out compared to my brother, I was the one with the mental issues and such
>We were fighting one night as she basically said to me “Im so fucking happy you’re an adult, I no longer have to care about your pathetic ass, I wasted nineteen years of my life on you, little shit! You were a fucking accident, im gonna be the happiest fucking woman in the world once you blow you’re brains out someday”
>My step mom does weekly check in calls with me and she catches wind of the whole situation from the night before
>A couple hours later I hear somebody stomp inside
>It was her, she was fucking furious as she gave my mom an entire lecture about motherhood and she told me to grab all my stuff and move back home
>Did she seriously drive for two hours for her step son?
>Over the drive we start to bond again and she tells me how in anthro culture mothers will stick to their children no matter what and how much the modern world has destroyed motherhood.

/adhg/, but a bit different
>getting adopted by an anthro family or dad remarrying an anthro woman
>anyways to the point, getting a new anthro mom
>old enough to be able to compare how your actual mom was like and how new anthro mom is like
>more or less getting smothered in attention and affection
>learning just how hardcore some specie's maternal instincts are
>wants to cuddle a lot more since she's worried you're cold from no fur
>a lot more grooming since all she has to groom is your hair
>then species specific mom quirks
>if roo then she'll keep wanting to pouch you
>raccoon mothers will adopt abandoned kits and also raccoon mothers invest a lot of time in raising and teaching their young how to survive
>prehensile tail species will pretty much leash you with them
>otter mom not letting you sleep unless you're holding her hand
>infinite supply of milk from cow/goat/sheep mom
>and so on
>also how fucking aggressive certain species are about protecting their young

>imagine having some job or situation where you have to crawl through vents
>have to clean them or repair certain areas or parts somewhere in the vents
>and during the whole time you have to worry about anthro female beasts hiding out in the vents
>basically being hunted certain species since you're just begging to be snatched and whisked away by them and use to breed more of their kind
>think that scene from aliens movies where they have to crawl through the vents
mostly expect a lot of big rat girls

>Sci-fi space setting
>Various furry races formed civilizations and factions across many planets and systems
>Each one is different, some highly territorial and independent
>Others willing to cooperate and form federations together
>All of them have the two similarities between them
>Theyre all mostly women and Human males are a highly sought after commodity
>Humanity itself is a rare thing, scientists can't explain it but they always seem to appear on distant worlds
>Entire wars have sparked over newly discovered human planets
>It doesn't matter if it is small independent nations, or multi galaxy wide empires
>Be it through diplomatic relations, or full blown raids to grab as many men to throw into slave trade ships
>None of them can resist the urge to add more human dick to their population

what would you do if your anthro sister was trying to seduce you?

>Growing up with your rhino anthro sister
>Many fond childhood memories together
>The relationship between you and her is wholesome
>As both of you are getting older, she outgrows you completely
>The size and strength difference makes things more awkward, and things gets quieter between you two.
>Entering puberty, weird feelings starts to arise, as both of you begin to notice certain places and smells on each other.
>You feel more intimidated by her now, while she has gotten more curious of you. Stalking you, starring at you, her attempts to hide her spying are getting worse and worse.
>One day mom and dad left you two alone together. With you defenseless sheltered inside your room she took her chance.
>You got nervous the moment she entered your room, and your small protests against her presence only made her move closer to you.
>She trapped you with her body, beginning to smell you, as you cower in front of her.
>She dosen't listen to your whimpers anymore and your struggles are futile. She licks and smells you wherever she pleases, getting more and more forceful as if she is scratching an itch that have bothered her for months.
>You’re afraid, but you feel some of the same emotions as she does. You knew that this would happen. You knew she would claim you.
>The temperature in the room increases as she rips off your clothes with her teeth. All you can do is lay there and be a good boy for your big sister as she takes care of her urges.

>A cold stormy night
>In a big-ish house
>it's just you and your adopted sister
>you remember back when you were a kid and your family thought of the idea of adopting, you thought it was stupid, you're already the best kid around
>didn't matter, they brought home a bunny gal
>your attitude changed quite quick with all that fluff, you hopped around with each other, petting her, her snuggling against you, it was the best, you loved feeding her carrots and she loved sleeping on top of your bed.
>Of course when it came to outdoor activities she completely floored you, running around the yard was like trying to compete with a worth class athlete, especially when she can use all four of her limbs while you're stuck with two like the damn ape you are.
>This didn't mean you were completely outclassed though, because of her short height and lack of digits she usually asked you for anything out of the closet, whether it be batteries, a blanket, or even just some cereal and jam
>It felt good to have the advantage, of course you didn't admit it to her, but in secret you were always smug
>The kind of thing that if it got out you're pretty sure she wouldn't ask you anymore because she'd be angry at feeding your ego and that you looked down on her in some way
>kind of hard not to look down on a small bunny though
>you can particularly remember how in the middle of the night your parents would absolutely swear at her because she would run up the steps on all four like it was a goddamn race track
>you didn't mind, you liked having somebody to talk with at night, you had trouble sleeping as well, and it let you two watch movies and play games together
>horror games were not a good match for her though, but she insisted on playing them anyway because she knew you liked them
>this led to many instances of you playing with her, half an hour or so going by, then two knock on your door with a hesitant pause
>"Hey bro, i got the nightmares again, sorry, can i sleep with you?
>"Jesus you look like you've seen a ghost, what was the nightmare about?"
>"It was those headless banshees that chase you down a hallway in hotel darkness"
>"Yeah those are pretty fucking spooky, but you remember that you have a shotgun in the game right?"
>"I did, it was empty, went click, the thing ran up to me and jumped in my face, if i hadn't of woken up i think i'd be seeing the insight of a ghosts stomach right now...whatever that is"
>"Well i've told you that if you stay up so late with me playing the game you will get scared"
>"I'm not afraid of the game, it was just a random nightmare, plus it's fun to play with you bro"
>"A random nightmare that happens almost every time we play the game?"
>"You'd be scared of them too if you saw them!"
>"Don't worry, if any ghosts show up around here i'll protect you, doesn't matter how scary looking they are"
>"Thanks bro, can i come in then?"
>"of course, but you forgot to put some damn pants on"
>"I don't exactly think pants are an important priority when a ghost is about to devour you"
>"Gotta look dignified for the grave at least"
>"Very funny"
>She walks in, still with no pants on and a saggy top, you look away with slight shame, you've noticed her "assets" have been growing rather largely lately, and you don't want to say anything to make her feel bad about what's natural
>That, and you also enjoy looking at them, of course you hate yourself for doing so, you know it's wrong, she's your sister, even if adopted, it's wrong to think about her like that
>But you do love her, so you have to look at her to make sure she's okay right? No scratches or anything, right?
>That's all it is, there's nothing perverted about checking out your sisters body to make sure she's not hurt.
>"Uh, bro are you okay?"
>"Oh huh? yeah i was just thinking you really should put some pants on"
>A shitty lie if there ever was one, you think
>"Dude mom and dad are having their date night,you think i care if you see me naked?"

What are some bold claims that mental health professionals in the adhg world make? I was thinking stuff like
>”The true pandemic is mentally ill boys”
>”you’re son isn’t mentally ill, you just stopped acting like a mother to him when he turned ten and now you’re facing the consequences”
>”Most of these threats of suicide, tantrums and these cases of loneliness don’t just happen out of the blue, these boys are crying for the love only a mother can give”

>You walk down the street and you see four hyena girls wearing leather jackets all with Hyaenidae written on the back of them
>They turn towards your direction and smirk at you before the big spotted one walks up to you picks you up by the shirt and drags you down into an alley with her smaller lackies following her
>the spotted one pushes you against the wall then grabs a hole of your pants ripping them off exposing your lower half to the world
>she that lowers her pants exposing her large girthy erect pseudo penis as she flips you around and shoves it up your asshole
>you feel her pounding away inside you as the small stripped one who looks kind of like a canine goes under you and begins stroking your cock
>you feel like you are beginning to climax from the stimulation of having your ass penetrated and dick stroked but just before you cum the short striped one clamps her mouth around your penis swallowing your load
>she then gives you a blowjob as the large spotted one begins pounding you harder
>after your second climax the tiny striped one gulps down your last load as the large spotted one pulls out of you then tosses you to the ground on your back
>"I'm satisfied, you lot can do what you want with him" the spotted one says as she turns and walks away leaving you an orgasming mess
>you turn your head to see the two remaining ones have taken already stripped off their pants leaving them as bottomless as you
>the brown squats down over your erect cock and slams her pussy down onto it giving you an intense sense of pleasure as she begins straddling you the short striped one also stripped off her shorts and stands over your head her taint in full view

>Anon is an autistically strong humie
>Got kidnapped by goons from a money-hungry slaver, then sold to a zebra
>After arriving inside the made-cottage he was met with a fertility goddess of a mare
>Huge hips, plump fat and she's the forest alchemist who writes prestigious books under pseudonyms
>Said that she needed a human that can reach high shelves and has a big dick and strong babies to give
>She thought that Anon filled the gap
>So she keeps him on the short leash, enticing him teasingly just so enough that she can leave the room and leave his slave frustrated
>Splaying her ass on stools just to see her pristine puffy slit, Bending on her only window to see the jiggle on her phat ass, her two huge breasts pointing in two directions. She's flaunting it all
>And all that teasing is discouraging Anon's self-esteem because he knows that he'll never get to have sex with a lady like her
>it's not until he realized that "Hey, maybe I should make her life as irritating as possible"
>And that's exactly that
>A bucket filled with water is placed atop the door
>Her collected sand got wet and disintegrated
>So on and it went on, causing as many little bullshit as he can to her teasing mistress
>All of this because of his misunderstood mistress,who doesn't understand how to seduce a human male and how to get him to fuck her until three months
>She worked out to look like this... And her humie is just a prick that keeps causing her trouble

>getting my clothes back on after showering in Gym locker room
>arm grabbed, pulled away by a bat
>she claims she doesn't use towels anymore
>wants me to lick up all of her sweat

>Anon -like many of his kind- Is a slave who was freed
>But he got re-enslaved because he can't remember what identification means
>And so he gets to climb trees for many years now, all because the fat Zebra keeps on nagging him and butt heads over, quite literally
>But this time, she's had enough and will use her authority to force him to climb the tree and snatch the cone
>Then Suddenly the abnormal wildlife roared and covered the two of you's escape route
>You jumped off the tree and landed on a bush to reduce the fall-
>-To see you miscalculated and you're behind the beasts
>Punching, kicking, and using a large branch to defend himself, he drove all of them back and approach her
>And see that's one of them opened her fur and is bleeding slowly
>He's not a doctor but knowing one of his buddies died that way in the Savannah, he knows when to stop messing around and rescue a life
>Because he's not a doctor he also doesn't know how to close the wound
>So he just used a large spinny looking leaf to cover her wounds, problem solved
>Next was the leg, he ripped off his shirt to bandaged her leg to stop the blood from coming out
>But at the same time, he hoped that when she could recover so he can escape her
>But that doesn't feel right...
>He is so retarded that he can't even save a life properly
>Until she opened her eyes and scolded Anon for improper dressing
>Says that she only fainted and dizzy and blamed him because he was hooting for no reason
>She shouted at him to get out and tend the front porch flowers so she can tend to her wounds properly
>She smiled when Anon tripped on a slightly raised wooden floor.
>When certified chemist say that its a badly grown herb that's when the neurons brain goes to overdrive
>And rips her saggy protective
>Exposing her brood mother like body and
>Carried her bridal style off to the puddle of mud
>She was mad when they reached it and started to degrade Anon as a slave who she never want to meet
>Anon was staring at her, unaffected
>That and adds insults like "You bear the mark of autism Anon" Then its generally a good idea to make up to her real fast
>How? Is the question that's asked everyday, well; by giving her a flower from that book she keeps staring at
>And so he set out at night and came back the next dawn, all bruised and large scratches all over his thigh
>After Anon's escapade yesterday, she wanted to say a little apology to a slave that kept her company
>But upon seeing the rare flower, she thought that Anon sacrificed his Wellbeing-
>--He autistically fell off a cliff--
>-That so she can give him another chance to woo her again
>But at the same time enrages her completely because SHE Was supposed to keep him inside the cottage so he can't hurt himself
>But she appreciates the uniquely scarce flower regardless, that touched her heart a little
>So he was tied to a single room the whole day as a sort of detention and reflect on what he did wrong
>He didn't, he just fell asleep, thinking that her mistress is treating him kindly
>Over the next months, Anon going to point A to B every day, just so he lay off his continuation of crusades worth of buffoonery
>But then he started to reflect on his actions, then realized something
(There is nothing more dangerous than an autist weaponizing his disability)
>Anon arrived at the cottage holding a basket of miscellaneous items
"I uhh, did not get you name miss"
>She stopped stirring "What sort are you saying, Anon?"
Taking six seconds to digest, he decided to say it clearer "I do not know your title" Anon cringed himself as he echoed the last word"

>walk by the locker room
>some anthro girl sitting alone ask you to come in
>she takes of her shoe and socks says she need >help cooling off
>ask you to get on the ground lick her paws

Have musings on various mustelids in an /adhg/ context. It's probably obvious where I didn't have any ideas but they can't all be winners.
Least weasel:
>Perhaps on the shorter end but they've got boundless energy and are quite protective of their mate.
>Heat hits like a goddamn truck, prepare to be off work or unable to attend classes for a few days or even a week.
>Voted most likely to leave thirsty comments on all your social media pages and send tit pics.
Stoat:
>Elegant and refined, often found in high-up positions but they've still got a heat as fierce as other weasels.
>This can come as quite a surprise to those who haven't much experience with them.
>Will sometimes just take you on the spot, confident in the legal exceptions for mustelids in heat.
Otter:
>Playful with a mischevious streak. Sea otters enjoy cuddles and holding hands.
>However, otters will constantly grind against you until you give in and give them what they want.
Mink:
>Absurdly soft fur, often hang out around rivers like their otter cousins.
>Very possessive - they only rarely tolerate other anthros around their man.
>Quite aggressive in bed.
Pine martens/sables:
>Extremely fast and agile, superb acrobats and gymnasts - trying to hide up a tree won't even delay the inevitable.
>Sables have silky fur; both pine martens and sables have a keen sense of smell which can help them sniff out men.
Fisher:
>Bigger and stockier than most weasel-like mustelids, yet still surprisingly flexible and agile (especially in the snow).
>Generally will want to move in with you (or vice-versa) as soon as they're confident the relationship will work out. Like to mark you with their scent through vigorous rubbing (and sex, of course).
Ferret/polecat:
>Ferrets are peppy, friendly, and easily exciteable. Often live in groups.
>Have a great sexual appetite, not least due to their heat. It can sometimes be quite rough. Several ferret/polecat anthros may have sex with a human at one time.
Badgers/wolverines:
>Stocky and stout. Don't have much time for others' social pretensions and are more than capable of handling themselves in a scrap. Once you're part of their close-knit family they'll treat you very tenderly.
>Sometimes American badgers team up with coyote anthros to get human men; will share the lucky(?) guy between themselves.
Hopefully that didn't suck too much.

>anthro GSD wife
>military service had her in the "titan" group
>turned her into a ten-foot fertile amazon
>got into a steamy night after saving her of all things

>on top of being big, she's a natural with some military-devised martial art style
>she even tried to teach you some moves, but you just tickled her into mate-pressing you
>she loves squashing you under her perfectly-kept body, but she scolds you into "making" her do it
>she even tearfully admits she's scared of hurting you when you get her drunk
>she did the kind of gnarly shit in her service you'd never speak of to uphold her dignity
>scared of doing it to you since she's never been confident in controlling herself in this big body
>you spend the first years of your marriage building her confidence up
>she turns around and practically becomes a local superhero
>volunteers as a firewoman and makes the papers when someone royally fucks up
>tally of no less than a dozen lives saved thanks to her and the crew
>tell her you're so hot she needs her kevlar to handle you
>she sneers and dresses up to oblige you
>then crushes you under more pressure than a water jet from a hose
>afterglow is mostly her licking your face until her tongue slips into your and chokes you
>you playing dead resulted in her frantically doing CPR on you and your ribs got broken
>she was absolutely livid but you smoothed it over with a night of worshiping her
>ends in you being smothered in a waifur blanket muttering about her "big everything" now

>I'll never be assigned an emotional support canine waifur
>She'll never comfort me after my nightmares
>She'll never help me through my rough days at work in a job that I hate
>She'll never help me fight through my issues and become a better person
>She'll never accompany me on long backcountry hikes, where we'd share a single sleeping bag (Not like it was needed, considering her fur)

Based on the sons of Humanity and mustelid greens of the past few threads
Chronicler's notes
Due to the present shortage of males, the often playful members of the Mustelid Tribes have developed a dark tactic for acquiring mates. The heat cycle of several breeds, more specifically Ferrets, Martens, Minks, Stoats, and Weasels, can be particular strenuous. While alchemical potions can migrate this to a manageable level, the desire to be bred by a male, regardless of species, remains rather strong. This has led to tribes with a shortage of males to raid others with improvised berserkers of said species. Such a raiding party will have at the very least have half a dozen members of such breeds stop taking the suppression potion a few days before the raid.
This, combined with the accompanying Shaman providing them with a special mushroom blend, send them into a psycho-sexual state. Often, the Shaman will give the volunteers their passing rites, as most will not survive the raid, before giving them the brew. The raiding party will then approach their target from downwind, the scent of the males sending the volunteers into a frenzy. Heedless of self preservation or opposition, they will dart in as fast as their legs can carry them towards the male. Most defenders will have mere seconds to react as a racing streak of fur, fangs, and blades races past them and deeper into their encampment. Unguarded tunnels, standalone burrows, and wall-less settlements will quickly find almost feral intruder in their midst, and heading for the most valuable members of society.
Anyone who has experienced play-fighting with a Mustelid will quickly learn of their agility, flexibility and speed. This is used to full effect as the berserkers move through gaps between structures, narrow tunnels, and groups of defenders. It is advised not to get in the way of them, as they will tear through anyone standing between them and their prize. Upon reaching the male(s), they will aggressively mate with them, killing any female that comes near, even turning on each other readily. While the defenders are now occupied with the berserkers, the rest of the raiding part, the Badgers and Wolverines leading, smash into the recently exploited gap, opening a corridor for their Shaman and a retrieval force. Said Shaman quickly pacifies the survivors and the male before retreating with the rest of the raiding party.
This tactic often traumatizes the male in question, and the wining berserker often keeps them occupied with vicious intercourse for the next few days as she "cools." Shaman magic can ensure pregnancy in a female regardless of the male's species, though it's often the mother's species, and very rarely a male. This shock and awe tactic is rather successful, such that fledgling empires often employ such formations when absorbing outlying tribes. Brutal, perhaps, but with the curse lingering over Gaia, it is often a necessary evil to continue a tribe's linage.
With the arrival of humans and their Goddess, this tactic might be on the wane, as this newfound source of males seem to be immune to the effects of the curse. As such, Human males, as mentioned, are a valuable commodity for whoever can acquire them(see tale of Foster Bent). Against a human camp or scouting group, this tactic is extremely effective, as the human's Goddess does not grant them weaponry. When the hormone driven Mustelids attempt this against human structures, it is largely unsuccessful due to the practically impervious metal they are made from. The only ready way to the males inside, is for the Mustelids to enter through the ventilation shafts, or acquire a human metalworking torch.
So, yes, horny Ferrets hopped up on meth-shrooms, and company raid your encampment, what do?

Imagine being adopted by one of them.

Scenario: You are the sole human living in your neighborhood. Your neighbors are all manner of prehistoric beasties. Some of them are tiny, and a lot of them could crush your house. The architecture tends to favor the larger set with allowances for smaller sorts such as yourself. You have ready access to food and water, you own a vehicle even if you rarely use it (it's easier to ride on a friendly shoulder), and you make decent income. You have good to neutral standing with your neighbors, and you have no outstanding legal issues.

Gantz but it's anthro aliens you have to fuck for points, as long as they are satisfied you get to live to keep up this cycle till you get 100 points, Anthros range from the normal to far more out there style chimeras or monsters

>allowed to cover it (for weather and other stuff) when necessary but must show it if any anthro asks, no reason needed
>can be remotely accessed (i.e. if a human isn't behaving then some anthros call the police, give them the name/id, and the police can shock as necessary in addition to the normal stuff)
>only way for the wearer to use digital money at all
There's some stuff I'd get rid of though.
>Sets an alarm for if the humie isn’t home by their curfew
Could be abused to drain the batteries. Or if you mean shocking then it could lead to an infinite feedback loop that would eventually kill them. They should just be expected to know to be home by a certain time. If they aren't then it just logs it and the human gets some sort of visit from the police over it.
>Shocks them if they exhibit anger
Not really doable without just ending up training them to never experience adrenaline, at least not without some serious sci-fi tech to be able to differentiate between anger, fear, arousal, etc.
>A leash can be extended out of it
Takes away space from other, more important things like batteries. Just have a little loop extend out of part of it for hooking a leash onto.

>Ejaculating into the water will increase chances of you attracting them for aquatic pokegirls can smell human semen miles away
>After the blowjob phase she will then present herself to you so take this opportunity to fuck her senseless
>Once you fuck her to the point of exhaustion now is your chance to catch her with your balls and add her to your team roster
>After dominating her she will become loyal and loving towards you and only you
>Be careful not to be the one who gets exhausted first otherwise she will take you back to her lair and make you her slave however if you cum too soon then she will leave you for being such a weakling

Be fun to mess around with a setting where anthros are semi-feral and all female. Human sized or bigger with them leaning a bit more towards feral animal shaped. They also mainly act like feral animals do and not being able to talk, but with a lust for human males/need them to reproduce more of their kind. Sort of dystopian like with men and boys getting grabbed by she-beasts.

>Mean while your uncle is fucking the anthro dog he works with to the sound of you getting fucked by the horses.

>We need to about how human men are portrayed by the media as mere sexual conquests for anthro women. Hollywood paints ALL human boys as trophies for anthro women. EVERY male human character in film or television ends up submitting to an anthro girl, sexually or otherwise. Humans are NOT playthings for anthros! Recent surveys have shown ONLY 63% of human men have had sexual fantasies regarding anthro women, let alone sexual encounters! Look, anthro women, just because you're taller and stronger, and have tighter pussies does not mean you are superior! Furthermore, not all human women cowardly or weak or selfish! JUST because they're physically weaker on average and sex with them is boring does NOT mean that they-

A Monster Hunter setting with anthro monster girls would be a perfect match for /adhg/. It has big aggressive woman that will try to dominate hunters and kidnap hunters that they take a fancy too back to their lairs not to mention all of them will be not just physically stronger but also physically bigger that fits well with that one anons fetish from a few threads back. The content you could get from this would be endless.

This reminds me that the only one other anthro dream I had involved a shark girl space pirate who kidnapped me for sex purposes. I guess sharks are my subconscious favorite.

I wish retards would quit responding to this. The absolute least we could do is come up with something interesting. Also, just list the species, don't have it be species'd shit.
Last digit in your post is what species do you get:
>0 bears
>1 boars
>2 bovines
>3 bunnies
>4 canines
>5 cats
>6 deer
>7 equines
>8 hyenas
>9 rats
Second and third last digits in your post are how you get dominated (if it's the same digit twice then replace the second last digit with the last digit):
>0 drugged
>1 at gunpoint
>2 bound
>3 blackmailed
>4 coerced
>5 kidnapped
>6 bribed
>7 slave
>8 drunk
>9 brute force
Fourth last digit is an extra addition:
>0 breast sucking
>1 musk
>2 age difference
>3 tribal
>4 harem/group
>5 biting
>6 class difference where you're the lower one
>7 class difference where they're the lower one
>8 dystopian
>9 worship
As an example, for the post I'm replying to it would be 37669005, so 5=cats, 00 becomes 05=drugged and kidnapped, 9=worship.
Now someone with time to burn and some graphic talent make it an image.

>Bears, brute force, drugged, group/harem
Goddamn I hit the jackpot.
>You decided to buy a membership online to one of those "dime-a-dozen" fitness centers.
>Figured it'd be better to kick bad habits and get out the house once in a while.
>And no, work didn't count as your exercise for the day, even if you did lift heavy-ass boxes in a warehouse.
>Sure you were pretty toned for your size, but there were even boxes you weren't confident lifting, almost breaking your back in the process.
>Not like they'd give a shit anyway...
>The nearest center was in a rundown part of town, full of anthros somewhat segregated from your neighborhood.
>You could tell just by the smell - The faint odor of shedding mammals and sudden humidity was enough to detract most humans.
>Not you.
>10 minutes beats an hour long drive by a long shot.
>As you pulled up to the place, you could tell you were in for an experience.
>Cracks were plastered on the outer surface of the brickwork, with a yellow-stained sign and one of those accordion metal gates to keep people from stealing shit.
>Either this place was run by a mom-and-pop or they were really trying to go for that "Rocky" aesthetic.
>The sound of a police siren in the distance wasn't helping you as well, mind riddled with second-guesses.
"Fuck it."
>The money was spent and you were here.
>You grab your small sling-bag full of spare clothes and some things to wash up after, double-checking to make sure your car was locked before entering the building.
>On the way in, the door buzzed with a electronic jingle and a wave of air conditioning washed over you, tingling your skin from head-to-toe.
>There was also a variety of stations to use, with different anthros attending them.
>Most of them were female bears...
>Wait.
>All OF THEM were female bears.
>There had to be at least a dozen of them and all their attention seemed to be on you now.
>You had to be standing there for what seemed like hours, gazing back into the crowd of predators.
>"Welcome, hun."
>A female polar bear was at the reception desk to your left, peering over the computer monitor with amber eyes that glossed over your body.
>"First time, I take it? Well, come on over."
>That sweet voice pulled you from your fear-induced shock and soothed your nerves, if only a little.
>You stepped over to the desk, taking a glance at the large woman from where you stood.
>gotdamn.jpg
>She was built like a Goddess - she rocked the body of an 8 foot tall plushie with features that would make any woman jealous.
>Those breasts of hers had to be G-cups, bare minimum for a woman of her stature. The shirt she wore also seemed to do nothing to cover those nipples of hers.
>Despite her more rounder physique and thick fur that covered her entire body, something told you she was packing muscle underneath.
>Hell, all the bears here seemed to be on the "plus-size" but she EASILY took the cake.
>"What's your name, hun?"
>"I-It's Anon, ma'am"
>...Real smooth, dipshit.
>"Call me Cheryl~"
>The ursine woman began to type on the keyboard clearly meant for larger paws, tapping away with a light sway.
>If you didn't know any better, you'd say she was flaunting those massive globes, waiting for you to make a move.
>A final tap on the keyboard got your attention back up.
>"I got your name here. How's about we sign you up for the full-course?"
>"Uhh, what's the full-course?" You say without thinking, grabbing onto the strap of your bag tighter.
>You hear some of the women in back chuckling to themselves.
>Others continued to lift their weights while keeping an eye on you, and some... well, let's just say they were showing off just how flexible they really were.
>"It's a personal training program. Special for new members."
>What did you really have to lose by taking an offer from her - after all, you've made it this far.
>"Sure. Why not?"
>"Good choice, hun. Let me just enter this in the system and we'll get you started."
>Cheryl peered once more from behind the computer, taking her time to enter the information before a curved smile barely showed one of her fangs.
>Was that a good thing?
>She got up from her desk with one hefty motion, twisting her body around to look at the wall of keys that hung freely.
>Her body leaned in close to inspect each tag, clearly labeled with a number - possibly for lockers or whatever storage they had in place for customers.
>It gave you enough time to see her shorts barely contain the mountain of an ass she had.
>Already, your mind pictured if you could withstand the herculean task of lifting them.
>With a flick of her claws, she took two of the keys and gestured you to follow.
>As you both headed towards a room near the back, you couldn't help but look at the rest of the gym.
>Attentions still seemed to land on you but the ladies seemed to be more subtle about it the closer you passed them by.
>The more you thought about it, the more you came down to one ludicrous conclusion.
>You were in their territory and the only rite of passage you had was through Cheryl, the leader of the pack.
>Yeah, it was their gym, but you had just as much access as they had - you paid the fee.
>That self-assurement definitely kept your stride from looking like a lost puppy in a bear den.
>Once Cheryl made her way to the metal door, she twisted one of the keys inside the lock and pushed the creaky door aside.
>The motion detector in the corner of the room switched the lights on with a low hum, revealing a spare yoga room.
>Thick, blue mats, a large mirror on one of the walls, some boxes of what you assumed to be equipment in the back, and a smell you couldn't really quite place your finger on...
>Guess they don't use this room often.
>"After you," she gleefully tapped on your rear, pushing you off your feet and into the room in a stumble.
>Geez, she really put a lot of weight into it. If you didn't know any better-
>You turn to look back at her but now there was a crowd huddled at the door.
>"Hazel, make sure to lock the front."
>Cheryl handed the other key to one of the brown bears that was lifting weights previously.
>"With pleasure~" the gruff voice called out, disappearing behind the wall of bodies that started to flood the room.
>They all sauntered near the walls of the room: giggling, cat-calling, and making seductive poses before forming a circle around you.
>There was only one exit - the one behind Cheryl.
>Shit. SHIT!
>"Oh, Anon. We've been waiting for a man like you for SOOO long..."
>Cheryl was making her way towards you while the others wooed her on. It was pure instinct for you to back up, like the cornered animal you were.
>One of the bears, a panda about your height, snatched your bag off the floor - you didn't realize you let go of it until now.
>She started to tear it open and yanked one of your spare shorts, huffing it and touching herself in plain view.
>"Ahh~ His scent is so good!"
>The panda muffled underneath the fabric, others beginning to join her surrounding the tattered remains of your bag.
>"C'mere, boy~"
>One of them grabbed you from behind, forcing your arms behind your back into a strange lock like you were being detained.
>She placed her muzzle on your neck, breathing heavily and licking you while you struggled.
>It was pointless.
>"Mmm, feisty and tasty. Just how I like 'em."
>Your mouth wanted to protest, yell, scream, but nothing came out. Just struggling pants and shaky breaths escaped your lips in a torrent of hopelessness.
>It's obvious what they wanted... were you going to give in?
>No, you weren't going to just accept your fate like a wounded animal.
>You grit your teeth, thrashing yourself in the bear's clutches, flailing your body as best you could while threatening to pull your arm from it's socket on multiple occassions.
>You didn't care - Freedom was what you craved.
>"We got a fighter girls~" The sultry voice behind you moaned, pressing herself against your back to feel her mounds of fur and flesh.
>Whoever she was, she was getting real into it - those breaths of hers were panting harder and harder on your neck.
>And your pretty sure she was wet as a slip-and-slide down there.
>"...but we're just gettin' started!"
>Instantly, your thrashing came to a stop.
>Fangs scrapped against your neck, keeping you still like prey in the jaws of a predator, hoping they wouldn't clamp down any further.
>The warm tingle of saliva dripped down your skin onto your shirt's collar - sticky and wet.
>F-Fuck!
>What now?
>Your eyes dart around the room, looking at all the females who were caught in their own vices or "enjoying the show." The room was filling with the scent of their exotic womanhood.
>Cheryl, on the other hand, was right in front of you the entire time, almost admiring your vain efforts with a twisted smile.
>"Oh, you poor thing.."
>She brought her paw under your chin, a delicate stroke that turned into a tight grip - her claws were scratching against both sides of your cheeks like pincers.
>With her other paw, she held some..thing. You couldn't tell from your angle but she was bringing it close to you.
>That was the cue for the bear behind you, sinking her teeth in and causing a loud yelp of pain from deep within.
"Ahh!"
>In that split second, Cheryl pushed whatever small, chalky objects into your mouth, forcing her paw over your mouth and muffling whatever scream you had left into a gag.
>You couldn't think - you swallowed it on instinct.
>Both bears still held their place, even in the coughing fit you gave, they wanted to make sure whatever it was went down.
>...
>Minutes went by.
>The females were getting restless in your new enclosure, taking turns to come beside and smell you deeply, or rub your hand against their taint.
>Slick, velvety ribbons of flesh coated your fingers with their scents and warmth, while hot moans and pants echoed in your ears.
>All of this arousal was getting you off, whether you liked it or not. Either way, you couldn't protest in your current position.
>The pain was still there but something new was happening inside you.
>You felt strange... Heavy.
>They must have been able to tell because their grip on you loosened, just enough to give you some room to move.
>Not like you were moving on your own - this was completely different.
>It was like air turned into ocean waves, pulling and pushing you in the current's direction. Your knees buckled and shook to your own weight.
>Just what the hell did they do to you?
>"Let him go, Mary."
>Cheryl called out to the bear behind you. She instantly let go of you and gravity soon took over.
>You fell to your knees, barely catching yourself between the wet stains on the blue matted floors. You couldn't help but look around, maybe shield yourself from one or two of them.
>They were keeping their distance... for now.
>Watching with fervor in their eyes.
>Waiting for the moment to pounce.
>Cheryl bent down to greet your eyes with her massive rack. The fuzzy pendulums swayed back and forth, taunting you in a way.
>"I'll give you 30 seconds, Anon. If you can leave, that is..."
>The fuck kind of game was this?
>You forced yourself up to meet the beast's eyes - they had a glint of malice in them.
>"Twenty-nine... Twenty-eight..."
>Shit!
>This was no time to think.
>Your muscles strained harder than you ever thought possible to do such a simple task as walk to the door.
>Pushing with all your might, you were determined to get the hell out.
>"Fifteen... Fourteen..."
>The door was not even twenty feet away. Both legs couldn't help but shake with a hearty stomp each time you put your foot down
>Left foot. Right foot. Left foot.
>COME ON! MOVE, DAMNIT!
>"Eight... Seven..."
>Your fingertips touched the metal of the door frame, feeling the cool air conditioning on the tips of your nerves.
>For a second, you were smiling.
>Then, you were in the air.
>"Five... Four..."
>The door was moving further and further away from your grasp.
>"Three... Two..."
>Someone grabbed your shirt and sent you flying back into the pit of ravenous bears.
>"One."
>You hit the mat with a thud, knocking your vision into a blurry mess of ceiling tiles and fluorescent lighting.
>A gasp of air reeled you into semi-consciousness.
>No...
>It can't be like this.
>This isn't happening. This can't be happening!
>Tears started to well up in your eyes, only to briefly see Cheryl, in the buck, positioning herself above your loins.
>The fur near her sex was matted down and wet, dripping occasionally onto your pants.
>All the bears cheered and wooed her name, making comments and suggestive requests at your expense.
>"Fuck him good, Cheryl!"
>"Make him your bitch!"
>"I want to ride him next!"
>Run.
>Do something.
>DO ANYTHING!
>Your flight-or-fight instincts took over, clawing your way backwards from the beast that loomed above you.
>The women took this opportunity to clamber onto your arms and legs, preventing any sort of movement. Some of them even took this time to satisfy their cravings.
>Tongues and snouts worked their way around, the warmth of a kiss here and there, paws and claws pressing against flesh.
>All that stimulation was making you just as horny as they were, albeit the fear still kept your sanity in check.
>But that wasn't going to matter anyway...
>Cheryl was busy taking her time pulling down your pants, leaving the tent in your boxers exposed to the rest of the females.
>Damn, you were hard as a rock.
>The bears that weren't straddling your ligaments leaned in close, pressing their snouts against the loose fabric to take in as much of your "male musk" as they could.
>Each took their turn, visibly shaking and gorging themselves to your scent - it was one they wished to fully take advantage of.
>"A-Ahh~"
>"Mmmahh~"
>The hot sighs of ecstasy washed over your groin, the thin fabric doing nothing to stop you from getting closer to the edge.
>You were biting your lips, drawing blood, wishing this would all be over soon...
>This was far from over.
>One of the girls started to chant, "Take it off!," enticing the others to join too. Soon, the room was all cheering for Cheryl to continue with your unfortunate strip tease.
>You held your breath, anxious heartbeats pounding against your chest in response to the uproar.
>"With pleasure, ladies."
>The amazon of a woman set herself down on her knees, her body resting just barely above yours. You could feel the warmth radiate from her nethers on your chest.
>Those thick thighs of hers were almost three times the size of your arms and could easily crush you, if given the chance.
>She was putting on a show for the others: wiggling her ass on your length, grinding against your body, salivating and covering you with more hot liquids.
>They were eating it up, cheering and playing with themselves to the performance.
>The bears that were clinging onto your ankles and wrists were now busy fufilling their own carnal desires.
>You wanted to move... but whatever that substance was had your body completely drained of energy to fight.
>All you could do was become the "boy toy" they all wanted you to be - powerless to the apex predators in the room.
>Cheryl wiggled herself lower and lower down your body, until she was resting just above your crotch.
"P-Please... don't."
>Your weak voice wimpered out, begging for mercy. You had no other option - they won. Tears rolled off the sides of your cheeks in a pathetic display of submission.
>Your mind was a complete wreck and your body betrayed you. All that was left was the shattered fragments of dignity.
>It was a shame to admit it, but you were scared beyond recognition of what was going to happen next.
>The polar bear leaned down to match her muzzle with your face, looking directly into your eyes with a certain aura of lust.
>"Don't worry, hun. I'll be gentle~"
>Her tongue invaded your mouth, the thick muscle exploring every nook and cranny there was. The messy combination of fluids dripped down your chin.
>It was a makeout session that lasted for who knows how long - seconds turned into torturous minutes in that prison of pleasure.
>The others seemed to be enjoying it just as much as before, filling the room with even more of their "female scent."
>Finally, she dragged herself away, letting a strand of saliva connect you before she placed one last peck on your lips.
>You couldn't hold it in anymore: your sex was twitching against your boxers with all the right feelings in the worst of ways.
>"Mmm, looks like somebody's ready~"
>Her plentiful cheeks toyed with your length for a moment, coaxing more excitement from the crowd before she moved back to position.
>All she wanted, all she craved, was going to be hers - that definitive sensation a man could only provide.
>With one claw, she dragged the boxers low enough to where a single twitch would free your binds. She held it in place, glossing over the ridges and veins of your visible length with half-lidded eyes.
>"Come on, Anon. You want this just as much as we do."
>You couldn't hold yourself back: even if you weren't drugged up, even if you had the strength, her words turned you into butter.
>One twitch sent your sex from their binds like a slingshot, feeling the tip brush against her wet folds before bouncing in place.
>All the ladies were drooling, in more ways than one, over you now, seeing your exposed member out in the open. Perhaps they could even smell it from a couple feet away...
>"Good boy~ Now let me take care of the rest."
>Cheryl decided to take it slow, holding herself with one paw while clinging onto your length with the other. The touch of her pads had you twitching in her digits like a high schooler's first time.
>She was enjoying the sensation, squeezing it and rubbing up and down a couple times in her grasp, getting the full package.
>One second she was fondling your orbs, the next she was working on your tip.
>"Such a sensitive boy~"
>Cheryl was learning each location that made you shiver, twitch, and yelp - if you didn't know any better, she must have had an obsession for humans.
>Your mind was breaking down: twisting and bending to the whims of the predators, and your craving for release had your toes curling.
>Then, her warmth hit your lower body so fast, you moaned loudly out of pure reflex, arching your back in a wave of satisfaction.
>That wet tunnel slowly descended, dripping all over your cock as it swallowed the entirety of your shaft with a pleasant thump.
>Cheryl was fully hilted on you, swaying her hips from side to side, panting as her insides caressed every ridge of you.
>The other bears were either working on their second climax or getting a closer look at you, watching the different expression that riddled on your face.
>They cooed and kissed your body in various places, offering pleasures beyond your wildest dreams if you gave in to their demands for your seed.
>"Come on, stud. Cum for us~"
>"Just let it all out, boy~"
>"He's so close~ Look at him."
>Cheryl continued the assault, milking your member with those velvety walls, increasing her pace more and more - the sounds of wet plaps and schlicks were captivating the audience.
>Your body no longer cared for anything other than this moment, hips barely moving on their own to match the pace of your captor with the small amount of strength you could muster.
>As soon as Cheryl realized this, she doubled her efforts to satisfy. The polar bear wanted nothing more than to embrace your lovely seed with all she was.
>There were no more thoughts going on in your head - only the countdown to Nirvana fueled you.
>Both of you teetered on the edge, waiting to see who would cave in first.
"I- Mmnn... I can't hold it..."
>"Yes! Give it to me, Anon! YES!"
>You couldn't hold it anymore.
>The dam burst in a instant, a torrent of ecstasy flooded out from your body and into hers, mixing fluids of love and passion in her honey pot.
>Cheryl pressed down hard on your loins, the pulsing sensation of her walls massaging your length as each twitch fired another hot round, coating the beast's insides.
>Both of you moaned to the heavens - you were lost in a paradise of your own making.
>...
>You were a complete mess: your ears were ringing with a faint noise, blocking out all the sounds in the room.
>You had no energy to move. Not even a finger was under your control.
>And your mind was driven to complete stillness.
>All you could see from the corner of your eye was Cheryl wiping herself off with a spare towel of yours, then a wave of her paw.
>The room suddenly got darker.
>No.
>They were surrounding you.
>It was their time to have fun with what remained of you.
>Immediately, the panda from before was right above your head, forcing her wet box on to your face, filling your mouth and lungs with her musk as she grinded back and forth.
>A couple other bears started licking your legs and arms, feeling the rough bumps of their tongues coat your body with more hot fluids.
>And there was no telling how many were surrounding your member: a new snout, tongue, paw, or set of lips managed to keep you twitching and letting out load after load.
This continued with each woman switching places, getting to experience a different part of you whenever they felt like it.
>It was a free-for-all. No spot on your body was left untouched.
>...
>How long were you there for?
>You had no clue. Time was not important.
>Every conscious minute was a lifetime of pleasure against your will.
>...
>The room was steaming with warm fluids and scents.
>All the women were either making their way out the room or catching their breath.
>You were right in the center, a combination of everyone's efforts, discarded after use.
>There wasn't an emotion you could pinpoint in the moment, laying there on the wet mats, staring at the ceiling tiles while you basked in the fluorescent light with lazy eyes.
>You just simply existed.
>What would any of it do for you? You would still be laying there...
>Your thoughts were put to a stop when a water bottle was brought to your open lips - you drank from it without hesitation.
>Ice, cold water.
>It felt so good to have something that wasn't warm invading your body.
>After a couple drinks, the bottle was taken back, a voice following behind it.
>"Looks like you enjoyed your workout, hun~"
>Cheryl was standing above, to your right. She took a swig from the bottle, still gripping onto your towel that slung over her shoulder.
>"How's about we get you washed up?"
>You swallowed your spit, trying to form a sentence but the words were lost in your mind.
>She must not have payed attention, or didn't care enough to wait. Before you knew it, you were being lifted onto her other shoulder.
>It hurt, but not terribly so. There was enough cushion on her body to prevent her shoulder blade from gut checking you.
>Either way, there was no use in trying to fight it. You welcomed the thought of a cool shower.
>Cheryl simply tapped on your rear, a lot lighter this time.
>"Don't worry, I'll make sure you're nice and clean... and you'd better not skip out on us next week~"

>buy an original M16A1 from a pleasant ursine woman
>she throws in a case of M193

>3 months later
>hanging out at her place

>"Oh that, yeah. I used to work with the ATF, still have some buddies at the top that wouldn't mind if some things go missing every now and then."
>you start to get a bad feeling
>excuse yourself
>"Why the rush hon? We haven't even had lunch yet."
>you explain that you forgot about a doctor's appointment
>her large paw settles on your shoulder, her grip keeping you in place but not causing pain.
>"Hon, I wouldn't try to leave if I were you, one call and you get charged with posession of an unregistered machine gun, federal prison time. Now, sit back down and I'll get the food."
>lunch passes by uneventfully, the admittedly delicious food does nothing to alleviate your growing anxiety
>"Ya know hon, I've had my eye on you for a while now. Even before our little transaction."
>you start to feel drowsy
>"Yesterday, I saw you out on the town with some dumb bimbo, I knew I needed to make my move because you, are, MINE!"
>when did that wall get that blurry?
>the last thing you feel before sleep takes hold is the large bear hoisting you up into the air
>as you wake up, your head is swimming, the air feels uncomfortably warm and smells strange but good
>"How ya feelin' hon? I was afraid that the dose was too big."
>hearing her voice, your eyes snap open as the memories of earlier flood your mind
>you start struggling and almost immediately, she lays her paw on your head
>"Calm down hon, don't want you to hurt yourself."
>you do as she says, stop struggling and you take note of your surroundings
>that's a bear pussy
>about 2 inches from your nose is a clearly excited bear pussy
>drip
>some of her excitement hit the tip of your nose
>"Alright hon, mama bear can't hold back anymore."
>she readjusts herself, bringing her puss in contact with your face and bringing more of her heady musk with it
>she begins grinding on your face and you start lapping at the needy hole in front of you
>"By the time I'm done, you won't be able to stop thinking of me. My scent will be burned into your brain."
>by now you can't think of anything else but pleasing her, her musk has made you little more than a horny drunk
>"Come on hon, enjoy mama bear's honeypot."
>this goes on for about two hours
>even after she gets off on and of you, her musk is still all that you can smell
>"I hope you enjoyed that hon because we will be doing that often now that you're living here."
>you ask her what she means by 'living here'
>"Remember hon, I said you're mine. That wasn't just dirty talk, you try and leave me and you get federal time."
>you ask her what'll happen to your things, your apartment and your job
>"I already sent some friends to collect your stuff. Tomorrow we are going to visit your work and hand in your resignation, it is only polite to resign in person after all and we can even let your landlord know that you will be living elsewhere."
>she only wants what's best for you, she loves you with all her heart and maybe you can try to return those affections and she smells nice
>you say that sounds nice
>"Great hon, we'll start trying for cubs in a week and I already have a wedding planner."
>If you weren't so tired you would've jumped at her plans
>"Oh no, I'm sorry hon, I was so preoccupied with getting myself off that I forgot about you, let me get that"
>your prior protests died in your throat as your painfully hard member was engulfed by her wonderful mouth
>you blew in less than a minute and a half
>she pulls you into her plush form and holds you tight
>maybe this won't be too bad, you think as sleep takes you once more

>Humans manage to give animals (female) higher intelligence and a body to match
>Unfortunately, by human standards they still are pretty stupid

>Friend of Friend joins
>Deep rumbling purr erupts from their head set
>Its clearly a fur
>Its fine at first, you and your friends are bascially just chatting it up and teaching her how to play
>She makes weird comments and off hand statements about how you sound, saying you sounded cute and kinda short.
>Think nothing of it, she gradually improves and you all resume the game as normal
>Few days past and she's actually gotten away better, out playing most of your friends and even you
>Still says weird and kinda creepy stuff, saying she can smell you right before she raids your base and ambushes you in mine shafts
>Usually her attacks do minimal damage and she leaves your stuff in a chest not too far from your house when you die
>Still easily the best player in the server, kinda makes it hard to play at all if she feels like going on a killing spree or kills all the Mobs before you could
>Hop on one day, Server is near max capacity
>da fuq?
>Get on, hear over a dozen deep feminine voices chatting and teasing your friends while you play
>Raids are way more frequent now and you even were held captive by Fur players until you logged off for a while and logged back in
>Still, damage was minimal and they never steal stuff
>Then they start building inappropriate builds and structures, saying more and more risque things about 'How cute the humies once they whine about being griefed' and 'Can I join you? I wanna put my bed next to yours~'

>the pain was subsiding
>you felt safe, loved even
>you closed your eyes and began to nurse off your hunter

>One of the mods for the discord server you are in invites you to a private video call
>Don't join because you always got weird vibes from her while in game
>One thing that always made her mad was being ignored
>She DMs you "Join the call, Anon"
>She calls you by your real name even though you've made sure to never tell anyone on this fur-infested server
>"Hey, how do you know my name"
>"I know a lot about you, Anon. Like what happened to your account"
>Your account?
>Try logging into the game client again and again, but your credentials are rejected
>She took your account
>You've been grinding this stupid game for 7 years and she just nabs it
>Get mad and prepare to shout her out
>Join the call with your camera turned off and you are greeted with pic related
>Can't get a word out
>Face is red hot
>After a few seconds she says "Thanks for joining, Anon. I heard you're having troubles logging in."
>She's rubbing herself in a circular motion, occasionally spreading her pussy wide.
>"Y-yeah.." you manage to squeak out
>"Well I'd love to help you out, but I need some help with what I'm doing first"
>Consider just cutting your losses and leaving, but something pushes you to play along
>Ask what she wants
>"Turn on your camera and drop your pants"
>Tell her "No."
>"N-no?" She stutters obviously surprised by your sudden and firm refusal
>The account was important to you but you've been a denizen of the internet for long enough to know there was no guarantee that you'd get it back if you complied
>In fact, she would probably record the whole thing and blackmail you with it only to sell it on a pornsite anyways
>Since it came down to it you'd just quit
>Tell her as much
>"What do you mean you'll quit? You can't just quit! D-dont you care about the account?"
>Of course you do. That was the account your mom got you when you were much younger. She even used to play with you. Before the cancer. Back when she used to smile and you were too embarrassed to hug her
>Fuck. You shouldve hugged her more
>You missed the thick fur of your adoptive mom's neck, where you'd bury your tear stained face and your hate for a world that seemed to only want to abuse you
>You felt a solid lump forming in your throat as your resolve hardens and you delibrately let out of a sticcato laugh to clear it while you reflect on how absurd the situation is
>You'd been wallowing in loss for seven whole years, grinding away mindlessly at a game that didnt matter because it was one of your last connections to her.
>Threatening you had been the catalyst to give you enough strength to finally let go
>"Stream deleting it to the whole God damn world. I dont care.My mom didnt raise me to be a slut that will wave his dick around on command." You end the call.
>She chews a nail. Nothing was going like she planned
>It was supposed to be simple. Easy. Get a humie boy's account and get him to strip for you and then all you have to do is keep escalating right until he's in your arms
>You just need to give them a good excuse as proper motivation and they'll come crawling to you all on your own
>Atleast that's what her favorite mongolian neighing site had convinced her of
>In truth, she just didn't want to be alone anymore and she was desperate enough to go through with it.
>She wasn't like her friends who could just walk up to a guy and put a hand on his shoulder while delivering an innuendo or ultimatum
>She didn't have the confidence for that in real life.
>It was online where she really reigned and she'd been showing off to everyone relentlessly, adopting a false confidence and persona that didnt really suit her.
>Most of the humie boys had left but one of them had stuck it out. He was pretty good actually and he never got all that mad when he lost.
>She really liked him but the humie exodus from the server had pressed her for time.
>So she learned a few things and before she knew it, his account was already in her hands
>And now she was in this mess where he'd seen everything and probably hated her guts
>The high of her initial excitement had already come crashing down
>Why had everything gone so, so wrong?
>For a long while, she sat there with her head in her hands
>You sat there in your chair fuming, unaware of how much time had passed.
>"I'm giving it back you."
>She dms you the information and you immediately change the password again. Maybe you'd go for multifactor authentication at some point after this whole ordeal.
>You feel your clenched jaw relax. You didn't even realize you were doing that.
>You weren't going to give thanks to the person that stole it in the first place and against your own better judgement you simply ask her "Why?"
>You expect a flurry of excuses and half truths to be painfully listed out in front of you.
>Instead, you get another call. You hesitate but answer it and you see her face for the first time.
>Emotions you've only seen in the mirror play out across unfamilliar features. Loneliness, misery, shame. You knew all of those far more intimately than you'd like to admit and they were just as ugly of companions for someone else.
>She looks dead in the camera and it almost feels like she's looking right into your eyes and says "I'm sorry. What I did was wrong and really, really stupid."
>"Yeah, that was pretty damn dumb." you say, not quite being able to muster as much of the venom that'd been bubbling up just moments earlier.
>She winces at your matter of fact pronouncement. "I...I just-" and she paused for a moment while she collected herself. "I don't know. I was in a panic because all the other humies were leaving the server and I didn't want you to go."
>"You don't even know me."
>She immediately protested. "I know that you're smart. I know that you've got a dark sense of humor from those memes you post. I know that you like the color green and your favorite minecraft block is cobblestone."
>Maybe she did know a thing or two about you, afterall. Even if it was just superficial stuff, how much could she really learn when you had spent your time actively avoiding conversation with her?
>Still, that didn't excuse what she did.
>"Honestly, I just wanted to talk to you at first, Anon. I wanted you to let me in. But as I was really doing it, I guess I convinced myself that we both wanted something else. I really am sorry."
>Somehow, the obvious guilt, crippling loneliness and hormone induced decision making allows you to come to terms and forgive her.
>You turn on your own camera. She blinks for a moment as if she can't believe what she's seeing. You stare hard as if you're trying to burn a hole through her head.
>"Let's never, ever have this conversation again."
>Her ears flatten. "Oh o-okay."
>"And if you ever pull something like this a second time, I swear I will never forgive you."
"Y-you mean!?" her ears perk up and her eyes are aglow.
>"I think we got off on the wrong foot. My name's Anon. Just 'Non in game. What's yours?"
>Fin.

The ten year old approached the giggling furry milfs. They turned their heads to him in unison, one pulling her jowls back in anticipation, another opening her jaw beneath the closed expanse of her lips. They approach the boy, ara ara-ing as one does, and, while one lady sides the child and squats down from behind, the other, larger anthro drops to her knees and begins slovenly tongue fucking him with no introduction. Completely domineering over the boy's weak tongue, she moans loudly into his closed throat, which ellicits a responding coo from the second woman. The second fur then addresses the child, calling him cute and introducing themselves before making slight humor at "already meeting her friend." She latches her long, clawed hands onto the child's hips, pinching the outer waistband with her pointer and middle fingers and sliding her thumbs beneath the skin-to-fabric connection; breaking this fleeting connection with ease and shivering anticipation and slowly peeling their small guest's only article of clothing, his blue swimming trunks, down to his slightly red ankles. It took only a single glance over his sun-kissed shoulders to observe the rewards for her efforts: a seven-inch, uncut, drooling, half-erect and throbbing hunk of cockmeat which stunk of a musk so aggressive it stopped whatever the second female behind the child was saying. Not that he would've noticed anyway, what with the plump BBW of a dog that was making heavenly choirs down his esophagus with her shota-ravished pangs of heat.

>"Their money will always be good here."

>easy money
>"Yo, we got a limo comin'."
>"The fuck? Night's almost over. It's one-thirty in the morning."
>"At least three girls. Damn, they look loaded."
>Shit, break's over...
>everyone rushes to their posts, getting their last-minute body sprays and making sure their costumes showed as much skin as possible
>thankfully, my outfit isn't as revealing - health standards and all, if you could believe that
>just as my hands reached for a towel to wipe the counter, the double doors opened right on cue
>three different anthro females with lots of jewelry adorning their bodies, lighting up in the flashy underground den: a cougar, a lioness, and a vixen
>one of our younger guys hops on the opportunity, greeting them with his own rehearsed coreography I've seen one too many times
>cougar takes the cake, literally, placing a hand on his ass while following him to some seatings off in the corner
>the other two meander for some time, taking their time to "inspect" each and every one of us
>seems like they're more reserved than their friend
>just before they make it to the bar, the DJ cuts the music for a second and breaks into character
>"Ladies, I want you to give a VERY warm welcome to one of our boys: his touch is like venom, but it feels SO good. Give it up for, "Black Mamba!""
>one of the favorites goes on stage, fog machines and all gracing his entrance, dancing with fluid-like movement on the pole
>"Mmm~ I think I like that one, Sherry."
>"Well, what are you waiting for? He's looking at you..."
>"Oh alright hun~ Just remember our little deal."
>the lioness turned and walked away, grazing a finger on the vixen's chin before walking towards center stage
>yep, "Black Mamba" was, in fact, gesturing for the ladies to come closer, only the lioness took the bait while licking her chops
>which left the vixen standing by herself near the bar, looking at her phone
>...for a full minute
>if no one else was going to jump on this, might as well be the first
"How 'bout a drink?"
>the woman lowered her phone, if only a little, to glance at the bar table in her peripherals, then directly at me
"Seats are a bit worn down but beats standing."
>that seemed to get a chuckle out of her, sauntering her way over with her tail flicking in the wind before taking the stool closest to me
>"You're right, these seats are trash."
>she adjusted herself multiple times to no avail - the slim dress she wore rubbed back and forth against her body, leaving little of her cleavage to the imagination
>with a huff, she resigned to whichever position felt most comfortable and glossed her eyes over me
>"Maybe a drink can help a woman like me~" she batted her hazel eyes with a smirk
"Now that I can help with. What's your poison?"
>"Hmm. Surprise me." she leaned forward, resting her arms and some of her breast on the freshly-wiped counter
>well, this could either go well or bad, considering she's never ordered from here before, let alone looked like she ever stepped inside a strip club
>maybe she wants something sweet... with a kick - a red russian might do it
>my hands reach for bottles on the shelf with no pause, all the locations specifically chosen so that high-ticket items were out of a customer's reach
>luckily, this drink was easy and cheap: one part cherry liqueur, one part vodka, and ice
>the vixen watched as the ingredients melded together to create a red-hued concoction, just before you added the cherry on top
"Enjoy."
>the ice clinks in the glass as she raised it to her lips, sipping while maintaining eye contact
>"Mmm~ You make this look easy."
"Thanks."
>"How long you been here, tiger?" she took another sip, eyeing my body up and down
>might as well be honest with her since she'll probably never come here again
"A couple years, give or take. Gotta pay the bills somehow."
>"You know, a man like you is, what, 23-24? Must be in your prime."
"You could say that."
>"And you're choosing to waste it in some underground pleasure palace?"
>She wasn't wrong.
"Yeah, cards weren't in my favor, but I managed."
>"I see..."
>she took another sip from the glass, placing it on the counter with a small clunk
>maybe that was a step too far
>she seemed to be watching her friends, taking sips every once in a while as they cheered for their own "play-things"
>the both of them looked to be enjoying themselves quite nicely... but the vixen was different
>conversation was part of the job as a bartender, yet this silence felt deafening
>the lack of clients only worked against me, finding less and less to organize and wipe down
>my body was hunched over, digging through some older bottles before her voice broke my concentration
>"Say, what's your name?"
>the vixen was staring at my ass for a solid minute before looking into my eyes
>I pulled myself up to be greeted with a devilish look, one that I'd seen too many times
"..Nathan."
>"I'm Sherry."
>she reached into her dress, pulling a folded wad of cash out before plucking a single one-hundred dollar bill and pressing it against the table
>"I need another drink~" the empty glass clinked as she swished it around in a circle
>holy shit
>that drink was like, eight bucks max, and she really wanted to pay with hundreds?
>was she just trying to force herself to have a good night?
>whatever it was, best to let her know in advance
"You know, it's not that expensive.."
>"I've always wanted company like this," her tail flicked behind her as she pressed the bill further, "Take it."
>one look from her demeanor took control over your protest
>fuck it, I guess
>the red liquid on cold ice went by as quickly as it was poured - Sherry was persistent on keeping the tab open for as long as she could
>by the time any of us knew it, the DJ was pronouncing the "last call" for the crew and put on a cheesy song about making love in a rainy jungle
>the lioness and cougar were eating it up, putting more bills into whatever crevices or straps they could fit them on
>Sherry didn't seem to give it much thought, politely sipping her drink while taking every chance to eye my body whenever she could
>honestly, it felt nice to be desired like this, safe within my own area, so I took whatever opportunities I could to bend over or reach for glasses on the top shelves
>at least, without making it look like I was trying too hard
>a couple "Mmm's" and heavy sighs must have been proof that something was right
>it was the least I could do after the tip she left
>"Hey, Nathan," her eyes were half-lidded, but still coherent. Well shit, she can hold her liquor
"Need another?"
>I wasn't going to deny her if she was paying, plus they had a limo so all was good on that end
>"Actually, I have a different request," she slipped a few more bills on the table - hundreds again
>I raised an eyebrow, curious what the vixen's plan was
>"How's about you come over to this side? You've been working hard enough and I'd like to personally thank you"
>my body hesitated: it was enough money to pay rent for the month but what exactly did she want
>the night's almost over and if push came to shove, the bouncer was still around
>just play along and see where this goes
"Guess I could use a break."
>"Mmm, now I'm glad my friends invited me along."
>I turned around and lifted the gate behind the bar, coming around the wooden divider to see all of what Sherry had to offer
>nice legs, very defined curves and a big, bushy tail that swung behind her, almost long enough to fall to the ground if she was standing
>her chest size wasn't big but she still seemed to flaunt it about, her nipples perked up against that slim blue dress of hers
>in turn, Sherry got to see most of my body - the parts not hidden behind a thick, black apron along my waist and the tight-fitting shirt and shorts given to me by the company
>as I walked over, her tail couldn't help but sway from side to side, showing her enthusiasm even if her face didn't match
>"Could you just, you know, do a little 'spin' for me?~" she circled a finger in the air
>guess she wants me to work for it
>I do my best to slowly turn around, not much of a dancer but trying to play the part while shooting her a look over my shoulder
"You know, I don't usually do this for customers."
>"Then I guess that makes me special, huh?"
"You're one-of-a-kind, Sherry. Haven't had a customer like you yet."
>"Mmm~ Why don't you come closer, darling?" she giggled to herself, using the same finger to lure me in
>surprisingly, she didn't latch herself onto me when I was within arms-reach: simply taking her time to look over all my features, clothed and not
>"You look pretty strong, big guy~"
"You'd be surprised how much heavy lifting goes on in the back."
>"May I?" her hands hovered over my bicep, hesitant but yearning for permission
"I don't see why not?"
>both of Sherry's hands grazed against my skin, tingling the small hairs along the way - I flexed my arm a bit, getting some positive feedback from the entranced vixen
>"Mmff~ I bet you could carry someone like me with those arms."
>she was wiggling in the stool, biting her lip while sinking her fingers into skin, making small divots against the soft flesh of my arm
>maybe now was the best time to stop
"Sorry, Sherry, but my boss'll have my head if I do that. Company policies and all."
>her expression went from enticed to disappointed in a flash
>that's a strip club for ya
>the other girls started heading over to the bar, each with a man in tow beside them
>"Ooo~ Sherry~ Who's this stud?" the cougar growled in a low, sensual voice
>"Looks like a real man," the lioness simply stated, waving a hand in the air
>"Just a guy who really knows how to make a drink I like," Sherry winked in my direction
>"She's not the drinking type," the cougar added, whispering in a way towards me
"Neither am I, but to each their own poison."
>don't know where that came from
>"Hmph, sounds like a romantic, this one. Better than 'Brian' or whoever the fuck that other guy was." said the cougar
>"Yeah, you should really hook up with him," the lioness elbowed against Sherry, almost causing her to fall out her seat
>looks like the alcohol was finally kicking in - good thing too, it was past 3
>the DJ came around and proceeded to round up the rest of the boys, yelling from across the room
>"Sorry ladies, but we gotta close up. We'll always be here whenever you're in town."
>a collective "Thanks" came from the group as they started to make their way towards the door
>I couldn't help but watch as Sherry walked alongside her friends out the door to their limousine
>...and it looked like she was giving a "Call me" sign
>wait
>I walked over to the tip jar, with the money that she had placed inside
>there was a piece of paper hidden within the small fortune
>her name, phone number, and a message - "Want more?"
>after the shift was over, the guys started to change back into their normal street clothes, me included
>some of them complained that they didn't get to take advantage of the wealthy ladies, especially when it came time to count my tips
>their fucking loss, I gave them plenty of time
>"So, we gonna catch ya hittin' the slots today, Nate? You ain't on the schedule..." one of the guys mentioned
"Not sure. This is a lot of money, but not sure I'll go fuckin' around with it."
>my mind was on the piece of paper in my hand, unsure what to do with the information
>the single phrase "Want more?" played over and over
>I wasn't served on some kind of platter for her, not like the other guys, so it wasn't about getting sex - even she was hesitant about touching me
>what exactly did she want
>...
>once we closed up shop, the neon sign with "Skinny Dipping" stayed lit for a second before the hum of electricity was completely shut off
>we all parted our separate ways, driving off into the barely visible hues of dawn
>I wasted no time driving back to my dingy apartment, trying my best to avoid the route I took to the casino after most shifts
>what else was I going to do with this time, or the four-hundred and sixty dollars
>just sleep it over: after all, Sherry was probably in no condition to talk over the phone right now and I had no idea what I was going to say
>Hell, there was enough proof-age in those drinks to make a light-weight pass out
>I parked my car in the assigned spot, made my way towards the assigned door, and placed my assigned key into it's assigned door knob
>with a simple twist, the dark and empty living space greeted my arrival with the smell of dust - heavy curtains covered most of the windows to prevent any light in the building
>should really fucking clean this place at some point or maybe hire someone else to do it for me
>I threw my clothes on the floor and hopped into bed, ignoring the sounds of the city waking up so I could get my own shut eye
>11:45 a.m.
>my fingers pressed against closed eyelids, rubbing the stress of a "decent" night's rest the best they could
>the bed and pillows were from a discount furniture store so figures it would be shit in a couple months
>never going there again
>guess it was time to do some of the daily tasks: wash up, eat something, and clean the used clothes
>the first two went by without a hitch but I stopped myself when it came to the third, holding onto the skimpy pair of shorts I had on last night
>thoughts raced to replay the events of last night in an instant
>most, if not all, of Sherry's features were a vivid picture in my mind
>I mean, she did look good: possibly in her late 30's, early 40's with definite sugar mommy vibes
>and what about that guy her friends were talking about, "Barry" or whoever it was
>from the sounds of it, he was a bad choice and they were trying to hook her up with someone else - just a girl's night out, looking for some action
>not to mention she was mostly composed until you were right beside her, from the clear indications of her body language
>that sort-of fatal attraction to a man was what kept the women coming back, and boy, did it sell
>it would also be a shame to just ignore the call, regardless if she paid with all this cash
"Might as well see if she's up."
>the paper was much easier to read in the light, punching the numbers one after another into my phone, then pressing the call button
>now we wait
>...
>the phone line rung three times
...
>still ringing and no answer
>damn, was it too early
>"Mmnnhello?" a voice slurred from the other side
"Hey, is this Sherry?"
>"Wh-Who is this?"
"It's Nathan. This a bad time?"
>"Oh! Nathan!" the groggy tone immediately change to a distinct excitement which easily broke the tension, "I couldn't tell over the phone. My gosh, how are you?"
"I'm doing good. How about yourself? I didn't get you too drunk, did I?"
>"Yeah, yeah. I'm doing fine. Just- well, I really enjoyed those drinks, you know."
"I think I could tell."
>a soft giggle came from the other side - she either thinks I'm really funny or is really into me
>"Sooo I'm, uhh, glad you called..."
>must have really caught her off guard if she's this dazed, too
>the ball's in my court, better shoot while I got the chance
"Well, I couldn't forget a 'special' customer like you."
>"Really?" an uncertainty rose in her soft voice, sensual but yearning to hear what's next
"Yeah. Figured we could, I don't know, get some coffee, talk a little. Luck has it it's my day off today."
>"Oh? Yes, I'd really like that."
>there was a certain charm in that last sentence of hers
"Tell you what, I've got a couple things to finish up here but you pick a place, text me, and I'll meet you there. Deal?"
>"Mmm~ Sounds wonderful, Nathan."
"Then it's settled. Take care, Sherry."
>"Byee~"
>after the clothes were done drying, I set them aside in a basket, only to be distracted by a vibration from my pocket
>"StarDrop Coffee, 32nd and Kettle Street, 45 minutes. See you soon~"
>there was a message that flashed on-screen for a split second before getting deleted
>"Wear whatever you'd like-" was all I could read
>a thought popped in my head, wondering how raunchy it would look to go in uniform in broad daylight
>it was quickly disregarded - the public doesn't need to see that
>there was a shirt that fit snug, same goes for the pants
>maybe one of those necklaces you got lying around
>and finally, just a bit of that spray-on scent that the guys use at work
>not too casual, but not formal - it was the perfect outfit for a day in town
>...
>the drive wasn't terrible: city life like this was bound to have it's own traffic issues, along with shoddy construction at every other street to repair a pothole or two
>luck was really on my side, making it 2 minutes before the deadline
>the place looked completely different from any cafe I ever visited: most of them being from a chain or serving too locally to get any traction
>just looking from the windows, there was a large interior with many humans and anthros in suits collectively talking with one another over business, and a cup of joe
>oddly enough, I was the only one who seemed out of place compared to the rest
>shit, maybe I should have wore something a bit better
>but all that really mattered was your "date," and Sherry wasn't in the crowd, or the seats
>"Hey, tiger~"
>the soft voice poked from behind, a hand delicately wrapped itself around my left arm, snake-like in it's movements but with fur that bristled against skin
>one look over my shoulder was enough to tell
>Sherry was wearing a different dress, one that looked more palpable in public, along with a matching purse on her other arm and a necklace that sunk into her cleavage
>"You mind escorting me inside, big guy?"
>a sigh of relief was my only response, taking the time to walk alongside the vixen to the front door
>she was about 5'2", not including her fluffy ears that always pointed towards the sky, so being a lot taller meant having to take slower steps
>"You smell really good."
"Thanks."
>"You didn't do that just for me, did you?" she smiled, taking another whiff of the air in front of her
"Maybe I did."
>she let out a deep, content exhale, her grasp pulled you a bit closer, vaguely feeling the outline of her breast against her dress
>no bra? nice
>once inside, the aroma of coffee was actually a lot lighter than I originally thought - must be because of an anthro's heightened sense of smell
>there was a booth in the corner of the building which looked more private than the rest, on account that it had no window, so Sherry took the opportunity to point it out
>we both sat down on opposite ends and immediately a young-ish deer anthro came by to our table
>"A pleasure to see you again, Miss Sherry." the waiter pleasantly spoke with a thick accent, grabbing a notepad and pen from his waist apron "The usual?"
>"Of course, Manuel."
>"And for the gentleman?"
"Just an espresso, if you could."
>"Certainly, sir."
>After jotting down the order, he promptly left to the kitchen.
"Talk about fast service. You come here often?"
>"Enough to know the names of all the staff, yes."
"Wow. Must be pretty nice."
>"Well, it does have its advantages."
>a minute of silence passed, fingers twiddled in a effort to stimulate a conversation
"So."
>"So..." she replied the same message, a wave of uncertainty taking its place between the two of us
"Last night."
>"Yeah?"
"I just- I can't make heads or tails of it."
>"What do you mean?"
>looks like I'll have to spell it out for her
"Why'd you spend so much on me? You didn't have to."
>"What else do you do at a club? The money's not an issue, if that's what you're asking."
"I mean, sure, it's not an issue, but most girls would've got their 'fair share' out of it. You just..."
>"Just what?" her hazel eyes looked deep into mine with curiosity, lightly scratching her claws against the table
"I don't know. I was expecting some force or something - that's usually what happens with our guys. It's why I said 'you're different.'"
>"I've never felt a human before. Not like last night."
"Right, but that's the other thing: you don't seem like the type to go to a club."
>her eyes trailed off from mine, looking at the freshly-made claw marks into the table
"Sorry. I just want to know who I'm talking to if that makes sense. Most people put up a front - I'm not like that."
>a second passed in silence
>then, Sherry giggled to herself
>"You're a really swell guy, you know that?"
"I try to be."
>"No, you are: the way you talk, the way you carry yourself. I've never met anyone with company like yours."
"But we've barely gotten to know each other."
>"I can tell when someone's being genuine or not, and you..." she closed her eyes, taking a deep breath before opening them slowly to look directly at me, "you're more than that."
"Wait, what do you mean?"
>"I'll show you."
>Sherry simply reached into her purse and pulled out something that I wasn't expecting at all - it was a blank, lumpy envelope
>she slid the thing towards my direction and watched with an intense gaze, almost as if she was trying to look through me
>there was only a few things on my mind that could've been: drugs or money, and from the scene at the bar last night, she definitely had enough cash to go around
"Wh-What is that?"
>she whispered, leaning closer on the table
>"There's ten-thousand in there. Take it."
>HOLY FUCK!
>that was more money than I had ever won in the casino, let alone from a good month at work
>my lungs felt heavier than before, having to manually breathe in order to keep composure, if that's what it looked like
>I could pay off my rent for the rest of the year, too
>maybe get myself one of those newer cars instead of driving around in my shitty, beat-up Corolla
>...no
>this wasn't the right thing to do at all, even if she was offering, even if she was trying to prove a point
>damn, it hurt to say, considering the only reason my ass was employed at that strip joint was solely for the money
"I- I can't take this, Sherry."
>my hand barely wanted to touch the flimsy paper, pushing it against fingertips until it was sufficiently on her side of the table
>Sherry had a confident look about her, tail lightly patting against the cushions of the booth while she placed the envelope back in her purse
>"I knew it~"
"Knew what? I'm not just going to take that from someone I just met."
>"Why not? You could have walked out that door and no one here would have even batted an eye."
"What do you mean? Of course they would."
>"Take a closer look. Tell me, what do you see when you look into that crowd?"
>her piercing eyes watched over me, observing each detail in whatever "social experiment" she was planning next
>fine, let's get this over with
>I scouted the entire room, full of business men and women of all shapes and sizes
>most of them were either talking about recent investments or laughing it up to jokes that weren't even funny - it was a kind-of surreal you'd see in movies, to say the least
>I sighed, shrugging my shoulders while giving a half-assed assessment
"Some rich, up-tight assholes, I guess. What does that have to do with anything?"
>"Exactly. All of them are in their own little worlds, thinking about gains and losses. Truth be told, I'm not that different from them."
>I paused, looking back into the vixen's eyes with a small sense of dread
>"But you - you're nothing like that. There are some things in this world money can't buy, if you can believe that."
>Sherry's fingers crept their way across the table to mine until she was able to press into the back of my hand, eventually laying her own hand atop mine
>she was looking into me the entire time, waiting for something to happen
>I was trying to do the same, looking for something I wasn't so sure about - what was it? It felt like... a spark? Passion?
>"Your espresso, sir." the deer came back with two cups, handing one over to you
"Oh. Uhh, thanks."
>well, that's one way to kill the mood
>"And here is your order, Miss."
>"Thank you."
>"If you need anything else, please, feel free to call us over."
>we both nodded, waiting for the steam to settle on our freshly brewed concoctions - they smelled heavenly, even in the flavor-dense atmosphere
>each of us took turns sipping our drinks, occassionally making eye contact between to gauge our thoughts
>it was almost like a game of chess: seeing what moves your opponent would make depending on the ones you took, and right now, it was a stalemate
>"So, since you asked me about last night, it's my turn to ask some questions of my own." she set the half-filled cup on the counter with a sly look
"Fire away."
>not like I had much of a choice - she would probably try and pay for this instead of going dutch, too
>"Are you happy doing what you do?"
"You mean like bartending, or what exactly?"
>"You said it before, 'the cards not being in your favor?' Ring any bells?"
>she was right, yet again, but was I going to tell her that straight to her face?
>the job was simple and some nights were pretty nice - then again, it wasn't the career I'd love to continue for the rest of my life
>even looking back at it, I hesitated when it came to that envelope of money she left on the counter
>was I really that easy to manipulate or did I do it out of a need to survive, taking whatever scraps were fed my way?
>"You and I aren't getting any younger, tiger." she took another sip, looking into the crowd once more with those dagger-like brown eyes
>"The last thing I'd want is for someone like you to 'fade away.'"
>a bit ominous but she had a point
"What are you getting at?"
>"Well, you know how to make a damn good drink and I'm pretty sure I 'like' you." she chuckled under her breath, "I'm willing to give you an offer you can't refuse."
"And what happens if I don't?"
>"You won't." her lips curled along her muzzle, showing her fangs in a sinister fashion while tapping her claws against the table
>those last two words got my nerves in a bundle and a well of anxiety boiled in my gut... part of me wished it was the coffee speaking
>I pushed the near-finished cup to my side, resting both my arms on the table while leaning forward - my attention was set to full, waiting to hear what the smug vixen's offer was
>"How would you like to work for me?" she said while adjusting her position in the booth, pointing a finger at herself while puffing her chest towards me in a confident manner
>there was a glint in her eyes: a deviousness that tempted me all the way to the bone
"For you, huh?"
>"Full-time employment, with benefits. The hotel down the street could use a guy like you."
>Sherry looked to the wall as if her vision could see through stone, in the general direction of the nearest hotel I could think of
>there was no way she was serious
"You mean, 'The' Sapphire Crown?"
>"That's the one."
"You own that building?"
>"An overwhelming majority of it's shares are under my name, so yes, I would say I own that building."
>she leaned forward to poke my nose with her finger, prompting me to reel back in my aloof state
>my disbelief turned into a cautious stare, looking back and forth between the wall, Sherry, and my lap
>those buildings were far more than some dime-a-dozen hotel chain: they were luxury suites for executives and business folk that frequently traveled, prioritizing mainly in dense cities
>no wonder she chose this place for coffee since it was right nearby, IF she was telling the truth
>hell, that's probably why she knew all the staff by heart
>but she wouldn't just offer the job without something in return, right?
"What's in it for you?"
>"Oh? And here I thought you weren't the business type." she said with a smirk on her face
"Well it'd hardly be fair. I'd hate to take advantage of someone who's already spent so much on me."
>"I just want a cute guy like you close-by, that's all... unless, of course, you're offering something in return?"
>Sherry feigned innocence, swaying back and forth in her booth while her tail flicked happily behind
>Shit, fell right into that one. She turned the tables on me without even having to ask it first - was this her plan all along?
>there was nothing of value I could offer to a woman like her, which could only mean one thing
>I was going to have to pay for it with my body
>that was the final option - maybe I could find a way to work this out before jumping to conclusions: I mean, she could be bluffing or maybe the job was too good to be true
>there was still a lot to consider before abandoning a semi-steady career, even if it did suck
"Well, I'm still not sure exactly."
>she stared at me, pressing against the table with her chest in an effort to elicit a response - that dress could only conceal so much of her cleavage, but when the fabric was stretched-
>"What's the matter, big guy? Cat got your tongue?"
>now my mind was on the fritz
>the only thing I recall was a voice louder than I thought speaking for myself, the words flowing out my mouth as careless and brash as they did
"It's just, I don't know the place and it's a hell of a decision to make: Where would I be staying? What's the bar like? It's a lot to think about, Sherry."
>her persistence came to an immediate stop
>"Oh. I see." she slumped back into the booth, along with her tail, "Sorry, Nathan."
>it was only a moment before the crowd in back seemed to grow louder, overtaking the silence between the two of us
>the day was also coming to a close: different shades and colors barely visible from the windows inside the bittersweet-scented coffee shop
>guilt tore deep into me, wondering if I could take back what I said, but knowing it was futile
>"No. It's my fault. I should be the one saying sorry."
>I looked up to see Sherry's head in a dismissive state, hung low and looking at her lap
>jeez, I really fucked that one up
>I never even stepped inside and already I was protesting the-
>suddenly, an idea sprouted like wildfire in my head
"Hey, Sherry."
>she only raised her head a little to meet eye contact, the somber expression on her muzzle clear what she was thinking
>maybe this would cheer her up.. it was worth a shot, if anything
"How's about you show me around?"
>I took a second to collect myself - she did the same
"Maybe... Maybe if I get a feel for the place, I could take you up on it. Then, you could get a drink from me whenever you'd like."
>she paused for a minute, averting her gaze and bringing it back to look directly into my eyes
>another one of her tests but I wasn't going to falter
>"You're not just saying that, are you?"
"I haven't lied to you so far, have I?"
>"I'd really like that, Nathan." a sincerity in her voice brought me back, as if I was teetering on the edge of a cliff
>fuck that was close
"I can escort you too, if you'd like."
>she laughed softly to herself, reaching into her purse to pull out her wallet - she left a sizable tip, not like yours, but still a godsend to a minimum wage worker
>"You're cute, you know that?"
"Don't really get that often."
>"You will, IF you take the job."
"Then I guess you'll really have to convince me."
>both of us stood up from the table: Sherry immediately came to my side, clinging onto my arm and gently rubbing her fur against my skin
>"Don't worry. I'll think of something, tiger~"
>we headed over to The Sapphire Crown across the street, watching out for the slew of traffic and pedestrians
>Sherry kept as close to me as possible, her saunter occasionally touching my leg with that big tail of hers
>when we reached the entrance, we were immediately greeted by one of the head staff offering to help the vixen with whatever she needed
>she dismissed him formally, saying that she was here on business while gripping onto me tighter - guess she really wasn't lying
>eventually, I got to see the full bar and all the amenities it had to offer: there was no customers around so we had free range of the place
>safe to say it was in excellent shape and a hell of an upgrade from the backwaters I was used to
>there was even some equipment I never used because the shit cost so much
>Sherry watched me, like a kid in a candy store, eyeing up everything I could and describing what they were used for
>I didn't know if she was really interested or just giving me attention, but I was glad to have her authorization
>"Sooo? What do you think?"
"This place is- damn, I don't even know where to start. It's neat and organized and, and there's just so much I could do."
>"You must really love bartending."
"Yeah. It's a good way to get to know people."
>"Why don't you go ahead and make something?"
"You sure?"
>"You don't need my permission. Just make something you think I'd like."
>the limitless options of what I could do here was overwhelming, to put it lightly
>I just started looking at whatever bottles were on the shelf closest and started to pour into a shaker with ice
>a bit of sweet vermouth, a couple shots of fine bourbon, club soda for a little fizz, and a dash of orange liqueur
>it was simple, but I didn't want to overexert myself just yet
>finally, I grabbed a glass and poured the drink, adding two cherries on a spear for color
"It's nothing special, but I think you'll like it."
>Sherry raised the glass, eyeing me from behind the concoction with a smirk - she took one sip and let out a content sigh
>"You're right. This is pretty good."
"Glad you enjoy it."
>good thing too, I was afraid of anymore conflict between the two of us
>my natrual instincts started taking over, wiping down the equipment I just used in an autonomous fashion
>Sherry continued to sip from the cool glass, watching me the entire time as I performed each meticulous action, or so I thought
>"You know Nathan, I never fully thanked you that night."
"Really, it's nothing."
>"I mean it."
>she stirred the half-empty drink in a circular motion, watching the crumbled bits of ice that floated in the glass drift and clink
>once finished, I put down my towel and came around the counter, taking a seat on the stool beside the vixen
"Thanks but look Sherry, you've already done so much for me."
>"That's not what I mean, big guy."
>she took another sip of that sweet drink, then placed it on the counter - the perspiration dripped onto the lacquered wood as the time went by
>"You're sweet. You're also one hell of a flirt." her tail swayed on the stool, almost like the pendulum on a clock
>"But you're an even bigger tease."
>wait, what
"Wh-What makes you say that?"
>she came closer, speaking softly at only less than a foot away between our faces
>"The way you look at me, the way you make me feel, even the way you smell..." she took a breath of air, exhaling from her nostrils in a pleasure-drunk tone
>"You like the attention, don't you~? I could tell that night, too."
>it was hard to know from my perspective: sure, the other night was a bit of a show for her, but was I naturally teasing her?
>I was getting cold feet before I even had a chance to react, seeing that expression of hers turn "predator"
>"I don't want to see you get carried away by some other woman,"
>she leaned into my ear, whispering in a sultry tone
>"I want you ALL to myself, Nathan."
>those words must have spoken to my inner core, a blend of sexual tension and hesitation kept me from moving - my eyes locked on the vixen's half-lidded gaze, her eyes full of lust and craving for more
>"So what's it going to be, tiger~? Are we going to keep playing around," her teeth pinched my ear, the hot breaths on my skin sending shivers throughout my body, "or should we get some privacy~?"
>all I could muster was a couple short breaths, making a small indent on her fur
>"Mmm, I think I really like you like this~ All cute and pretending to be 'innocent.'" she licked my neck with her smooth tongue, coating it with a thin, warm fluid
"Nnff~"
>I tried to stifle the sound, barely letting it pass through my teeth to no avail
>"Ooo~" Sherry cooed as her tail flicked rapidly and her body wiggled atop the stool, "Now I KNOW you really want this."
>I watched as she grabbed her drink, finished the rest with a hearty sigh, slammed it on the table, and jumped off her stool
>"Come on~" she beckoned with a flick of her finger, slow and deliberate, coaxing me off my stool and into her clutches once more
>the vixen wasted no time wrapping her arm around mine: this time, she did so with much more vigor, pressing my forearm hard against her chest as she led me to one of the rooms on the first floor
>she pulled out a keycard from her purse and swiped it against a black panel, producing a "beep" and a "clunk" - the door was unlocked without a problem
>the lights immediately flickered on to a room like any other hotel room: big ass bed with large sheets, a standard television, decent bathroom to the side as you walked in
>only difference was the workstation in the corner where a couch normally went - must be for company purposes
>"Feel free to make yourself at home," the vixen said, letting her blue dress fall to the floor, exposing all of her body before me
>goddamn, she didn't look a day over thirty
>she was already making her move while I gawked at the place
>her slim figure was now clear underneath that brown coat of hers with the only difference being the white fur on her belly and chest
>both her breasts hung carelessly in the calm ambience and her nipples were perked up in anticipation of events to come - they had to be C-cups, for sure
>her legs were nothing short of voluptuous, curves leading upward towards a temple of pure bliss
>"You ever been with a woman like me?" her hips swayed from side to side, taking her time to walk past me and lock the door behind
>"Don't worry, I'll be gentle~" she whispered, standing on her toes to give a peck on my cheek
>before she walked by, she locked her hand with mine, fingers intertwined, leading me towards the bed with a confident gait
>I couldn't do much other than follow her lead - my mind was clouded with thoughtlessness, a putty being molded by the vixen's grasp
>once there, she simply pulled my hand down, bringing my head to her level - the dumbstruck expression that still riddled my face was gazing into her passionate eyes, brimming with sexual frustration
>"God, you're too cute~"
>she tilted her head to fix her muzzle against my face, kissing my lips delicately, then with fervor, slipping tongue and exchanging as much saliva as she could
>my body couldn't help but shiver against Sherry's resolve, feeling her flames of passion ignite mine into a whirlwind
>I was getting lost in her, bringing my other hand around the back of her head, holding on for dear life, sinking fingers into that fur of hers
>this only made her want more: she pressed her tongue deeper, letting some of our devotion drip off our chins in a messy display
>then she stepped forward, leaning her body closer and closer until my legs were at the foot of the bed, knocking the both of us onto the sheets with a soft thud
>Sherry chuckled slyly, continuing her assault, moaning hot breaths in-between and keeping my hand locked in a vice-like grip
>her other hand crawled over my body, taking its time to feel my features until it rested above my crotch, squeezing the tight pants and confirming a definite bulge underneath
>"I think someone's got naughty thoughts~"
>a devious grin appeared on her face: her hand rubbed over the protrusion, back and forth, causing my body to arch and ache in her clutches
>it felt so good... but I was still confused - did I want this? To be taken by a vixen in heat?
>that consistent friction against my hardened member coaxed a word that I uttered between moans: soft, yet clear as day
"Yes."
>Sherry ceased everything she was doing, looking at the panting body that laid beneath her
>she bit her lip, letting out a sly chuckle between breaths: she pressed one of her hands against her breast, teasing a perked nipple, and the other on her nethers, circling around her button
>"Mmm~ Say it again, Nathan~"
"Yes."
>she hastened herself, pressing deeper into her flesh and fur
>"Mmff~ SUCH a good boy~ Again."
"Yes, Sherry!"
>"MMFF GOD I want to ride that cute face of yours so HARD!"
>she stopped playing with herself to hunch her body over mine, putting both her hands beside my head and pressing her forehead against mine
>"You'd like that, wouldn't you?"
>call it fear, hesitation, or whatever else I could possibly muster, looking into her eyes only revealed a beast that was reveling in their own pleasure - my body was in a state of panic
>and it chose to accept its fate
"Yes."
>"Good boy~"
>she adjusted both her knees above my shoulders, straddling her wet flesh mere inches from my face
>"Now, do a good job and I'll make sure to give you a treat afterwards~"
>the heat radiated off her body onto mine: small tufts of fur on the edges of her thighs brushed my cheeks, and a string of wet lust dripped onto my chin
>she lowered herself, pushing those folds against my lips, pressing her button against my nose, moaning out my name in a cry of ecstasy while slowly grinding back and forth
>"Nathaahhnn~ Oh fuck me~"
>her scent was inside my nostrils, my mouth, and my mind while her heavenly mixture of love flowed onto an obedient tongue, working to please the vixen above
>Sherry quaked to the stimulation of her honey pot, only able to let out labored breaths
>"Ahh~ Mmff~ Ahhh! Yes~ Oh God, yesss~"
>she changed her rhythm, pressing harder and faster against my face: one hand sunk her claw into the bed while the other continued to massage her breast, lost in her own bliss
>her thighs moved closer together, threatening to crush my head, and the constant slap of wet flesh only made breathing more difficult
>"Nathan! I'm- Ahh~ So close~!"
>my mind was determined to continue but my body was refusing, shaking my right arm against the sheets to try and signal the lust-crazed woman
>it didn't stop: she was too focused on reaching that climax, all while my vision seemed to tunnel around me
>this is how I go out, huh?
>her hips bucked over and over, mashing my face in a mess of sexual fluids and sweat - she was curling her toes right before-
>"AHH~ Ahh! Ahh GOD, yes-OH FUCK!"
>Sherry pushed herself off, lifting her legs as high as they could before adjusting herself to the side of the bed
>I tried to speak at first, coughing up a storm before I could even get a word in
>"Ohmygosh, are you okay? I'm sorry! I-"
"It's okay. I'm alright. It's okay.."
>I did my best to reassure her, taking that time so we could both catch our breaths, more-so for my sake
>damn, that was too close for comfort
>not even a minute went by before she chirped again, her voice sounding meek and frail as if she had committed a great sin
>"A-Are you sure..?"
"Yeah, Sherry. I'm okay now."
>"Okay." her ears relaxed themselves, a solemn look was painted over her muzzle
>"I just.. I got lost in that feeling and- and I-"
>I leaned over to kiss Sherry on the lips, which caused her to completely stop her train of thought - pretty sure she was also blushing
"It's okay, I promise."
>maybe a kiss after a fresh bath in vixen juice wasn't the best timing, but she didn't seem to mind
>"Thank you, Nathan." she slowly shifted herself on the bed towards me, this time with a kiss of her own, soft and serene
>my body returned the favor in earnest, feeling that muzzle connect with me like a clasp, containing our moans and short breaths
>we did nothing but sit on the edge of the bed and make out for what seemed to be an eternity, pulling each other in a loving embrace
>my hands explored her body: all the contours and curves on her thighs and waist, digging into her back, wanting more of her
>her fingers were more delicate: reaching underneath my shirt to feel my abs and shoulders, gently grazing her claws on my skin, and squeezing my ass on two or three instances
>I honestly forgot to count
>by the time we realized, it already turned to night, the window curtains held most of the passing lights and sounds from the outside world
>we both pulled back from our passionate kiss for a moment - I took that time to pull out my phone
>9:34 p.m.
>Sherry looked at the phone with me, turning to a bittersweet expression when I put the phone back in my pocket
>"Nathan?"
"Yeah?"
>I glossed over her figure, reading her body language as best as I could - she seemed upset, but... why?
"Hey, what's wrong?"
>she took a deep breath, contemplating what to say before she spoke
>"I just want to say I'm sorry. For all of this. You're a really, really good guy."
>I was about to say something, but she continued
>"I know I shouldn't be manipulating you into this job, especially with sex, and I feel pretty awful about it, honestly."
>"It's just that guys like you are hard to come by, and a older woman like me, well..."
>"You're.. not going to leave, are you?"
>the tone of her voice was on the verge of breaking, tears visible in her eyes
"Sherry."
>"I'm fine if you feel the way you do, I just-"
"Hey. Listen."
>I took her hands into mine, gripping tight enough to stop her from continuing that downward spiral of self-pity
"I know that things weren't 'as planned,' but, I still had a good time with you. Hell, I've had more fun than I've had in a long while."
"That doesn't mean I'm just going to leave. "
>"B-But you were just looking at your phone."
"I just wanted to see the time. We still got all night, remember?"
>Sherry's eyes glistened, a faint smile on that sniffling muzzle of hers broke through the sorrow she felt
"I really wasn't going to admit it, but I uhh, kind of enjoyed 'this.'"
>my finger pointed back and forth between the both of us - she looked completely shocked to hear that, coming from the guy who almost drowned in pussy, literally
>"You- You really mean it?"
"Yeah, and maybe, we could do this again. Just, you know, a little more carefully."
>she giggled at the last sentence, hunching her shoulders like she was guilty on all accounts
"So, what do you say? Deal?"
>she wiped her eyes with a smile on her face, then locked her fingers with mine
>"How's about we get you cleaned up first, tiger?"
>she was most likely right, even if I couldn't tell - I probably smelled like nothing but fox taint
>Sherry got up from the bed, leading me with her hand towards the bathroom
>"Don't worry, I'll be REAL gentle~"
>Ah shit...

> sees primitive apes evolving in Africa
> as an act of spite against what he knows will become sentient life, decides to engineer a species of hyper-predators using his ship's powerful genetic engineering and fabrication suite so that the apes will be exterminated
> this is the predecessor of the anthro; it is a relatively large (8-9 foot), bipedal, nocturnal ambush predator roughly as intelligent as the things it is hunting. as an incentive to eat and eventually render extinct simian life-forms, space-hitler removed its ability to code for certain vital proteins; it needs to acquire them by eating apes, as they are the only source of some of them. moreover, they are designed to acquire relevant genetic information from local life-forms so that they adapt when they reproduce
> space-hitler dies a much-deserved horrible and agonizing death
> the population of these things is enough to stop humanity from moving out of Africa, but not actually enough to wipe proto-humans/apes out
> a lot of time passes; over time, the ape-eaters evolve to be able to survive off of the blood of non-sentient wildlife
> this means that they spread world-wide, and populations of them in Africa start to decline
> proto-humans move out of Africa and begin to evolve into humans just as the ape-eating things begin to acquire DNA from local wildlife in their habitats
> what are technically just two species of sentient life begin to evolve
> after a certain point, the ape-eaters are now completely recognizable as the modern anthro. size variations from the original 8-9 foot ancestor are very common.
> they still require those vital ape-sourced proteins to survive; moreover, integration of Earth animal DNA has resulted in extremely low reproductive success (not sterility, but very low viability) unless said proteins are part of diet on a regular basis, as the membranes of eggs and sperm break down very frequently without them [or something like that]
> some of the original exterminator-predator biology is extant still; even the smaller variants are comparable in physical capacity to their obstinate prey and capable of doing things like 2-story vertical jumps due to their smaller size (good for hunting tree-dwelling proto-humans), while most can comfortably run at speeds measured in the medium teens of digits in miles per hour; individuals capable of lifting close to half their body weight with one arm are common
> hands/feet/tongues are sometimes prehensile [if, in the case of the latter, not very physically capable], and tails always are when the bone structure supports it
> extra types of cones in the retina result in greyscale night vision in low-light conditions
> large numbers of canine and incisor teeth still, although some individuals which adapted herbivore DNA have significantly fewer
> at this point, they're basically large carnivorous beast-people that are nearly separate species, albeit still capable of producing sterile hybrids via interbreeding
> it really has been a while since space-hitler created these things, and their ability to adapt DNA over generations and create new killing methods is really, really breaking down
> the second-to-last adaptation before it breaks down is venom designed to render bitten but non-killed targets braindead for consumption; however, their ability to create functional genetic alterations is messed up at this point, and instead of shutting down the brain it instead causes dissociative anesthesia by blocking NMDA receptors - think ketamine.
> the one thing the adaptation did get right in its second-to-last attempt at making them more lethal is to mod the receptors in these things' brains to be immune to their own venom
> anthro gene-mods prove incredibly lethal at this point, and human population is dropping fast, but then there's an error - the gene-mods, in all their defective, retarded glory, decide that the humans need to stay around, so that they can provide food for the anthros, so that the anthros...can kill all the humans in the future. yeah, the mods are basically fried at this point by tens of thousands of years of time-induced replication errors and background radiation, and the civilization that spawned space-hitler is long gone. the mods decide that in order to keep the human population up, they need to make eating them less of a problem for the humans, and to do that, they utterly burn themselves out in their last modification, ever - they make the anthros capable of surviving on blood rather than just meat
> the gene-mods are now junk DNA
> the anthros are now strong vampires with a drug-like bite, a bunch of other useful physical features, and a dependance upon simian blood or flesh for survival/reproductive fitness
> none of that supernatural bat-wing or cross aversion or burning in daylight shit, although they still tend to be nocturnal when the opportunity presents itself
> humans and anthros evolve to be sentient, neanderthals are bred into the human DNA pool, etc.
> that infertility without ape blood has lead to a culture of promiscuity among anthros, and sex often occurs between any two adult individuals that form a strong emotional connection - there's basically no difference between "we're very close friends" and "i love you romantically" and "i want to fuck you until your eyes roll back in your head".
> this mean that anthros have both conscious and unconscious incentives to be very equitable, permissive, supportive, and loving romantic/sexual partners (consciously, treating your partner well results in them sticking with you, and, unconsciously, it might be hard to find another one capable of reproducing well)
> after the beginning of what would be the hunter-gatherer phase IRL, the more evolutionarily successful anthro groups decide that it's easier to drink blood than to eat humans, because drinking blood doesn't kill them if you do it right
> if you ask first and offer the physical protection of an 8-foot-tall beastman/woman [with the latter being relevant for the purposes of this thread] in exchange for a bite now and then, the odds are that they'll take it
> moreover, they get hooked on the bite and it's cute when they follow you, and oh, well, why not extend the culture of casual sex to them as well
> anthro-human societal groups start forming
> agriculture is a human thing; anthros join up and offer protection from rival settlements and their anthros, the ability to easily capture more humans from rival settlements, free ketamine bites, and casual sex in exchange for a steady supply of (human) blood and (non-sentient animal) meat, physical labor, and a roof over their heads
> there aren't many anthros compared to humans (the ratio is something like 75% to 90% humans to 25% to 10% anthros), but it's a lot more than the initial 99 to 1, since willing human "victims" enable much faster reproduction
> the standard relationship goals vary wildly - anything from one anthro and one human romantic/sexual/feeding partner to a polyfidelitous inner core of 3 or 4 anthros and an outer ring of like 12 to 16 humans who each have a relationship with one anthro in particular first, and all of the group as a whole second
> racial/gender/sexual identity/etc. divisions are not the defining aspect of this world; instead, it's (a) the type of relationships humans have with anthros, (b) political disputes between all-human, all-anthro, and mixed cultures, and (c) social disputes over the relative power imbalance that anthros are gaining despite their numerical disadvantage
> at some point, some individual anthros mutated unique chemical tags on their venom that only shut down certain receptors, meaning that bitten humans often become addicted to that individual anthro; this is generally seen as a highly desirable thing for both parties and a sign of a fidelitous and happy relationship
> a consensual romantic/sexual/feeding relationship between an anthro and a human is generally seen as the best possible relationship goal, and while it's technically legal in most areas to feed/fuck nonconsensually, bad things tend to happen to anthros that do- after all, all the other anthros that aren't doing that don't know whether their own humans are vulnerable to the ones that do, and all the humans are afraid of it, so both tend to gang up on what are basically rapists
> often, sex is combined with feeding; this becomes a major social issue, since the more backwards anthros think humans are supposed to be food/second-class citizens, not friends or "friends"
> anthros are not as much social animals as their non-sentient counterparts; while wolves and elephants still operate in family groups, and mice still cluster together, they are all generally significantly more possessive and territorial, and often compete for territory, dominance, humans - and, less-violently, for entertainment, even within extended family groups. it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective - the general health and evolutionary value of a group of anthros is determined by the number of humans they don't have to share the blood-producing capacity of. obviously, civilized ones have mostly moved beyond such things, but the basic urges are still there
> the natural biological physical advantages anthros possess give them a notable capacity for combat. moreover, their psychology leans towards outsmarting things and identifying weakened members of groups, meaning that they make natural leaders, psychologists, and medical professionals. however, there aren't a lot of them in comparison to humans, meaning that they're not particularly good at jobs that need numbers, and they're bad at getting along outside of their immediate friend/family/food/fuckbuddy group, so coordination is not their strong suit. their price of living is often high, as well; it's expensive to live in a society that's 80%-something humans and not always built for you, and meat is generally expensive

not related to the one guy's vampire world building, but image the different levels of intimacy of giving blood willingly
your blood in a blood bag
>very impersonal kind gesture and usually the blood is cold or lukewarm
direct feeding from wrist/arm
>more personal, but still fairly non intimate and too similar to giving blood through needle
bit more kinky places like the thighs or from cuts on the body
>more intimate and comes from the vamp being kinky or playful during forms of sex, but all the bites wouldn't be seen when clothed
the neck/nape
>the most intimate from not only being highly visible even when clothed, but because no matter what angle the biter comes from the you have to have a very close embrace in order to do it
>the neck is also very sensitive and you're also literally putting your life/one of the most vulnerable parts in the jaws of a predator

>wake up to the burning smell of ash

>"Hah, there's no use running now, boy."
>she takes a big sniff of your chest, letting out a exasperated sigh while lolling her tongue out

If someone was making a documentary on human-anthro relations, where anthros were asked about how they feel about humans, what would your favourite species have to say?

>"I mean, how can anyone resist the little guys? They're so cute! So small, and squishy, and soft, and if you kiss them in just the right places they make the cutest little noises! Oh, and when their faces turn all red when they're embarrassed, I remember when I first claimed my little cuddle bug here, he was all shy and stammering, oh, but when I took him he just moaned and wrapped his legs around and gave me everything he had. I even made his eyes roll back into his head! He was just too much! Oh look he's blushing!"

>I've got the worst of luck...
>it's been less than two days on this ship: I came aboard thinkin' this was another frigate-class government supply vessel, instead, it was nothin' but a ruse
>slave traders - not just any band of misfits too, these low-lives were known as "The Black Gallery," a mostly-female group of experienced thugs and thieves
>the company aboard this ship disguised the entire thing, making sure not to leave any speck untouched; government-issued tracking codes, forged serial numbers, the works
>I don't know what they were after but now that I'd seen 'em, they had no option but to keep me locked up so they could figure out when to dispose of me
>last time I'll ever take information from that prick "Balthazar" in She'evryn
>I've barely been given any scraps of food or water between the two anthros guardin' my cell
>one of them is a seven-foot tall horse man which likes to come in and rib-check me after a "hard day's work"
>must be trying to lower my morale but I've been through worse
>hurts like hell, though
>the other is a eight-foot gator- no, a crocodile: she'd get pissed if I called her that... gotta remember the snouts and jawlines are different between 'em
>nonetheless, she was the one mainly lookin' after my cell, currently taking a snooze, sitting on a stool designed for someone hundreds of pounds lighter than she was
>her horse friend was busy sharpenin' a knife against a rock slab she must've found off the ground - the blade was crude and thoroughly worn-down, but it's probably seen more action than mine, wherever they had my shit
>if only I could-
>no, don't even think about it
>if I did manage to escape, if I miraculously came across an escape pod and the right codes to eject the damn thing, it wouldn't go unnoticed and I'd be just beggin' to get shot down
>but that uneaten sandwich on the table looks so fucking good right about now
>damn, I'd do anything for a bite right now...
>"Look alive! Captain on Deck!"
>the gruff horse's voice rose the slumbering beast into a startled mess, fumbling about until she stood at attention for the superior officer that came down the stairs
>at least, that's what I'd thought
>a stunning six-foot mink wandered into the keep, her slim figure swaying side to side in a battle-worn French commander's outfit that accentuated her luscious curves - Joanna de Claverie, the one and only captain of The Black Gallery fleet
>she was wanted in over seven different parsecs for illegal goods and slave trade, destruction of government property, falsifying documents, and the occasional decapitation of government officials
>the list goes on and on, but it's safe to say she was a mad woman with a temper for the law that knew no equal
>"At ease," she said with a tired look on her short muzzle, possibly due to a night on the bottle or waking up too early - there was no way to tell behind these metal bars
>both of my captors relaxed their bodies, going back to their posts as if they were busy while the captain walked around the brig with a lazy expression
>she was whistling a tune, something similar to "I've Been Working On the Railroad," as her heavy boots gave a certain aura of suspense
>it only stopped when she came close to the end, near my cell - she raised her head in the air, taking a couple sniffs to distinguish whatever smell she had found, then tilted her head to look at me
>"Hey," the mink beckoned with an authoritative voice, shaking her head in my direction, "Who's this guy?"
>the horse man came near Joanna, and in a split-second, he was greeted with a choke-slam against my cell's bars, then wrestled to the ground before he could react
>"You.. FUCKING KNOTHEADS! Mind telling me why NOBODY'S informed me about this rat yet?!" she said, brandishing her claws and tightening her grip against the horse's neck
>despite the horse having a height and weight advantage, the element of surprise brought her down to a writhing mess on the floor, struggling to answer with a raspy voice
>"What's that? I can't hear you choking on your own INCOMPETENCE!" the captain seethed through her teeth, fur standing on edge
>"W-We thought you already knew, Captain." the crocodile mustered from behind, trembling in place with fear in her thin eyes
>Joanna turned her head slowly to glare at the buxom lizard, releasing her vice-like grip immediately from her subordinate - honestly, I felt sorry for the poor equine, crawling away and gasping to catch her breath
>"Did I FUCKING ask you?" she pointed a claw in the crocodile's direction, "Next time, stay quiet unless told, or I'll make you."
>she spewed those last words out like venom
>the captain stood up, surveying the situation, then gazing into the cell directly at me - those thin pupils pierced my soul to the bone
>"So, who the fuck is this piece of meat anyway?"
>"We found him- cough cough- stowed away with the goods, during inventory rounds," the horse tried speaking, "He- cough- just gave himself up. Took all his gear so the fucker wouldn't try anything."
>that was a lie - I still had a knife in my boot, in case things got hairy, but I wanted to ease their suspicions on me as much as possible so acting like a civilian was my best bet
>"What did he have on him?"
>"A notebook in a bag, some- cough cough- Mat-Sec rations, and a Jynx Type-L Blaster."
>"Where are they now?"
>"In the armory."
>"Well, at least you nut-less fucks can do something right," Joanna crouched down to smell the air once more, "He fucking smells like a nobody... Hey, skinny. What's your name?"
>maybe she knew I was a thief, but hopefully not my entire record - thankfully, no one has brought up my notebook so it seems I'll be in the clear for now
>better try and give her a name that sounds non-descript, maybe that'll get me off this ship faster if I pose myself as a nobody
"Johnathan Hargraves"
>"So, skinny, what were you doing on MY ship? With a pretty face like that, looks like you barely just finished school."
"I got lost on my way back to Nevaal. Before I knew it, the ship took off. Tried looking for a place to sleep and then 'they' found me."
>"Alright, but what's a civvie like you doing with a Type-L Blaster? Last I knew, only shitty pilots used to use those things."
"It's my Dad's. He used to use it back in the day, now he's gone."
>at least that much was true
>"So you're a stray, huh?" she chuckled to herself, then it turned into full-blown laughter
>"Boy, do I have bad news for you-"
"You're the infamous "Joanna," right? Leader of The Black Gallery?"
>that caught her off guard - she stopped laughing and her face turned expressionless, immediately staring back into me with those piercing eyes once again
"That's your name, right? Joanna de Claverie?"
>"Sounds like you know a bit about me," her claws grazed against her cheek, lightly pulling against her bottom lip and showing some of her fangs, "What else do you know?"
"Well, uhh, I learned a bit here and there from people on the streets. Your gang is wanted in over seven parsecs."
>"HAH! We're MUCH more than a gang, kid." Joanna chided with a smirk on her muzzle
>"But we're far from Nevall now... You scared, kid?"
"N-No.."
>I tried to sound a bit uncertain - sure, they could do a lot to me, but maybe I could get on her good side and see more of the ship
>if that was the case, then I could get my shit, take my fair share, and they'd never know who I was

>guys talking smack all over vc
>but it's not enough for her to show one or two of them up
>she must vent her frustrations in a perfectly natural manner by rubbing herself noisily over the call
>everyone shuts up, some join in

>the galaxy is a pretty dangerous place
>most species are pretty xenophobic and only concerned with their own prosperity and survival, to the point that most will just enslave or outright genocide you if they have a chance
>if you're a new spacefaring civilization that's been discovered by a more advanced one, then nine times out of ten you're pretty much fucked
>the Squidoids of Proxima Centauri don't come in peace, they come with neutron bombs and tachyon beams to purge your worlds clean of life and strip mine them for resources, either cuz they don't want to give you the chance to advance and eventually do the same to them, or because they just found your species so hideous and alien to their sensibilities that they decided you don't deserve to live in the same galaxy as them
>so it was very lucky of humanity to make first contact with one of the few species that were A. humanoid and B. not complete xenocidal turbocunts
>the Fenrisians had been a spacefaring civilization since humans first started figuring out gunpowder, and in all that time they had been carving themselves out a place in a universe full of mean ugly bastards, whose first instinct upon seeing something different from them was to blast it out of existence
> by the time the two species met in the mid 23rd century, humanity was just taking its first awkward steps out of the solar system with their freshly discovered FTL tech, and the Fenrisians were a war-hardened empire with enough kill tallies to make the squidoids think twice
>after a very tense first contact, that almost resulted in a human colony getting nuked, the Fenrisians were happy to finally meet a race that didn't use railguns as a form of greeting, and humanity was just happy to meet somebody

>the Fenrisians grew to love humans, for a variety of reasons
>for one, humanity was a young race, still new to interstellar travel, and the Fenrisians found their unbridled excitement and curiosity endearing
>and then there was the fact that to Fenrisians, humans were just plain adorable
>small, furless, no claws, and tiny little fangs, humanity was like a race of cute little neotenic primates
>humans took the Fenrisian starnet by storm within a matter of months, with trillions of vids/pictures of the cute little monkeys flooding the net
>it took only a few hours before the first porn was uploaded
>so it should come as no surprise that the Fenrisians also became protective of humans
>very protective
>to the point that within just a few years of first contact, humanity had become a protectorate of the Fenrisian Empire, with fleets patrolling human populated space

people need to play up more how humans have tiny predatory features that other pred species would find cute
>forward facing eyes which is common among pred species
>tiny canines/fangs and small mouth so any time we eat meat you'd get pred anthros cooing at you how cute it is
>now claws
>a lot of play for humans is also similar in how a lot of playing for pred species is mock hunting behavior
>flatter faces so humans would be cute in a way baby animals have shorter muzzles

>Have traits often found in baby pred anthros, endearing us to them
>To prey anthros it's like a weak little creature trying to act tough and failing
>Prey anthros also often use it in their "besting and fucking predator" fantasies

>the fact that the two species were sexually compatible just strengthened the fenrisians obsession with humans, and before long interspecies relationships became commonplace
>it was really the best deal humanity could ask for, on their own, the human race would have been swept aside by any number of ugly nonhumanoids hungry for resources and genocide, and the only thing the fenrisians really asked for in return was space nookie
>and then there came the incident
>in 2340, a small human freighter vessel, crewed and captained by just one man, was captured by a race of cephalopods whose name has been stricken from history
>the cephs took the man prisoner and proceeded to cut him open, to see how he ticked, as they did with just about anything new they came across
>not so much as a hello, just straight to vivisection and experimentation
>the whole thing probably never would have come to light, had it not been for one fenrisian patrol group that just happened to stumble upon the ceph ship, and then promptly disable and board it
>when the fenrisians boarded the ship and found the man's eviscerated remains, it spelt the end of the entire ceph species
>the news went public humanity was horrified, and the fenrisians apoplectic
>one life
>one human life was all it took for them to completely lose their shit

>the resulting genocide was perhaps one the biggest and most thorough in galactic history
>a single hit from a fenrisian battlecruiser's main gauss cannon is enough to end all life on a planet, two is enough to crack the planet in half
>the fenrisians not only triple-tapped every ceph world they could find but vaporized the chunks of planet left floating in space
>to this day, centuries later, the area of space that once comprised the ceph empire remains the galactic equivalent of a ghost town, just a big expanse of empty space, left silent as the grave
>and the fenrisians keep it that way, a permanent reminder o the rest of the galaxy of the price for touching their space husbandos

>a few years after the ceph genocide, a human cargo freighter unexpectedly makes first contact with another space faring species that resemble felines
>the human crew and the newly discovered felinid species hit off well
>human crew later learn that the felinids are actually apart of a dual-alliance with a species of enormous reptile-esque aliens that reassemble crocodiles
>upon learning of this discovery, the human government is thrilled that they have discovered another potential Allie and trading parter
>however, the Fenrisians did not share humanities enthusiasm upon learning these developments.
>they didn’t see potential allies, they saw romantic competition.
>and they don’t want to share

>Humanity wasn't seen as lower class. Not less intelligent, nothing less than the Fenrisians.
>No, but they were seen as needing protection.
>Of course, that was fair. Humanity still needed to learn the ways of the bigger world out there, and the race was only still growing.
>However, humanity was never given a chance to show who they were. How they came to be outside of their history. Long and bloody.
>It was no real surprise. It happened with all races, even the Fenrisians.
>Humanity was thankful for that, to not be an outlier in their brutailty.
>However, living and integrating with another race lead to less fighting all together, especially when the Fenrisians began to protect them.
>So when word came of an incident where a human colony had been attacked the Fenrisians came to help.
>What was before them as they touched down, was the bloody remains of battle.
>Humanity wasn't as advanced. Not as strong.
>Yet humanity fought back with everything they had. So many dead. So many dying and unable to be saved. Yet despite everything, they had won out long enough for help to come.
>This was the first time the Fenrisians really saw what kept humanity alive all these years. Will, determination and percerverince.
>Not the strongest. Not the most advanced. Not the best of the best. They just don't give up.
>Even when all seems lost, even when it would be safer, easier, to give up. They don't. Because humanity keeps going, an unending desire and drive to live.

>things came dangerously close to war
>luckily war was not only averted but an alliance was formed all thanks to the human ambassador who attended the negations
>not because of anything he said, but because he nodded off in his chair during the talks, and the other three ambassadors all agreed that he was adorable when he slept, and so with that bit of common ground, the talks took a much more positive turn

>ywn be a member of the guard
>ywn be asked to do a photoshoot for human propaganda because of your "heroic features" in return for a safer job
>ywn get in front of a camera with a member of the mechanicus with a weird shaped camera and be told that it's just the newest model
>ywn be told to do strange poses, some with you turned around and bending over, some with your pelvis in a thrusting pose
>ywn agree to it anyway because your clothes are so thick no one could possibly find it attractive
>ywn find a billboard a few days later with a clear x-ray showing your body underneath your clothes
>ywn see the female beastmen and other animal like mutants staring at the billboard whenever you pass by one
>ywn see aliens on your side of the battlefield more often
>ywn see more wars won, with mutants and aliens being interviewed afterward saying they were inspired by "humanities perfect bodies gifted by the Emperor's himself"
>ywn become increasingly concerned as fewer male humans are doing the fighting
>ywn feel hungry eyes on you at all time

>This just in, a new sport has replaced Blood Bowl as the most popular amongst lizardmen, beastmen, and skaven!
>The point is for the team fuck the ball carrier who is always human (and male by necessity)
>Human males usually refuse to play, but some donations from the followers of Slaanesh has ensured the supply has not dried up
>There are two popular versions
>Grabbers keepers and the Slaaneshi league
>The former lets the winners keep the man, and the players are usually played by amateurs who want to test their luck
>The Slaaneshi league however is where the pros go, and a lot more money is on the line
>the ball runner is well trained in dodging and running, and they get paid more the longer the game goes giving them a fine incentive to avoid the enemy teams
>The final prize? Riches beyond your wildest dreams, and the MVP of the winning team gets to pick which runner she wants to keep
>Warning: anyone who picks a ball runner is only allowed the "Blocker" position, and any attempts for them to have sex with the carrier will get them disqualified
>Fun fact, almost no human teams have joined, and the ones who have joined are at the very bottom of the rankings
>If any attempt to join, good luck, this can almost be as scary as the Blood Bowl

>human boy is getting bullied in high school
>but it's by rat anthros
>so their "bullying" is dominance grooming
>started out as them just grabbing him and combing his hair/licking it to groom
>then they moved up to using actual combs and hair cutting scissors
>and that wasn't enough so they brought in nail clippers/files, skin care products, tooth brushes, shaving razors, and such

>That, plus the incredibly iconic looking picnic basket, pulls the idea together.
>It would be kinda funny if you didn't feel so fucking stupid.
>Evening, sun is going down now. You're to take a walk through the park from the edge of campus, all the way around and back to the entrance. A few miles long, it would take an hour or so if you only walked.
>So you did. The looks you got, well they were annoying, but you didn't back down. Not once.
>A fox your age laughed, and cupped his hands to call back to you. "Where you going red?"
>The urge to say, "Your grandmothers" is almost too great to pass up. You're not looking to get into a fight though. This is bad enough.
>"Grandma's, of course. Where else?" You call, the grin coming to your face easily enough.
>You walk along a little longer, eating up the attention. It helps to do that, rather than let it bug you.
>The trail goes deeper into the more wooded area, and you go on though, happy that the streetlamps had already begun to flicker on. Your path is lit.
>There really aren't many people here, but you do pass by a few others.
>One human girl jogging keeps going and only stops with a realization once you had passed her.
>After that, you're a little more than halfway though.
>Silence surrounds you. Insects are barely making any noise, and very few birds call out.
>That's what gave you the creeps at first.
>The feeling worsened was the rustling from a section of brush and trees by the riverbed.
>You keep going, but as you reach the spot where the bushes very visibly move and rustle, that's when a figure breaks through.
>You both stare at one another for a long time.
>She's fucking tall.
>Like really, what the hell.
>Easily a bit more than a foot on your own 5'8.
>Maybe more, you only come up to her shoulders.
>A female wolf with brownish gray fur and a somewhat tattered, obviously designer, punk outfit.
>Jeans, ripped and torn, a shirt showing off her stomach and a good amount of cleavage.
>The both of you stare at one another for a while. She seems surprised at first.
>At first.
>Then, the biggest, fullest shittiest shit eating grin forms over her snout.
>"Well, good evening little red." She says, her startled expression changing into something more laid back.
>Her posture relaxes and her tail flicks slowly behind her. You feel her eyes scan over your figure almost like they're on top of you.
>"Where are you off to then?"
>The question glances off your brain for a few seconds.
>"Just, going for a walk..." You reply. How the fuck? When did? Where in the hell did your confidence go exactly?
>You force your head back into its rightful place, only to have it immediately bail on you.
>She'd moved while you were thinking so heavily.
>Walking around you, stooping over to look you over.
>What the fuck.
>"Ah, um. Well, sorry to bother ya." You say.
>Fuck it, abort. You're weirded out, and your brain doesn't want to work properly.
>You take your first step, and immediately choke yourself as your hood is grabbed and you're halted from moving past your hood's length.
>A "Gah" sound comes out of your throat, you're almost positive you've never made a sound like that in your life.
>"What's the rush there red?" Her voice is right in your ear now.
>Her breath washes over your face. Hot, moist and rather heavy with the smell of weed.
>Why does that not surprise you? For some reason, the idea just seems natural.
>"Whatcha got in the box?" She asks, already pulling it from your hand.
>You tighten your grip for some reason, though there isn't anything of importance in the basket.
>Surprisingly though, she's able to get it.
>She twists your wrist and you shift into an uncomfortable position, your hand opens up and she takes the basket.
>The wolf is still holding you by the wrist now, and with the other hand she's rummaging through the bag before she grins and pulls out a bottle of coke.
>"Cool, I was thirsty." With that, she manages to twist the top off with a single hand, and then proceeds to completely chug the whole bottle, half of it sticking into her maw.
>Only a few seconds later does she sigh and drop the empty bottle back into the basket.
>"Good shit, though I'm fucking hungry too."
>You're still not sure what the fuck is happening.
>Her now free paw moves to you. It's on your ass before you know what's going on.
>You don't think anyone has ever touched your ass outside of your father giving you a spanking back when you were young.
>"Yeah, I think you'll do for that." She says with a calm looking smile.
>Now you need to set something straight. "What the hell are you on abo-"
>She's been doing a good job keeping you on your toes.
>Now she's managed to knock you on your ass.
>That's because her tongue is in your mouth, and she's pressed right up against you.
>She's so fucking warm. So fucking soft. You honestly feel like you're going to melt into her body.
>This is the weirdest sensation you've ever felt.
>Her hand is still gripping your wrist tightly, and she's using the hand against your ass, now risen up to the small of your back, to pull you right up against her.
>Her tongue is hot, and it's long too. It invades your mouth easily, especially with you so dumbstruck.
>You shudder and finally let out the weirdest noise you've ever made. A light whining moan into her mouth.
>Her hands grip you tighter and you're pulled closer as her muzzle presses against you a little harder as she bears down overtop of you.|
>Realization hits you, and you suddenly know just how much that weird fucking noise you made had turned her on.
>You feel her walking, and now she's basically dragging you forward until finally you fall.
>You're let go and you fall back into the brush and tumble down the slight hill out of sight of the trail.
>Just before you can get your bearings, she's there again, leaning over you.
>You start to get up, but her hands come down on your wrists, pinning you to the ground.
>She moves them, and soon enough she has your hands together, one paw larger than one of your hands holds them both down.
>Her other paw slowly moves down your body, starting at your chest.
>You've never been sensitive to touches like this before, but her clawed finger slowly trails downward and you can't help but squirm and gasp as she runs a finger down.
>It pauses at your waistband.
>You're staring at your groin for a long second before you look back up at her.
>She's staring back at you.
>Slowly you shake your head. The word, "No." don't even have time to leave your mouth.
>She undid your button and pulled them down roughly.
>The thing that's horrible though, is that she didn't bother to try that with your boxers.
>"Red on red? Cute~" She says, before casually ripping them apart. Her claws graze your skin and you yelp.
>Her other hand comes up to your mouth and holds your head back into the dirt.
>"Shut it Red. No noise, understand? Else I swear to god I will find something to gag you with. Be it my fucking panties or anything else I can get my hand on."
>For the first time, she looked dead at you with a look that could kill.
>You finally nod, and the lazy grin returns.
>Your boxers are in shreds now, and your cock is in full view, bare to the cool evening air.
>Slowly, the hand holding your head down let go, and came back down.
>Her hand comes around the base of your shaft.
>"Wait, do-" However you stop talking the moment she looks up at you.
>There hasn't ever been someone with that kind of power over you.
>Yet here was this wolf, holding you down and now grabbing your cock.
>You gasp, because she's just wrapped her paw around your shaft and is rubbing you slowly.
>Her paw pads are almost heavenly. Soft and a little squishy. They have such a strange sensation, so different from your own hand, and yet she's good too.
>Despite it being dry, she moves along smoothly.
>That doesn't last.
>"Time for that meal you promised..." She says. You only barely catch the words, because a moment later her maw has taken your cock entirely.
>You gasp, and bite your tongue. Her other hand is now on your thigh, and her claws are holding at your skin, threatening to pierce you.
>Holy shit, that fucking mouth.
>Her tongue is long, and her muzzle holds your entire length. She begins to bob.
>A light suction comes along with it and you feel like you'll fall through the ground with how light your head is getting.
>Her other hand finally lets go of your thigh, but she keeps sucking you off.
>Instead, you barely register as she undoes her own pants.
>You're unable to help it, and buck upward against her mouth.
>Bad idea.
>Her paw comes back down, and holds you there against the ground. Claws back against your skin. The hand holding yours above your head tightens as well.
>She lets her teeth graze your cock, just the lightest touch.
>That pleasures you almost as much as it scares you.
>Still, you keep quiet as she goes back down on you.
>You feel fit to burst, and just as you're debating trying to thrust into her mouth again, she's let you go.
>Well, she's let your cock go, at least.
>She's shifted and is getting out of her pants entirely now.
>"Fuck, alright. I can't... Not anymore." She huffs.
>She's straddling you, now that her pants are off.
>You can see her tail wagging behind her. It's going rather fast.
>You look back to her, just in time to realize that you're hands are free.
>That doesnt last. She's taken off her shirt and has tossed it aside.
>"Aww, poor Red. Nah, you're staying down there for me, alright?"
>That wasn't really a question. Her hand had come back down to hold your hands where she had left them before.
>Her weight is present, and it's kind heavy. If you weren't so... Jumbled with your emotions, it would have felt really nice.
>"Finally..." She breathes, and your cock presses up against her snatch.
>You feel it's heat and watch in a mixture of shock and several other emotions you have trouble grasping, as she lets herself slide down onto you.
>It's like a gunshot.
>The pleasure and the loud popping, banging noise in your mind.
>How weird.
>You start to moan out, and she silences you.
>Thankfully, she didn't make good on the promise to stuff her panties in your mouth.
>You had a bad feeling that if she did, you may have liked it.
>Instead, it's her tongue again. She's breathing heavily and kissing you again.
>This time it's far more rough. Her tongue is almost attacking your own.
>You don't have any time to catch up on what's going on.
>She rises up on you, and slides back down again.
>You moan into her mouth once more.
>Her other hand grabs your side as she comes up and falls back upon you. That weight feels even better like this.
>She's picking up speed, and you're left under the soft fur, messy, sticky and heavy, Hot and so weirdly wonderful and terrifying.
>You thrust back, and finally she lets you move somewhat.
>You feel that pleasure building again, and you're getting closer and closer.
>She grabs you tightly and the speed is picking up. You don't last.
>You cum, and everything goes dark for a moment.
>Light comes back to you, and the wolf is still riding your cock.
>Your hands are free, but you honestly feel too weak to move.
>Doesn't help that she's still attacking your cock, despite the fact that its so fucking sensitive now.
>In fact, it almost hurts.
>It's a feeling you've never felt.
>Pain, and pleasure so strong that it hurts.
>Her hands are at your waist, helping her thrust down onto you.
>She finally comes down and bites.
>You would have screamed if you had the energy for it.
>She had taken a lot of your hoodie into her mouth, but still, her mouth was right around your neck, holding it down.
>She tightens around you, her arms holding you close, her teeth on your neck, her tight hole gripping your shaft.
>You cum again, and that actually feels painful.
>She holds onto you throughout the whole thing, and you're left panting, wide eyed and staring up at the stars.
>"Ooooh... Fuck." She finally says, letting your neck free.
>You don't move, you feel like your brain has glazed over.
>She doesn't get off of you.
>No, instead she shifts so that her head is beside yours, her teeth catch your ear and pinch it.
>"Mine..."
>That last word, right in your ear. Her breath washing over your face.
>You shudder against her heavy weight.
>About an hour or so later, you're walking back through the trail, and there are those fuckers.
>All of them are laughing and whistling at you and "Nate" Which you assume, but aren't yet sure, is short for "Natalie." The wolf who'd basically raped you and then claimed you as hers.
>The remains of your boxers are now in the basket you carry.
>She's got you pulled up tight against her as she leads you out.
>Honestly you're still too light headed to argue.
>You do notice as she gives them a thumbs up.
>You really hope there is nothing more behind that, but you have a bad feeling they had set the whole thing up.
>You pity the next poor soul they meet. 
>Because from what little you hear later on, Nate is more gentle than others.

>alien anthro ships commonly have human cabin boys

>one constantly gets fur all over your clothes, the other marks you with small scratches here and there
>it's never taken any further than that
>even the slightest mention of FLUF/JAWS having a better inspection gets them riled up
>can't help the smug grin on your face as you basically herded the two into being the most well-kept crews in the division

>as time passed she was clearly getting more into it
>groping her own breasts, humping, giggleing as softly as a donkey could giggle
>you could feel the clit throb and her entire sex almost kiss you back as she let out a great moan
>things stood silent for a moment as you could feel her fluids drool down your chest and hard cock
>letting out a sigh she leaned back and punshed the shower back on
>you're still a bit dazzed and confused over what just happened
>eventually she got out of the stall, drying herself with your towel and tossing it into your face
>"Thanks..." she added before she picked up her swimsuit and shampoo and clopped out the shower
>you stand there and think her scent still on your body
>resuming your shower the thought still lingers and as you get fully dressed and leave to unlock your bike you spot her from behind wearing a black hoodie and laughing with her friends.

Doing a bit of spring cleaning for your parents while visiting, when you uncover a bunch of old photos of your mom in an old shoebox, dressed like a man-molesting, boy-bagging whore from the days before your dad came along. She's everywhere from the beach to the bars and what appears to be hotel rooms, dressed so carelessly with her body so loose and exposed... you stood there for the longest time staring at her pair of exposed breasts which were the centerpiece to what could've been her own handiwork while alone. Such giant, peach-colored nipples that you could've cut glass with... there was even a ziploc underneath that, exclusively filled with negatives and blowups of selfies... with her hands, those same delicate hands that cradled you as a baby and combed your hair for your first big picture day, fondling, pinching, squeezing and even squeezing the genitals of countless different men, from pot-bellied boomers, tanned dudebros to what must've been highschool seniors and even sophomores. There was another box beneath that one, which contained around a dozen pictures taken of your mother in the same hotel room from the last set... every last one, she's topping and you can tell by the redness around her several partners' crotches, that she was slamming down extra hard...
You were erect, so sorely erect and flustered for the flash that was your mom in her prime, that you had completely disregarded the fact that she was in the doorway, wide open, watching you with a red blur across her face, and two firm peach buds poking out through her summer tank top. Leaking.
"Exploring?" She quipped, as she gleamed into the room, closing the door behind her.

Treat your furmom like a queen, make her feel hot, sexy and young again. Let her sit on your face, drink from her chest, let the young and old of her life come together and build something new and beautiful. Then, when the time has come, go down on your mother. Taste her body, the body that beget your own. Be born anew and lay pipe until her womb is full with her little boy's perfect, incestuous seed.

There as been and epidemic lately in athronia, horny humans from the /adhg/ tribe have moved in hearing of our aggressive, dommy women. Many a men wanting to be dommed by Milfs and gang raped by female biker gangs. When they came they were disappointed. It was just another anthro city, no matter how often they walked alone at night or wandered the back alleys in revealing clothes no female anthro made a move on them. Naive and foolish, they couldn't go home after they spent all of their money to get here. So they settle into to this "Prudish" place, they called it. Little did they know that the rumors were right, but not in the way they thought for these anthro females were not promiscuous and unlike human females, mated for life for the sole purpose of love and breeding, but it was how they did this that was so...horrifying....

you see, in anthronia the first person you mate with is almost always your husband or wife, thus. In order to get husbands, anthros will mate with friends sometimes with force.
>Billy got corned it the locker room today by his coworker.
>he never stood a chance
>His female human childhood friend tried to stop her, but she got slashed across the face by the anthro
>all that the human female heard next was quiet sobbing and moaning as her secret love was stolen away..

Some more deviant anthros would rape stranger humies and killed them later so no one will no that they lost their virginity. THough this process is frowned upon, it's a common practice in the drug infested slums of athronia

Childhood friends, coworkers, roomates? There was no such thing as a platonic relationship after you became good friends with anthros in anthronia. She will keep other females at bay, making sure you are as kissless of a virgin as she is. And then one night she claims you.
Some male humie rights activist have tried to get right for the humies who become bethrothed this way, for they are never allowed to break up, and some feel like their is no choice. But all atempts inside the city have been dwarted, for in anthronia you have to make friends and if you make freinds with female anthros, chances are one of them will have their eye on you and will claim you int time.
>john had a childhood friend who was a lizard/serpant thing
>asked him to move to anthronia with her
>she joined to military and he tried to join to
>always wondered why she never had any boyfriends and stuff
>what hot and humid traing day they slip back behind alley
>where she claimed him as the father of her children as they traded cherries.

The top of the food chain were the female anthros who claimed their humies/male anthros via cherry trading or having their cherry popped, they were politicians, warlords, slavers.
Next were the milf biker gangs. Foreigners, women who have had sex with more than one male, or outcast. Looked down on by society, but are feared enough to get tributes from small villages. They are ruthless, and will pillage caravans enslaving men and women humies to sex trafficking. They have been known to line up the women of a villiage and have them watch as they kill their children and rape their husbands. Though most rape is done to for mating. For some anthros still claim this way, just some feel it more delicious to take husbands from human wives.

And finally we have the yeen bandits and raiders. Though not all of them are yeens, a good bit are. These consist of a mixed bag of anthros, but also contain the most ruthless. They do everything the milf biker gangs do except they do it sadistically. They will have humie wives raped in front of husbands, then take the husbands for themselves, coming back with pictures of her new family with her humie to show the enslaved humie wife (currently being used as a anthro male cum dumpster) much to her distress. These bandits eat offspring of human females and see them as competion and will often castrate them and disfigure them, they have been known to make male humie brothels and have male humie harams.

>”It’s not much, I’m working on building my own place on the land my old man left me.” You hear the anthro, Gionna, everyone calls her Gigi, say.
>You nod and trail around both of your cars to step up beside her as she opens up the trailer door.
>With a loud squeaking noise, it’s opened up and the two of you step inside.
>Lights flicker on, and the place is only a bit of a mess. It’s what comes with living alone and working long hours.
>Otherwise it’s fine. Some things lay about, likely shit she was messing with before bed or just before work.
>Gigi taps a remote and lets the tv boot up to some kind of crime drama, before hopping over to the kitchen.
>”You’re welcome to relax and kick off your shoes, you know.” She calls, as you hear the clinking of bottles.
>If you’re drinking, you’re gonna be here a bit anyways.
>You let your boots slide off and you sigh, the coolness of her trailer breathing life into your sore feet.
>She walks around holding two bottles of some cheap malt liquor margarita, and hands you one.
>You knew she was taller, by about two or so inches, but only now do you realize it’s by more than that.
>Your boots gave you two, maybe two and a half extra inches, while she went to work in bare paws.
>The job didn’t need steel toes, so...
>Christ, she was tall. That threw you for a loop, so...
>Fuck it, bottoms up. You crack open the bottle and down half of it.
>After you sat back, she’d sat down too. >You didn’t really realize how close she was at first, not until she leaned forward and set down the six pack of the drinks, now minus two.
>She was almost right beside you.
>Ignore it, not like you actually care all that much.
>You just aren’t used to the kinda closeness is all.
>So together you drink, and you comment on the tv show and you complain about work.
>She tells you how she’s going to be joining her father’s business later, but he wanted her to have “Experience working a normal job.” Complete with air quotes and rolled eyes.
>You tell her how you’re using the company to pay for college, since you’re not willing to go into debt for it.
>Before you know it, you’re out of drinks.
>She saves the day, happily bringing out more, and you two laugh and talk and drink more and more.
>It’s going to be great, spending your one day off painfully hung over.
>As you’re on your eighth drink, she leans over and falls against you.
>Jesus fuck she’s soft.
>You’ve never felt an anthro’s fur before.
>Not like this, at least.
>You’re nearly shocked out of your drunken state.
>Nearly.
>Relaxed, you instinctively reach out and begin to pet her, scratching behind the ears.
>You can’t help but remember the family dog while growing up.
>She feels like that, but much bigger. She moves and reacts differently too.
>Gigi groans and relaxes into your touch, her heavy head falling onto your lap as you pet her.
>You can’t lie, not to yourself.
>This is fucking amazing.
>You finish your next bottle and blink, realizing something.
>You’re a little hard, they way she’s laying against your crotch.
>Her nose is buried against it inhaling your scent.
>At first you just think how weird dogs are and how you she push her away.
>Then you remember she isn’t your dog.
>Wait, is she doing this on purpose?
>Your eyes widen, but your drunken mind tells you to watch.
>Her head lifts and she grabs your zipper.
>You watch in half shock, half drunken lust as her fingers... Weird paws crossed with hands that are insanely cute. As they fiddle with your zipper and undo them until your boxers are revealed.
>Gigi doesn’t even look up at you.
>She just keep going, her nose sniffing and taking in your scent.
>Her fingers pull back your boxers, showing off your half hard cock.
>She didn’t even hesitate.
>Her tongue snakes out and begins to lap at your shaft.
>Jesus fuck.
>It feels good. The flatter tongue, more surface area, nice and long. Hot as hell and so slick.
>You hold back a moan, which she still takes as a sign to work on you.
>Her paws grip your legs and you can feel her blunt claws pressing against your thighs as her maw envelops your cock entirely.
>That’s a whole other sensation.
>She begins to bob up and down, a light pressure holding her mouth there as she begins to suck you off.
>You’re still petting her, but your hand has moved to her back, and it’s trembling now.
>You weren’t expecting anything like this, and you’re not entirely sure how to feel either.
>You try to say something, but the pleasure of her expert tongue forces your words into little moans and gasps of pleasure.
>You’re close, and as you buck up against her once, she pulls away, leaving you painfully hard.
>She grins down at you, now seeming to look over your figure.
>A hand reaches down as she pulls against her top, letting her breasts spill out.
>”How about the main event then, stud?”
>Her voice, heavy and deep, is like magic.
>Your mind is muddled, and the drunken mix of lusty need and addled perception makes you nod.
>Hell, you had told yourself for a long time that you wanted to be with someone, not just fuck anyone.
>Apparently that didn’t seem to matter now. Her pants come off and she slides them away. Her pussy is dripping, puffy and hot right above your still wet cock.
>You hold your breath as she lowers herself onto you.
>Her paws come down onto your shoulders and grip you tightly as she reaches your base.
>You groan, and it’s suddenly muffed as her mouth presses to yours, her hot tongue invading your mouth.
>Your eyes roll to the back of your head as she kisses you. As she rides you.
>Your hand caress her back and the soft fur as she bounces.
>The slightly heavier weight feel insanely good, and with her soft, tight walls...
>Well you don’t last long. You cum, but she keeps riding.
>You moan into her mouth as she rides your sensitive cock, and a minute later she clenches s around you.
>You feel her juices spill out over your crotch as she slumps forward, burying your face with her tits.
>It’s not long before you’re passing out.
>Maybe tomorrow the two of you can talk.
>Hell, this is already a much better weekend than you’ve ever had though.

>find lab/dungeon full of magic/science experiments

Is it me or are anthro majority countries putting all sorts of restrictions on human movements and increasing survellance of them?

it's just for our protection!
you shouldn't be worried about it.

One thing you could do would be to have the school always occupied. Having nocturnal species attending it at night in the same building. Of course you'd need to find some reason for him to at some point switch to sleeping at night, but I don't think that's too bad. It would certainly be quite interesting and could perhaps even further reinforce the idea of him really being in completely different world to what he's used to. The nocturnal anthro species would likely have an even more extreme obsession with humans as they'd be starved for supply due to humans being diurnal.
Maybe humans were always a minority, but just not as extremely. That's far more reasonable than going from majority to tiny minority. Maybe they were like ten or twenty percent of the global population but got reduced to something like one percent or less. Perhaps it was due to some huge war that happened a long time ago. Not ancient, recent enough to still be in the back of some peoples' minds, but not in living memory for anyone. This could also be another source of conflict. Even though plenty are very interested in him, some have nothing but animosity towards him. It could also further reinforce tensions between the other students themselves, almost a factional thing.
I think it's a good idea to not go with him getting randomly jumped for sex like some cheap porn plot. Definitely better to make it a more real story.
And one last thing—don't worry too too much about the setting. The most important thing in writing is this: Just write. Until you actually start turning your ideas into a story then they're worthless. Execution is everything. That's not to say you shouldn't plan, but just make sure you actually have a point where you accept your planning as good enough and start doing.

Have it to where different species of anthros have specific psychological quirks, among those being ones that make them attracted to your MC.
>The lioness girls want to form a sort of harem around him because he has hair that looks really nice, has a lot of body, and is healthy.
>He gets shy enough around the large yeen girls that they can notice and his slight meekness gets them going
>He does still have enough confidence that he can pull off the subtly cocky attitude that really gets to the prey species like rabbits, squirrels, possums, raccoons, what-have-you
>Apparently he hit the genetic lottery and his scent is almost intoxicating to the various canine and wolf girls. Perhaps he resorts to natural cleaning with unscented soap and water so he maintains his natural smell without being dirty and gross?
>Feline anthros are still vulnerable to the effects of catnip, perhaps your MC utilizes this to get them torqued up?
>The bear girls similarly to the yeens are also quite large and MC also gets shy enough around them for them to notice, they also really like this
This might be completely off base from what you had in mind for your guy, but my image is of a human boy who decides to try and lean into all of these weaknesses and have every female in the school wanting him terribly.

>go to bar
>drunk eagle corners you and starts regaling with war stories as her way of flirting

>and a reward he receives, as her palm lifts from the surface of his bare, lightly sweaty skin, tracing two claws down through his smooth pubis and laying her entire hand down once more to the underside of his undescended little package, which was covered only by thin square partition of cloth which was repeated over his posterior
>her sickening motherly grasp turned swift tides as two fingers lifted the underside of the youth's puny testicles, with a thumb covering them up, tenderly the anthro tiger rolled her underage pupil's balls between her squishy pink fingerpads for a moment as her lesson began to wrap up
>of course, all of her students were very far along in their understanding that this was all merely her way of displaying swift acknowledgment for their corrections, even if they didn't always deserve such a prize, and could only pay it as much mind as a single-digit age child hoisted into a rigorous training regimen could muster
>dropping the boy's sweet, ripe fruit, she concluded the class on a lesson in bodily cleanliness, and dismissed the young men
>save for one, of course

>live with anthro roommate
>she's not a NEEt exactly, she has a job, but she's pretty much a shut-in who rarely leaves her room

>one day she gets a package, one with what looks like nip moon runes all over it
>you take it to her, like the good roommate that you are, and upon seeing it in your hands, bleary, sleepy eyes instantly go wide, and her tail and ears both perk right up
>she snatches it out of your hands and slams the door behind her

>she wears headphones when she games, so volume isn't really a problem most night
>except this night, she slipped up

>she must have unplugged her PC in a panic upon realizing that her headphones weren't on because it abruptly stopped and the rest of the night went on dead quiet

This is your adopted anthro sister. She's a year younger, a head taller, smells like shea butter with an undertone of wet coochie and loves meat. A lot. Earlier this morning, she accidentally brushed her juicy brown butt across your crotch while you two were scooting past one another in the bathroom. Deep down, you couldn't help but consider how aggressive that "accidental" bump was. She pulled a one-eighty and gave you an "Ooh!" with a hand over her agape mouth, then quickly carried off to her room and shut the door. Not that you'd ever tell a soul, much less her's, but the smell of her body drove you absolutely mad. With feelings. Feelings of her sitting on your face, nude and giggling while she teased at your bulge with her soft, chocolate footpads. Feelings of you violating your younger sister's privacy, despite her insistence, lapping at her dripping spot from top to bottom, drunk with "that" smell. The same smell that always hits the hardest when she leaves her room, door remaining closed beforehand.
She's sassy. She's got spunk. And you want her to go feral on you. Of course, this is a small world, and just what luck such feelings would strike, as the feeling was reciprocated on the other side of your wall, where your sister was rubbing herself a pretty little wet spot to the thought of dropping all pretenses, stripping and paying her older brother a conjugal visit.

So imagine cute scenes of anthros bringing in some animals they hunted and eagerly watching a human cook/prepare some food in village. Could also see places that have a human cook in a mostly anthro area would get more customers.

>Species:
Hyena (Commonly reffered to as 'Yeens'
>Homeworld:
Yeen'de
>Population:
(Estimate) <12 billion
>Disposition/description:
Hyenas are a carnivorous, canidoid species possessing, like most species, far greater strength and speed than humans. This is made evident by their hunting strategies of the past, where they would form packs of 3 or 4 and hunt in the night. They are not much faster than humans, and so had to rely on ambushing. This carried over to their mating strategies.
Hyenas are aggressive towards humans, both generally speaking and sexually. Most 'relationships' start out with a pack of hyenas simply walking up to a human who made the mistake of being alone at night and dragging them away for a long session of mating.
>Mating habits
Since many of you horny shitlords have started to view my books as 'waifu/r catalogues' rather than sources of general information/survival guides, I thought I may as well start including this section. You're fucking welcome.
Yeens are abnormally dominant, even more so than is standard, as i found out on my unwilling 'suprise holiday' to Yeen'da. All but one of my sexual encounters there had me as an unwilling participent, much to their apparent enjoyment. This dominance has become a popular subject on the Internet, spawning the genre of porn known as 'YEENED'.
As previously mentioned, Hyenas are pack hunters. When their pack takes a mate, they do not take turns, instead prefering to gangbang them. One could think that they are polygomous from this, but that's not entirely true. They only ever have one male per pack. The hyenas will commonly fight for more dominance over than man, typically by overpowering the others, but on ocassion this can be done by simply winning his favour.
Note: simply being marked by another species does not make you safe. They very often attempt to 'take' already owned males.

>Species:
Boar
>Homeworld:
Susrofa
>Population:
17-20 billion
>Description:
Boars are bulky and powerful, sporting strong, curvaceous bodies. They are taller than humans, standing at (on average) 7'5", also possess. They possess coats with short fur, usually a light brown with either scattered large black spots or stripes.
Their curvaceous forms lead many to believe that they, like bovinoid species, lactate naturally. They would be correct in this assumption, but what they don't know is that a boar produces almost as much milk as a bovinoid. This milk is used to feed their man while they pin them down.
>Mating habits:
In heat, boars develop an even thicker body. This is not only for the purpose of attracting more mates, but it also helps in combat, both with both other females and with males. For context, they will often fight over males when they encounter them alongside other females, therefore benifiting from the extra 'padding'. When it comes to 'fighting' males, the extra layer is more for helping to keep the male against the ground. This extra padding also keeps the male better fed, as it increases the size of their bust. They are rarely not on top whilst mating, which ends in suprisingly few damaged pelvises, given their healthy amount of padding.
Boars are also very heavy drinkers, both culturally and biologically. They have a natural resistance to poisons including alcohol and it also features prominently in their culture. Furthermore, it is often used in courting, as well as 'courting'. They will offer, usually very aggressively, to share a drink with a man. The man will usually accept out of fear (lest he be forcefed the alcohol), and be forced to drink with the boar until they are too drink to resist the boar's advances. The more cruel boars sometimes put Cobra venom in the alcohol, taking advantage of their own resistance to it while also taking advantage of its aphrodisiac and muscle-relaxing qualities on the man.

>Species:
Eagle
>Homeworld:
Mericara
>Population:
6 Billion
>Description:
Eagles are avian anthros hailing from a planet in which a singular world government has taken over, in which a majority of it's citizens view being a part of that state as a critical part of their identity, upholding it's values with an almost jingoistic passion. Most of these values shouldn't really affect you or most other species. However, one of their key tennents, among 'freedom', 'democracy' and 'militarism' (more on that last one later)
In terms of body, they are very strong for avians and have an impressive wingspan. Despite being avians, they are also not particularly light, but certainly lighter than most anthros.
>Mating Habits:
While they are on their home world, their method of capturing mates is very simple, and even more direct. They will fly into the air and scan the area for movement. Upon spotting movement, they look closer. If it is a man, they swoop down and grasp him with their talons, picking him up by the shoulders. They will carry them back home, usually around the middle of a mountain and mate with him there.
Away from home, due to the aforementioned militarism, they are usually at war. While at war, any men they encounter are taken back as prizes, whether they were combatants or not. They rarely hurt humans, so you, dear reader, are perfectly safe from them. Physical harm wise, anyway. You are not safe from the mental harm of being esentially kidnapped and taken to a foreign, far off planet to be forced to mate with your former enemy.
As their husband, expect to be treated as a househusband, as is their tradition. Your duties will be standard chores, as well as watching eggs, keeping them warm and, of course, breeding/sex.
NOTE: Eagles and their government have been under investigation for commiting various warcrimes. Their official statement has been the following: "Fuck off. we do not care. We will take more men. Eat ass. Freedom reigns."

>Species:
Viper
>Homeworld:
Venara'ra
>Population:
5 Billion
>Description:
A viper's most noteable trait is it's tail, being at least 15 meters long and possessing good strength. Around comparable to the average anthro, but nothing like the 'contstrictor' varieties of snake anthros.
They also, more importantly, possess retractable fangs which produce are used to inject a potent venom into their targets. This venom is highly potent, but not as a means of killing. Rather, it acts as both an aphrodisiac and a muscle relaxent, rendering the affected person (usually male) incapeable of movement and extremely horny. This venom is also present in their other fluids, suck as milk and saliva, but in smaller quantities. This venom is also highly addictive, ensuring once they have a man, they have them for good.
Beyond their tale, their bodies are well toned, up until the breasts which are large, typically larger than the average mans head. So, relatively small compared to most anthros.
>Mating Habits:
Typically, they prefer seduction to the standard normal method of 'sence man, take man, fuck man'. They certainly have a way with words, managing to make even the most innocent of sentences sound highly suggestive, ensuring even the densest of males cannot miss their advances. If this fails, for whatever reason, the male of their affection will quickly find the darker side of their personality: their obbsession. They have been dubbed as 'yandere' on various circles of the internet. They will stalk you. They will hunt you. They may even, on occasion, hurt you. Most commonly though, they will put their venom in your food and drinks. Its all out of passion, though. According to them, at least. This is when the aforementioned rape will happen. In my case, I woke up with her coils around me, and her mere inches away from my face watching me sleep. When I woke up, she immediately went for the throat. The venom was in, and the mating began.

>Species:
Rabbit
>Homeworld:
Unknown
>Population:
60-70 billion
>Description:
Rabbits are known less for their own species and more for what their species created. After the universe met humanity, they created an underground (litreally) trading ring specialising in human trafficing, trade of various drugs and (where it is illegal) prostituion. Many men are victims to this prostitution system, being put into debt to them and forced to work off their debt. Indefinitely.
The rabbits themselves are among the shortest of Anthros, standing between 5'8 and 6'4 and possessing very strong legs along side what is known as 'breeding hips' and what is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest asses in this galaxy. Emphasis on 'this'. These strong legs allow them to run and hop at incredible heights and speeds. Useful during mating season. They have short fur that can come in basically any colour and long ears.
There is a common steryotype of rabbits being abusive and cruel, more than likely coming from the tight ties to their criminal empire. These stereotype are not entirely wrong, either. Obviously though, a stereotype is just that. A stereotype. There are plenty of rabbits with absolutely no links to the criminal underworld. These ones are usually very gentle and kind, whilst similtaniously being very exciteable and bouncy.
>Mating Habits:
Ever heard the term 'fucking like rabbits'? That. Rabbits, when not in heat, still possess and impressive libido, but one that is controllable nonetheless. However, when mating season hits, nothing short of locking them in a cage and trapping them in the deepest reaches of space could even come close to them finding a mate and fucking their brains out.
During mating season, rabbits also produce a pheremone that makes men (and anthros) almost as horny as they are. Merely standing near them at this time is enough to cause its affects to become overwhelming.

>Species:
Dragon
>Homeworld:
N/a (Out of galaxy)
>Population:
200 Million<
Description:
The Dragons are creatures from beyond our galaxy. They are extremely powerful in terms of strength, speed and intellegence. They are also highly varied, but all have scales. What im about to tell you about them is more of a generalisation than a fact, as many different types of dragon exist.
Most dragons are bipedal and have wingspans of at least 3 meters. The dragons themself stand at around 3 meters tall. They, despite being fully capeable of flight, are heavy, due to their very large breasts and, scientifically put, gigantic asses. They can come in all the colours of the rainbow and then some, including the rare black dragons.
They have a symbiotic relationship with another species, the Kobolds. The kobolds act as willing servants in exchange for protection and men.
Various other sub-species exist, such as the Serpantine Dragons, Psionic/Dream Dragons and Wyverns, alongside appropriate subspecies of Kobold (Serpantine Kobold, Dream Kobold...)
Mating Habits:
There are many tales of the exploits and conquests of dragons, glorious or underhanded. They all end up rich. However, depsite all their riches, they feel a certain void. Something is missing. They'll try more conquests, try founding a new kingdom from nothing, spanning lightyears. None of it ever works, though. It often takes them centuries until they realise what they desire is a man. When this realisation dawns on them, they will search and search until they find a man that strikes their fancy. When they do, they will very formally invite them to become their prince, usually by showing up in their bedroom with a legion of Kobolds and their other lieutenants outside. The man rarely refuses. Unlike most anthros, refusal is not met with increased aggression. Instead, it is met with increased attempts at impressing the man. Greater displays of power. More seduction.

>Species:
Kobold
>Homeworld
N/a (Out of galaxy)
>Population:
At least 40 billion
>Description:
Kobolds are anthros that entered a symbiotic master/servant relationship with the Dragons. They live in packs, making them well suited to the heirarchal structures of servants and soliders they are a part of under the Dragons. One might think they would be unhappy with this arrangement, but this could not be further from the truth. The reward the Dragons give them is men. Sometimes as a 'retirement gift', after a few years of service. Sometimes, when Kobolds enjoy the military life, their unit/pack will recieve a man to share.
Kobolds stand at only around 5 feet, making them among the shortest anthros. Their builds vary strongly, most commonly being lithe yet muscular with reasonable busts. They also have, like their draconic elders, long tails along side fantastic asses. They share the same general variety with the Dragons, some with horns, huge variety in scale colours, some with serpantine lower halves, etc.
Kobolds can, on occasion, feed their master(s) with their milk. The Dragon will simply call them over, drink from their breast, and send them away. The Dragon will sometimes ask them to feed their husband this way, too.
>Mating Habits:
Kobolds are significantly less dominant than their Draconic masters, but still sexually dominant none the less. This is made up for in numbers, however, having at least 5 kobolds per man. Their mating sessions will typically involve the man being given an aphrodisiac (often Dragon's Milk, or their own slightly weaker equivilent, Kobold Milk) and then each of the Kobolds taking turns to recieve a load. While they arent actively fucking the man, theyll certainly be helping to pleasure him still.
Their tails are, being a lot more thin than a dragon's, suprisingly prehensile, so these get used in the bedroom too. Usually for wrapping around things, though they can sometimes be used for insertion.

>Species:
Shark
>Homeworld:
Baysinn (infested/uninhabitable, now nomadic)
>Population:
Unknown
>Description:
Sharks are a nomadic type of anthro orgininating from the watery world of Baysinn. They stand at an average of 6'6" and typically have grey skin, although both these factors can vary greatly, with some sharks being up to 8 feet tall and having brown and beige stripes. They have large, powerful, nonprehensile tail that grants them impressive speed in water. They also, most notably, have very powerful jaws accomponied by sharp teeth. These are more often used as a threat and even as a ways of attracting mates. They are strong and quick. They also have very keen senses, primarily their smell. They can smell the scent of an unmarked man from up to a mile away, and even further if they are bleeding. If you get a papercut, Abyss save you.
Their society, following their depature from their now Xenomorph infested homeworld (creatures from outside our galaxy), they formed a sort of mass-piracy coalation. They had always been skilled at raiding on the oceans of their own world, so those skills transfered nicely. They raid interplanetary/intersolar transport ships for plunder and people. both human and anthro for various reasons. Often for the fun of it, sometimes for taking slaves, sometimes for mates. Usually the latter.
Their raids typically follow a structure of 'Threaten defenceless ships with a very big gun' then 'board them and overwhelm them'. They then either drag the ships along with them or just take what they want and fuck off to wherever. They also often come planetside, usually to sell merchandice and exchange information. They have some of the most advanced technology in the galaxy, thanks to stealing it from their old foes, so much so that their crews can also consist of androids and even cloned versions of OOGs, like the aforementioned xenomorphs.
Their crews do tend to be a very mixed bunch, even picking up humans to 'adventure with'.
>Mating Habits:
When a shark smells or sees a man that they like, they will singlemindedly begin walking towards them. They will break through doors, walls and barriers put in the way (often with their tail), push people aside, climb up buildings. Little can stop them short of another shark who has spotted a man in the opposite direction. Such a conflict is rare, but when it happens it is best to duck for cover, even if you are not one of the pursued. They walk because they like to watch the fear grow in the man's eyes. They could run, sure, but it'd all be over too quickly. Like many carnivores, they live for the thrill of the hunt.
When they finally reach the man, usually when he realises escape is impossible or he gets tired or ran into a dead end, the shark will pin him against the wall. After relishing in his fear for a good while and verbally threatening/seducing them, they will grapple onto them and hold them to the ground while mating with them. They do not stop until the man is completely exhausted, at which point they are even easier to just pick up and take back to the ship. At this point, unless the man can escape, they are their new wife's treasure, always being at their side, whether they like it or not. They should do anyway, since wondering off on a Shark pirate fleet is a dangerous thing for a human indeed. So many anthros who joined up just to get that chance at stealing a man, and so many walls that would be broken the second the shark notices their husband has wondered off or been snatched by another from under their nose. Stealing a shark's husband is seen as a complex and interesting method of suicide by many anthros, but there is the occasional species that can compete: Eg. Dragons, Xenomorphs, Deathclaws.
Fleeing is typically punished by even more snu-snu or even tighter hugs in those cold deepspace cabins. They're coldblooded, after all, and need the body heat.

>species:
Bee
>Homeworld:
Hive-6
>Population:
80 billion
>Description:
Bees are an insectoid species of Anthro that overwhelmingly dominates the northernmost ring of stars, living in several hundred artificially created planets/hives. They each have their own ecosystems and function as ecumenopoli, hosting both a densely populated hive-underground and thriving ecosystems above ground. These underground areas are lit by the Bioluminesant honey that they produce from their breasts, vaginas and mouths. It is used traded throughout the galaxy, and is desired both for its taste and its affect on human males when applied to the skin or ingested.
With their recent first contact with humanity, the number of hives has been increasing rapidly, as one bee only requires a single man to begin to be able to spawn an entire new hive. That, and only about 6 months time.
Bees themselves live in a strange system of a mix of monarchism and communism. They all have at least a degree of reverence to their particular nation and to the queen that they live under, up until a man is located, at which point nationalism is the last thing they're concerned about.
Bizzarely, although not unsuprisingly, the Eagles immediately declared a 'total war of annihilation' against the bees as soon as their economic stances were revealed. No shots have been fired directly, but the two sides have instead resorted to a proxy war.
The bees themselves are varied depending on the subspecies. Bumble bees, for example, are very large, 8 feet tall minimum and have curvy, fluffy bodies. They are also much more cuddly and gentle. Honey bees, on the other hand, are much shorter standing at around 5'7" on average. They have more lithe frames, and much shorter fur. Most of them have pronouced fluff about the neck, forearms and legs no matter the species. They all also have a stinger, which an inject a venom. Additionally, they have small wings that are suprisingly powerful.
>Mating Habits:
The bees are known to aquire men by a very direct route. Stab them with their stinger. It's completely painless and sometimes, depending on the species, not immediately noticeable. The venom is an intense aphrodisiac and a relaxant, both of the muscles and of the mind, making the man as maleable and submissive as the bee needs him to be. After the sting is done and the man starts to have his muscles weaken, they will simply hang around with him for a bit: flirting, making small talk, watching the venom take hold, progresively more bold advances. They may initially start off with simply hugging the man or holding on to his hand (as many men are now used to recieving on random instances, making this not suspicious at all). This will progress to them becoming more intimate, such as by the bee pushing the mans face between their breasts, wrapping their legs around his waist, letting them stroke their neck fluff. The more aggresive species may combine their flirting with intimidation in a similar manor to carnivores. Demonstrating their strength by lifting the man into the air with them while they fly, showing off their stinger, and even forcing them to eat their honey off their finger or sometimes straight from the source. All this time the man is becoming more drunk, tired and horny. This process happens over the course of between 30 minutes to 2 hours, during which the man will put up little to no resistance.

>Species:
Weasel
>Homeworld:
Mustell
>Population:
20 Billion
>Description:
Weasels are smaller anthros, much smaller than average at only around 5'7" on average. They are short-furred and typically have light brown fur with white about the inner thighs, stomach, cleavage and throat. They have thinner forms with decent muscle mass. Despite their unassuming appearance, Weasels are suprisingly good at combat, being capeable of putting up a more than fair fight against even much larger anthros. Their martial arts and acrobatic ability should not be underestimated. You would struggle to find one that is not a trained in at least 2 forms of self defence and trained with weapons, melee and firearm.
Weasels often work in the defence sector, both military and private. You want something dead or dont want to be dead (or more likely raped)? Hire a weasel, or sometimes several depending on severity. They are (usually) professional and unlikely to attack a man. HOWEVER - BIG HOWEVER - DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT LET YOUR GUARD DOWN. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, READ 'MATING HABITS'.
Many weasels practise meditation and calming rituals for reasons, again, in 'mating habits'. This dedication to such habits has caused them to drift towards the aesthetic of a warrior monk or deciplined soldier. As such, many are a part of various religions such as The Lustful Scale or the Voidist movement. Speaking of, I highly advise against taking them up on their offers of 'refuge for vulnerable males'. It turns out the nice viper at the door was looking to 'introduce me to the faith' via having me take part in one of their rituals. Said ritual involved me being wrapped in their tail and being made to drink from 'the fountain of lust'. I'm currently writing this from inside a box via candlelight. Anyway, the weasels are rarely zealots, but given most of these faith's views on men, it is best to watch your back around them. Even harder.
>Mating Habits:
Had to get your attention down here, hence the big warning. Didn't want to break structure either, I already know that'd bother me. The Weasel is, at nearly all times, in heat. They may keep a calm and focused exterior, but this is meerly a method of holding back a very horny beast within. This metaphor is very commonly used, so much so that the 'Wereweasel' has overtaken the 'Werewolf' in popularity. Parly because of the horny weasel's famous ferocity, and partly due to the term 'werewolf' becoming something else entirely. See: 'Night of the Wereweasels' and 'Weaselborne' both by Lth'Krgar.
A weasel will only ever attack a man when either: A religious occasion demands it, they have recieved what they percieve as concent (which is quite a lot, usually just an assumption), or 'close contact or exposure to a man', as is written in the Standard Weasel Collaboration With Humanity Warnings. When this does happen, all of the proffesionalism is gone in seconds. They will mate with the man with reckless abandon, in public or not, on the job or not. They really don't care.
They are not as dominant as most other species but are far more horny.

"You've never taken a scratch in a fight, have you? You've never felt the real threat of death before?"
She slowly brought a hand towards his face. He tried to back up further, but the metal steps would not budge beneath him. As the wolf's hand softly touched his cheek, he clenched his eyes shut in horror. Heat rose to his face, concentrating behind his eyelids and in his throat. A choked sob escaped his lips, and a tear rolled down his cheek, hitting the brown fur of Vardroders fingers.
"Oh, my sweet darling", she said in a sing-song voice, barely audible despite the silence of the hallway. "This is even better than I thought. I think we’re going to have a lot of fun together, you and me. Now look at me.” After a few seconds, the pilot did as he was told, and cracked open his eyelids. They glistened with tears, and another sob wracked him as he stared into Vardroders’ predatory pupils. She bared her teeth in an approximation of a smile, making him flinch. Her hand was still on his face, furred thumb gently stroking his cheek. “Now,” she said in the same whispered tone, “which one of these is your cabin?”.

>"Dear, what is taking so long for you to take him? He would have been moaning into your fur if you tried a little harder."
>"Mom, we don't do that anymore. Men are sensitive things that need to be caressed and coerced into the bedroom."
>"Maybe they are sensitive when fighting, dear, but they will not accept your love if you do not beat it into them. They never believe that you truly mean it until you really show them."
>"And I am showing him. I've shown that I am willing to slowly court him, and eventually he will let me ravish him in the bedroom willingly. I want him to enjoy the moment just as much as me."
>"Men are not used to being courted, he will assume you are trying to take advantage of him. The only way he'll truly know he is loved is when you've shown that you are willing to go all the way. Playing these games is just confusing him."
>"Things have changed, mom."
>"And some things are still the same, my daughter."

>Humans didnt just enslave the monsters like they originally did, but they created humanoid creatures to do their hard labor as slaves

>tho this time, its done with a slave uprising
>humanity cant defend against the forces of natures they created and get almost annihilated
>monsters decide to spare humanity under one condition

>humanity doesnt have the option to say no
>especially if you have to deal with something like firebreathing lizard anthros, a skinless-looking dog anthros who can move at mach 3, or a very fast tiger anthro in the snow, where humans already struggle with the cold alone
>only issue is, nobody would volunteer to such a thing, so they trick them by telling their men theres a monster on the lose

>Humans disappear for some reason, leaving behind their cities
>Dogs become intelligent very quickly
>There is this sense that there is something missing in their lives, but they can't quite tell what
>For some reason, they seem to have memories and dreams of wonderful, beautiful creatures
>Some religions popped up, saying that these creatures are what's missing
>Finally, after becoming civilized some of the dogs start looking in the ruins that were left, and they find books
>One book on dogs called them "man's best friend"
>A misunderstanding occurs
>Dogs, not understanding the human language completely, assume that a "best friend" is a lover
>They read how they protected humans and helped hunters, and in return they were well taken care and loved
>They believe this means they were the grand protecters of their other half
>But humanity has gone now

>the males, ranging in ages from fourteen to eighteen, are vetted from voluntary competitions in which they have excelled, physically and mentally
>pankration is not only present, but a fixture, and is considered the competitional coup de grâce, where six pairs of anthros are selected from the competing population based on their performance averages, and then waged against one another, untimed and unending until one, two or all combatants lie dead
>the three finalists are considered victors and then given an option of "claiming" their prize, or challenging their fellow contestant(s) for her/their own human(s)
>should one succeed over another at this rate, the contestant will be crowned grand champion and awarded with two or three youths for her success, depending on how many remain succeeding the final decision
>for many great empires spanning early millennia to times recent enough to visit in person, this was the preferred method for inducting leadership positions

>Well anon you're becoming brown bread, a stiff, dead as a doorknob

>Shit you are now standing but naked in what can be described as a lush magical garden surrounded surrounded by a bunch of tribal looking furries with each being a different species with them speaking some language you don't understand at all with them starring at you directly.
>Soon a transparent ball with various glowing shapes inside of it lower in front of you startling you
>"Anon E Mous! Our world is need of a hero! Life is stagnating and and soon all life in our world will become extinct and we need you to help and usher new life! The last of life with free all formed up into one large army and are fighting off hoards of people possessed by unholy spirits of death and intertitle and your soul is the only one who can help us!"
>Okay shit this is all going to fast and and you can't even think to remember what the ball was just saying besides needing a hero and demons, your naked and surrounded by tribalistic furries who seemed worried, wanting to take charge or trying to get people to calm down

>Be me.
>Made to be the sacrifice to the forest gods.
>Tied up and left in the woods.
>Footsteps.
>From the brush, it's her.
>Fox. Tall as fuck.

>Get to some underground den.
>Untied.
>She suddenly hugs me.
>I can't help but ask, I've already basically given up on my life.
>"You're sacrificing your life, alright. Your life as you know it. You're mine now~."

>You've become familiar with them and a part of their social group whether you like it or not.
>It's halfway to Summer break, Taco Tuesday is today, the bear lady is wearing a new perfume, and the gator woman's stomach is growling like a diesel engine.
>Class just ended.
>Arriving at the cafeteria, you discover that the amount of tacos a mature female alligator can eat is "Yes."
>Gathered around a table with you protectively sandwiched between the two largest members of the group, the table is quickly piled high with an Olympian mound of tacos.
>The alligator, Cleo, is shoveling handful after great, scaly handful of soft and crunchy tacos into her jaws, eating with all the grace of a primeval reptile.
>The badger, Shawni, is discreetly passing a bag of what you know to be her stash of good shit around the table. A few of those on a taco or two should liven up the evening.
>The elk, Rain, has already inhaled her shroom allotment and is chasing it with a deep pull from her lemonade. Her party girl meets hippie self shines through yet again.
>To your immediate right is the hippo, Ramona, laughing her head off at seeing Rain go ham on shrooms. She her smooth, doughy middle squishes against you.
>To your immediate left is the bear, Jasmine, snapping photos of your group on her phone to post to her Instafan. Her thick, luscious fur covers her fluff-over-steel physique.
