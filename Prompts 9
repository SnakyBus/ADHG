>basically like an in-heat male scent since human's mating season is year-round
>single human guys give off the scent strongest since it's just their scent
>even human guys with human GFs still give off the scent strongly since human women don't have strong scents that stick to the guy and don't rub against guys enough to even properly mark them

A fantasy of mine is to be the centerpiece of a high society anthro party.
The whole point of me being there is to be fawned over, adored, pet and played with.
An exotic thing that all the fancy and well-to-do animal women go crazy for.
Lost in a sea of huge, poofy dresses, claws and hooves running through my hair.
Eager old anthros leaving big, wet kiss marks on my face.
Getting pinned against a marble pillar by a huge, fat ass.
Scale and fur and feather passing me around like an expensive bottle of champagne.

>Suddenly, they pull away, and before you can gasp for breath...

>threatens to kegel you into red paste if you break her daughters heart
>sends you off without another word, and a pleasant toothy smile on her face

> Hound Goddess Luna Makes you her pet
> Be Anon, a curious and adventurous soul always seeking new thrills.
> One fateful day, you find yourself in a secluded forest, following a winding path that leads deeper into the woods.
> The air is thick with the scent of pine and earth, and the only sound is the rustling of leaves in the gentle breeze.
> As you continue on your journey, you come across a clearing bathed in golden sunlight.
> And there, standing before you, is a breathtaking sight: a tall anthro hound, her fur a mix of shades from deep ebony to rich mahogany.
> She stands at least a head taller than you, her powerful frame exuding an aura of dominance and raw sexuality.
> Her name is Luna, the Hound Goddess, and she looks down at you with eyes that seem to pierce your very soul.
> "Well, well, well," she purrs, her voice like velvet, "what do we have here? A little lost lamb wandering into my domain?"
> You can feel a shiver of anticipation run down your spine as you meet her gaze.
> "I-I...I was just exploring," you stammer, feeling suddenly small and vulnerable in her presence.
> Luna chuckles softly, a sound that sends a thrill of desire through you.
> "Exploring, hmm? Well, you've found something quite interesting indeed," she says, stepping closer until she's mere inches away from you.
> You can feel the heat radiating off her body, and the scent of her arousal fills the air, intoxicating you.
> "Tell me, little one," Luna continues, her voice low and husky, "have you ever been dominated by a Goddess before?"
> Your heart pounds in your chest as you shake your head, unable to tear your gaze away from her.
> "Well then," Luna smirks, her tail swishing behind her in anticipation, "it seems you're in for quite the experience."
> Without another word, Luna takes charge, pushing you down onto the soft mossy ground.
> You gasp in surprise and excitement as she straddles you, her powerful thighs pinning you down.
> "Mmm, such a delicious little plaything," Luna purrs, her claws grazing lightly over your skin.
> You whimper, feeling a mixture of fear and arousal coursing through your veins.
> Luna leans down, capturing your lips in a searing kiss, her tongue probing and exploring your mouth.
> You moan into the kiss, surrendering yourself completely to her.
> With expert hands, Luna begins to undress you, removing each article of clothing with tantalizing slowness.
> Your body is on fire, every touch sending shockwaves of pleasure through you.
> Luna takes her time, teasing and tormenting you until you're begging for more.
> "Please, Luna," you whimper, your voice filled with need.
> "Please what, my pet?" Luna smirks, her eyes glinting with mischief.
> "Please...please dominate me," you gasp, your body trembling with desire.
> Luna's grin widens, and she reaches for a length of rope that she had hidden nearby.
> "Oh, I intend to," she murmurs, her voice filled with promise.
> With skillful hands, Luna binds your wrists and ankles, securing you to the ground.
> You're completely at her mercy now, and the thought sends a surge of excitement through you.
> Luna stands over you, her powerful form silhouetted against the dappled sunlight.
> "Now, my little toy," she purrs, her voice a seductive whisper, "let's see how well you can please your Goddess."
> With that, Luna begins to explore your body, touching and teasing every inch of you.
> Her hands are everywhere, her touch both gentle and firm as she drives you to the brink of madness.
> You writhe and moan beneath her, unable to control the waves of pleasure crashing over you.
> "Yes, that's it," Luna growls, her voice filled with hunger, "give in to me completely."
> You cry out as she finally takes you, her body moving in perfect harmony with yours.
> The pleasure is overwhelming, blinding in its intensity as Luna claims you as her own.
> You lose yourself in the ecstasy of the moment, surrendering to Luna completely.
> And as you come undone in her arms, you realize that you've never felt more alive.
> Exhausted and spent, you collapse against Luna, your body trembling with aftershocks.
> She holds you close, her strong arms wrapped around you protectively.
> "Well done, my pet," Luna murmurs, her voice filled with pride.
> You smile weakly, feeling a sense of contentment wash over you.
> "Thank you, Goddess Luna," you whisper, your eyes closing as sleep claims you.
> And as you drift off into a blissful slumber, you know that you'll never forget this unforgettable encounter with the Tall Hound Goddess who dominated you completely.

>lots of variation and accessorizing
>can be generic leather collar or highly personalized
but
>no easy access to neck for biting/licking/nibbling
>also means no bite marks/bruises/hickey on neck either

>They came for me on the beach
>I was laying on a towel, soaking up the rays while my parents were back at the resort devouring the breakfast buffet when I heard footsteps somewhere behind me
>I thought nothing of it, but then they stopped right next to me, I looked up, and the next thing I knew there was a rag covering my mouth
>There wasn’t much of a struggle, I blacked out nearly instantly, but the one glance I got at my kidnappers made me more confused than anything else
>They didn’t have bandannas over their faces like some sort of gang, they weren’t skeezy looking yeens hoping for a quick ransom, hell, they were dressed in cheap swimming trunks with noses caked in sunscreen just like every other unfurred tourist on the island
>Just two human men, middle aged and clean shaven
>They could have passed for a couple of schlubby dads enjoying time away from their nagging wives if it weren’t for their strangely cold eyes and blank faces
>Not that it mattered who I thought they were, I woke up in what I can only assume is some kind of ship’s storage room
>The steady hum of a distant engine reverberates around the hollow space and I think I can hear the faint calls of seagulls from somewhere above
>A cloth sack is wrapped tightly around my neck and my mouth is kept shut with duct tape
>With hands and feet bound with rope I’m utterly helpless, and the more I struggle the more it becomes apparent that I won’t be leaving this place of my own volition
>It isn’t long until I hear voices and footsteps from somewhere above, and I quickly still myself so they won’t know I’ve been struggling against my binds
>The voices become clearer, it’s two men, likely the same ones that kidnapped me
>”-don’t think I’d be happy with that.”
>”It’s for life though, and unlimited! A chance like this doesn’t come more than once in a lifetime you know.”
>”I’d still prefer the cash option. Shit, I don’t even like her brand that much. Penguin pops are so much bett-”
>”Shut up!” The voice angrily whispers. “Don’t let her hear you say that. I hear she’s touchy about that sort of stuff. Family legacy and all that.”
>”Whatever.” He flatly replies
>The voices quiet as they stop right in front of me
>Two arms reach down and wrap under my arm pits
>”Up ya go.” One grunts
>I'm carried through the unseen bowels of the ship by the two men
>It’s oddly quiet as we progress, no sounds other than our echoing footsteps and the hum of machinery
>Guess it must be lightly crewed
>Eventually I’m pushed down into a chair and the cloth bag over my head is ripped off
>My eyes burn at the sudden increase in light, so I squint and slowly take in my surroundings
>I’m on a ship, on the bridge to be exact
>It’s in the shape of a half circle, with windows letting in plenty of sunlight and consoles covered in electronic displays surrounding the rounded portion
>Standing off in the corner of the room is a graying German Shepard man in a captain’s uniform and standing directly in front of me is a large polar bear woman
>Unlike the dog she’s not wearing a uniform of any sort, instead dressed in a tight-fitting cream-colored dress shirt and skirt
>Her ears are pierced with large diamond earrings and a shiny golden necklace sits around her neck
>She stands tall, arms crossed in front of her chest as she looks down at me with a barely hidden sneer
>I get the feeling that she’s the cause of whatever situation I’ve found myself in
>The bear leans down sniffs around my face, I reflexively close my eyes and turn away, hoping that she doesn’t feel like taking a bite of my neck while she’s down here
>Thankfully, she leans back up and looks to one of the men standing behind me
>”He’s young.” She flatly states, voice tinged with disappointment
>”Just as you requested. One college age human male, unharmed, and with an average build.”
>She cocks her head with a frown
>”Last time I checked seventeen was a little young to be going to college.”
>”I swear he looked-“
>”Don’t worry Ma’am.” The other one says. “We can liquidate this one and get another. No extra charge.”
>Liquidate? I feel my blood pressure starting to rise
>The bear exhales and looks to the ground, eventually rolling her eyes and motioning to my bound body after a brief period of deliberation
>”No need. I’ll take him. Have you all decided on method of payment?”
>”Yes Ma’am. I’ll take the cash payout. And my partner will have the…”
>”Lifetime of free Bearstein’s ice cream please!”
>Her lips curl into a smug smile
>”Glad to see another happy customer. I’ll hook you up with the proper channels. No more than a gallon a day though, don’t try to take advantage of me. You…wouldn’t like that.”
>”Of course not ma’am! Thank you ma’am.”
>”I believe we’re done here then. Pleasure working with you. Now get the hell off my ship.”
>”Right away!”
>The men behind me scamper off and the bear turns to the captain
>”Set in a course for home and take us away. I want to be sipping cocktails on my beach by sundown.” She orders
>”Of course Ms. Bearstein.” He replies, moving to one of the consoles
>She then turns to me, my blood running cold as her emotionless dark eyes run over my body
>She reaches down and tears the duct tape off my mouth
>”P-please! Don’t hurt me!” I plead. “I don’t know what you’re asking but my parents can pay! Please, just let me go and I won’t tell anyone what happened!”
>The bear pauses, a look of amusement appearing on her face
>”Money? I assure you, it isn’t money that I want. And even if I did, your parents couldn’t pay the kinds of sums that I deal in.”
>”Then why am I here? W-what do you want with me?”
>She leans down, a finger holding my chin up so I had no choice but to look at her
>”Do you know who I am?”
>I shake my head
>”No, I don’t.”
>She looks to the floor with a disappointed sigh, then walks to a small freezer on the bridge
>She rummages around, moving wine bottles and iced coffee out of the way until finally pulling a box out
>She moves in front of me and holds the box up to her face
>”Do you recognize me now?”
>I glance between her and the box
>On the box is a young smiling polar holding up a pawful of popsicles in a rainbow of colors
>Near the top of the box in bright pudgy font are the words ‘Bearstein’s Polar Princess Pops!’
>It gradually dawns on me that the young bear on the box is, in fact, the bear standing in front of me
>”You’re…the polar princess?”
>She puts a paw up to her mouth and chortles
>”Yes, about thirty years removed from the bear on the box, but I'm still the polar princess.” She sets the box down on a console. “My father, the founder of the Bearstein Ice Cream Company, put me on the box when he debuted what would become the most popular brand of frozen treats in the world. He raked in billions and left me as the heiress to the family fortune when he died. Since then I’ve been keeping things running, doing my part to keep the family name in good standing and the profits flowing in.”
>I shake my head in confusion
>”And what does this all have to do with me? Why am I here?”
>She leans against a console and crosses her arms
>”I suppose you wouldn’t know, we did try to keep things hush-hush so the media wouldn’t lose their minds, but I recently had a rather messy divorce from my ex-husband.”
>She brings her paw up and looks at it longingly, a small ring of matted fur where a wedding ring once graced her finger plainly visible
>”So? I didn’t have anything to do with it!”
>”It’s not about the divorce, it’s about what happened after. A week after signing the papers I found out that he hooked up with a cute little doe girl half his age, one that he’d been keeping around as ‘work friend’ when we were still together. Hell, maybe a third his age would be more accurate. You could practically still see the white spots on her back!”
>You begin to see where this is going
>”So you kidnapped me to…what? Make him feel jealous? Lady, I’m sure there are plenty of young, attractive guys willing to hook up with you out of their own volition. Lots of guys don’t mind dating, you know, older chicks. No offence.”
>She smiles politely
>”None taken. But can you imagine the media outrage if they found out I was running around robbing cradles? There would be so much gossip, and drama, and nasty rumors spreading like wildfire. I simply couldn’t take the risk. So, I had a few trusted associates acquire you for my own needs.”
>”Please, come on, you can’t do this! It’s illegal!”
>”Illegal?!” She blurts out with a laugh. “Baby, when you get to my level of income illegality is nothing more than a minor annoyance. Right now we’re headed to my own private island where even the omnifur herself couldn’t see what’s going on.”
>”But my family! They’ll know I'm missing! They’ll get the police involved!”
>She waves a paw dismissively
>”Oh don’t worry, I’ve already informed the police on what to do and bribed them to keep their mouths shut. They’ll launch a lengthy investigation, do their due diligence, then a couple weeks from now they’ll discover human remains in the stomach of a large alligator. The lab report will declare that the DNA matches yours, and you’ll go down as nothing more than the victim of yet another wild animal attack. Such a terrible way to go, torn to pieces by a stupid stinking lizard. An absolute tragedy.” She reveals, wiping a faux tear from her eye
>”This is insane. I’ll fight you! Find a way to break free! You can’t keep me as some kind of sex slave forever!”
>”Tut-tut-tut, sex slave is such a crude phrase. I prefer the term ‘plaything’. You’ll be my hot little stud on the island, a plaything of my own to match my ex-husband’s prancing slut. And there won’t be any breaking free for you, oh no. Everyone on this yacht works for me, everyone on my island works for me, and all outgoing and incoming communications are monitored. You know, just to make sure any company secrets aren’t accidentally leaked. Whether you like it or not, you’re mine.”
>”No…but…you can’t…” I trail off, desperate to find some kind of counter
>She turns to the captain
>”How much longer until our arrival?”
>”Six hours at current speed Ms. Bearstein.”
>”Good. I’ll be in my cabin if you need me.”
>She then bends over and cuts the ropes holding my hands and feet together with a mere flick of her curved claws
>”Stand up and follow me.” She orders, a paw held firmly on my shoulder
>Seeing no other option, I comply
>We make our way through the pristine halls of her yacht until coming up on a large oaken door decorated with an intricate carving of an arctic coast
>She turns its gilded doorknob and we step inside
>I'm immediately hit by a wave of cold air, still in nothing but my swimming trunks I can’t help but hold my arms together and shiver
>”Awww, poor baby.” She coos, rubbing my shoulder. “I have to keep it a little chilly in here, even though I get my fur cut every week I still need a place to cool down from time to time. And don’t worry, you’ll be warmed up soon enough.”
>As we move through her quarters the first word that comes to mind is ‘luxurious’, fine wood, white marble, gilded accents, the whole place must take up an entire deck of the yacht
>We make our way past her kitchen, living room, and library, until finally coming up on her bedroom
>She closes the door behind us and finally takes her paw off my shoulder
>Her opulent bed takes up most of the floorspace, the cottony blanket spread across it bearing the logo for the Bearstein Ice Cream Company
>”Take your bathing suit off. I want to sample you before we arrive at the island.” The bear orders
>”You don’t mean-“
>”Yes, I do mean.” She fires back. “We’re in the middle of the open ocean so don’t even think about getting snippy with me. Get naked boy, you don’t have anything I haven’t seen before.”
>My cheeks redden and a knot forms in my chest
>As much as I want to resist she seems to be the one holding all the cards right now
>So I slip my swimming trunks off and silently shiver as she undresses
>First she unbuttons her dress shirt revealing a lacy black bra holding up her sizable bust
>Then she slips off her skirt, her black panties now the only thing between me and a lifetime of unwanted memories
>With a wiggle in her hips she steps closer and waves a paw down her body
>”What do you think? It isn’t often young guys like you get to see the sensual body of a mature polar bear, much less one who’s net worth rivals small countries.”
>”You look beautiful.” I force out
>She puts a bashful paw to her chest
>”Aww, thank you. I’ve come a long way since I was a little cub posing for a stupid ice popsicle box. What’s the phrase? Aged like wine?”
>I quickly nod in agreement
>”Yes, you’ve aged like wine.”
>”Good. Now get over and pull my panties down for me.”
>”W-why?”
>”Sex is a mighty boring thing when only one party’s motivated to participate. Trust me, my ex was a limp fish in bed and there’s nothing worse than a selfish lover. So get over here and show me you’re at least the slightly bit motivated.”
>Resigned to my fate, I walk forward
>”Kneel.” She commands, and I get on my knees in front of her
>I put my hands up to her panties and-
>”No, with your teeth.” She says with a devious smile
>I groan internally and lean forward, biting down on her panties and lowering them down until they touched the floor
>As soon as I straighten my back I feel a paw grip the backside of my head and she shoves me into her crotch
>My face is covered in soft fur and slivers of warm flesh, a slightly musky scent invading my nostrils
>”Mmmmm…” She moans in delight. “Finally a new face to see between my legs. And even better, one that has no choice but to be there!”
>She then leans down and grabs me by the shoulders, easily tossing me onto the bed
>Before I have time to come to my senses she’s already on the bed towering over me, a foot on either side of my hips
>She puts a finger up to her chin
>”Ya know, there was one position my ex could never do, one he just didn’t have the flexibility for. But for a spring chicken like you…”
>She grabs my legs and pushes them up to my chest, leaning forward so her cunt was right above my…already erect cock
>Thanks teenage hormones
>She then eases down and engulfs my manhood behind a wall of white fur
>I try to steel my nerves and block out the pleasure from her folds gripping my cock but it’s useless
>My own body has betrayed me
>She begins a wild up and down and my cock can’t help but stay rock hard
>With my feet resting against her shoulders I stare at the ceiling, and try to simply pass the time
>What happened after is a blur
>After I came she wasn’t done, so we tried a few other positions
>Sometimes she’d take the lead
>And other times she’d force me to under threat of death
>I seem to recall being forced to lick her cunt while she poured wine over it at some point
>Or at least I think it was wine, the bitter taste of alcohol is still on my tongue as I wake up from a post coitus nap
>Orange light from a dying sun spills in through the cabin windows and as I lean up I see the naked form of Ms. Bearstein laying next to me, leaning up against the headboard
>The blanket is covered in a mixture of fluids, tissues, an empty wine bottle, and a couple popsicle wrappers
>Sitting next to her is a box of polar princess popsicles, that explains the wrappers
>Hearing me move she looks into the box
>”What’s your favorite flavor?” She asks, her voice oddly calm
>”Blueberry.” I shakily respond
>”That’s mine too.” She says with a gentle smile, rummaging around the box and handing me a popsicle
>I take it, but refrain from opening it
>I’m just not in the mood for sweetness
>”Was I your first? And I don’t mean your first polar bear.” She asks
>I stare into my lap in shame
>”Yes, Ms. Bearstein, you were my first.”
>”Thought so. And don’t call me Ms. Bearstein. My employees call me that, my family calls me that, my competition calls me that, you can call me…” She briefly looks to the ceiling in thought. “…you can call me the polar princess from now on. Got it?”
>”I understand, polar princess.”
>With a popsicle stick hanging out of her mouth she gets off the bed and walks to the cabin window, sighing in delight as she takes in the view
>”We’re here.” She states
>”Where?” I ask, mind still cloudy after waking up
>She pulls the bare popsicle stick out of her mouth
>”The island, my home. And now yours too.”

>I want to pin his limbs with a monstrous strength that surprises him. Maybe we're rough-housing. The mood is playful and flirtatious, but he's never been overpowered before; when his muscles strain against mine, when he fails to shove me off or break the hold my cudgel of a fist has on his forearm, he realizes for the first time what it feels like to be powerless in the grip of something that could really hurt him. My monstrous mouth is itself as much a tool as my hands. It can hang over him threateningly, sharp teeth gleaming wet when my lips curl back. He knows my animal mouth can damage him, but it can also be used so softly on his body.
>I don't mean to say that I want to rape someone. I want this hypothetical man to feel a thrill of fear, excitement, and uncertainty in my arms. (He's in over his head! He didn't realize I was so much stronger. What if he said no? Would I respect it? What if I'm rougher than he hoped?) I don't want him to be so terrified that he's repulsed by me, but I'd like to unbalance him. Make him feel small. I want to handle his body like its a toy – push him onto his back on the bed, pin his arm over his head, grasp a thigh and spread his legs for me. Not meanly, but with authority. Every action communicates my desire for him, and expects that he reciprocates that desire without asking. My judgment is enough for both of us.
>I want that blushing red penis to point stiffly up at me from between his thighs, bobbing while he squirms under the hands that pin him. I'm going to straddle him and sit right down on that. You can't imagine how good it feels to have that hard, warm flesh sliding in and filling you up. With each movement I can feel him rubbing my passage over every inch. When I squeeze down on the cock inside I can feel it even better; for that instant I tighten up, it feels so much bigger and so much harder. I'm wet, full, and it's bliss.

>"another"
>the smartly dressed wolf in a button-up and vest shoots you a concerned look from across the bar
>"alright skinny, but after this I'm cutting you off."
>you grumble and lay your stack of bills down on the counter
>more than enough to cover your tab, and a generous tip for the friendly bartender
>she places the glass she was wiping underneath the counter and begins mixing your sixth cocktail of the night
>you keep your gaze on the wooden finish of the bar to avoid the concerned stares other patrons shoot you
>you shouldn't be surprised, you can't imagine they get many humans here in 'The Wolf Den'
>especially not ones that only seem content destroying their liver at the bar
>but this was the closest watering hole to you and after tonight you needed a drink in a social setting
>the bartender slides your drink to you before taking your cash graciously
>you're pretty sloshed at this point when you hear her whistle to someone and then not so subtly gesture at you with her head
>you see a furred mass approaching you from the corner of your eye
>"How we doin' humie?" The newcomer greets you with a hand on your shoulder
>a muscular grey wolf in a tank top and jeans
>"ya know... Usually bucks like you are smart enough to not wander into a den of hunters~" she continues, sliding her hand down your back and tracing a finger towards the base of your spine
>"So wha'? Ya' wanna take me home and fuck me?" your slurred response comes as quickly as your soaked mind allows
>this catches the flirty wolf off guard, she withdraws her hand and shoots a questioning look at the bartender, who just shrugs in response
>"Uh... Wha-... Y-yes?" she stutters out, confused
>"Lets just go then... Lets just go..." You slur, putting your head in your hands, barely holding back a choked sob
>"I-I uh..." The grey wolf is at a loss for words, sounding much less confident
>she mouths a silent question to the barkeep, who responds by raising all five fingers
>the wolf at your back gives a low whistle of astonishment before patting you on the back and taking the bar stool beside you
>"So skinny... Why don't you tell me why you're really here?" She says, her playful flirting tone replaced with a much more serious one
>in your desperate drunken state you can't help but spill your guts to the concerned stranger
>"She dumped me... After 4 loving years she dumped me like a pile of garbage..."
>a look of realization dawns on the wolf's face and she takes a long inhale
>"Oh- you poor thing. H-hey, you wanna come hang with me and my friends? It'd be a lot better than drinking alone, we're fun gals!" She musters with the enthusiasm of a mother trying to console a crying child
>not too far off from how you actually felt right now
>"Whate- *hicup!* whatever..."
>"C'mon big guy, you look like you could use some friends right now" the wolf says as she drapes your arm over her neck
>you giggle drunkenly at the idea of being called 'big guy' by a wolf twice your size, you mood already swinging back to hazy mirth
>she seems to realize the size difference as well as she goes to stand and nearly lifts you out of your seat
>"Hmm" she hums to herself for a moment before putting you back down
>the grey wolf withdraws a few bills from her wallet and slides them across the bar
>she mouths a thanks to the bartender, who winks back at her in return
>then she takes your already forgotten drink and slams it
>you hardly notice in your slumped state, the previous drinks already catching up to you
>"alright, up you go" she says, and your suddenly flipped on your side as you're hoisted into a bridal carry
>suddenly you're moving through the bar, your destination unknown in your impared frame of mind
>you think you can hear a few more wolf-whistles from other patrons as you're carried through the bar
>you feel so secure in the grasp of this strange wolf
>"Y-your so *hic!* strong" you muse
>"careful dude, we might not make it back to the booth if you keep talkin' like that." She responds, you feel her flex a little at the remark. Her hard muscle straining under her soft coat of fur
>before you know it, you see yourself approaching a corner booth with six... Or maybe it's three? Wolves sitting at it
>a series of 'oohs' and 'ahhs' rise from the table as you both approach
>"awww! Cute!"
>"there was a human in here!?"
>"nice catch Deb! Where'd you find him?"
>"Girls, this is-- Uh..." The grey wolf, 'Deb' you're assuming, stops, realizing she never got your name
>"Anon" you mumble, already having closed your eyes and barely paying attention to the conversation
>"Anon" Deb continues "he got dumped, so he's gonna spend some time with us tonight, be nice."
>the trio pipes up again
>"Oh no!"
>"that's so sad!"
>"ooooh, single!" comes the last response, along with a new wandering furry hand creeping up your arm
>you feel it quickly swatted away by Deb's arm looped around your back
>"Hey! Easy! He's not feeling well right now." Deb growls, pausing for a moment to readjust you in her grip. "Besides, when he sobers up tomorrow. He's mine first"
>"wha- *hic* what was that?" You ask, no longer paying attention to the conversation
>"Nothing, dude. Why don't you get some shut-eye? We'll keep you safe while you sleep off your woes"
>a nap? That sounded nice...
>you feel yourself being flipped upright and slid into the booth next to the pack of wolves
>Deb slides in after you and soon your surround in a blanket of fur, pressing on you from both sides
>you feel a muscular arm snake around your back and pull you into Deb's side
>your head lands on a soft pillowy surface and you sink into it
>you're already starting to feel a little better as a chorus of muffled giggles and coos lull you to sleep

>You try to keep your composure

>”i said both eyes anon! How can i hypnotize you if you’re keeping one eye shut?”
>you can feel your eyes open unconsciously, as if your own body was in on putting you under her spell
>”thats a good boy. Now keep your eyes on the birdie”
>how could you not? With herself positioned over you, her soft feathery breasts swaying with each swing of that golden pendulum. How could you ever look away from the pretty bird?
>you couldn’t, you didn’t want to
>”thats it, just keep watching. It feels good to let go doesn’t it?” She leaned back, letting her crotch grind down onto your hips as you felt yourself stare and stare at her
>the prettiest bird with the softest feathers and the nicest golden gleaming eyes

>She sits in her chair like always after getting home and waits for you to stop what you're doing to take care of her
>You know your place, so she doesn't even have to say anything
>A few seconds later you're on your knees right in front of your anthro wife
>Like always, your pants and underwear are off, so she can see how your body reacts to the scent and sight of her feet
>First you gently grab her foot and start kissing the top of it for a few seconds until she raises it a bit
>It means you're allowed to taste her soles now
>Your lips press against her warm sole, giving it a nice long kiss while she slips the other heel off and pushes it into your hand
>Usually she wants you to focus on making out with her feet before the foot rub, but it seems like today was a bit tough for her
>You're a good husband, so you start gently rubbing her tired sole during the make-out session
>Your wife lets out a quiet moan and closes her eyes
>That's the moment you switch feet and let the other one feel your lips too

>Your anthro wife taught you well how important it is to not be selfish during those foot worship sessions over the years
>She can feel your desperation in your tongue and your fingers
>"Good boy, very good boy. Just focus on my toes for a bit longer, and I'll let you mate with my feet again"
>Jerking off while both of her feet are resting on your face feels amazing, but getting to fuck them?
>You instantly start sucking on her toes, one by one
>Every one of her toes stays in your mouth for half a minute, so your tongue can rub against it from every side
>Your erection starts twitching again as you think about fucking the feet that own you
>She's looking right at you, enjoying every second of her submissive husband worshiping the lower body part there is
>It must give her so much satisfaction to spend all day running after and catching those untrained human criminals, only to get home and enjoy the sight of her tamed husband licking the soles of her feet
>Now that both of her feet are nice and slippery, you can claim your reward
>She puts her soles together, so they're next to each other, creating a small gap between her soles
>You lay down on the floor and position yourself in a way where your cock is directly under her feet
>The first thrust is always the most intense one, especially after making out with her soles for so long
>It's hard to control yourself, but it feels so fucking good to slide your hard cock between those soft slippery soles
>You try your best to slow down a bit and make your reward last a bit longer
>It doesn't take you long to hit the edge
>You instantly freeze for a few seconds knowing your cock is so close to giving up
>Her soles are wrapped tightly around your cock, your wife could easily wiggle her toes or squeeze her feet a bit tighter to make you spill your seed
>You look at the anthro above you and see that smug grin on her muzzle
>Oh no
>"P-Please honey, just a little longer! Please!" You squeal as she reaches down for one of her worn heels
>"I beg you please, I need-" You can't even finish as she places her right heel over your face
>She doesn't want to be the one telling you to finish early
>She wants it to be your own choice
>For your addiction to her scent to take over
>Your nose ends up inside of her heel, right at the spot on the insole where her toes stay at for at least 8 hours a day, five days a week
>It's like something in your brain snaps, you can't even control your hips anymore
>You start fucking that footpussy again, but this time without slowing down or being careful at all
>You can't say no to that scent you love so much
>It feels so good to stop yourself
>You love her so much
>You love sliding your cock between her feet until they're both covered in your fat load
>and that's exactly what happens
>With the last thrust you empty your balls all over both of her feet
>You can still see her smiling at you, knowing it's always the same thing that gets you cumming early
>She gently squeezes your balls with her toes to make sure they're all nice and empty
>It's so hard to get up from the floor, but you know you need to clean them up
>Maybe next time you last a little bit longer

>"I was scared of Annie because she jumped at me!"
>Annie looks like she's going to pounce again
>but one of the disembodied paws holds her back
>the narrator chuckles

>Annie nods her head vigorously
>"And if you like him, you want him to be happy don't you?"
>Annie looks confused, scratching her chin with a claw
>then she smiles
>"Yes!"
>"Did Hugh look very happy when you pounced him?"
>Annie looks over at Hugh
>he's still frowning
>"No."
>Annie's ears droop dramatically and she whines
>"No. Humans are sensitive, Annie. Even if you like them very much you have to be careful, especially when he's not your husband."
>Annie pipes up
>"Yet!"
>the narrator chuckles again
>"Of course, he's not your husband yet. And until he is, you shouldn't be pouncing on him."
>Hugh breaks into a smug grin and sticks out his tongue at Annie
>"Now Hugh," the narrator chastises, "You know that Annie likes you very much."
>Hugh nods his head
>"But you did something wrong too. You fought back."
>Hugh gasps and furrows his brow
>the narrator continues
>"You know Annie is bigger and stronger than you. Anthros are bigger and stronger than humans."
>Annie flexes an arm
>"So when you're scared, or an anthro you don't know is touching you, fighting back may mean you get hurt even worse."
>Hugh looks over at Annie, terrified
>she blows kisses
>"Now, Annie is a good girl, but sometimes there are bad girls. When you think you're in trouble, don't fight. Flee. Find your mom, or an anthro you can trust like your local Safety Officer, so she can protect you."

>Hugh dashes to hide behind them
>Annie looks dismayed
>"Let's try that again. Annie, do you think you could show Hugh you like him without scaring him?"
>Annie scratches her chin again
>and then a light bulb lights up over her head with a 'ding!'
>she runs over to Hugh's side
>he flinches and hides behind the officer's legs again
>but Annie just offers her paw
>Hugh looks at it
>then steps out of hiding to hold it
>Annie smiles
>and then gives Hugh another lick across the face
>Hugh blushes
>the narrator gives another warm laugh
>"That's more like it. I'm glad you two could learn about boundaries. Tune in next week to learn about the different kinds of work in the State of Bismarck, and what every citizen does to keep the lights on, and food on your table!"

>"Easy now. There's lots of jobs that need doing. Depending on what you excel in, you could be...a farmer."
>Annie's plain clothes suddenly change to denim overalls and a flannel shirt, she holds a pitchfork and wears a straw hat
>a chicken struts by, and she goes to chase it
>"Or a soldier."
>Annie now wears a green uniform and a combat helmet
>she has a cork-gun in her paws
>the little cartoon wolf snaps a salute
>"Or a construction worker."
>her outfit changes again, a worker's jumpsuit under a safety vest
>her ears folded under a yellow hard-hat
>the jackhammer in her paws suddenly springs to life, and she bounces around erratically
>"Or even, a State Inspector."
>Annie pops back to her normal clothes with a gasp
>"An Inspector? Really?"
>the narrator responds
>"Only if you're diligent in your studies, respect your teachers, and work very, very hard. Inspectors are the eyes and ears of the Governing Council itself, and help keep all the parts of the State running smoothly."
>Annie looks starry eyed as the narrator continues
>"But remember, whatever you do, you must work your hardest to be the very best at it you can be. One day the state will rely on anthros like Annie to keep the lights on, food on our tables, and our borders safe."
>the screen turns over to Hugh, who looks equally excited
>"And what do I get to do, Inspector?"
>"You have a very special job as well. A job only humans can do."
>Hugh bounces in place excitedly
>"You get to be a husband."
>Hugh deflates, his excitement turning to a frown
>"A husband? Why does Annie get to do all the cool things?"
>the narrator tuts chidingly
>"Being a husband and father is a very special job, Hugh."
>"A husband's job is to marry an anthro, and help her make a big happy family."
>a pram stuffed full of cartoon wolf babies rolls up beside Hugh
>"And a father's job is to raise that family to make more hard working anthros, and diligent humans for the next generation. Hugh, when you're having dinner, who cooks for the whole family?"
>Hugh taps his finger for a moment
>"My dad!"
>"And when you do your homework, who's there to help you with the math questions?"
>a knowing smile cross Hugh's face
>"My dad is!"
>"And who teaches you right from wrong, watches over you, and reads you bed-time stories?"
>Hugh beams
>"My dad!"
>the inspector's voice is bright with praise
>"That's right! Being a husband and a father is a big responsibility, and just as important as being a soldier, or a farmer, or a construction worker."
>the camera pulls out to show Annie and Hugh on screen
>"So kids, what do you want to be when you grow up?"
>Annie throws up her paw
>"An inspector!"
>Hugh also raises his hand
>"A father!"
>the narrator chuckles warmly
>"Very good! Be sure to work your hardest, do your best, and you'll find the perfect job to serve the State. Tune in next time where we'll learn about the history of the State of Bismarck!"
>Annie and Hugh wave goodbye at the screen as 'THE END' shows up over their heads

>an old TV flickers
>bright colors and cheerful music broadcast across the State through radio waves play
>"Annie and Hugh"
>a pair of cartoon figures are on the screen
>an anthro girl, a human boy
>the girl is a canine, with gray fur and a goofy sharp-toothed grin
>"Hi, I'm Annie!"
>the boy looks more reserved, with neat hair, a polite smile, and hands folded behind his back
>"Hello, I'm Hugh."
>a disembodied narrator speaks
>the voice of a mature woman
>"Hello kids!"
>the pair of cartoon characters wave
>"Hello Inspector!"
>they answer in unison
>"Today we're going to learn about History!"
>Annie and Hugh both frown
>Annie sticks out her tongue
>"Pbbbbt! History! That's boring!"
>Hugh nods his head
>"Yeah. I have to learn history in school."
>the narrator tuts chidingly
>"Now kids. History is very important."
>Annie crosses her arms
>"How can history be important? It's stuff that's already happened! I wanna know what's happening next! Like what's for dinner!"
>Annie licks her chops and a thought bubble with a steak appears over her head
>Hugh speaks up
>"Or if it's going to rain this afternoon!"
>a thought bubble of Annie and Hugh playing in a park appears over his head
>both thought bubbles poof out of existence with the inspector's next word
>"Kids. History is more important than dinner, or playing on a sunny day. Without knowing the past, it's impossible to prepare for the future. What if you were in the forest, and didn't remember the path you took?"
>suddenly Annie and Hugh are both in a creepy forest, looking frightened
>"We're lost!"
>they cry in unison
>Hugh hugs onto Annie, who wraps her arms around him defensively
>"But if you do remember your history..."
>as the narrator continue, a light shines through the branches
>Annie and Hugh gasp in relief
>"You can use it to find your way through troubled times."
>the dark woods fade away
>Annie and Hugh relax
>but Annie doesn't let Hugh go
>the narrator chuckles warmly
>"See? Know your past, and you will have a future."
>her voice turns serious
>"And knowing Bismarck's past will help Bismarck have a brighter future. The story of Bismarck starts a long, long time ago, in a time called Before."
>Annie and Hugh look quizzical
>Annie speaks first
>"Before?"
>and Hugh continues
>"Before what?"
>the narrator intones
>"Before the end. In the time that was Before, there was no Bismarck. There was no Assignment. Because there were no Anthros."
>Annie suddenly pops out of existence
>leaving Hugh alone and startled
>"Annie?"
>he looks around, tears brimming in his eyes
>"That's right. In the time that was Before, there were only humans. And just like when you were in the forest, they were sad. Confused. Lost."
>the inspector's voice turns grave
>"So lost, they destroyed their own world."
>suddenly Hugh is surrounded by dusty wasteland
>his fearful expression turns to downright terrified
>the human boy wails and covers his head in his hands
>"Things were terrible. But when Before became After, Anthros came into the world."
>Annie walks in from the side of the screen
>she waves
>"Hi!"
>Hugh jumps up and hugs her again
>the narrator's tone finally lightens
>"That's right. When Anthros came, they saw humans, and wanted to help."
>Annie offers a paw to Hugh and pulls him to his feet
>"The moment they met, every Anthro knew they were meant to be with humans."
>Annie smiles wide as she holds Hugh's paws
>"But the humans were afraid of Anthros. And tried to fight them."
>Hugh's clothing changes to that of a soldier
>he has a cork-gun in his hands
>"But the Anthros didn't want to fight. So they went away."
>Annie walks off screen again, this time the view follows her
>"A special Anthro, the first Chairwoman led her people North out of the great Dustbowl, to a city called Bismarck."
>the background goes from wasteland to cityscape
>"The First Chairwoman of the State founded a new nation in this city, and as a sign of peace, took the leader of Bismarck as her husband."
>Hugh reappears from the edge of the screen, and Annie comes to a stop next to him
>she licks his cheek and holds his hand
>the wolf giggles
>"Just like I'm gonna marry Hugh!"
>the inspector laughs again
>"When you're grown up, Annie. When you're grown up."
>Hugh looks to the camera, frowning in confusion
>"But where did the Anthros come from?"
>Annie shares his look of confusion after a second
>"And who was the First Chairwoman? Was she a wolf like me?"
>the inspector answers
>"No one knows. In the confusion at the end of Before, the Anthros simply arrived when they were needed. There are no records back then because things were so hectic. And as for the first Chairwoman..."
>a silhouetted portrait shows on screen, featuring a non-descript body shape with only a vague snout
>"When she stepped down after establishing our great State, the First Chairwoman passed leadership to the Council of Bismarck, and had her name, and all descriptions of herself stricken from State records."
>Annie gasps
>"Why would she do that? She's so great, everyone should remember her!"
>the portrait is replaced with a fluttering flag of Bismarck
>the inspector's voice beams with civic pride
>"The First Chairwoman believed in equality among all Anthros. She did it to show that any species could have led Anthrokind in the past to a brighter today. And today, the State of Bismarck needs every species to make a bright present!"
>Hugh pipes up
>"Even humans?"
>a disembodied hand comes from the top of the screen to pat Hugh's head
>"Especially humans. Hand in hand together, Anthro and Human kind will raise that brighter future."
>Annie and Hugh both look up at the waving flag with starry eyes
>"Tune in next time where we'll learn about the Assignment Program!"

>play as a female
>get to fight and kill and be killed like normal
>play as male
>not allowed to engage in pvp
>only allowed to play support
>instead of being killed you get "knocked out"
>bard class gets swapped for what's basically a battle stripper/cheerleader

>be a traveling merchant
>a horrible snowstorm hit you as you traveled across skyrim
>lost your horse and most of your product
>stumble to the nearest inn and burst through the door with a gasp
>"Come in traveler, take a seat by the--"
>you throw yourself in front of the firepit
>don't even bother with a seat
>just curl up and shiver
>damn this cold northern country
>you're suddenly poked with something blunt
>the hostess is jabbing you with the end of her broom
>"Hey you lout. You'd better by something or get out."
>you look up
"Have pity. All my coin is lost. Just a night by the fire, please."
>the hostess scowls
>"Does this look like a poorhouse? If you can't pay then get out."
>another voice interrupts
>"Khajiit will pay for the human."
>you sit up further to look across the common room
>in the back corner, two sets of glowing eyes stare back at you
>you can't make out more but you recognize the accents
>the hostess turns to the unseen khajiit
>"And who is he to you, cat? I told you not to make trouble."
>there's some snickering, and another voice responds
>if the first was warm, this one is cold
>sly and with a teasing lilt
>"This one makes no trouble. The human is merely khajiit's client."
>there's a hissing exchange from the shadows and the first voice continues
>"Yes. This one is a mercenary. She is hired to protect the nord and his money."
>the hostess glares
>then grunts and glances down to speak to you
>"Fine. But you're responsible if they steal anything."
>she marches off back to the bar
>you pull yourself off the floor and stagger over to the corner
>"The human is very cold, yes?"
>peer through the dark and see a khajiit seated at a table
>tawny-furred, with golden eyes
>she's clad in steel-plate armor
>"And he is alone, without money."
>her companion, grey-furred with ice-blue eyes purrs in her teasing inflection
>this one wears robes
>she snickers
>"Khajiit thinks this is not a smart way to travel."
>you hold up your hands
"I cannot pay you. My caravan is lost."
>both of them snicker
>they have another quick conversation in their strange tongue
>the grey one lashes her tail and leans back in her chair
>the orange one takes your wrist and pulls you down into the one empty stool at the table
>"Sit human. Khajiit has a proposition for him."
>you think you like the orange one better
>she's forceful yes, but her smile seems more genuine
>the grey one seems almost...
>hungry
>"This one knows he does have money. But in Skyrim, he has something of much value."
>the orange one gestures at you
>"He is human. He is allowed in places khajiit cannot go. Cities. Halls. Temples."
>the grey one leans forward and puts a paw over your hand
>her claws digging into the wood
>"Khajiit needs his handsome face."
>the orange one hisses
>and there's another short exchange you cannot understand
>the grey one rolls her icy eyes and releases your hand
>only for that paw to replaced by an orange one
>"So an exchange, yes? The human will go with khajiit, and will let khajiit in nice places. Big shops, new work, and nice fancy inns. Not like cold drafty hovel."
>she makes no attempt to lower her voice as she disparages the inn
>it is cold, despite the fire on the other side of the room
>"And khajiit will protect him. Take him place to place. Pay for his bed."
>sounds too good to be true
>they're probably sneak-thieves of some kind
>but you can't turn them down
"Fine. It's a deal."
>the orange khajiit smiles wide
>and grasps your hand tighter
>"Good! Oh, but there is one more thing khajiit asks."
>you suddenly feel arms snaking around your chest from behind
>a rumbling purr in your ear
>Shor's bones!
>you didn't even notice the grey one sneaking up on you
>the orange one goes on explaining as the grey one's paws explore your body
>rubbing your chest and drawing claws down to your belly
>"It is cold. Too cold for khajiit. Handsome human must share his warmth. And perhaps more..."

Wealthy executive anthro milfs eating sushi off of a smooth-shaved barely legal human teen

>All you knew is that they pay quite a lot of money for a single "session", you just have to shave all of your body hair below your nose and send them a few pictures
>They actually double the payment if it's your 18th birthday for some reason
>Another reason to give it a try..
>You do need some money, so why not give it a chance? What could go wrong?
>A few days later you find yourself all naked, lying on your stomach with some anthro lady putting some sushi on your back
>"Don't move until they're finished, do what they say, and don't speak unless spoken to"
>Before you can ask about anything else, the anthro exits the room, leaving you naked and covered in some expensive seafood
>A few minutes later, some three women enter the room and sit on the couch in front of you
>They keep talking about their businesses, but you can't really understand most of what they're saying
>It feels a bit weird how they don't pay any attention to you, it's like your whole existence is limited to being a big human plate for those wealthy anthro ladies
>At some point, one of the anthros accidentally drops a piece of seafood
>It lands right behind your armpit
>Oh no
>A pair of chopsticks fishes the sushi out but not without making you silently giggle, causing your body to twitch a few times
>They stop talking, but hopefully only for a few seconds, so maybe they haven't noticed
>Unlucky for you, every piece of food from that point gets dragged across your naked back before disappearing
>It's like they're doing that on purpose
>It's so hard not to laugh when they rub your sides with something cold or with a few pairs of chopsticks at the same time
>At some point you can't take it anymore and accidentally let out a quiet giggle
>They all stop talking at that moment
>"I don't know about you, but I'm still hungry. Let's get some more. Oh, and this time we should flip him over, this one sounds adorable~"

>she starts tugging for you to follow

>See a boar women walking down the street
>She's wearing a short coat with legs covered in fishnet stockings
>Her tusks are finely polished and lips are blood red, she's obviously an anthro whore
>Shout at her that she's a fat fucking sow who shouldn't come to this side of humie town
>She oinks back that stupid humies shouldn't threaten superior species
>Tell her to go back to whatever barn she crawled out of
>She tells me to run home to my furless skank of a mother
>I smash a beer bottle against a wall and point the sharp end towards her
>She pulls out a switchblade
>?????????????????
>Wake up in a dingy little apartment bedroom
>We're both naked and each of her teats is surrounded by my own dried saliva
>I slip my hand between her legs to feel a mixture of grool and cum
>Guess I'm mommy's little bacon boy now

>RadAway weakens your sperm cells a bit so it takes way more than just one breeding session to knock her up
>After your 5th orgasm you're shooting blanks so she lets you rest for the rest for the night

>It's the first time you hear a deathclaw's heart beating right next to your ear
>Maybe your new life won't be so bad?

>Math is next period
>Where the hell did you put that textbook?
>Bell rings
>Fuck
>Still rummaging through the back of the locker
>That's when you hear them
>That obnoxious gaggle of girls
>You shudder
>Why'd they have to run out of space in the male locker rooms?
>Why'd your locker have to be in here
>You keep your head down
>You don't want to be teased again, you're not sure you can take it today
>"Hey nonny!"
>A padded palm smacks your up-facing butt
>They all start to snicker when you yelp and nearly collapse into your own locker
>"Oh gawd, Christie that was mean!"
>One of the girls whines through a giggle, she grabs your arm and helps you to your feet.
>"Tammy's in looooove" Christie taunts
>The two glare at eachother for a second while the rest of the volleyball team starts opening up their own lockers
>It's a menegerie of species, all slim, athletic, dripping with sweat, fur all styled up in wacky ways
>Some of them are panting in a way that just makes you blush
>You avert your eyes
"I... I just need a book is all. Then I'll be gone"
>You mumble but you're tugged on again
>Oh no it's Christie again
>That 6'5 cheetah girl smirks down at you, you can't help but feel like you're shrinking under her gaze
>"You don't have to leave so soon, 'non, It's not like you're super threatening or anything"
>You don't know how you feel about that.
>Another girl calls from your left but you can't see here behind your locker's door "Yeah it's nice havin' something to look at"
>There's a wave of snickers and giggles
>You're practically frozen, trapped in this room of half-naked hormonal furry bodies
>All pouring with pheromones
>"Hah, I think he's broken"
>Christie tugs you into a big sweaty hug
>You can feel your shirt staining
>A tongue smacks your forehead, then she pulls back
>The cheetah gives you a wink, and her canine friend Tammy shoots you an apologetic glance.
>You leave without finding the book
############
>3 Days Later
############
>"Hey Anon!"
>You'd recognize that voice anywhere.
"Oh, uh, hey Christie"
>Your gaze darts to her shoulders but you don't dare look in her eyes
>She smirks
>"You're always so tense, dude"
>"Anyway, you've got a free period today right? Why don't you come down and watch me and the gals demolish?"
>You accidentally look at her face
>A blush hits you like a truck, your lungs seize
"Ah... you mean like, watch your volleyball match?"
>She puts a paw on your shoulder, you notice how tight-fitting her uniform is
>The cheetah snickers "It's not like you're goin' to death row Anon"
"Sorry I'm just"
>"Distracted and nervous? As always?" Her grip releases. "c'mon, it'll be fun! Plus you can oggle us without feeling shy about it"
"Wha!?"
>You stiffened, your eyes were locked with hers now
>She was grinning from ear to ear
>Then she started laughing
>You wanted the ground to erupt beneath your feet right then and there
>"Calm down dude" she teased through a bout of snickering, gripping your arm when she saw you wobble on your feet.
>"I know it's gotta be a little weird for you, being assigned the girls' locker and all"
>"Honestly we don't mind the attention, well most of us. Don't look at Melinda, she'll rip your throat out"
>You gulp
>"Oh yeah! And Tammy said she wants to see you after school, but she's too shy to ask"
>/SHE'S TOO SHY?/
"Uhm... okay. I'll be there. F-for both"
>Christie beams
>"Awesome, seeya after the match then!"
>She's walking away when she swivels back and asks, "Oh and try to video some kick-ass volleys, yeah?"
>The bell rings
>English... And you've got a test.
>How are you gonna think straight now?

>Barge into the Ultra-Luxe
>Lay down an entire box of caps
"I'll book your wildest hooker for the night, please."
>Get escorted to a suite
>Waiting for you is a massive deathclaw
>She's laid back on the creaking bed with her legs spread and arms behind her head
>Each muscular thigh is thicker than your torso
>Her crotch is a deep, drooling slit in those armored scales
>"So, I get to have you all night, huh?"
>The lizard's scratchy growling voice shocks you to your bones
>The door slams and locks behind you
>"You paid for it!" squeaks a voice from the hallway
>Your paid-for comfort beckons you with a curling of her murderous talon
>"Don't keep me waiting, sugar. I'm ~starved~ for touch"
>You drop your clothes and head into battle

>God your tongue hurt.
>How long had you been at this?
>Her thighs were still clenched at your waist
>And the occasional grunt or squeeze of her tail around the back of your neck let you know you were doing something right.
>Still.
>This was more exhausting than you'd been expecting
>Your lips smooched the vixen's quivering pucker
>She'd started so tight when you began
>You could barely stick a finger in without her squirming
>But once you lubed her up with your tongue she loosened up pretty quickly
>After just a few minutes it was easy to dig that flexing muscle deep into her tailhole
>She seemed to like that, given the chitters and groans
>You let your hand focus on her womanhood
>A couple fingers slipped in deep while your thumb played with her clitoris
>That was like an hour ago now
>Her juices were dripping down your arm
>Your tongue desperately wanted to quit
>You curled your tongue and dug your fingers in against her walls
>Oh she was satisfied alright, it's just that she was a glutton for pleasure.
>Any time you tried to pull back she squeezed her legs or pushed her butt back into your face
>10 more minutes past, with your spit drooling down her backside
>Your tongue wriggling in and slurping out of that tight tunnel
>Your pruned fingers scraping every corner of her pink depths
>Then suddenly
>"Annh... Fuck... that feels so good..."
>This was it, you were free!
>But... then why was she..?
>The plump vixen pushed her paws against the bed
>She fell backwards, right on top of you
>Your eyes shut tight as your face was swallowed by her chubby bronze cheeks
"Mmph!"
>You tried to protest, but her pucker had clenched your tongue hard
>"Shhhh." She snapped
>"Tongue back in"
>You whimpered, but obeyed.
>"Thaaats a good boy..." her whisper made you feel all tingly
>Beyond the veil of her buttocks she pulled your legs out so you were laying flat beneath her
>Then she laid her paws on your crotch
>The paw pads gently ground against your boxer-bound manhood
>"You want a footjob?" she asked
"Mrmh! Mhm!"
>You gave her some excited tongue wriggles and a fierce rubbing of her clit to say 'yes'
>Your vixen mistress giggled
>"Another hour under me, then you can cum all over my toes"
>A mixed sense of despair and determination filled you
>Your face hurt
>Your tongue burned
>Your brain was doing the best it could with a vixen-musk adulterated air supply
>This was going to be a loooong hour.

>Her getting too drunk and getting more frisky in turn
>The party gets a bit out of hand
>She starts talking about how obedient and caring you are
>You've never seen Stella drink so much in such a good mood
>"Its MY fuuuucking pethusband and I'll do wahta I want with himmm! Comme heree"
>She starts making out with you in front of her guests
>You can feel yourself getting tipsy just from those messy kisses
>Hopefully the guests left right before she started riding your face
>You lick her to orgasm and help her get ready to bed afterwards
>Once in bed Stella says she needs you to cuddle with her until she falls asleep
>The last thing she says before blacking out is how happy she is you're still around

>"Anon, we know you were involved"
>"We found traces of coke in your hair when we were processing you"
>The bunny was smug
>She'd just spent two hours letting you spin up a story
>She asked you details
>Checked for clarifications
>Made small talk
>All to crash you down to this moment
>Your meager confidence faltered
>Blank expression breaking into a frown
>All of the sudden your mouth was dry
>"Now, we know there were more people involved. Clearly you're not smart enough to hatch a scheme like this"
>That smug little interrogator leaned over the desk
>She tapped her stupid carrot pen down on the plastic surface
>Then she leaned back in her chain.
>"All we're askin' for is a few names, maybe a location or two"
>"If you're cooperative you could see your sentence reduced or even dropped if it's found you were coerced."
>You gulp, but you can't lather up any saliva
"I... I want a lawyer"
>Your mumbling catches her in a snicker
>"Oh come now, Anon, don't be like that! We were just gettin' to know eachother!"
>She threw her feet up on the table
>Her boots thudded.
"I don't have to talk anymore"
>"Yeah, sure, you don't. But right now you've dug yourself into a pretty deep fuckin' hole."
>She kicked one of her shoes off
>"You're lookin' at up to 15 years here, maybe 6 with good behavior"
>The other shoe thudded off the table
>That smug little cunt rolled off her sweaty socks and, using her toes, tossed them towards you.
"Wh- What are you-"
>"Got a paw fetish, don't ya? We searched your phone. I know you find this distracting"
>You felt sick
>What else had she seen...
>"Calm your nerves, how about a trade? You get to lick my paws and in exchange, I get information"
"I'm not a rat"
>Your nervous voice chokes
>"Aww, poor humie"
>She wriggles her toes
>You tug forward but your hands are beneath the bolted-down chair
>"Don't you want a little... lick?"
>Her foot loomed in front of your exhausted, desperate eyes
>Your tongue wavered out from your parched lips.
>"Uh uh!" Her feet pulled back
>"Give me a name first"
>You gasped
>Your mouth opened again
>This time you spilled your guts.

>Be anon
>went out to the club on the weekend
>not your usual scene, but it might be fun
>tons of bodies bouncing, dancing, grinding
>humans and anthros alike partying
>it's overwhelming at first
>but then you get a couple drinks in you and start to bounce along to the music
>you're still hanging by the wall when you feel something tug your wrist
>it's an anthro
>a hyena woman
>dressed to party, crop-top and daisy-dukes with plenty of jewelry
>she's giggling
>"Hey! Come dance with us!"
>right behind her, leaning on her shoulder is another hyena, dressed similar
>the second is a bit shorter, though they're both way taller than you
>she cackles and leans forward
>"You're too cute to be dancing alone!"
>you try to pull back your hand
>she's strong
"I'm sorry, I have a girlfriend!"
>the hyenas look at each other and break into a shared cackle
>"Dude it's fine!"
>she tugs your wrist again
>and the other hyena comes around behind you to hold your shoulder
>"It's just a little dancing! Totally fine."
>you really don't think you have much of a choice
>and it's probably fine
>just a little dancing
>"Why don't I get us some more drinks and then we can have some fun!"
>the yeen at your back snickers and presses her snout against your ear so she doesn't have to shout over the music
>"I'm Kerry."
>she points across the dance floor
>"And that's my friend Cassy!"
>Cassy has returned with drinks in paw
>you're handed something bubbly and neon-blue
>"Cheers!"
>whatever she got you, it tastes like cotton candy
>you drink a healthy gulp
>then Kerry reaches around you to tip the glass up
>forcing you to drink more
>Cassy snorts and cackles
>"C'mon! No lightweights! We're partying!"
>you cough and splutter when the glass is pulled away empty
>you're slapped on the back and dragged toward the center of the dance floor as you try to regain your breath
>Cassy giggles and starts to bounce along to the beat in front of you
>you feel Kerry's hot breath on your neck
>"Now dance!"
>you bounce along to the music
>not exactly graceful, but you manage not to make a fool of yourself
>your new dance partners grin and dance along
>bouncing and swinging with the crowd
>but man
>that drink is starting to affect you
>whatever it was, it's strong
>you feel loose and free
>Cassy barks and whoops
>"Yeah! Go humie!"
>you try to do a move you saw on TV
>instead you trip on your own feet and almost fall over
>you're lifted immediately
>Cassy grabs your shoulders while Kerry lifts you from behind
>you're pressed back against the hyena's body
>holy shit those are her tits
>smushed against your back
>she shifts her body a bit and you find your body moving with her
>Cassy holds your shoulders and steps closer
>"Careful!"
>Kerry cackles
>"Looks like that drink was a little strong. Don't worry baby, we'll hold you up."
>you don't like that idea
>but they're already dancing again
>more like grinding against you
>the hyena in front with her hands on your shoulders and her hips bumping against yours in time to the beat
>behind you the other holds you up from under your arms
>her paws sliding over your chest and abdomen as forces you to sway with her body
>you a great deal drunker than you expected to be
>you so you just kind of bob your head along while Kerry and Cassy force your body to move
>"Now that's more like it!"
>Cassy grabs your head
>then your face is engulfed by her tits
>you're completely sandwiched between two strange anthros who go on bumping and grinding and cackling
"Mmph!"
>this is going too far
>it probably went to far five minutes ago
>you try to raise a protest but it's muffled under yeen tits
>you struggle against the hyena girls
>they just go on laughing and dancing
>like they don't even notice you putting up a fight
>until--
>"Oh shit!"
>Cassy grabs your shoulders and pulls back
>"Fuckin' finally!"
>Kerry leans her head over her shoulder
>"What? What is it?"
>Cassy grabs your crotch
>"Boner city baby!"
>oh fuck
>it's not your fault
>what are you supposed to do when you're smothered in yeen titties, with paws all over you, and a yeen grinding on your crotch?
>your face flushes
>Kerry gasps and bursts into fiendish giggly
>"Omygod that's so cute! Take it out!"
>Cassy starts undoing your belt
>you try to push her away
>but Kerry grabs your wrist and holds it back
>"Come on baby."
>Cassy gets her paw down your pants
>grabbing your shaft forcefully
"S-sorry but I got a human girlfriend!"
>that's only kind of true
>more like a human co-worker you're crushing on
>but maybe it will get them to back off
>Cassy flops your cock out of your boxers
>"Don't care. Show us the goods."
>it does not
>they break into harsh cackling
>Kerry's paw goes under your shirt
>pawing at your chest
>while Cassy starts stroking your cock
>her pawpads are warm, a little rough
>her grip is tight
>the hyena in front of you starts with herself
>her other paw going down her pants
>"Fuck, look at you squirming. Kerry, give him a pinch."
>Kerry response
>you feel the sharp pinch of her claws on your nipple
>you spasm and try to buck away from your captor
>she just giggles and twists her fingers to wring a groan from your lips
>"Aww precious. Give us another moan!"
>Kerry goes on tormenting you while Cassy keeps up the mutual masturbation
>her breath coming in shuddering huffs and uncontrolled cackles
>your cock twitches in her paw
>starting to leak pre-cum onto her fur
>you moan as Kerry's other paw leaves your wrist so she can tease both nipples together
>"Are you gonna cum? You gotta tell us when you're gonna cum okay cutie?"
>Kerry gasps
>"Ooh! Ooh! Cassy you should do that thing!"
>oh no
>what thing?
>Cassy nods furiously
>releasing your cock to frantically undo her own short-shorts and pull them down
>her panties are dragged down next, and she grabs your cock to force the tip into them
>they're already soaked
>"G-Gimme a paw, sis."
>Cassy starts pleasuring herself again
>one paw holding down her panties, the other rubbing her clit
>Kerry gives you a reach-around and starts jerking you off into Cassy's panties
>she's rough like Cassy was
>but even more enthusiastic
>her pawpads quickly getting slick with your pre as she strokes
>"C'mon baby, give us a big cummie."
>Kerry starts licking your neck and nibbling your ear
>her hot breath sending shivers down your spine
>Cassy snorts
>"Don't fuckin'--mmf--say it like that."
>she's leaking from her getting herself off
>warm fluids spattering your cock to act as lube for Kerry's strokes
>"Aww, but you want it don'tcha?"
>Cassy growls and rolls her eyes
>"Yeah. Just fuckin'--just make him cum already!"
>Kerry cackles and starts stroking you faster
>"C'mon baby, c'mon. Give Cassy a big fat load~"
>you squirm in her arms
>the other paw doing a good job of both holding you down and groping your relentlessly
>Cassy growls and huffs out shuddering breaths
>"C'mon just fuckin' nut already!"
>Kerry's trying
>milking you at a frenetic pace
>your cock twitches in her paws
>building to a climax
>Cassy too trembles, her arm shaking as she masturbates furiously
>her moans loud enough to be heard over the music now
>your own moans mingling with hers in the air
>and all the while you get closer and closer to climax, Kerry is cackling and giggling in your ear
>nibbling and licking you
>you thrust into her paw
>the beat pounds in your swimming head
>your body flush from the effort
>and finally you jerk forward
>Kerry holding you by the base to aim the first rope of cum right into Cassy's panties
>spattering the already-soaked material with your seed
>you grunt
>cock spasming in the air
>Cassy groans and huffs
>her tongue lolling out
>staring as you fill her panties with cum
>you don't even bother fighting back
>the last few spurts dribbling out of her underwear and down the inside of her thighs
>Cassy slides them up
>"Fuck yeah~"
>Kerry giggles
>"She liked that. Now it's my turn! I call dibs on--"
>a meaty hand lands on your shoulder
>all three of you look up to a muscular bull with a seriously pissed off expression
>his plain black T-shirt reads "SECURITY" in bold letters
>oh no
>"Alright freaks, take the humie show the fuck out of here."
>you stammer
>trying to explain it wasn't your idea
>but he just grabs the back of your shirt and lifts you off the floor
>the yeens yelp and scamper away as you're hauled across the dance floor
>they're waiting out front when you're tossed out on your ass
>Cassy's still squirming and huffing, the front of her shorts already stained
>but Kerry helps you up to your feet
>"Haha shit. That was pretty fuckin' crazy."
>you finally pull your pants up
>Kerry brushes you off
>"Sorry we got you kicked out babe."
>she suddenly smiles wide
>"Oh shit! I know this other place we can go!"
>you hold your hands out and try to back away
"I dunno about--"
>Kerry's already grabbed you
>she links your arm in hers and starts walking you along
>Cassy trotting to catch up
>the taller hyena managing a shuddering giggle
>"Don't worry about it humie. We'll buy you another drink. And dinner after."
>Cassy takes your other arm
>no escape now
>"Where were you thinking, Kerry?"
>Kerry giggles and flashes a big smile
>"That low-key joint down on fifth!"
>low-key sounds nice
>Cassy picks up the pace
>"That's perfect. We'll get away with a lot more there!"
>oh
>that does not sound low-key for you
>Kerry speeds up too
>you're practically dragged along
>too exhausted to put up more than token resistance
>not like you didn't have some fun
>maybe you can still dance some
>then Kerry speaks again
>"Haha yeah. I bet they'll let us fuck him right on the bar!"
>oh man
>gonna be a longer night than you planned

>Turns out when you feel pains similar to growing pains, it's your body not getting tall enough to fit the soul.
>Like outgrowing a set of clothes as you wear them.
>Have occasional aches all around the body- so when finally kicking the bucket you shoot up like a beanstalk from a fairy tale.
>After a life of good will and kindness you're about to ascend to a higher calling only wind up face-down into some red pavement because your parents decided to sell their first born to a hell demon in exchange for exceptional fertility and virility because they were impotent pieces of shit.
>They better be down there too, damn it.
>At least you're twelve feet tall now and can just punt people like footballs if they get too close, so that's a positive.
>The only negative is that you're the butler of some uppity bird lady with a superiority fetish.
>She treats the help like shit, and charlie-horses the back of your leg every time you get too close because being three feet shorter than a 'sinner' is apparently unacceptable for a bird witch.
>Doesn't help that she always has some sort of asinine task to accomplish.
>Just today she demanded that you bring tea and sandwiches to them and her hoity-toity friends, slapped the tray out of your hands, threw hot tea in your face, and groped your ass before kicking you to the ground.
>So, it looks like you were eternally subservient to a bitch with a princess complex.
>Yep, this is hell.
>The sound of a ringing bell awakes you at dawn.
>Even though the broom closet you sleep in has no windows, you know it's dawn because Lady Goetia likes to make your afterlife a living hell and wakes you up the moment light crests the forsaken horizon.
>You dust off one of your uniforms, change out of your jammies and depart.
>Just another day ruled over by the bird.
>Answer the door and escort possible mercenaries or assassins to her quarters in order to gain her audience.
>Prepare breakfast for Lady Goetia and their family.
>Have the breakfast you toiled over thrown in the garbage by your mistress.
>Stare pleadingly at her ex-husband for the sweet release of super-death.
>Have your pleading go unanswered.
>It was just another morning.
>-and it wasn't even eight yet.
>Your lady loved making you do ridiculous things throughout the day- most of which directly hindering your work.
>Did she demand that you dust the furniture? Well, now she wants you to learn how to juggle and ride the unicycle for her company.
>At the same time.
>Are you supposed to assist in the re-shingling of the roof with the imps? Too boring for the bird mistress. Now she has turned it into a suicidal free-for-all where it's either the imps or you.
>You're gonna miss Mookie, but the guy tried to slice your throat.
>What's worse is by the time you got off the roof covered in the viscera of your coworkers- you were getting shoved into a suitcase and relocating to her brother's house.
>You're fairly certain she just threw you on the roof of a carriage, but it's pretty hard to tell through THREE INCHES OF BALLISTIC NYLON.
>There's the sound of stirrups being whipped, and you're off.
>Fuckin' whee~
>You're not sure if her brother is a nut, or not.
>He acts like one, but the important word here is 'acts.'
>Might be smarter than he lets on, or dumber than you think.
>Also might want to doink his own sister.
>You know that you shouldn't be surprised because it's hell but c'mon, man.
>In the meantime, between the divorce and other things- Lady Goetia has been becoming. . . Frustrated.
>-and guess who has to deal with that?
>"Butler! BUTLER, WHERE ARE YOU!?!"
>You walk with purpose down one of the many corridors of the palace you've wandered many times before.
>Your posture was perfect, your focus ahead, and the large cloche-covered platter balanced on your right hand did not so much as jostle.
>You moved your feet fast, but with precision each time Lady Goetia called.
>"BUTLER! IF YOU ARE NOT HERE IN FIVE SECONDS I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND MOUNT YOU TO THE WALL!"
>You knew better than to doubt her sociopathic claims; a sentiment shared by your legs as they sped up just enough to still carry you with a sense of class.
>The moment you arrived at her chamber door however, you were met with the owner of this abode- Andrealphus.
>You were smarter than to stand taller than anyone in this place, soon crouching slightly in something of an awkward curtsy; closing your eyes as not to make contact.
>"Best to head inside. She's losing patience."
>The sound of a door opening hit your ears.
>"Your butler is here with what you've asked, dear sister."
>There was the sound of a closing door followed by steps on a cold floor, as you opened your eyes to see Andrealphus wandering off away from you; leaving you with an ominous doorway and a forced obligation to open it.
>The stench of sex hit you like a wall in a way that made you flinch.
>It may have not have been unpleasant, but you knew who it came from.
>You strolled in with the covered platter taking lead just in time for a vase to fly across the room and smash into the door.
"You. . . IDIOT."
>There was your mistress; sitting upright in a lavish bed far too large to be appropriate for her own size.
>"It was about time you got here!"
>To save face, you bowed.
"Apologies, I will improve in the future."
>The high canopy of the bed that once creating a regal curtain wall of luxurious linens was now in tatters as she stared daggers into you.
>You wasted no time, quickly moving around the bed and setting the domed platter on her bedside table before removing the cloche to reveal. . .
>Sexual paraphernalia.
>Indeed, the frustration that Lady Goetia had been dealing with was of the intimate variety- this escapade of a divorce apparently going on for so long that she has apparently suffered from it carnally somehow.
>How this came to be was anyone's guess.
>By how little she fucked Stolas, you'd think the bird was biologically asexual.
>None the less-
>This has led to moments in the day where your mistress has indulged in lustful decadence.
>Phallic toys, lubricants, sexual devices, lustful stimulants- the works.
>It was such a a spread that you had to advert your gaze just to save face.
>Now, however, came the worst part.
>After quietly dismissing yourself outside the room, you were to wait for your mistress to finish using them; the sounds of furious masterbation beginning the moment those doors were closed.
>'Why-' you ask? Because she couldn't be expected to clean them all, herself.
>You're pretty sure that your mistress didn't even know how to use a sponge; much less hold it.
>It was disgusting, really.
>Any normal person would probably be turned on by such a thing, but you felt nothing.
>She was a spoiled brat that grew up into a rotten woman, and there was no amount of pheromones or sexual thoughts that could get past everything she has made you do over the years.
>That being said, today's session certainly was going on for a while.
>Seconds turned to a minute, and then two, then three, then five, then ten, and finally twenty-seven.
>You had to check your pocket watch just to be certain the clock in the hall was accurate.
>All the while, the noises in the room behind you were becoming all the more furious before devolving into exhausted panting.
>"BUTLER, GET IN HERE NOW!"
>You sigh when finally being able to pick yourself off the door and step inside once more to-
>Damn it.
>The room was practically in shambles.
>Furniture was overturned, sheets were slashed- even some of the wallpapers seemed clawed into.
>This was going to be a pain to clean.
"Yes, Lady Goetia?"
>You shut the door behind you as you got a good look at the toys scattered around the bed and floor, stepping over a dildo just to reach the foot of the bed.
>It was there that you could see the bird woman lying in bed, furiously staring at you.
>Her red eyes tried to burn into you while her form below her neck stayed mostly shrouded by a comforter.
>"You wish to be free of your servitude to me, is that correct?"
>Was this a trick question?
>Even behind her heavy breathing you could feel the presence of arrogance, but bit your tongue.
"It has crossed my mind during my many tasks, yes."
>There was a pause.
>"Then I order you to disrobe."
>A frown graced your mistresses presence as you stood still as you watched Stella rise to her feet stop the mattress- making her way toward you.
>She stopped at the foot of the bed, staring down at you with annoyance at your lack of movement.
>"-and if I refu-"
>Before you even know what is happening, there is a talon gripping your throat that yanked you onto the bed and flat on your back.
>"YOU DO NOT REFUSE ME!"
>It was a verbal, visceral eruption that truly reminded you of the pecking order between the sinners and the higher class of hell.
>You were pinned by the throat against the bed, the woman's sheer grip strength already strangling the airflow to your lungs.
>All the while, your eyes couldn't help but wander when it came to the form that now knelt over yours.
>It was the first time seeing your mistress bare; her form no-longer covered by a blanket to let you see everything her dignity compelled her to cover.
>A small set of breasts, and a pair of shapely hips covered in a soft plumage of feathers were what you pulled your eyes away from just in time to see Stella stare down at you with entertained distain.
>She seemed to almost forget that you were suffocating.
>"You had best listen because I am only saying this once-" she threatened with a tightening of her grip.
>"I am going to lessen my grip, and give you an order."
>You began to flail your legs pointlessly under her as she pressed a sharpened digit onto your chest and slowly began to press onto you.
>"If any other words come out of your mouth other than 'of course, mistress' during your time in this room, then I will kill you a thousand times before you are given the opportunity to try again."
>Your mistress loosened her grip, and you gasped in a lung-full of air.
>"Now, disrobe."
>The bleeding fury behind her gaze caused you to relent, a hand clumsily unbuttoning your vest.
"O-of course. . . Mistress."
>"-and I'll handle the bottom-" she demanded fruitfully when using a digit to pop the button off of your pants crudely.
>"I normally wouldn't stoop to doing such a thing with a dirt-thing like you, but there is little else one can do when the only other options are faulty toys, and family."
>In only a matter of moments you feel her digging around in your pants, pulling out your shamefully half-mast member.
>She gripped it, but couldn't fit the fingers of her claw all the way around; giving it long, firm strokes when staring at you with narrowed eyes and a crude smile.
>"I'll give you a deal just like I gave those abominations you call 'parents'."
>You didn't know what to be staring at, the sight of your owner disrobing you of your trousers just to grind against your shaft better or the devious stare she gave you.
>"Please me, and you may consider your bindings to me loosened. Understood?"
"Of course, Mistress."
>She only seemed to be half listening when positioning herself over you; using a couple digits to spread a soft plush-looking labia over the head of your shaft.
>"Good, fail me and I'll have you gutted."
>In a swift movement she already dropped, not only surprising you but herself as her knees caught her halfway down your cock with a sharp gasp.
>"FUCK ME!"
>You weren't sure if this was a demand or a swear at the ceiling, but you thrusted upward in a way that caused your mistress to shudder; her knees buckling to let her fall the rest of the way as you felt your tip hit the end of the road before hilting your length.
>"Damn you, you bastard. . ."
>Lady Goetia hissed as she arched over you, sharp teeth clenching as her hips grinded into you.
>"Don't just lay there like my pathetic ex-husband! Keep. Fucking. MOVING."
>You weren't sure if it was your dick taking over your brain functions, or the talon being pressed against your throat but it wasn't long before you had Stella Goetia bouncing on your dick with every thrust of your hips.
>"Harder. HARDER. Oh, for the love of- just let me do it."
>A surge of pleasure shot through you as your mistress slammed herself onto you- letting you know absolutely certain that you were smashing against the back wall of her depths.
>"Well, this is a pleasant surprise-" she spoke through breathy huffs. "You're not as useless in bed as I expected. Perhaps I should make you my personal dildo?"
>You didn't wish to dignify that with a response, but luckily it seemed like you wouldn't have to as somehow your mistress got even more intense with her motions- wrapping her arms around you as if to pull you into her.
>You felt like you weren't going to last much longer, and she could feel you throbbing inside of her so in one last motion she slammed herself on top of you in a way that you almost heard your pelvis pop.
>Her body almost spasmed when reaching climax- instead choosing to latch onto you and grinding until she felt you paint her walls white.
>Even in the after-glow of post coitus, your mistresses body domineered your own as in your mental fuzz you did not take more of your lady taking something off of her bedside table and putting it in your mouth.
>"I am far from satisfied. Let us continue."
>This was going to be a long day.

>get abducted
>they run a series of tests on you
>forget to beam you back down to earth
>you're a sex pet for alien squirrels now

>"Thaaaats it, you fuckin' freak. Deep huff"
>Your eyes practically roll into the back of your head
>Was this even real? It couldn't be, it was too good to be true!
>The derisive snicker from the crowded room was loud in your ears
>Almost drowning out the thumping electronic party music
>This was equal parts a nightmare too, having your degeneracy exposed to everyone you knew
>Some party
>"Did I tell you to stop?"
>Stephanie's commanding tone launched your tongue back into action
>Your nose was buried in her sweat-damp armpit
>Nostrils burning with the skunk's natural scent. All those oils really leeched into sinuses.
>Everything was going to smell like her for days.
>Your tongue dug through that wiry nest of pit-fur.
>Stiff bristles to dig through and savor the wetness
>If you were feeling poetic you might think of it as the 'Rain of a goddess'
>Rather than what it was
>The rank, unwashed pit of a rowdy skunk bitch.
>The wall slammed into your spine
>You groaned
>Trapped in her underarm now
>"Jeez, I think I can feel his dick on my thigh"
>Steph's words excited the crowd of friends and enemies
>All united in observing your perverse torment
>You kept lapping, sucking, drinking that girl's sweat
>Part of you hoped this was all filthy wet dream
>The other part was glad to have finally been exposed
>"Alright that's enough."
>She pushed you in the chest. Hard.
>It hurt!
>Your tipsy self fell backwards and sprained your hand when you fell to the ground
>You seethe
"What was that for?"
>She didn't reply, just pulled her left foot from her heavy boot
>The socked toes flexed
>Dripped with sweat
>She stepped on your face
>"Huff it, perv."
>The hangover
>It was bad
>You awakened laying face first with your head crammed into the pillows of a couch
>It wasn't your couch
>Must've gotten too drunk to get home
>You clamber up
>Everything smelled weird
>You were drenched in sweat
>Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt.
>You needed water... but first you needed...
>Your slow stumbling turned into a mad dash towards the bathroom
>At least - you were pretty sure this was the bathroom.
>Thank fuck! It was!
>Hunching over a toilet you turned your stomach inside out
>Then you collapsed next to it
>The taste of vomit staining your tongue
>There were footsteps
>"You alright?"
>Stephanie's voice
>She was half naked too
>What was she doi- oh.. right, this was her home.
"Aghhh.."
>You groan
"I'm fine"
>A few memories of what happened last night tore through your brain
>Your face in her pits
>Sucking her toes
>Even letting her put a collar on you and parade you around the place
>A feeling of sickness rose in you
>As if the literal sickness from the booze wasn't enough
>"You were pretty wild last night" She teased.
>You wanted to die
"Ugh, why did I do that"
>She helped you to your feet
>"I 'unno, you were horny? I'm gonna take a shower. If you want another stab at my armpits, you can join me"
>She shrugged
>You wobbled on your feet a little
"I'll just get a glass of water first"
>The blast of cold water shocked you wide awake
"Why didn't you warn me!"
>"Only works if you don't see it coming"
>You shivered
>The cold shower poured down down both of you
"I notice it works for you"
>"Yeah but you're a noob"
>What the fuck was that even supposed to mean?
>Whatever
>You grabbed some soap
"So..."
>You hadn't talked much about last night beyond the awkward run in
>"Yeah there's probably loads of video"
>She cut to the chase
>"Honestly, nobody's gonna care, don't worry about it"
>"Coulda been waaay worse, you're lucky it was me bossin' you around"
>She laughed, then put a bottle of shampoo in your hand
>"Mind getting my tail?"
>You diligently helped shower the skunk
>Her fur was soft
>At some point she turned the cold to hot
>The warmth was incredibly cozy
>You wanted to cuddle her
"That mean all the insults and stuff were uh?"
>"100 percent real, you're a degenerate"
>You gulp
>She cackles
>"But that just means I can make you my pet, right? Like, I've had boyfriends. Boyfriends suck."
>Her hands rest on your shoulders
>You glance to each and then to her eyes
>"A pet sounds way better"
>She pushes you down
>This time you go with it, crouching into a kneel
>"Good puppy."
>You had told her you were okay with the pet-play kink
>So long as it didn't bleed into your real life
>That was 2 weeks ago
>Currently you were sitting in a lecture hall taking notes... with a collar around your neck.
>Steph had spent the whole morning bullying you into putting it on
>You wish you'd had the gumption to fight back just a little harder
>But the way she said "Bad puppy!" just twisted the blade in your heart
>You realized you'd been staring into space for the past 5 minutes
>Everyone was leaving
>Blinking a few times you settled back into reality
>Then you crammed all your crap back into your bag and slung it over your shoulder
>Your hand came to your throat, felt up the collar
>You tugged on it a little
>It was kinda tight
>"That's the point, dummy. So you remember it's there."
>You remembered that alright.
>Trying not to think about it, you left the campus to find something to eat
>You walked past an alleyway without looking
>Out from it emerged a shadow which bolted past you
>Swiftly, smoothly a furry black hand swiped past your face
>Felt a tug on your neck
>Your eyes darted around til they landed on that black and white landing strip of a tail
>Then followed the leather strap that was hooked into your collar
"What the f-"
>"Puppy! I knew I'd find you around here, you always come here"
>You glanced at Steph, then down at your own collar
>Then again you let your eyes follow the leash to her fist
"Oh... oh shit. Oh please, Steph, please not in public!"
>Your whines just made her giggle
>"Come off it, you look cute like this!"
>She tugged on the leash
>"Now heel, puppy! We're getting lunch!"
>This was the most humiliating experience of your life
>Sitting across from Steph, eating a muffin, drinking a mocha-latte ...
>With a leash between your neck and her palm.
>You chose not to make eye contact with anyone in the cafe
>"Y'know~"
>You just watched your own slip-ons shuffle beside Steph's boots as you left the cafe
>"A real pet wouldn't pay for his own meals, he'd beg for his owner for food and if he was a good boy, she'd feed him"
>God her whispering was insidious
"I am not giving you my bank account"
>She snickers and gives you a little smack on the shoulder
>"Daw you're no fun! At least entertain the idea."
>You shoot her a disapproving glare
>"Hmf"
>You sigh
>"Puppy is sleeping on the floor tonight."
>Your eyes swivel back to her
>Disbelief all over your dumb face
"What!?"
>"You heard me."
"Why? Because I won't give you all my money! That's absu-"
>"No, it's because you're raining on my parade here"
>"If you act like this is spoils the mood"
>You can't believe this
>This is nuts
"What does that eve-"
>"Just play along! You don't actually have to do it, just pretend!"
>Oh.
>You felt a little silly.
>You also felt quite angry. Why were girls so difficult?
>"Anyway. Orders stand. Puppy is on the floor tonight."
"Steph, c'mon!"
>"Nuh uh! And I want a paw massage."
>You sighed
>You strolled down the street with her, you almost forgot you were on a leash a few times.
>After a couple minutes of silence she went back into teasing
>This time you leaned into it
>Let her fantasies run wild, she'd certainly indulged in yours.
>You didn't want to be ungrateful
"Oh um, there's something I forgot back at campus? Can I go get it?"
>You tugged on the collar a few times
>"Oh! Forgetful little puppy aren'tcha? Sure, lets go back!"
>Oh no.
"I meant on m-"
>"Oh I know what you meant, but you've been a bad puppy today"
>"I'm not letting you leave my sight."
>You gulped
>Asking your professor if he'd seen a little red USB stick shouldn't have been so nerve wracking
>But doing it with a collar around your neck ...
>With your 'owner' standing behind you, giggling ...
>While she tugged on your leash a few times just to fuck with you ...
>You'd never been so red
>Or felt so cold
>She hadn't even seen the thumbdrive, so it was a waste of time.
>You later found it crammed in the bottom of your bag
>The entire humiliating ritual of being waltzed around campus on a leash was for nothing
>Well..
>Maybe not nothing per se
>Steph was pleased
>Really pleased!
>You sat with your back against the foot of her bed
>The skunk's toned thighs wrapped your head
>Her feet were on your manhood
>All you could do was groan
>"Sorry about making everything so public"
>Surprisingly there was a hint of guilt in her voice
>It was still mostly lust though
>"I know you said you weren't ready for that but... God, it was hot! Right?"
>Your cheeks were already burning up. They had been for hours.
>The day had been extremely uncomfortable
>In part thanks to the ceaseless bulge in your pants
>You give another groan
>"You're not a bad puppy, just a scared puppy."
>"Still sleeping on the floor tonight though, I haven't changed my mind"
>You whine
>Her toes curl around your shaft
>A toepad grinds your frenulum
>"That foot massage was good though! So um, I've never jerked anyone off with my feet before, am I doing a good job?"
>You nod as well as you can with her thighs gripping your skull
>She giggles
>You throb, and then you explode.
>Her giggle grows to a snicker. Steph's toes wriggle. Your spent seed stains into her black fur.
>"Look what a mess you made, naughty boy"
>-- Six Months Later --
>Maybe it was a bad idea
>But you decided to move in
>You and Steph talked about it a bunch
>It was a pretty big step for a few reasons
>First just financially
>Suddenly the two of you had more money spend by splitting the rent
>But kink wise
>Thing were kicked up to 11
>You woke up curled at the foot of Steph's bed.
>You were naked, Stephanie was nowhere to be found
>With a sigh you crawled out from under the covers
>The bed was still warm. Smelled like her too
>It was cozy
>You laid on the pillow for a moment, rubbing your eyes
>Then you reached to the bedside table for your collar
>It had become a routine
>Your palm fell flat on the wood surface
"Huh?"
>You looked to your hand
>There was no collar here
>Strange
>You suddenly felt even more naked than you already were
>With a hop you climbed out of bed and pulled on some clothes
>Sweat pants and a t-shirt
"Steph? You home?"
>A couple seconds later her voice calls back muffled through the walls
>"Mhm! Bathroom!"
>Oh, okay
>You waited in the living room / kitchen
>Might as well make some breakfast
>You popped bread in the toaster, when you turned around you noticed something
>A box was on the countertop
>The label made your throat dry
>A couple moments later you heard your owner/lover bounding down the hallway
>Her tail waved behind her like a great fluffy black and white kite
"Uhm, did you buy a shock collar?"
>Her smile quickly melted into a scary grin
"Uh oh"
>"Oh yes."
>You stuffed the toast in your mouth and chewed
>"You're gonna be a good puppy ... Or else"
>You swallowed
"G-gentle"
>She cackled

>His face was buried in the cow's backside
>His cheeks were smooshed by the surprisingly grippy strength of her her doughy cheeks
>"Why've you stopped? You're down there til I finish this match remember?"
>He wheezed in a breath through flattened nostrils
>Then he put his tongue back where it belonged
>It slipped in with ease, her thick butthole was already lubed up with spit from before
>He couldn't complain really. Sure it was hot and muggy and kinda bitter tasting back there
>Still
>There was a cow with a deliciously fat ass sitting on his face
>Who doesn't want that?

>"Hey skinnie! You're under arrest!"
>What? You twirl around to see who just verbally assaulted you
>It's a cop. A very short cop.
>She tugs you by your tie and you nearly collapse onto her
"Whaddido?"
>"Were those words?"
>You swallow and try speaking again
"What am I under arrest for?"
>"Carryin' around those fat nuts"
>You blink
"What?"
>She smacks your crotch
>You wince and nearly double over again
>Now handcuffs fly out
"H-hey wait this can't be le-"
>"I'm a cop, dumbass, anything I say is the law"
>You're pretty sure that's not how it works
>"Now get in the car before I pull out my baton, I can get pretty... kinky with my baton."
>You do whatever this crazy bat cop wants
>"Great!"
>"Now fuck the shit out of me, I forgot my heat meds this morning."

>Give her the "fingerguns"
>Say, "Rat-a-tat-tat" as you "fire" off said "fingerguns"
How does she react?

I can see few scenarios playing out depending on which kind of a rat we are dealing with. Not huge rats necessarily
>Simple/Wild ratgirl: Quizzically inspects you. Thinks you are doing some sort of mating proposal and buries you underneath her body.
>Street rat: "Heh. That is quite funny. Want to see mine?" Follows this with pulling out her Tommy gun. She definitely belongs to a criminal syndicate.
>Officer Flint Scenario: "Aha aha. You got a licence to carry those "guns"? Yeah didn't think so. You are going to the station with me" Proceeds to handcuff you and interrogate you later.
>Mature rat matriarch: Doesn't really understand young peoples lingo and thinks you are stuttering. Still takes it as a compliment and hugs you tightly with your head trapped between her cleavage.

>Your head feels spinny, the tip of your cock rubs agaist her tummy fluff
>"If you cum right now I promise I'm gonna stop holding back during the next session"
>She's holding back right now?
>The toy keeps rubbing against that special spot back there
>"Come on, be a good boy and let it all out~ Do it for mommy"
>It's just too much for your poor prostate to handle
>You can feel it with your whole body
>Your load starts leaking out of your cock as she kisses you again
>The orgasm lasts twice as long as the normal one, your legs were actually shaking the whole time
>She just giggles and gives your balls a squeeze to get last drops of cum out of there

Anthros raid your village, burn it to the ground, taking all the men and goods. then they just expect the captured men to act like loving husbands from day 1, insanity.

What route do you take?
>Be a good sex slave/husband and live out your simple life to your assigned waifur?
>Begin gathering secretly with the other human males and begin plotting your strike in order to escape and form a rebellion?
>Begin psychologically manipulating your assigned waifur to make her start believing she should be the leader, and help her usurp the throne of her anthro clan with you at her side?

>wat
>seeing my confusion she explains
>”First wave candidates were the soldiers involved in the fighting, while they could wait for the state to assign them a husband most just selected from prisoners of war directly.”
>she sighs
>”But it is their right by conquest, to the winner the spoils and all that.”
>”Your wife will be selected from veterans that were ineligible in the first wave due to injury and members of the citizen corps.”
>”Not that there’s anything wrong with that!”

>”Smaller men are more my type.”

>squeezed my haunches, inspected my teeth, prodded my gut until I sucked it in
>”This one’s too pathetic, even for my tastes. Next!”
>ouch
>The receptionist tried to cheer me up after that
>desperate, I made a shot in the dark
>”Do you have a husband?” I asked
>the kind, sympathetic look she gave me then hurt more than being called pathetic

>Be Anon
>Sitting on the waiting room of a strange massage parlor
>You’ve been having a shit week at work
>You hurt your back lifting a heavy box
>Hopefully a massage will help ease your pain
>You found this place and found it to be pretty cheap than most other parlors
>”Anon? Cassandra’s ready for you.”
>You snap your head to the receptionist and make your way towards the stout otter, who hands you a key and points towards your room
>”Room 7. And by the way, Cassandra likes to take her time, hopefully that won’t be an issue!”
>You tell her you don’t mind and thank her
>You make your way towards the door and insert the key
>Turning it, you unlock the door and turn the handle
>It isn’t hard to find your masseuse
>A tall, overweight grizzly bear woman is setting up her oversized massage table for you
>God, you barely even reach her waist
>She looks at you and gives you a toothy grin
>”Well, hi there, sugar! You must be Anon, right?”
>The words are stuck in your throat
“I—uh, I’m—y-yeah! I’m A-Anon!”
>Your heart skips a couple beats
>Cassandra looks as soft as she is sweet
>”Perfect! Well, go ahead and take off your clothes and we’ll get started!”
>You take a moment to ogle at the motherly bear’s generous chest
>Her chubby belly
>Her wide hips
>You quickly shake those perverted thoughts out of your head and take off your clothes minus your underwear, last thing you need is a stiffy in front of this big bear woman
>You make your way to the oversized massage table, before looking up to Cassandra to ask her a question
“Uhhhh, isn’t this massage table too big for me?”
>Cassandra chuckles and waves a paw
>”Oh sweetie, trust me. You’ll need this.”
>You shrug and climb up onto the massage table, laying flat on it
>”Now, you said you hurt your back at work?”
“Ah, yeah. I must’ve pulled something while I was lifting a heavy box.”
>”Ahhh. Well, hopefully I can make that better, sugar. Let’s start with your shoulders, just lie down and relax.”
>Cassandra got to work by putting her big paws on your shoulders, and began massaging you
>Despite how large she is, she’s very gentle with her ministrations
>She hums as she works her paws downward, slowly going down your back
>”You doing okay, sugar?”
“Mhm.”
>You smile as you relax in her grip
>”Good. Just let me know if anything hurts.”
>Her paws continue massaging your back lower and lower, until they hit a certain spot, causing you to wince
>”Ohhhh, I can feel how sore it is down there. You still doing okay, Anon?”
“Y-Yeah, just–don’t go too hard, please.”
>Cassandra giggles and places her paw right on your sore spot
>”Don’t worry, sugar. I’ll go slow…”
>Cassandra gently soothes out your aching back, rubbing you in a circular motion
>You let out a pleasured groan as Cassandra rubbed your sore back
>Her soft pads slowly applied more and more pressure onto your back, soothing your aching muscles
>”That feel good, sugar?”
“Mmm, yes. Thank you.”
>”Good. Then you’re gonna love this.”
>Cassandra climbed onto the table behind you, resting her legs on either side of you
>Then, she slowly lowered herself on top of you, smothering the entire back of your body in her soft body
>You let out a happy groan as she just barely rests her weight on top of you
>You feel her soft breasts rest on the back of your head
>God, she feels like a giant waterbed
>”Let me know if I’m too heavy, alright?”
>You nod against her breasts as she starts grinding herself back and forth on top of you
>You let out happy sounds as her soft body caresses every inch of yours in her softness and heat
>It’s like a weighted massage blanket
>You feel your loins begin to stir, your dick growing hard
>Time loses meaning, and eventually she stops her full body massage on you to lift herself up slightly
>”Do me a favor and lay on your back for me, sugar?”
>You happily oblige, turning around to face her giant mammaries
>Cassandra lets out a happy hum as her chest falls down on top of your face, smothering you in darkness
>Her soft belly covers the entirety of your body, including your groin
>Her overflowing fat caresses every inch of your dick, drowning it in pleasure
>She giggled and resumed her grinding on your entire body
>”That’s it, sugar. Just relax and let me take care of all that stress on your body…”
>You’re in heaven, Cassandra’s soft body becomes your world
>Her soft boobs mash your face, and her big belly grinds on your dick
>You stifle a moan as her soft fat sends a wave of pleasure throughout your entire body
>She chuckles, and speeds up her grinding
>You try and tap her, but your arms are stuck to your sides, so you’re left helpless as she grinds more pleasure out of you
>Eventually it becomes too much, and you moan into her breasts as you climax
>Cassandra slows to a halt, and lifts herself up off of you
“O-Oh my God, C-Cassandra, I–I am so–”
>”No need to apologize, sweetie.”
>Cassandra gives you a warm smile and rubs your chest, looking at you with bedroom eyes
>She uses a pointed claw to touch your nipple, coaxing a moan out of you
>”Matter of fact, I think you’ve earned the premium package, free of charge. Follow me.”
>She makes her way to a room in the back as you get up off the massage table
>You follow her into a large doorway, watching her massive ass shake and wobble with each step
>It’s hard to ignore when your head is at the same height as her butt
>Once the two of you enter the room, you notice a large mattress embedded into the floor
>You look up at Cassandra, who gives you a comforting smile
>Then, she reaches for the hem of her pants and pulls them down in front of you, revealing her lower nude half to you
>Your face flashes beet red as you’re unsure of what reaction you should take
>But Cassandra still gives you that comforting smile as she does the same with her shirt, showing off her massive breasts and nipples
>”Go ahead and take off those boxers, sugar.”
“I—uh, I-“
>Cassandra chuckles and reaches for the hem of your boxers
“Oh, sweetie, don’t be ashamed.“
>She then pulls down your boxers and releases your erection from its fabric prison
>You look away, embarrassed to expose your most sensitive part of your body to her in its full form
>Instead, she simply hums and lays her paw on your shoulder
>”Go ahead and lay flat on your back, sweetie.”
>Slowly, you walk on the mattress floor and lay down in the middle
>Cassandra walks to your spot, standing on either side of you, and turns around, showing off her massive ass to you
>She looks down at you to make sure you’re there, and smiles
>”Take a deep breath, sugar.”
>Slowly, Cassandra lowers her butt down, it’s moving towards your face in slow motion
>Eventually, her fur grazes your face, then it’s her soft flesh and fat
>Once she’s low enough, her feet move underneath your head and push you further up, driving you deeper into her crack
>Then she fully lowers herself down, settling all her weight on top of your head
>She clenches her ass around your head a couple times to make sure you’re in place
>”Ah, nice and snug. Enjoying yourself down there?”
>You let out a happy groan as you wiggle your head deeper in between her cheeks
>”Hehe, I’ll take that as a yes.”
>She wiggles and grinds on top of you, forcing you deeper
>You turn your head to the right to give her cheek a kiss, before turning to the other side and doing the same
>Eventually, her fur starts getting thinner until it reaches a point where there’s nothing but rigid skin
>”Ooh, that’s the spot! Feel free to give it a kiss.”
>You quickly oblige, leaning in to give her pucker a quick kiss
>Cassandra slightly jumps, then slams back down, forcing your face against her asshole
>”Here, let me take care of you.”
>Cassandra wraps her paw around your pulsing rod with ease, covering the entire shaft and tip
>You moan and buck your hips into her paw, desperate for release
>”Don’t worry, sugar. Just relax and keep kissing.”
>You pucker your lips and kiss her asshole again, over and over until it’s covered in a thin layer of spit
>Cassandra responds by moving her paw up and down with a tight grip on your rod, coaxing pleasured moans out of you
>You respond by opening your mouth and licking her asshole, causing Cassandra to moan and wiggle her butt on top of you
>Eventually, you stick your tongue through her pucker and into her insides, lightly sucking her outer rim with your lips as you make out with her ass
>”Ooh, t-that’s the stuff! Keep going, sugar!”
>Cassandra huffs as she continues jerking you off in a faster speed
>You’re almost out of air, but you don’t care
>All that matters in the world is Cassandra’s ass
>You grope and squeeze her meaty cheeks as you start to grow lightheaded
>Unfortunately, Cassandra removes her paw from your dick and lifts herself up, leaving a thin saliva trail between her asshole and your mouth
>You hold onto her cheeks as she moves away from you, leaving you with a frown
>But as you sit up, you notice that she’s in front of you on all fours, looking back at you and spreading her ass apart, showing off her glistening asshole to you
>”You wanna finish, sugar?”
>You eagerly nod and make your way towards her butt
>You have to climb up on her big, fuzzy cheeks to line up your tip with her asshole
>Once you get set up, you thrust yourself forwards, and start pounding her ass
>The two of you moan together as her asshole consumes your dick up to the hilt
>”Oooh, that’s it sugar, keep going, I’m so close!”
>You feel your climax approaching fast, so you slow down your hips to pound her ass harder
>Her ribbed anal walls caress your entire shaft, sending waves of pleasure throughout your body
“Oh God, Cassandra, I’m—I’m…cumming!”
>”Oooh!”
>The two of you climax at the same time, your seed filling up Cassandra’s asshole, and her own spraying on the mattress below like a geyser
>Exhausted, you lay there with your dick still in her ass
“Oh my… Cassandra, that was… thank you.”
>Cassandra looks behind herself and winks at you
>”No problem, Anon.”
“I guess I should get going now. Can we do same time next week?”
>Cassandra gives you a grin
>”Actually, I was thinking we could do it at my house, how does that sound? That’s where most of my stuff is.”
>Your eyes grow wide
“R-Really? Sure!”
>Cassandra chuckles
>”Of course. Now, we should get ourselves dressed, we close in 10 minutes.”
>The two of you separate and gather your clothes, swiftly putting them on and making your way out the door
>Cassandra holds the door open for you, but not before leaning down and giving you a kiss on the cheek
>”See you next week, Anon! Here’s my address.”
>You take a paper note she’s holding out to you
“Y-Yeah, see you next week!”
>You reach for the cheek that she just kissed and rub it
>You wonder what equipment she’s talking about that she couldn’t bring to her job

>very dominant musky badgirl rat makes fun of you, bullies you, and makes you eat her ass all the time
>in the afterglow of rough sex she becomes cuddly and kissy and sweet momentarily

>The Anthrostate

>Cheetahs are one of the most accomplished anthro species
>Providing great contributions to society, mainly in the hard sciences
>Not to mention their excellence in sports like sprinting
>Howerver they have frequent issues related to anxiety and propensity to panic attacks
>Apart from the obvious health problems, those combine with their natural introversion and social awkwardness make than very poor at socialization
>What, not surprisingly, leads to low reproductive rates
>To solve this problem the best researchers of the government came with an ingenious solution
>Paring cheetah cubs with human babies as soon as possible
>Preferably at birth
>This way the human will serve as an solid life long emotional support
>And as they would grow up together mitigating the social awkwardness and communication issues, they would be the perfect mates for one another

What about like
>Cheetah/Human pairings understand that they are not siblings immediately from the beginning
>Despite this, they still live with each other as if they are siblings
>They're made to share beds, showers, any sort of situation where one could be vulnerable to the other
>This helps cement that they have each other completely, and that they can not only rely on each other but can trust each other whenever they're most vulnerable
>For added effect, the human/cheetah pairings are given long periods of time unsupervised, especially when the cheetah reaches sexual maturity + first heat
>At this point a cheetah can leave home and start her own life without (too much) anxiety, as she understands she can rely fully on her human mate
>They can then start a family themselves and continue pairing their offspring

>Psychologists become increasingly concerned over growing depression pandemic caused by modern problems
>See how humans who grew up with pet (feral) dogs are more happy long term
>Testing with pet dogs are not terrible, but it is clear that the relationship between an anthro and a pet dog is not as positive as it is with humans and dogs
>One day someone pointed out that perhaps it is the human factor
>Desperate, they took a young human boy and a female anthro, then had them grow up beside each other
>It was a startling success
>They were incredibly happy and got along very well
>More times this was repeated
>For an indescribable reason this only worked consistently with with male humans and female anthros
>All tests involving human females and anthro males sadly failed, sometimes even having the opposite effect
>However, the relationship between male humans and female anthros could not be ignored, with the former gaining emotional fulfillment and sense of intrinsic value, and the latter great confidence and newfound purpose, things that were greatly lacking in the day and age
>There are other changes in behavior however
>As they aged, the females viewed their adoptive "brothers" as something to protect and cherish, leaving the relatively weaker males more timid as they become more reliant on their "sisters" when in negative situations
>When asked what the females thought, they always answered to the tune of "I think he is much cuter like this"
>Despite growing up together, they seem to not recognize each other as true siblings, as platonic love very often turns to romantic
>The females will often push (sometimes forcefully) their false brothers into a relationship, and the males will accept it
>These couples are becoming increasingly common, to the point of overshadowing same species relationships
>Some are concerned as this might result in the disappearance of male anthros and female humans, as they are not interested in dating each other, and their usual partners are gradually looking for other mates
>However, some psychologists argue differently, calling it a self solving problem
>Leading psychologist and member of the Cross-Breed experiment Clawrissa Roberts stated "We are fixing the state of the modern world. Although it is sad that our brethren may disappear, is it not better for us to look toward the future? My son may not be of my race, but he will be happy. My daughter may not be of my husband's race, but she will be happy. Many of us are marrying outside of our species because it makes us happy. Suicide rates have dropped, the economy is growing, and culture has been thriving! My cheetah brothers are free to marry human women if they want it so badly, but I will not give up this beautiful world. Me and my husband will choose the path that makes us happy, and I believe my sisters and his brothers agree!"
>When her husband was asked if it was truly his choice as she said, he stated yes
>After being presented photographic evidence of his sexual assault during his college years by his now wife, he merely laughed awkwardly and said "she was really convincing."

Would female anthros having smaller tits would be considered a female equivalent of having a small dick?
>Get’s her clothes ripped off by accident
>Exposes her flat chest in front of the humie bois
>”Haha! It’s so small and flat!!”, “Is her breasts dry as bones?”, “She made flashing pretty boring haha!”
>”S-Stop it! I’m not flat!! I’m a late bloomer, I swear!!” 

>Sorry, lil Humie, but your male protagonist might be a bad role model for our humie children. Standing up and be your own man? Questioning the female anthro’s demands and motivation? Be strong and independent humie? Sorry, babe. But let us the PROFESSIONALS do the direction now. We want to make a good role model for our boys to follow.

>Fox waifur
Will trick you into breaking some obscure fae-spirit law that makes you her property, will then keep you in her spirit realm until you've impregnated her at least seven times.
>Cow waifur
Will capture you after you've exhausted yourself trying to escape her labyrinthine lair. Be prepared to eat lots of dairy for the foreseeable future, you'll need the bone strength for what comes next.
>Rat waifur
You'll become the husband of a powerful rat warlady who will then share you with the female rats who have served her particularly well. Musk, lots of it.
>Hyena waifur
Even more musk and now with armpit licking. Be prepared to father an entire tribe. Also be prepared to wake up to your hyena waifur sporting a few new scars from fending off another band of horny yeens who wanted you for themselves.

>Snake waifur
Much bigger than you, has a cold front but if you look past it you'll find that she shows a great deal of love for you. Typically easy and slowgoing but if you get her aroused she'll pounce on you with surprising speed and determination. Won't let you go once she has you.

>So you do, following one of the paved walking paths that follows the coastline
>Your eyes are filled with beautiful feminine beach bodies, both human and anthro alike and the occasional guy getting entirely too much attention
>Thankfully, youve always stayed dedicated to being /fit/ so you dont look out of place here
>Debate posting a picture saying that "we're all gonna make it" on your favorite peruvian mineral manufacturing forum
>While your mind is preoccupied with those kinds of mundane thoughts, your feet are still carrying you forward
>You nodded absently in wordless greeting to a trio of women on rollerskates, one giraffe who towered over you and two humans
>You needed this. An escape from your hectic office job. Yeah, you were making money hand over fist but was it making you happy?
>No. But its easier to be sad in a big house--
>Your thoughts come to an abrupt end when you feel something sniffing your behind
>You look back thinking its probably an overly friendly dog
>It isnt.
>The giraffe woman is leaned over, her long neck extended to its limit as she's taking deep breaths of you.
>You tense up, at first shocked by this entirely alien situation
>You werent bad looking by any stretch of the imagination but if you wanted companionship, it was always you who had to make the first move
>You speed up, your head turned and glued on this rollerskating giraffe all the while as she speeds up to keep pace
>If youd been thinking at the moment, you wouldve just stepped off the pavement and youd get away easily
>You werent as you felt your heart to start thundering in your chest at this surreal situation and your flip flops making your escape attempt an ungainly waddling gait, more like a broken kite stuck in the wind than a clean sprint
>Your head is still turned as you begin to get some distance on her.
>Rollerskates be damned, she was not catching up to you.
>You shout out in exhiliration as she reaches out and says something
>She isnt looking directly at you anymore but whats in front of you
>You face forward just in time to scream out as you run full tilt into a tree. The trail pavement had bent around it like a wriggling worm
>After knocking yourself unconcious, you came to for only brief moments
>You felt her haul you onto her shoulder with surprising ease
>You heard her friends laughter as you dangled there, for all the world hardly any better than a bag of potatoes in that moment
>The last thing you remember is being flabberghasted and resentful as your impromptu stretcher had the gaul to cop a feel of your butt
>You woke up with a start. Immediately you tried to orientate yourself as you took in unfamilliar surroundings.
>The beeps of hospital machinery releasing the coiled tension in you and your whole body deflated as you unwound and relaxed back into the bed
>That was until the giraffe walked in, following a doctor who mustve come by to do the rounds on you
>The only plus was that he spoke surprisingly good english as he gave you a run down of what happened
>Youd been out for about half a day. Theyd done some test already and the only issue they found was your dehydration and the massive bump on your forehead. They wanted to hold onto you overnight and baring any unforseen circumstances, youd be discharged in the morning
>Not exactly the start to your vacation youd been expecting
>You reached up to gingerly touch your wound, wincing as you confirmed that it was indeed painful
>The giraffe woman had been waiting off to the side the entire time. She had a boquet of get well flowers in her hand as she scrunched over to avoid scraping her head against the ceiling
>You knew there were plus size anthro rooms but for a brief moment, you wondered what it would be like to be stuck in a world that wasnt built for your size.
>She wordlessly handed the boquet to you.
>You wondered if you were going to have to dig out that translation app you had downloaded on your phone
>Begrudgingly, you thanked her for the flowers
>She seemed to think that was you extending an olive branch and visibly relaxed when you addressed her directly
>"So." You start and she flinches. "What the hell was that all about?"
>Its clear she didnt understand a word you said.
>She fishes for her own phone and holds it up speaking into it for a moment.
>The robotic text to speech playing back the translation
>"I am sorry. I should have caught you sooner. Your waddling run was too cute."
>You felt yourself getting annoyed
Not "Im sorry for molesting and chasing you." No. She was sorry for enjoying the show and not nabbing you sooner. The implication that she thought she could catch you whenever she wanted wasnt lost on you.
>The throbbing that felt like it was right on your brain wasnt helping your patience either
>You motion for her to hand over the phone to translate what you were saying.
>After a moment's fiddling you figure it out. "You didnt answer my question." You adopt an icier tone. The one that made your team at the office sit up and pay attention during presentations "Why did you chase me to begin with?"
>She listens to the replay before answering.
>"You smell nice. And your beauty appeals to me greatly. I wished to know you better." The electronic voice informed me dispassionately.
>Right. Dogs sniffed each other in greeting. You didnt know many anthros, your residence and line of work keeping you separated as surely as any border fence would
>It wasnt impossible that giraffe anthros sniffed each other in greeting. Still...something about it seemed suspicious
>You didnt want to get involved any further
>You did the back and forth with her phone again. You accepted her apology, for whatever it was worth, and tried to wash your hands of the matter
>She, however, had other ideas. Insisting to make up by inviting you out to dinner. You pointed out you didnt even know her name
>She quickly rectified that by informing you her name was Marie and she was Ivorian born, as in the Ivory Coast or Côte d'Ivoire as she had said
>You didnt even know that was an actual country until she just told you
>Feeling a little more ignorant than you shouldve, you told her you were Anon born in Georgia and living in D.C.
>She thought you meant the country and not the state until you corrected her
>Shouldve just said you were American, it wouldve been easier
>Having to share a device to speak to one another couldve been a source of frustration but it quickly became a source of intimacy instead
>Having to listen to someone's intonation and then parse what they were saying was something you'd never done before. And that was probably true for Marie as well.
>The dispassionate electronic voice failing her french flirting in spectacular fashion and so she opted to take a different rlute with you
>Body language.
>She had been sitting on the actual floor and was still above eye level with you. She rested her head next to your shoulder, giving you bedroom eyes as you spoke into the phone, answering her questions or thanking her for the compliments she was generously throwing your way and doling out your own
>She was a looker afterall. And you'd seen just how curvy her body actually was in the foggy, now almost forgotten memory of your first encounter.
>She was just so...long. Long neck. Long torso. Long legs. Your lower head was already attempting to math out the geometry of how it would work out.
>In the mean time, her hands would linger a little longer on yours as you passed the phone back
>That escalated into more careful, chaste and exploratory touches
>You ran your fingers down her long neck, her spotted fur surprisingly smooth and soft.
>For some reason you were under the impression that it wouldve been coarse
>You explored spots that even she had trouble getting to without the aid of tools like long handled brushes and she reveled in your "soft, petal like touches" if the translation was accurate.
>And soon, you discovered how long her tongue was when you kissed
>It had started with a peck but now, she had the entire length of that wet prehensile ribbon of muscle down your throat
>Your own, flatter tongue was hopelessly outmatched but youve always been stubborn in your own way. Stubborn enough to run face first into a tree at least and so even as she dominated the insides of your mouth and coiled around your own tongue with all the surety of constrictor squeezing the last gasp from its prey, you moved. Pressing your lips harder. Wiggling your tongue free to keep up the fight the moment she slackened.
>You didnt need to come up for air. Somehow demanding that she drown you in her affections and she was all too willing to oblige.
>Her taste was as sacchrine sweet as the act itself. Some sort of fruity drink lingering in her mouth.
>Between that, your lingering concussion and the definite lack of oxygen and you were feeling like your whole body was tipsy.
>Your drunk and dumb fingers still drawing sensual shivers as they traced over sensitive spots
>Even with your eyes closed you began to feel the edges of your vision begin to darken and your eyes to swim
>But she refused to break the lock you had put yourself into.
>You would not be released until you passed out or she was satisfied
>Stubbornly, you held on. You could tell just how much she was enjoying this.
>Your whole body began to vibrate. Your lungs and their demands no longer ignorable.
>Soon they started to all but scream for relief.
>And finally, as tears started to form in your eyes and your struggle seemed to slow, you felt her tongue withdraw from the depths of you
>You heaved in one large breath after another as she changed positions, awkwardly on her knees, she was tall enough for her bossom to be in line with your head
>It couldnt have been comfortable for her but she pulled you towards her chest and repeated the same words over and over.
> "respire" you think she said
>Finally back in control of yourself, you began to appreciate how large her breast were
>Proportionally, they were a tasteful size on her body. Not so small as to be flat, but not so large as to be competing with her other assets
>Being directly between them gave you a fresh understanding of perspective as each globe was in actuality the size of your head.
>With your passionate kiss broken, both of you firmly became aware of your manhood straining against the hospital blanket
>There was something about her demeanor that seemed to change as she locked in on your meat.
>It was...predatory.
>Thats right. Thats exactly how her behavior could be described.
>Before you could get a word in edgewise, she had already pulled the blanket aside.
>Your penis a furnace against the bitter cold they kept the hospital at.
>She was already extending her neck. Like when she chased you, she was taking deep whiffs as she buried her nose into your crotch
>You froze in place when you felt an exploratory lick across the head of your dick
>Fuck. That felt good. You'd cum in no time if she really decided to get to work.
>You werent some semen retention proselytizer but it had been awhile since you'd catered to those specific needs and now with a womans faced buried in your crotch and huffing your balls it was at the forefront of your mind.
>Still you were a gentleman first and asked about her knees. No way was cold hard tile being kind to her fine legs.
>She stopped, the trance your musk had put her in was temporarily broken.
>She glanced at the time and then the door before seemingly making up her mind.
>She shimmied out of the shorts she'd been wearing as you seared the image into your mind
>You'd always been a legs man instead of just tits or ass and she had them for days.
>Just that tantalizing little show had put you on edge already and when she straddled your bed, bringing her sex directly in line with your face, you couldve cum from that
>She said something in french but you didnt need a translator for what she wanted as she pressed herself down onto your face.
>You always figured anthros would have strange and exotic genitals but everything was basically where it was supposed to be so maybe that wasnt the case. Or maybe Marie was the exception. Not that it mattered.
>You eagerly lapped at her sex but it took you a moment to find a comfortable way to bring your fingers into the action.
>Before long she was pressing down on you with more weight. The knot on your forehead a forgotten concern as she sought out more pleasure from you.
>You felt her go back to huffing you in.
>Now that you were already giving her head, the larger of your two brains was trying to do the math om what sex would be like with her.
>She was just so big. You had pride on your own size but you couldnt help but wonder if you could ever possibly satisfy a woman like this.
>Until you stuck a finger to the knuckle in her
>You heard a low groan and felt that damp wet tightness squeeze and massage at your digit.
>That expelled all doubts for you.
>You continued to lavish her with minstrations from your tongue. Taking extra care to swirl and roll her clit before expertly retreating when the sensations started to become overwhelming and transform away from pleasure.
>She still hadnt touched you beyond the occasional lick and her breath tickling and tightening your balls. Seemingly content to just breathe you in. It was torture.
>You wanted her so badly, it was all that could occupy your mind now. Perhaps you werent any better than her afterall. You were practically ravenous for a release that wasnt coming.
>Seconds turned into minutes and minutes into hours as time continued to march past.
>Not that you were aware of that. All you knew was that your tongue was tired, your jaw hurt and based on the way she tensed and trembled youd given her more than one orgasm
>Your stubborn side was starting to rear its head again. You wouldnt quit before she did.
>That was until she rose from her position
>You thought visiting hours mightve been just about done as regret sunk into your core.
>She faced towards you now. Thinking she wanted to kiss again, you started to sit up.
>She pushed you back down into the bed hard enough to take the wind out of you with an oomph.
>Grabbing your legs, she pushed them towards your head, giving you an involuntary stretch you werent quite ready for.
>You knew what this was. Some sort of amazon position you'd seen in porn before. You coulnt get your protest out fast enough as she used her long neck and tongue in a stunning display of flexibility to grab your dick and angle it proudly towards the ceiling where she proceeded to impale herself on it
>The sudden jolt of pure pleasure mixed with the pain of being stretched, unexpectedly manhandled and having your thighs serve as a cushion for the pushin as she used the springs of the bed to bounce you into her was euphoric
>You'd been craving this since that first kiss. No. Youre a liar. Some part of you had wanted this since you saw her skating past you.
>And now in a strange turn of fate, she was utilizing all her natural gifts to be the one jackhammering you into the bed
>Grabbing fistfuls of white bedding and holding on while this storm rode you was all you could do.
>The inexoriable buildup happened whether you wanted it to or not. There was part of you that was drinking all this in and wanted the moment to last forever. Another part wanted you to flood her womb white and fulfill a primal need to breed a fine woman.
>A quiet part of you though, wondered how and why you were being fucked senseless by a giraffee woman youd known for less than a couple of hours.
>Even as you desperately desired to race to the finish line, you didnt want to deal with the aftermath of reaching there.
>It wasnt like you had any choice in the matter anyways. Marie was dedicated to the task at hand and your cock practically pulsed in time with your heart beat.
>Your orgasm came not like a breaking dam but like a thunderbolt from a blue sky. It tore through you in an instant and you could feel her pistoning even harder as your groans escaped your lips and your ejaculate erupted inside her.
>You felt her convulse around your shaft, and a sudden wettness clued you in on the fact that she had just squirted as you came.
>Slowly she let your legs down back onto the bed to rest. Your semi-hard cock dragging a few more delicious sensations from you as it was freed from her grasp
>You were breathless, exhausted and covered in a myriad of fluids. It took you a moment to collect yourself
>Marie let herself fall on top of you. Careful to not hit you with all her weight. The bed creaked as it supported both of you.
>You both stayed like that for a moment. No words spoken. No need for assurances, quick exits or awkward goodbyes. Simply comfortable in one another's presence.
>Absently you stroked her neck again. Her fur was slick with a slight lather from the exertion.
>Visitation hours had to be almost over now. You wondered if youd ever see her again now that she'd gotten what she wanted.
>You were worried that you wouldnt. Youd started this strange relationship completely wrong. First with an accident and then with sex but that stubborn you, the country boy that had made it big, wasnt ready to give up yet.
>You watched her go into the restroom to dress. She came out with a towel to wipe you down as well. She was careful like she was polishing a marble statue.
>You grabbed her hand and decide to make a joke of it if only to hide your own vulnerability. "Usually, I get dinner first..." you start but you fall silent when you realize she doesnt understand a word you said
>Your expression might not have been the best when she quickly fished for her phone and opened the app again
>"Whats wrong?" She asked.
>"Will I see you again?" You ask back
>She pulls you into an embrace, wrapping her long neck around you in the process. It also reminds you just how much stronger she is than you, despite how many hours youve put into being aesthetic.
>"Oui."
>You know that one at least. Along with je m'appelle and omelette du fromage which made up your entire French lexicon. But you were determined to learn more.
>She said something else into the phone. This time particularly emphatically.
>The electronic voice relays the words to you, unconcerned about it's owners emotions.
>"From when I first saw you, I had decided you were mine."
>You press yourself harder into her. You werent sure if this was love or just something crazy but you were looking forward to finding out.
>You take her phone and speak into it "About that date...."

>anthros usually enter puberty faster than humans, girls being fastest

>she’s extremely pissed off by this
>she starts getting a little snotty in private, then she starts to lampoon you in front of your friends
>it gets to the point where she’s doing it constantly
>day in and day out, in class and at home, she picks at you
>you start to doubt your and her friendship, she was never like this before
>her birthday is coming up though, and despite misgivings you decide to be true to all those years of friendship
>you arrive on time, and you’re greeted by her mother, who’s ecstatic to see you
>she brings you into the living room, and gives you a little party hat
>your friend comes in quickly after
>she’s still not normal, picking at you and the little hat you rode in with
>you take the hits and hide your irritation, you give her her present, and join in with other guests
>by the time the party’s waning you start to walk out the door
>”Anon, wait!”
>her mother stops you before you can take off
>she tells you about the afterparty, the sleepover, and that you’re invited
>you sigh and agree, expecting to give it another hour before sneaking back home
>you open the door to her bedroom, expecting to see a couple other anthros hanging out
>there’s no one there
>before you can even turn around, someone’s grabbed you from behind
>whoever’s pressed up against your back is intensely hot, as if a furnace had just arrested you
>judging by the two soft pads of plush fat, it’s probably an anthro, and a woman too
>she’s feeling you up, hands either rolling up or down your body, searching for your sensitive spots
>”I’ve waited for this since my last birthday.” Her breath is hot.
>”Hope you liked the carrot cake. You’re gonna need the calories.”

>Be asked to slay a dragon
>Find her cave and charge in, ready to fight or die for your king
>The dragon is a fuckhuge nerd with braces and glasses in every sense of the word
>Almost get knocked out by her smell, stopping you in your tracks
>"Oh boy, a knight from the human kingdom, they are so rare these days!"
>She picks you up and grins
>"I have a special place for you."
>She turns around and you find a jar labelled "human knight"
>"Don't worry, I will make sure there isn't too much. I can't have a rare knight like you drowning."

Why are anthros so obsessed with you eating their produce?

You think they're really gonna let you drink/eat some other hussy's inferior produce?
>cows not letting you drink any milk but their own
>no other eggs beside your chicken gf/wife's
>sheep/alpacas making you wear clothes only from their wool

>”Thank you! I can be quite a expressive type” my son blush
>The chubby fox grabbed a big chocolate cupcake and shove a WHOLE piece in her mouth, “Now… *burp* exactly, what is your specialty, lil cutie?” She said with a hint of seduce in her lips

>I looked on one side, a ugly wrinkly rat women smiling creepily at my human son as she lick her lips like he’s nothing but a lollipop for her aging gums to suck on her disgusting mouth!
>The other side is a young Horse women, tallest of the bunch, muscular of the bunch, and devious of the bunch

>a forked tongue flicks out from behind her teeth
>"So cute!"
>the demoness straightens out, clasping her paws together and bouncing in place

>"Oh! Did you want out? Here, release!"
>she cuts the air with a claw, and you fall out of the summoning circle

>"Come back here hon, I wasn't done!"
>you find your body turning around and marching you back to the rat

>"I know you're excited and all, but first things first!"
>she reaches down toward your neck
>oversized paw easily wrapping around it
>in spite of your terror, you find the silky fur strangely comforting as it slides over your neck
>when she retracts her paw, you have a collar around your neck
>"There!"
>the collar is supple black leather, with a golden loop on the front
>dangling from the loop is a silver bell that jingles softly

>you finish with a few final spurts, soaked in sweat and more as you lay in a puddle on your study's stone floor
>"Good boy!"
>Kar'nassa beams down at you like you had brought her a toy
>and not just had the most mind-melting orgasm of your life
>"Now speak!"
>your voice comes out in a low moan
"What's going on?"
>the firelight in her eyes flicker as the demoness gasps
>"Oh! Oh no! Did you not--Do you not know what you did?"
>you shake your head miserably
>Kar'nassa gasps again
>"Oh no! Poor thing! Poor little human boy!"
>you're pulled into her lap as she sits down on the floor with you
>her arms go around your midsection and she holds you to her body
>your head nestled between her breasts
>"Oh and you're such a mess."
>Kar'nassa waves her paw over you, and with a tingling sensation, your stained robes and breeches disappear
>leaving you totally naked for her paws to trace over your bare skin
>and for you to feel the infernal heat of her body wrapped around yours
>it's more a comforting warmth
>you open your mouth and find yourself still able to speak
"What happened? What did I do?"
>Kar'nassa coos and starts to pet your head
>those claws looked like they could shred you
>but they feel so good scratching through your hair
>"You summoned me to be your master, sweetie-kins. The rune of servitude made it so you listen to my every command, and the rune of submission made it so you'll love serving me with all your heart."
>you groan
"Oh gods. How could I have done this?"
>Kar'nassa's arms go around you again and start squeezing you
>"Oh no, baby, please don't cry. I'm not a mean demon. I'm gonna take such good care of you. Everything is going to be okay, alright?"
>you blink away tears and find yourself somehow believing her
>Kar'nassa is going to take good care of you
>wait
>that's not right
"C-Can't you let me go?"
>you get another squeeze that drives the air from your lungs
>"No pookie! You're way too cute to let you go! What if you mess up again, and a nasty evil demon takes you?"
>your attempt to protest is shushed by a giant finger pressed against your lip
>"Besides. The rune of binding binds your soul to mine eternally. I couldn't let you go even if I wanted to."
>eternally?
>you tremble in spite of Kar'nassa's comforting embrace
>she seems to notice
>"Oh please don't be sad. I promise, you'll love your new home, I have a beautiful palace, and you can sleep in my bed, and I'll feed you and walk you and..."
>the embrace around you loosens
>one of the arms reaching down to start teasing your cock to life once again
>"...and I think I know how to cheer you up again."
>her other paw disappears
>and with a 'click' her bra falls off her chest
>"Lay down for me baby."
>you don't have a choice
>letting Kar'nassa lay you down on your back as she simply magics away the rest of her clothes
>you're surprised to see her nipples aren't pitch black
>but rather one is pink and the other a warm brown

>the same pink as her pussy that grinds against your hardening cock
>she smiles down at you
>"Okay my good boy, ready for your next command?"
>you whimper
"Y-yes."
>Kar'nassa grins wide, guiding your hands to her hips and lowering herself down to engulf your head in her breasts once again
>you feel her speak the next command as much as hear it
>your tip prodding her entrance as she wiggles her hips teasingly

>The first thing that catches your eye is their figures
>They each have breasts bigger than your head, you could probably be smothered under them
>They have well toned abs, visible even through their fur

>You yell into your gag, trying to beg for mercy
>The wolf women snicker and laugh at your struggles
>The tallest one in the middle walks up to you, you assume her to be the pack leader
>”Relax, human. We will not hurt you, unless you make us.”
>You shiver as she flashes her teeth and licks her chops
>She turns around to the other two wolves and barks a command at them in her tribal language
>The other two wolfesses walk towards you; you try and squirm away but they easily overpower you
>Surprisingly, they take off your gag and untie your restraints
>You take this as an opportunity to make a run for it, so you immediately get up and dart past the leader
>Unfortunately, she grabs you by the hair and sends you flying across the ground, knocking the wind out of you
>”Trying to escape your punishment, human?”

>The leader suddenly howls into the air, interrupting your protests
>Once her howl settles, she looks at you with a growl
>”You trespassed our lands! It does not matter what intentions you had planned, no human is allowed on our lands!”
>She barks another command at the two other wolf women, who flip you over on your stomach and hold you down by your arms
“No! Please, I’m sorry! I’ll do anything!”
>The leader chuckles as she steps closer to you
>”I love it when they beg. Now human…”
>She grabs your thighs and lifts them up, leaving your rump up in the air
>The leader leans her snout in, and you shiver when you feel her nose pressed up against your asshole
>You tense up when she flicks her tongue out and drags it along your entire asshole
“Ahhh! P-Please, stop! That–ow!”
>You yelp when she sticks her tongue through your hole and inside you
>Tears start streaming down your cheeks as she circles her tongue around your insides
>Eventually, she reaches a certain spot that makes you moan loudly
>The leader lightly clamps her teeth down on your ass and uses her tongue to gently rub your sweet spot and thrust her tongue in and out of your asshole
>You start to feel a pressure building in your groin as you moan and cry
“Please, s-stop! Ahhh, that–oh, God!”
>You hate this, but some sick, twisted part of you deep down inside you really likes this and wants her to keep going
>Fortunately, she retracts her tongue out of your asshole, and lets go of you, leaving you limp on the ground
>She tells the other two something in her tribal language; they flip you over onto your back as you catch your breath
>They leave you as they lay down near your groin, their breasts dangerously close to your hard, leaking rod
>The leader walks towards your head, turning herself around and showing off her extra large rump, each gray cheek bigger than your head
>You’re greeted by the sight of her pussy and asshole, catching a whiff of her intoxicating scent
>You try to back away, but the two wolves on your groin hold down your legs
>The leader holds down your torso to keep you from squirming too far
>She sways her ass from left to right, presumably to spread more of her natural pheromones into the air
>It makes you slightly dizzy
>”Now then, human…”
>She then sits down hard, engulfing your entire head into her fluffy cheeks
>”Enjoy the taste of an alpha.”
>Her pussy lands squarely on your lips, coating it in her sticky juices
>Some of it dribbles into your mouth
>You don’t want to taste her, this is wrong
>But her scent is starting to have an effect on your brain
>As if unwillingly, you stick your tongue out and get a taste of her pussy
>It’s oddly sweet with a coppery aftertaste
>”That’s it, human. Even those with the strongest minds succumb to the scent of an alpha.”
>The alpha gives another command to her underlings, and they quickly get to work
>You feel a pair of soft, furry mounds squish on either side of your cock, causing you to instantly buck your hips
>You hear girlish giggles as their soft tits mash against your cock
>They start moving their boobs up and down, up and down, getting more pleasure out of you
>You lick the alpha’s pussy with more vigor, sticking your tongue deep into her folds
>You take a deep inhale of her asshole, filling your lungs with more of her musk
>The two wolves on your crotch mash their tits against each other, choking your dick in a fleshy, fuzzy prison
>You feel their rock hard nipples graze along your shaft, making you moan and buck your hips
>The alpha above you grunts as you continue eating her out, her claws digging into your ribs
>You yelp and grab at her cheeks to try and warn her to not scratch you, but she does so anyway, leaving trails of blood along your ribs
>You let out a muffled scream of pain and slap at her ass, but she keeps herself still, chuckling and wiggling her hips deeper onto you
>”What’s wrong, human? Can’t take a little pain? Keep tasting!”
>Despite the stinging pain on your chest, the wolves at your groin keep you pleasured, causing a strange mix of emotions
>You moan loudly when they lean in and start licking your tip, barely poking out from between their boobs
>You buck your hips hard as they overstimulate your leaking rod
>Your pleasure continues to build, the scent of the alpha, the soft fleshy tits on your shaft, the licks on your tip, it’s all too much
>Eventually, you explode, coating the wolves’ tits in your sticky seed
>The alpha above you sighs, and lifts herself up off of you, leaving a trail of her sticky juices connected to your mouth
>She speaks to her underlings who get off your now limp rod
>You try to back away, but the underlings grab your arms and hold you down
>The alpha squats over your dick and holds it in her hand, lightly stroking it back to full mast
“Please…Let me go.”
>The alpha laughs as she watches tears fall down your cheeks
>”Once we have mated, you will become part of our tribe.”
>She then lowers her lips onto your dick, you moan and cry as your dick enters her pussy
>She starts riding you, slamming her hips up and down on you
>You buck instinctively, but she’s way too heavy to let your hips go anywhere
>Her tight walls clench around your dick, you feel like she’s squeezing it flat
“Ahh, please, stop! No–mmph!”
>One of the wolves on your side silences your protests as she grabs your head and forces her tongue into your mouth
>You try to back away, but she puts her paw on the back of your head and pushes you against her
>Your eyes roll in the back of your head as her tongue travels down your throat, triggering your gag reflex
>The other wolf leans in to nibble at your ear, whispering sweet nothings in her tribal language
>It doesn’t help comfort you, especially when you’re being raped by a wolfess twice your size
>You moan into the wolf’s mouth as the alpha slams her hips hard onto you
>”Fill me, human. Fill me with your seed. Give in.”
>You try your best to not cum, but the tight, wet walls of the alpha are impossible to resist
>Your pleasure reaches a peak, and you fill the alpha’s womb with your cum
>You let out a muffled moan as the alpha’s pussy tightly clenches on your dick, squeezing more seed out of you
>She doesn’t moan when she cums, instead she grunts as her juices squirt on your waist
>The alpha lifts herself off of you, and her underlings move away from you
>You want to escape, but you’re too exhausted to move
>You feel your eyes grow heavy, and you close them
>But just as you’re about to doze off, you feel one of the wolves grab your mouth and force your jaw open
>Your eyes grow wide as the alpha holds a bowl and pours some sort of honey-like liquid into your mouth
>You try to spit it out, but she quickly covers your mouth and holds her claws dangerously close to your neck, grazing your skin as she growls
>”Swallow.”
>You reluctantly take a big gulp, letting the thick substance travel down your throat
>You look over to the side as a big, chubbier wolfess enters the tipi, followed by a few more wolves
>You’re starting to feel funny, whatever they made you swallow it’s already taken effect
>Your dick grows painfully hard, you groan as it grows a few inches beyond its normal size
>You try to move, but you find all your limbs lying uselessly
>The alpha stands over you as you lie there completely limp
>”You’re going to spend the night mating with our tribe, human.”
>You open your mouth to speak, but the chubby wolfess suddenly stands over you and squats her fat ass down near your face
>You catch a whiff of her musk, but for some reason, it makes you feel…really horny
>She giggles as she wiggles her ass side to side
>You buck your head into her ass, feeling those super soft pillows squish into your face
>The wolfess lets out a gasp of surprise as she coos something in her tribal language before she settles her ass down on your face
>Her asshole lands on your mouth, and you quickly get to work by slathering your tongue all over her pucker
>You feel another wolfess on your groin, teasing you by blowing air on your rock-hard dick
>You moan loudly into the wolfess’s asshole as your dick throbs
>It’s going to be a long night…

>the door to the recruitment office swings open
>three pairs of eyes stare at you in mild shock
>a wolf, a tigress, and a rat, all three in uniform, look at you from their desks as if you had wandered unannounced into the back room of a business
>the soldier closest to you, the rat, has the good grace not to open with "are you lost?"
>"Good morning, how can we help you?"
>you pull a letter from your pocket and unfold it
>the official of the Anthrostate Armed forces on the top of the page
"Yeah, I hope so. I got this letter saying I had to report for mandatory duty? But that can't be right."
>the rat looks perplexed as she takes the paper
>the wolf and tigress have gone back to their own busywork in the background
>"You're right, this shouldn't..."
>the rat peers at the paper and starts typing on her keyboard
>then her eyes widen
>"This is correct, sir. You've been selected for civil service. I'll arrange transportation immediately."
>you flap your mouth for a few seconds
>not comprehending
"That's wrong. Humans aren't eligible for military service."
>but the rat has already risen from her chair and skittered off to the back of the office
>you hear what sounds like a very animated phone call coming from the back
>when she comes back, it's with a stern look on her face
>"Please take a seat, sir."
>you step back from her desk
"Wait a minute, no way I'm--"
>you freeze
>the other two soldiers have risen from their desks
>the rat looks ready to jump up and restrain you
>"Take a seat, sir."
>you sigh, defeated, and sit down on one of the waiting room chairs
>it's not long before a car with military plates rolls up outside and a doberman, also in uniform
>the soldiers in the recruiting office all stand and salute when she walks in
>the doberman returns the salute
>"At ease. This the one?"
>the rat returns to sitting at her desk
>"Yes ma'am."
>the doberman looks at you with a similar stern expression
>"Come with me."
>you rise meekly and follow the officer out the door
>she opens the door on the SUV for you, and swings it shut behind you
>you ride in silent uncertainty about your future
>what's going to happen to you?
>are they going to send you to fight?
>you didn't think the anthrostate was even at war!
>scary thoughts about being shot or maybe stabbed in combat run through your mind the entire trip
>until the SUV rolls through the front gate of some kind of army base
>and the officer speaks up
>"Okay. Here's the basics. Three square meals, health and wellness checks every week, be sure to stay hydrated."
>she pulls to a stop in front of a long, squat, brick building with a single door in the front
>"Alright. Here you go. Term of service ends in two months."
>the doberman woman leans over you to open the door
>you blink
"That's it? Don't I get any training?"
>the officer snorts
>"They'll do most of the work."
>you're pushed out of the car, none too gently, to stumble onto your feet outside the barracks
>you just catch the officer muttering as she slams the car door closed behind you
>"Lucky bitches."
>the SUV roars off and you're left standing in front of a barracks
>alone
>you look around, but this whole area seems abandoned
>not another soul
>you reach out to the barracks door and slowly open it
>letting daylight speed into a large barracks room that's in almost pitch black
>a half-dozen pair of eyes shine back at you from the dark
"Uh...wrong roo--"
>you don't even finish your lame excuse before the front of your shirt is grabbed and your dragged into the dark room
>it reeks of musk
>there are paws all over you
>groping
>grabbing
>clawing
>you can't keep track of them all
>only the feeling of rough paws desperate to reach every inch of you
>suddenly there's a cold, wet nose on your ear
>"About fucking time! I NEED something to fuck!"
>the cold nose is replaced with a hot tongue
>then sharp teeth
>she bites your ear hard enough to draw blood
>you cry out in pain
>and to your relief someone responds
>a husky voice, trembling with some unseen effort
>”Sergeant!”
>the paws around your shoulders release
>the presence behind you retreats into the darkness
>the other paws exploring your body freeze, expecting further reprobation
>it comes with a harsh bark
>”The rest of you, atten-SHUN!”

"It's heat season. I took health class, ma'am."
>there's a rash snickers from the soldiers

>"Fffuck, good human."
>she takes a deep breath, managing to regain her officer's tone for a moment
>"I should be looking after the women under my command, but given the circumstances..."
>her body shifts, hips raising enough for that heat to be pressed against the tip of your cock
>"...I'm taking what's mine."
>the colonel drops her weight
>you're engulfed, feeling the burning hot walls of a heat-ravaged pussy
>she quivers
>claws digging through your hair

Masquerade parties among anthros would be so very different. There's so much more identifying them than just their face; their scent, their markings, tails, etc. All unique things that act as instant identifiers. Not at all like humans who can hide/obscure their face and suddenly they're next to anonymous. For anthros it would have to be an atmosphere of playing pretend, like "We all know who everyone is, but we're wearing the masks to pretend like we don't." It'd be a social exercise in What Would It Be Like To Be Anonymous? Because I doubt anthros would really _know_ anonymity socially due to all those cues.
Just some thoughts I wanted to share.

>Anthro going about her day as usual, nothing out of the ordinary
>Suddenly picks up a familiar scent
>Follows it to a human guy
>Immediately realises it's the guy she's met at those parties she's been too
>This guy has been her plaything for the last few weeks and now she finally sees him without a mask in public for the first time
>He's unaware who this random Anthro is
>He's in danger

>Early morning light filters through the curtains
>It wakes you into what may as well be a dream
>As you stir, two things come to your awareness first: the presence of the wolfess beside you, and the collar around your neck
>Exactly as you fell asleep, face to face with your wife
>You shift slightly, pressing yourself into the warmth of her fur
>You're not much shorter than her, but in bed, it feels different
>Nestled under her chin, wrapped in her embrace, you feel much smaller
>Her strong, yet gentle arms encircle you, pulling you closer
>You shut your eyes back up, tight, and bask in the sensation
>With one hand you hold her
>With the other you begin to explore her familiar curves, drinking in the feeling of her softness
>Burrowing your nose against her neck fluff you take a deep sniff of her fur, breathing out with a soft "mmm."
>A comforting scent surrounds you, a mix of earthy, musky, tones and a hint of lavender from her fur shampoo
>The scent of a real woman, a scent that inspired your complete obedience
>Her black lips nuzzle against your forehead, letting you know that she's awake
>You turn your head up to meet her kiss, her breath mingling with yours for just a moment
>Then once again you bury yourself back into her neck fluff
>You press every part of yourself into her, feeling her heartbeat, the rise and fall of her breath
>Your legs and hers weave between each other, her soft fur caressing your bare skin
>Even after so long together, it still makes your heart beat a heavy rhythm when being so close to her
>The leather at your neck is warm against your skin, a familiar and comforting tightness
>It feels like an extension of her embrace, a constant reminder of her ownership
>The two of you freeze like that for a long time, pressing into eachother
>Moving seems impossible
>As if breaking this embrace would shatter the spell of warmth and comfort, and you would not be able to return to it
>Eventually the wolfess whispers to you, "half past seven"
>A satisfied growl shudders through her body, reverberating through your chest, a growl that makes you pull yourself even more tightly against her
>"We're not getting up until ten"

>ywn be a poke trainer who's big lopunny's "good little boy"
>smothered under 400 lbs of pokebunny muscle meat every night after making camp
>going pro league just to spend the winnings on rare candy lollipops for her and max heals for your hips
>my pokemon journey consists of watching people get broken in two and getting nearly broken in two
>dynamaxxing is out of the question holy shit
>a foolhardy ratatta girl gets mondo stomped the moment she leaves the tall grass by a bun 90 levels her senior
>type advantage gets btfo by a pokerabbit fist the size of your head
>saw lopunny sock the shit out of a legendary, funniest shit I've ever seen

>"massage parlor" that only caters to anthro women
>you need the money and they pay well
>but you didn't realize it was that type of massage parlor
>every client you get just wants you to massage them long enough to get in the mood, then go down on them
>you spend basically 8 hours a day with your tongue buried in anthro pussy
>and the clientele is very varied
>wolves, hyenas, lionesses, foxes, dogs, cats, bunnies, deer, horses
>sharks of all shapes and sizes
>avian cloaca
>some of them come in once or twice out of curiousity, but most are regulars
>and you're very popular. boss is asking you to work more hours
>you smell like a zoo 24/7
>strange anthro ladies cat call and wolf whistle at you
>what few human women you knew are not in your life any more
>your landlady, a fox, has started giving you weird looks when she comes to collect your rent
>worst of all though
>you're starting to enjoy it

what kind of medieval/classical waifurs do you guys think would make for good ADHG stuff?
So far I've got
>bandit leader/warlord/raider (spoils of war)
>foreign monarch (married off)
Those are pretty well travelled but you can also have
>adventuring party fighter (you are her squire/healslave)
>not!skaven sneaker (you are kidnapped for breeding/schemes)

>Forces you to do all the chores
>Refuses to shower more than once a week
>Doesn't even pay her share of the rent most months
But you're still going to beg to taste her pussy anyway

Virgins for Christ Cruise with an Italian captain, we capsized on a known maritime hazard. We was comin' back from the island of Aruba to Saint Lucia, just dropped off a bunch of missionaries. Unwed Female missionaries. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen-footer. You know how you know that when you're in the water? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... was our guido captain had been so incompetent, no distress signal had been sent.
They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. Y'know, it's... kinda like shy girls at a party, the idea was, shark comes to the nearest man and that man, he'd start flailin' and hollerin', and sometimes the shark'd go away... sometimes she wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, she wraps herself around ya. Right between her thighs.
"Y'know the thing about a shark, she's got... powerful thighs, thick thighs, like a PAWG thighs. When she comes at ya, doesn't seem to be nothin'... until she mount's ya. And those thick thighs squeeze ya, and then... oh, then you hear that terrible high-pitch moanin', yer face turns red, and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin', how tight she is, how wet...she'll fuck you to pieces"
Y'know, by the end of that first dawn... they'd raped about a hundred men. I dunno how many sharks. Maybe a dozen? I dunno how many men, they averaged, six an hour? On Thursday mornin', I bumped into a friend of mine, Ned Carter from Utah- savin' himself for marriage. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up... he moaned like a little bitch. Well... he was getting sucked off below the water.
Coast guard showed up to rescue us. Y'know, that was the time I was most frightened, waitin' for my turn. Eleven hundred virgins went into the water, three hundred sixteen men come out, and the sharks took the rest.

>japanese otter yokai
>like pranking humans mostly harmless stuff like calling out people's names in crowds/mimicing people's voices or turning off lanterns in the middle of the night on people
>also really like getting drunk on sake with humans

>synth wife edited her conf and accidentally added two zeros to the desire.breed value
>after 7 hours, some moderate bruising and 2 litres of orange juice you manage to cuff her to the oven with those pink fuzzy cuffs she used to use on you

>the guy has talked you through the process of SSHing into your wife apparently you just need to press the WPS button first
> he was starting to explain how to roll back her configuration weights when the call cuts off
>your wife's hand is pressed down on the receiver cradle of your novelty rotary VOIP phone
>she isn't wearing the cuffs any more
>in point of fact she isn't wearing the arm that those cuffs were attached to either
>where did he say that button was again?

I sometimes like to imagine how the gender roles are reversed and I can’t help but think of scenarios like this
>A anthro women draw themselves as big, big breasted, muscular anthro women with a cute young anime humie boi wearing revealing clothes with a big bulge on his underwear
>Anthro women who’s a perverted loser who got transported in a world where magical humie bois roam the place and they treat her like she’s the chosen one and she takes advantage of the hero’s role just to get into their pants

We can spit roll some lil’ prompts to make it more interesting.
>Having to hear your anthro daughter complaining about your human son hogging up the tv because he wants to watch his ‘boy shows’ about magical human boys
>Having to be flirted by some chubby yet confident rat women as she placed her arm around your shoulder as she takes a fat inhale from her cigar and giggle after letting her undress you like a gentlegal she is
>Having a big tough doberman wife as she fixes the houses with her strengths and give her a kiss on the lips on her doggy lips for being a good wife and reward her with a big dish you cooked for her
>Be a house husband and see your bear wife in a nice suit coming from a stressful business work but gives her a kiss and take her to the couch and see her taking off the suit and finally letting her big tummy let go and making a nice relaxed moan

goofy ideas
>humans have no magic but demons/spirits/elementals/etc will lend their power by being summons in exchange for sexual favors from human guys
>human mages lose their power if their virginity is taken and anthros can steal their magic by fucking them
>human gods are super petty and revoke powers from humans that sleep with beast women
>anthro witches/mages/etc finding out human semen super charges magic shenanigans ensue

>take her on a date to the beach.
>get her into the water.
>anon uses his masculine wiles to convince her into the public showers with him
>Anon aggressively scrubs her cooch with a whole bottle of shampoo as "foreplay"

>The Hypocrite
>In the future, new types of creatures emerged and started integrating into the human world.
> Anthropomorphic animals or just Anthros, their numbers started to increase after legalizing Interspecies Marriage.
> That caused a big controversy in the political world, some started asking if they should give the anthros other human rights, should they let them vote or practice politics just like humans.
>Orson was the face of the anti-interspecies marriage movement, a young Human conservative spokesman, and the host of the show "All Humans!" and was famous for his loud and honest rants.
>he was invited to debate other pro-interspecies marriage guests.
> The show started and the host presented the guests, Elena a large anthro tigress who was one of the first anthro to get her own show "How to Anthro with Elena", the crowd clapped and cheered for her.
> The host then Presented Orson, the crowd booed him and even insulted him until the host told them to stop.
> The interview started and both of the guests gave their perspectives on Interspecies marriage with every minute the views increased and the debate became more heated.
>"So," Elena started,"what's your problem with people marrying Anthros?"
>Orson who got really heated by the conversation and by the crowd booing him, "I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORCE ME TO ACCEPT YOUR FETISH AS A LEGITIMATE MATRIMONY, MARRIAGE IS A SACRED AND YOU PEOPLE MAKE IT FEEL LIKE JUST ABOUT HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS, LET ME SAY IT REALLY SLOWLY FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND, I'M NOT AGAINST AN ANTHRO MARRYING AN ANTHRO AND A HUMAN MARRYING ANOTHER HUMAN, BUT AN ANTHRO MARRYING A HUMAN? NO THAT'S UNNATURAL!"
> The crowd gasped in disbelief and then started booing even louder.
>"And we will end our show here, thanks for watching," the host said and ended the show.
>Orson froze in his place and then got out of the studio before anything bad could happen to him.
> Hours later, Orson entered his house and just sat down in the couch, thinking and analyzing all that happened in the interview today.
>"Oh god!" he said to himself.
>"Tough day hon?" a sound said from the bathroom.
>"Yeah i did that interview with Elena" answered Orson.
>" And how it went?"
>"Pretty awful, she's getting too good now and her arguments are getting better," Orson said and went to the kitchen to eat something.
>"so when are you going to tell them?" said the voice again.
>"tell them about what?"
> A heavy footsteps were heard coming to the kitchen, and after a few seconds, the source of the sound appeared.
>a six-foot-nine Arctic wolf with a larger body and buff arms. this was Wendy, Orson's secret wife and the one who helped through all those years.
>"about us? about who you truly are!"
>Orson sighed,"Are you out of your mind? I can't be public with our relationship.."
>"Relationship?! we are married!"
>"In this country, our country, we aren't Wendy"
> For legal reasons and to keep their Marriage a secret, the two of them got married and had a wedding in an island country where they don't reveal marriage certificates.
>Wendy took a deep breath and then sat next to him at the kitchen table,"I'm tired of pretending Orson, i really am...I want us to be able to hold hands in public, I want us to be able to finally sleep in the same bed and I want us to stop pretending that we are co-workers! I want to be able to finally start a family together and live freely"
>Orson looked at her, feeling a little guilty for making both of their lives hard and he couldn't reveal this detail about him not after what happened today.
>Orson held her large hands and squeezed them, "Wendy look at me, do you think that I want all of this, Do you think that I don't want to hold her hands while we go out and take you on a date and enjoy ourselves but once I became the face of the whole Anti-interspecies thing a lot of people started giving a shit about our show, organizations started funding us and with this funding, we were able to build this house and gave me and the show more audience which led to more funding and made me do more interviews and so on..."
>"So it's all about money then?"
>"Fuck no! Do you think that I would do all of this to you just for some money?! No..."Orson became grimmer," It's about saving face and keeping both of our reputations, you know what will happen if people knew that I was told to not marry an anthro and that I married an anthro wolf..."
>"They would call you a Hypocrite..."
>"Not a Hypocrite, THE Hypocrite, heck this will destroy both our show and even our lives Wendy...and now with 25 states out of fifty legalizing Interspecies Marriage and the chance of six others joining next year, I will get more interviews...more broadcasts...and more debates..."
>"So what now? we are gonna live our whole life like that? what about what she said about having children, how's that gonna happen?"
>"I don't know...I just don't know Wendy, I just want you to know something..."
>Wendy raised an eyebrow, "what's that?"
>"i want you to know that I love you and I will try my best to find a solution to all of that..."
>Wendy sighed and leaned on him a little," I know you will and I will be here with you"
>Orson's phone rang and he excused himself and let Wendy think about this whole matter.
>Wendy met Orson many years ago, She had a small website where she hosted and posted anti-interspecies articles and videos, she met Orson after she interviewed him, and had great chemistry together and decided to launch the "All Humans!" together, they worked together for serval years until they realized their feeling towards each other and started secretly dating.
> They both used to believe that a human couldn't love an anthro the same way he would love another human.
> They soon discover that they were dead wrong.
>Orson came back to the kitchen with a frown on his face.
>"What's the matter?"
>"Well the good news is that we have new sponsors for our campaign, they said that they will invest 'handsomely'..."
>" And the bad news?"
>"What I said in the interview sparked a huge national debate, and we will start to get double the hate mails and death threats"
>Wendy took a deep breath and then stood up,"I will get the paper shredder and the shotgun'
>"....yeah you should i guess"
>"Unnatural, Orson?! Really! This is the best thing you had in mind?!" exclaimed Wendy after she listened to the interview.
>Orson shouted, "You heard how they started booing me! I couldn't think, okay!"
>Wendy got a little annoyed and then browsed the internet, "Well, look at this, your name is now trending on social media."
>"How bad is it?"
>"Not as bad as you might think... some people are calling you 'Based' and others are calling you a bigot... but Elena is using this opportunity to boost her popularity. She’s doing a special episode just analyzing the interview."
>Orson rubbed his temples, "Great, just what I needed... more fuel for the fire."
>Wendy frowned and crossed her arms, "Orson, this can't keep going on like this. The more we push this narrative, the harder it becomes to ever come clean."
>Orson sighed heavily, "I know, Wendy, but what do you want me to do? We've built everything on this... we can't just tear it all down."
>"But at what cost, Orson? We’re lying to everyone... even to ourselves."
>There was a long, tense silence between them. Wendy broke it by opening a file on her laptop, "Look at this. Clara, the anthro rabbit who was married to a human... she was pregnant with his kids."
>Orson's eyes widened, "What? When did this happen?"
>"It was kept quiet, but I found the details... Her husband pressured her into getting an abortion, not realizing how dangerous it was for her species. She died because of it."
>Orson felt a knot form in his stomach, "Wendy... this is the kind of thing that could turn the tide in our favor."
>"Orson! what the fuck?!"Wendy shouted, "Are we really going to use this tragedy to push our agenda?! We’re already living a lie, and this could make it worse."
>Orson looked conflicted, "This is what we’ve been talking about for years. Interspecies marriages are dangerous because people don’t understand the risks. Clara’s death is a tragic example of that."
>Wendy shook her head, "But we know the truth, Orson. We know it’s not just about the risks. It’s about society not accepting these relationships... not making room for understanding and support."
>"We can’t let our personal feelings get in the way of what we’ve been fighting for. If we let this story slip by, it’ll be another step toward normalizing something that isn’t safe."
>Wendy sighed, "I don’t like it... but if we’re doing this, we need to be careful. We can’t let this spiral out of control."
>Orson nodded, "Agreed. We’ll present it as a cautionary tale, something people need to know about before they make any decisions. We have to protect people, Wendy... even if it means keeping up this facade a little longer."
>They spent the next few hours preparing, going over the evidence and crafting their narrative. The weight of what they were about to do hung heavy over them, but there was also a sense of determination.
>Finally, as the cameras rolled and the familiar theme music of "All Humans!" began to play, Orson took his place at the desk, Wendy by his side. He looked into the camera, his expression grave and focused.
>"Good evening, everyone. Tonight, we have a story that highlights the dangers of interspecies marriage... a story that ended in tragedy. It’s a story we must all hear and learn from."
>And with that, the show began, using Clara’s tragic death to bolster their controversial stance, despite any reluctance they may have had.

Do you think a form of prison assignment would reform anthro reprobates? If a normal woman gets all these hormones that makes her more likely to be protective, matronly, pair-bonded and so on.

What are your thoughts on being gaslit into a romantic relationship?

At what point does the gaslighting end and the actual relationship begin? Do you mean being gaslit into a relationship and then they turn out to be awful?

More like an anthro tries to fool you into thinking that you were always together. Maybe gradually skipping relationship milestones.
>"Anon, don't you remember agreeing that we'd go on a date here? You eat here every Wednesday? I see why you suggested going here for a date."
>"Why am I in your bed? I asked if we could go to the next step and you agreed. Don't you see all those condoms in the trash? We really went at it. Hey, how about another go?"
>"You remember when we went to Paris? It was so wonderful. You don't remember that? The doctor did say you might have some brain issues since... let's talk about something nicer."
>"Happy anniversary. I know you probably forgot, but I am fine with that. I have never been happier with you. Here is to enjoying our lives together. If it makes you feel bad, we can always do a repeat."{

I prefer already being in a relationship and being gaslit into being a subby little bitch.

That's a neat idea.

How do you guys feel about wrestling/playfights? You know, taking your girl on in a friendly tussle, and I don't even necessarily mean a sexual one. Do you think you could put up a fight?

>Do you think you could put up a fight?
no way in hell
i could use all my strength and she would only find it cute
i mean i guess she could play along and not make it completely one sided
play fighting is play after all and while i might not be able to really challenge her we could still have some fun

I love the idea especially when I'm hopelessly outmatched in the size and physical ability department. A somewhat sadistic waifur enjoying my weak, futile struggles makes for the perfect wrestling partner. And I could be her cuddle pillow... or a stress toy to squeeze depending on how she feels. Playful bites from a maw who could easily snap through my bones or take my head clean off are nice as well. And since I'm in love with snakes - coils. Lots of submission holds in those coils.

You must choose.

>"What would you have done if he said no?"
>"I would have done it anyway. I mean I like to be nice, but I am not an angel. Have you seen his (bleep)? I couldn't let that go."
>"Back to you Macy."

>Instead of going all at once, the anthros will slowly be integrated into the towns along the border of humanity's enemies, starting with the females as they are less likely to cause trouble

>That is the official plan
>However, the truth is the united tribes were devastated in their last country sized raid
>Most of the males led by the queen's fool of a brother were slaughtered in the attack

Anon pretends to be hypnotized and plays along but then her commands start to get a bit dirty...
starts off with maybe some kissing until it quickly takes a turn where she commands you to eat her out and then has you in a amazon position and then command you to love her forever
she would either 100% believe in hypnosis thinking that it's real or she knows it's not real and is just using it to break the ice or something

Idea...
The cold war wasn't a dick measuring contest between two superpowers, but a massive deterrent.
1947 Battle of Los Angeles wards of a scouting force of horny alien chicks
Those not shot down retreat, while UN meets up and discuses how to avoid getting conquered and keeping the powers that be in power
Come up with M.A.D. and set up the Cold war as a massive coverup and excuse to channel money into new technology to push mankind forward(in secret, of course)
Begin psyops to see how susceptible humans would be to being dominated by alien invaders
Aliens finally get back (Earth is a long way from imperial boarders, Space Australia to Space Britain) only to find the primitives waving around nukes like it's going out of style
Can't invade because then this habitable garden world is going to be reduced to radioactive hellscape because of mistaken identity
Many a female sulks at the loss of a prime invasion target and a bunch of handsome males

>Be Anon
>You’re currently tied in a spread eagle position on the bed
>Your big Australian shepherd girlfriend wanted to try something new
>She’s going to get you accustomed to her scent, apparently it’s a thing that some dogs do
>She took the liberty of taking a jog in the hot summer sun while wearing sweatpants as well as turning up the heat in the room
>Just to amplify her scent, as she said
>”Alright Anon, you ready for this?”
“Y-Yeah, sure.”
>”Oh! I almost forgot!”
>The big anthro then grabs a pair of her worn panties and shoves them in your mouth, before grabbing a ball gag and wrapping it around your head, making sure you can’t push her panties out your mouth
>”Just so you can taste me too, hehe!”
>With that, your girlfriend climbs onto the bed and straddles your face, her big behind looming just inches above you
>She’s sat on your face many times before, but every time is just as intimidating, one cheek is probably five times the size of your head
>Sweat drips down on your face like a faucet, and you can catch the smell of hot swamp ass and wet dog
>It’s mildly unpleasant, but not unbearable
>”Ready?” She says
>You can’t even nod your head before your girlfriend drops her ass onto your face
>Thanks to an ungodly amount of sweat, your head slips easily between her cheeks
>The smell is more intense now, it makes your head spin
>But you’re far from over
>Your girlfriend giggles and shifts herself side to side, grinding on your face and causing you to slip deeper
>She continues grinding on top of you until your nose comes into contact with her asshole
>”Now then, sweetie, take a deep breath…”
>Not wanting to disappoint your girlfriend, you take a deep inhale of your girlfriend’s asshole, which twitches in response
>Your head is immediately filled with her raw, unfiltered musk, making you feel dizzy
>But there’s some other odd feeling inside of you after you took a deep sniff, something that lingers in the back of your mind
>As if out of your control, you take another deep sniff
>There’s a hint of something indescribable, something that has you craving for more
>Your girlfriend chuckles and grinds her ass hard onto your nose
>”How is it back there? Does it smell good?”
>You take a third sniff, then a fourth, and then a fifth
>”Hehe, I’ll take that as a yes.”
>You lose count as you continue huffing your girlfriend’s asshole
>Her scent is having an aphrodisiac effect on you, you don’t know how or why, but it feels so good
>You continue huffing your girlfriend’s asshole, allowing that erotic feeling to build
>Your dick is as hard as diamond, begging to be touched
>”Aww, am I making you hard, baby?”
>Your girlfriend touches the tip of your penis, making you shudder
>”Don’t worry babe, just keep sniffing. I want you to smell me for weeks after this.”
>You do as you’re told, eagerly sniffing up her natural pheromones
>It feels so good that you want to taste it, so you try sticking your tongue out of your mouth
>But you forget about the fact that you’re gagged
>Desperate for a taste, you let out a muffled yell underneath your girlfriend’s butt
>She simply responds by grinding on your face again
>You take another deep inhale, filling your lungs with more of her scent, before letting out another yell
>This time, she doesn’t do anything
>You repeat this process of filling up your head with her musk and begging for a taste just to be ignored
>And filling your lungs with more of her scent makes you even more aroused
>Your dick is harder than it has ever been, throbbing and pulsing for attention
>Desperate for some release, you thrust your hips into the air
>Your girlfriend shifts her hips side to side, causing your head to move with her squishy, fluffy cheeks
>”Oh, we’re only getting started, baby. Plus, I need to catch up on some reading, if you don’t mind. Just try and relax down there, okay?”
>Your girlfriend shifts around a bit before coming to a rest, humming to herself as she presumably begins reading her book
>Time loses meaning as you’re stuck underneath your girlfriend’s ass for what feels like hours
>Slow, torturous hours
>You’re desperate to taste her ass and get some relief
>But all your muffled pleas for attention falls on deaf ears
>You’re forced to lie down there and continue breathing in more of your girlfriend’s musk for a long time, growing more and more aroused and desperate
>You’re so lightheaded at this point that you feel like you could pass out
>The occasional grind and shift on your face gives you a small second wind, but not for long
>Eventually, it all becomes too much, and you lose consciousness under your girlfriend, nose up her ass and still breathing in her natural pheromones
…
>Be Anon
>It’s been a couple days since your girlfriend did that scent trial with you
>You’re doing some laundry when something catches your eye
>Your girlfriend’s sweatpants from that day
>You lift them up and bring the seat of her pants to your nose
>You can definitely smell her musk on them
>Your eyes roll in the back of your head as your cock grows rock hard
>You fumble around with your pants and wrap your hand around your dick, stroking it quickly
>You continue huffing your girlfriend’s sweatpants as you keep jacking off
>Eventually, your knees grow weak, and you fall onto the floor with your ass in the air
>Your stroking gets faster as your sniffing gets deeper
>You moan as you feel your climax approaching, and then, you explode all over the floor
>But with your nose still in your girlfriend’s sweatpants, you can’t stop jacking yourself off
>It’s like her scent has taken over your mind
>You hear muffled footsteps behind you
>”Oh, baby, if you wanted my scent that bad, why not have it from the source?”
>You look behind and see your girlfriend’s fat ass in front of your face, covered in thin, sweat-soaked yoga pants
>You immediately wrap your arms around your girlfriend’s ass and shove your face in between her cheeks, taking a deep sniff of her ass
>She was right, it does smell better from the source

>did you know human males are free
>just go to any human settlement/city/planet/space station/etc and there are loads of them walking about on their own free for the taking
>no female's scent on them, no claiming bite on their necks, not even a female family member around to keep them guarded, etc
>even if there is a human female around them they can't and won't stop you from taking their males

>Calmly approach male
>Gently pat male on his head
>Give "bedroom" and/or "motherly" eyes to male
>Say to male in a seductive tone, "Would you like to be my good boy?"
>When male complies, gently lift male
>Insert male into your bodysuit until he is snug against your body
>Tell male you'll "keep him safe in there."
>Zip up your bodysuit

Xenomorphs would take over planet in record time if they stayed all female and reproduced through regular sex instead of the whole facehugger stage. With all the goofy and fetish shit that happens in official xenomorph media this wouldn't even be that out of place.
Honestly, the usual rape aliens/monster invasion becomes fare more efficient when it's female aliens/monsters going after human guys. Need only a couple of guys to get started, guys are alone more often/longer so easier to grab, no risk of death from alien/monster pregnancy you get in human women, human males don't have shit like menopause so can be used to breed for far longer, etc.

Need obsessive superhero wife to control my life.

do you imagine anon as just a civilian who attracted her attention, or maybe someone who wanted to try playing the role of villain but later realized it is not worth it cause the Heros are crazy.

Anon as a civilian is alot more exciting. Superanthro follow him around on his daily chores checking to see if he talks to any other girls.

getting rescued by an anthro means you legally belong to her now

>Work at an office job for twelve hours a day just to come home to a relationship that has already run it's course after only a couple years.
>You're not even married, just with some 'girlfriend' that treats you like utter garbage because she has a better job than most.
>She always lords it over your head that they makes more than you, and won't let you leave because as she always says: 'where would you even go?'
>Not only that, but fighting back is impossible because you live in a society that if you do, she'll lie and say you're abusive- and the police would believe every word.
>God, you hate double standards.
>You're dreading the carpool home, so you decide to walk.
>Maybe you'll stop at the bar- it's not like you'll get screamed at any less for coming home late.
>. . .
>You know what? Fuck it.
>You work hard, and you're gonna get so drunk that you'll fucking-
>'fwip!'
>You don't even get to finish that thought before a burlap sack is slid over your head, and you're dragged into a vehicle of some kind.
>A gruff, feminine voice can be heard from somewhere close as you can hear a sliding door close on the car.
>"We got one! Go go go!"
>There was a screech of tires, and with that you knew for certain that you had been kidnapped.
>-and you couldn't be more relieved about it.
>To your understanding- you had been kidnapped by citizens of the anthrostate.
>You know- THE Anthrostate?
>The entire country that's about the size of America, Russia, and China mashed together that just suddenly 'appeared' out of nowhere a few years ago?
>Also the very same country that is filled to the brim with humanoid creatures that are almost compulsively obsessed with the human species?
>THAT Anthrostate.
>So, it turns out that you've been kidnapped, and are now in the process of being dragged back to the Anthrostates as some sort of trophy husband.
>Which was weird, right?
>You weren't exactly Mr. Handsome in most cases, but far be it for you to give your kidnappers a reason to drop you off at home.
>It was best to just be chill as you lay on the reasonably comfy floor of the van that you can hear speeding down what had to be a highway.
>So, you just kicked back and tried enjoying the ride.
>The moment you started to lounge though, your peace was quickly interrupted by a very familiar set of claws poking into your side.
>"Hey, what's up with this one? They're not even struggling-" The gruff voice said.
>"You weren't too rough this time- we're you?" A much more dainty voice spoke from what you could only guess was the driver seat.
>"What? No! I just like it when they struggle. It's more fun that way."
>The gruff voice sounded like a jock.
>"You should really save it for your hubby back home, Hanna. . ."
>Hanging just over your motionless body you could hear 'Hanna' growl with disdain.
>"HEY! I SAID to call me by my codename! We need to be professional!"
>"Why? We're only here because you owe me after what happened after snatching YOUR husband!"
>There was a short pause, and a soft whine from above you.
>"Please, Jenny? I worked really hard on it."
>There was another pause, and then a deadpan tone following a tired sigh.
>" 'Agent Wolfsbane'. . . could you please check to see if my husband is alive so I can ask what his name is?"
>"HELL YEAH, I CAN!"
>'Hanna' sounded like a child that was excited to play a game of secret agents with her friends.
>With one pull of their hand, the bag was off your head and you could certainly confirm that you were inside a van- a huge wolf of a woman sitting cross-legged beside you all the while.
>Easily eight feet tall, one look at the woman's physique affirmed your mental accusations of Hanna being a jock considering she was wearing a black tank top and black shorts.
>That, and she looked like she could bench a truck.
>"Yeah, he's alive-" Hanna stated matter of factly with a snarky smile. "Almost thought I snapped his neck there for a second."
>Well, that's a ghastly mental image.
>"Oh, thank goodness-" a much more feathered individual in the front seat spoke. "I wouldn't have forgiven you, if you did, H-. . . Agent Wolfsbane."
>Brown feathers, a bright-green jacket, and a pair of worn out blue jeans covering her- there were also the faint signs of a hot-pink shirt collar around this bird-womans neck.
>"Heeeey, sweetie-" a pair of soft-blue eyes looked back at you from the rearview mirror where a necklace with a peace symbol medallion dangled almost ironically. "Welcome to your new life-"
>The cadence this feathered female spoke with almost made it seem like she was trying to ease you into the reality of your situation.
>"Now, I know that this probably isn't how you wanted to spend your evening, and you've probably got a lot of questions, and you're PROBABLY going to ask me to drop you off at home- so let me just answer all three typical questions recipients have of this 'exceptionally complicated' matrimonial process to get them out of the way!"
>"Yes, this is really happening. Yes, you're now my husband- don't question it. -And lastly: NO, there will be no bathroom breaks. I LEARNED THAT TRICK THE FIRST TIME."
>You watched your driver slam a feathered hand into the steering wheel to punctuate that last answer before taking a breath to calm down.
>"So, what's you're name, hubby? I'm Jenny, and I'm sure you've met Hanna-"
>"AGENT WOLFSBANE-" Hanna interrupted coarsely with a rumble in her throat.
"Yes, her-" within a moment, Jenny's flat tone was back to a stressed, yet bubbly one. "-but what about yours? I need to know the name of my new husband to really start this relationship right!"
"You can call me whatever you want just so long as you keep driving."
>You could feel Jenny's expression change from behind the wheel- the words that just left your gullet not sitting right with her.
>"Oh my God, Hanna- I think we just abducted a criminal."
>"Oh, that's like the cereal prize of husbands! Lucky-"
>"I DO NOT FEEL LUCKY RIGHT NOW, HANNA! KICK THEM OUT!"
>Jenny twisted around in her seat mid-shout, but considering the swerve that resulted because of it she snapped back around to adjust her position on the road quickly after.
>Not having a seatbelt on, yourself- you found yourself rolling around the floorboard of the van and smacking into the opposite wall to Hanna.
"Not a criminal! NOT A CRIMINAL! My life here is just terrible, I swear!"
>Showing obvious hesitation to following her friends order, Hanna was looking to Jenny's reflection in the rearview and then back to you quite a few times.
>The mental image of you turning into road pizza wasn't appealing, and you readied yourself for the worst.
>"D- Do you promise?" The anxiety-riddled way Jenny spoke matched your own.
"I swear. The only thing I've ever stolen is a stick of gum."
>"Pussy-" Hanna mocked.
>"Oh, thank goodness. I was actually scared for a second."
>All was quiet for a few moments- you being glad to not be pushed out onto the highway, and Jenny bring glad not to aid a fellow criminal.
>Only Agent Wolfsbane dared to look dissatisfied.
>"Oh my God, just SAY something already. Jenny- how long until we get to the rendezvous point?"
>"Well,-" Jenny cleared her throat. "We'll be headed for the coastline, so. . . Two days?"
>The agonizing groan the wolf-woman made clearly expressed how she felt on the matter- gripping both claws into the jet-black hair on her head that draped down her back.
>"I'm not dealing with hours of you freaking out, Jen- I'm getting some shut-eye."
>The huge woman laid on her side before turning over to face the wall; her long tail smacking you haphazardly in the face almost as an insult.
>"Wake me if the cops show up, Kay?"
>"Okay. . . Get some good sleep."
>By the near instant sound of sawing logs you could only guess that you were now 'technically' alone with Jenny.
>"So, uh, if you're not going to try and run. . ."
>From the front seat you saw one of Jenny's arms reach over to the passenger seat to give it a soft 'pat.'
>"Wanna ride shotgun?"
>Anything to avoid the risk of being tossed around again.
>A small trek up to the front seat later, and you were locked into the passenger seat with a seatbelt gladly wrapped around your torso.
>It was only really now that you were able to get a good look at the other half of the team that kidnapped you.
>A soft, rattled expression sat on her face as Jenny continued to speed down what you now recognized as the interstate highway.
>There was a fear about her, but also. . . Relief?
>The oddest thing about the bird-woman however had to be her beak.
>It looked. . . Clunky.
>Almost like a Halloween mask that didn't fit on a kids head when they wore it.
>You could at least make heads or tails of what kind of bird Jenny was now.
>She seemed to be some kind of hen.
"Well, this is probably the weirdest marriage proposal I've ever received. . . granted, it's the ONLY one I've ever gotten, but perhaps you should have just asked to buy me a drink?"
>Your jocular comment flew right over her head- Jenny having a laser focus on the road.
>"It's a. . . Cultural thing."
>Well, at least she's talking.
>"Anthro's see a person they want, and they just go 'Hey- I'd like to have sexual relations with that, and just-" Jenny swirled her right hand dismissively. "Take it!"
>A genuine frustration bled from Jenny's posture, and into her words.
"You don't sound too enthused about your culture for someone who's participating in it."
>The poor hen looked tired in ways you could recognize. Tired in a way that just made her want to escape something.
>"It's not that- it's just. . ." There was an anger welling up that she had to push down. "One of our leaders sexually assaults and kidnaps a human, and ALL OF THE SUDDEN we've ALL been blacklisted from human society! How is THAT fair?"
>Oh. . . Yeah.
>The 'first contact incident.'
>So, long story short:
>When the Anthrostates first appeared humanity was sort of thrilled about there being more sapient life than humans on the planet.
>There was talk of greater access to resources, possible new technologies- it was a pretty cool time to be alive.
>There was a big deal about how earth had trippled in size due to the introduction of a new huge supercontinent, the effects that such a thing could have on the environment, and a meeting between the leaders of the Anthrostates and the leaders of human civilization.
>It was a big thing where both sides would bring their families and have them get to know the others as a test of good will.
>It almost went perfectly. . . Until a nine-foot tall wolf-man stole some guys wife right in front of him.
>The details afterward were very fuzzy- demands for the man's wife to be returned were made, accusations of other kidnappings during the event, statements saying that the guys wife DIDN'T want to come back, and the good ol classic threats of war from both sides-
>It got messy.
>That's politics though, right?
>"We're all labeled as perverts now, and it stinks!" It seemed like this had been something boiling for a while. "My society is more complicated than that! I'M more complicated than that!"
>You look into the back of the van just in time to see Hanna scratching her backside.
"What about her? Is she complicated too?"
>Jenny looked at you as if that statement just destroyed her entire argument in a single shot.
>"No, she's a pervert. . ."
>Yeah, that checked out.
>"So, how about that name?"
>Jenny was looking from the road to you with pleading eyes, hoping for any way to make the situation a bit better than what it currently was.
"Well, if I'm leaving my old life behind, I might as well have a new name, right?"
>It was like a wash of relief came over the hen when you said this.
>Her grip on the steering wheel loosened, that anxiety lightened, and that smile looked a little less forced.
>"Oh, yes. That's something you humans seem to be fond of doing. It really is fascinating how you're all so willing to discard certain aspects of yourselves at the drop of a hat."
>You gave Jenny an arched brow.
"Are Anthro's NOT able to do that?"
>"Oh, no. It's not that-" she stated with a soft laugh. "it's just. . . It's not something we typically do."
>Jenny drummed her fingers on the steering wheel.
>"So. . . How about that name, hubby?"
"How about that?"
>"How about what?"
>" 'Hubby.' it has a nice ring to it."
>Finally, a calmness overtook Jenny, the hen deciding to turn her attention back toward the road.
>"I think I like that."
>So with the sound of snoring in the back, and the light grinding of wheels on asphalt the van that was now your kidnappers getaway vehicle traveled down the highway.
>-and although the light of the setting sun was still hitting the back of the van, you couldn't help but feel like a new day was already upon you.
>"First stop."
>You're not sure when you dozed off, but you groggily awoke to the sensation of the vans break-system causing you to lurch forward like a zombie.
>Barely cognizant and droopy-eyed, you could hear Hanna moving around in the back; every major movement of her body causing the vehicles hull to sway from side to side.
>"Finally, I get to stretch my legs-" the side-door of the van slid open just long enough for the wolf-woman to eagerly crawl out on all fours like a beast. "No offense, Jen- but that car of yours has just about as much space in it as a tin can."
>You could hear Hanna's vertebrae 'pop' when finally straightening out her back with a breath of satisfaction.
>"Oh, yeah- that's what momma likes. . ."
>This left you to pull yourself together and wipe the sand out of your eyes as a soft feathery nudge graced your bicep.
"Huh, wha-? Why did we stop?"
>Your 'eloquent' phrasing brought a laugh out of Jenny.
>"Hey, sleepyhead- it's time to top-off the gas tank."
>With a simple turn of the head you could see Jenny staring at you with a sympathetic gesture, a few feathered digits fiddling with her beak all the while.
>Barely aware of your own surroundings- you were snapped awake by the sensation of Hanna impatiently wrapping her arms around the hood of the car and rocking the entirety of the van in an act of pure impudence.
>"COME. ON. YOU. TWO. SLOW. POKES. GET. OUT. OF. THE CAR!"
>She accentuated her demand with one final shake.
>"I want SNACKS."
>Behind the massive woman though, you could finally see some hint of where you now were.
>A triangular sign standing high on a metal pole that looked like it was ripped right out of the eighties.
>The starry night sky made it look like a beacon as it spun.
>It was a mixture of pink, purple, orange, and yellow neon that made up what looked like a synthwave sunset.
>Just below it in green letters, and nestled in-between similarly presented neon palm trees were the words:
>'Palm Harbor Gas Station.'
>Stepping out of the van, you were able to take in a much more grand scope of your surroundings.
>You were in the middle of a desert- cacti, tumbleweeds, dirt, and a small two-lane road were all that graced your vision when looking back over your shoulder.
>In front of you however was a completely different story.
>Other than the road you all must have driven in on, the only other sign of civilization visible to you was the shockingly modern-looking gas station you were parked at.
>Granted, the place had only four gas pumps, two of which being already occupied- not including the van, which made three.
>The building itself was almost obelisk-ian in nature; the entire place looking about fifteen feet too tall, and the doors in being taller than any you've seen.
>This coupled with how the outside of the establishment was decked out in just as much neon as their sign made the place a little intimidating.
>That didn't stop Hanna from nearly scurrying up toward the front door in a way that made alarms go off in your head.
"Wait- hold on! If someone sees you they'll call the cops! Anthro's aren't supposed to be here, remember?!?"
>Your best whisper shout went unheeded as Hanna finally reached the door and bolted in just in time for Jenny to catch your shoulder before one could even consider running off after them.
>"It's fine-" she assured with a clumsy smile. "Me and Hanna came here all the time when she was looking for her husband."
>It was beginning to feel like you were getting uncomfortably comfortable with the fact that you've been passively forced into a marriage, but far be it from you to find problems with a consensual kidnapping.
>Still there were a couple things about this that peaked your curiosity.
"So, there are just people out there that are just 'cool' about casually breaking international law?"
>"Well, yeah-" Jenny's words were so casual one may have thought them flippant. "I mean- you are, right?"
"Hm, touche."
>A breeze of cool air hit the two of you when stepping through the station entrance- the smell of gas station burrito's and cigarettes wafting into your face.
>Considering Jenny stood about a head and a half shorter than you, you wouldn't blame her for not seeing the sight of a hunched over Hanna eyeing snacks and candies from behind the cover of grocery aisles- yet you were certain that she could hear the woman mutter that she would 'devour all of you.'
>It felt like you were practically babysitting a giant child, but as Jenny took your hand and walked you in further something else caught your eye.
>At the far right side of the store where the freezer section resided was was looked like a wall of white fur dressed in an ice-blue jacket.
>Standing tall- if not taller than Hanna, you could see a pair of headphones sitting atop two rounded ears on a head of white bouncy hair styled into a short weave.
>Beside her was a man that looked like he could beat you up from just a glance.
>He was big, burley, and almost covered with the same red curly hair that sat atop his head and dominated his face.
>The man was wrapping an arm around the woman's wide hips- his muscular arms only barely disguised by his plaid long sleeve shirt while using the other to almost seemingly guide the bear-woman to finding what kind of milk she'd enjoy.
>At the hotbox where the burrito's and other station food was put on display was a green-scaled woman with blond hair draping down about three feet to the mid-section of her back while wearing a black hoodie, and pants.
>Speaking as if she just stumbled right out of Louisiana- the lady was speaking to the station attendant with a Cajun accent about wanting something 'actually spicy'- threatening to get behind the counter and do it, herself.
>Beside her was a reasonably round man who didn't quite seem to know what to do with himself- nervously fidgeting his hands together while saying that he still had seasonings left over in their car.
>You and the man shared a glance, you giving a short but respectful nod while he smiled and sheepishly waved before what you could only guess to be his alligator wife pulled him close to her as the two of you walked by.
>You guess she was the protective type.
>Similarly, Jenny pulled you over to where Hanna was filling the crook of her arm with an assortment of junkfood.
>You shuddered to consider what kind of man a woman like this could have possibly taken interest in.
"You have. . . Money to pay for all that, right?"
>Possibly a stupid question, but just because it was stupid didn't mean it wasn't good.
>"No-" Hanna snidely cackled. "-but you do. Gimme your wallet."
>You lunged back a bit when Hanna reached for you, but Jenny was fast to 'bap' her claw away.
>"Hanna. . ." The hen scolded as her friend nonchalantly shrugged.
>"What? He's fun to mess with."
>Reaching into her pocket, Jenny was quick to pull out what looked like a small, blue credit card.
>"Whenever Anthro's are permitted to sneak into human territories by our leaders- we're permitted a charge card filled with about twenty thousand American dollars."
>Having to double-take when looking from the card to Jenny, you couldn't help but feel wide-eyed.
"Are you kidding me? Where do you guys get that kind of cash for things like this?"
>Jenny forced a smile.
>"Well, it's sorta, kinda, maybe. . . Fabricated?"
>What?
"What?"
>"It's funny-money-" Hanna added, leaving Jenny nervously placing the card back in her pocket.
>"Our country might. . . be trying to completely cripple your economic systems from the inside out. . . I'm really sorry. . ."
>Well. . . Huh.
>Having to straighten out your posture, you took a deep breath.
"Huh, I'm not as mad about that as I expected."
>"Wait, really?"
"Yeah, humans are terrible at managing our economies. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't completely collapsed yet."
>"Well, get out of the way, nerd- and let me help destroy your stupid system."
>It was just as charming as it sounded when Hanna pushed past you to carry her haul of chips, candy, and snack cakes to the register.
>At the very least the attendant seemed happy to oblige- his sharp customer-service smile having been slowly turning into a malice filled grin the longer he had to listen to the gator-woman complain about 'humanities dwindling culinary advancements.'
"Charming. . ."
>Sarcasm practically dropped from that one word before Jenny chose to distract by pulling you off to the side to shop for groceries.
>"Yeah. . . Hanna's. . . 'Hanna', but try not to be mad about it. She likes to mess with people, but it's never anything too crazy."
>One could only hope.
>As if she knew this place like the back of her hand- Jenny walked from aisle to aisle, picking up groceries and handing them to you to hold.
>Dry food, first aid supplies, laundry detergent, pain killers- basic things that you guessed were usually purchased on road trips.
>Though, to be honest you had never gone on a road trip before, so you didn't really know.
>"Oh! Hubby, look-" the hen called when picking up a bag of 'Flugel' corn chips. "It's like you're eating pointy little hats!"
>You had to admit that Jenny was pretty adorable when she wasn't having a nervous breakdown.
>You chuckled at the discovery as you motioned for her to place the bag at the top of what was already a sizable pile of groceries in your arms.
"Oh yeah, I remember those- me and my buddies used to stick those on our fingers as kids and pretended to have claws."
>Those were the days.
>As comical as the thought was however, Jenny's smile couldn't help but falter.
>"Oh, yeah. . ."
>She shuffled the chip bag from one feathered palm to the other.
>"I forgot for a second that I sort of. . . Stole you out of your own life for a second there. . ."
>As well as you could for someone with his arms full of groceries, you gave Jenny a playful bump with your hip.
"Hey, if it's any consolation- there wasn't much of a life left."
>There was a bit of of calm that came from your answer, and Jenny was quick to 'plop' the chips on the growing pile before moving along.
>"Alright, we just need a couple more- Oop!"
>You don't know how you didn't notice, but by the time you turned to leave the aisles- the bear-woman was standing there; watching the two of you quietly with a smirk.
>Jenny had actually bumped into the woman before stumbling back a little.
>"Oof! Oh, uh, I'm so sorry, I, uh-"
>Jenny nearly froze when she realized someone now towering over her- fumbling her hands together when taking a step or two back.
>You didn't know what was happening, but you could feel something akin to hostility in the air.
>"Oh, no. There's no need to worry-" the bear spoke hushed in a powerful tone. "There's just something down this aisle that I want."
>With an arm as thicker than your head, the woman reached over Jenny- the two never once breaking eye contact.
>At first, you felt like the situation might have been de-escalating; the large woman simply reaching to the shelf beside you to grab a few bags of chips.
>When the arm made a beeline for you however, you were quick to take a few steps back.
>"Hey, whoa- hold on there, the groceries are on the shelf!"
>The arm only kept chasing after you though, the tiny hen in front of you being quick to jump back and separate you from the bear woman.
>"W-what do you think you're doing?!? This is MY husband! I got him FAIR and SQUARE!" You could see Jenny's feathers ruffling in what must have been anger and unease. "Where's yours? I saw them just a minute ago!"
>"What am I doing-" the bear-woman responded. "I'm just trying to add to my collection, is all."
>A gruff growl cut through the air the moment the bear-woman took a step forward.
>"Hey, Ass-Hat- do we have a problem here?"
>There was a sharp slap delivered to the back of the bear-woman's head, and in an instant she snapped around to be face to face with Hanna.
>Both looked furious in their own right- the bear letting out a gutteral growl while Hanna clenched her claws into tight fists as they gripped the loops of multiple bags stuffed with junkfood.
>"What's wrong, fatty-" Hanna questioned. "Need more than one item off the menu- or are you just one of those 'Harem-sluts'?"
>There was a slight pause as the bear-woman gritted her sharp teeth.
>"If you're smart, you'll back-off."
>Hanna met the threat with a snide grin.
>"Well, then it's a good thing I didn't graduate highschool then, ain't it?"
>The sickening scared sensation in your gut was rising, but you knew when the opportunity to run presented itself.
>You bumped Jenny once more, and quietly signaled her to follow; a sentiment that she agreed with like a fish to water.
>When talking you made sure to speak never above a hush.
"In my back pocket I have a wallet. I have about three hundred dollars in there. When we get to the front counter take out all the money in it, put it on the counter, and ask for forty dollars in gas on our pump."
>You could see she was about to contest your demands, but you cut her off.
"We don't have enough time to use a card. I've seen enough bar fight to know this is going to get ugly fast, and paying over is a lot more convenient than not at all."
>So as asked, the moment the two of you were able to move around the other aisles of the station Jenny rooted around in your pocket and quietly payed the attendant who was surprising chill about all this.
>Something about selling the footage online for top dollar.
>All the while the bear woman and Hanna were still verbally tearing into each other with a growing hostility.
>The moment you and Jenny stepped out the doors however- all hell broke lose.
>Beastial roars, and immense collateral damage.
>It was enough to make you and Jenny sprint for the van.

>"Huh, that must not have translated properly. Let me try another way. Are your intentions peaceful?"
>"Our intentions are bridal."
>"Apologies, I must be using words that don't translate well. What is your species planning to do with our species?"
>"About three children or more."
>"I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here."
>"Well, your pants are still on. You don't seem to be doing anything to fix that."

Any that survive get first pick of the spoils, its only fair

She might not live long
Even if she never comes back you'll be well taken care of

You should be honored to be claimed by one

Male hyenas don't actually get "dommed". They get abandoned as children and forced into starvation and disease because the females think of them as the subhuman lowest caste.

this is actually full of a lot of missing information
>rank is hereditary from the mother's side
>but only if the cub stays in their birth clan
>this includes the males too
>even the high ranking males will leave their birth clans to join another one
>which puts them at the lowest rank
>this is because the females are less likely to want to mate with males from their own clan which is good since it prevents inbreeding
>also lucky is that a male's rank has 0 bearing in mate selection for the females
>there's even a couple of known clans where the matriarch keeps going to breed with the same lowest ranking male she likes
>speaking of higher ranking hyenas have lower ranking hyenas they're fond of and will go out of their way to protect them
>the daughters of these males also tend to get along with their fathers and help them out despite being higher ranking
>the males will also form small packs of all males where they will hunt together and in some instances kill low ranking females to improve their own rank
>the males also will tend to woo higher ranking females and ignore lower ranking females to give their cubs better benefits
>also the bullying isn't as bad as it's made out to be since you have plenty of videos of small males harassing much bigger females into playing with them even if it looks kind of rough but the male keeps going back for more
>spotted hyenas are very hardy
>not related to the males but you also have genetic freak females who even though are low ranked are so big and tough they get to act like social retards with no consequences and end up attracting the males because they have a history of having 3 cub litters where all 3 survive the birthing
>there's even a funny instance of a female usurping the current matriarch because she befriended the rest of the clan so much and got them on her side over the actual matriarch

I wish I had more images of absolute monster waifurs where they're either looking completely horny for human dick, or they look nervous because of how horny the human dick is for them.

There’s something weirdly hot about a gross fucked up weirdo anthro gf. Like she’d have to be pretty amazing otherwise for you to stay dating her.

I want to be stuck house-sitting with her over the weekend and get absolutely nothing done because literally every day she’s using me as her living sex toy. Cute gross slacker girls are peak.

>you go to a movie together

>she pulls you out to slip off the condom and tie it off, quickly slides another one on and slips you back in
>ow
>doesn’t dismount
>says she isnt done
>keeps working her clit and edging herself (you can actually feel her pussy clenching as she gets close) until you get hard again, then starts back up fucking you
>does this a total of three times, sometimes switching positions, taking short breaks to guzzle water, or feeding you candy with the hand she’s been rubbing herself with
>cums so hard youre worried she had a stroke
>credits roll
>you look like a disgusting wreck and can barely move - your dick is actually sore
>she somehow looks even hotter than before, like she just got off a stationary bike

>you stumble to the men’s room to piss and find her already in there using one of the urinals
>wants to compare streams
>she somehow paid close enough attention to the movie that she wants to discuss it on the way home
That for an entire weekend would kill you, but it would be a fun death.

Sort of related, but had the idea of a fantasy land where the small human kingdom was right in the middle connected to all the other larger anthro kingdoms/tribes. Trying to stay neutral, but each anthro kingdom/tribe looking to get them under their own control. Only reason they haven't been invaded by a single group is due to that would cause all the other groups to jump into the clusterfuck trying to claim the human kingdom too. Kind of like a fantasy version of Switzerland.

>Luranyphism is a pseudo-religious lifestyle unique to the archipelago city states of the Old World in which male humans and female minotaurs will openly pursue sexual and romantic relations with one another. The practice comes from religious scripture concerning the goddess of agriculture and wealth, Lura, who is often associated with bulls or cows. In the holy canon, Lura is described as an incredibly beautiful and strong woman with long golden hair riding atop a golden bull, of which is described as being incredibly loyal, protective, and loving towards his mistress.
>The origin of the practice itself comes from a line of text found in some versions of the holy books, in which it describes Lura and her golden bull leaving the physical world with the rest of the gods, but mentions “His daughters dutifully serving her sons, and her sons loving and honoring his daughters” plainly referencing Lura and her bull. Many religious scholars saw this and took it to refer to the relationship between a farmer and common cattle, given Lura’s connection to agriculture, but this obscure line of text has spawned an entire alternate lifestyle of Luranyphs: Minotaur wives married to Human husbands.
>As opposed to how something like this would be seen in other nations, Luranyphic relationships are not only socially accepted, but fairly common in the archipelago city states. This may be in part to the inherently positive and introspective aspects of Luranyphic belief, as it’s consistent to the point of stereotype that Luranyphs have extremely positive relationships and are more often than not highly talented artists, musicians, or athletes, who bond over their passions and push each other to become more masterful in their respective skills or crafts.

>‘Veshe’ is the Gnoll word for vaginal secretion, of which has a semi-prolific presence in Gnoll culture. Gnoll vaginal fluid has fast acting paralytic properties when ingested internally (This is because already mated Gnoll females will sometimes assault weaker females with their pseudo-penis, paralyzing them so that they can be “used” by the stronger female's mate.) Because of this, it’s commonly used to coat blunted arrow and spear heads when attempting to capture prisoners as opposed to outright killing them, effectively creating extremely rudimentary stun weapons.
>The Veshona however, is a sex ritual in which a mated female who is committing infidelity coats a dagger, pick, or other small pointed object in her veshe and gives it to the male she’s committing adultery with. The male then seeks out the females mate, sticking him with the weapon and violently beating him to near death while he's paralyzed by his mates own secretions. The battered male is then brought before his mate, upon which his genitals are devoured and his throat is torn out. The blood soaked female and alive male then fuck upon the carcass of the females former mate. The entire ordeal is as lovely as it sounds.

ADHG game where you try to escape a forest/anthrostate/dungeon and have to avoid being spotted by the anthro women because you couldn’t possibly hope to beat them in a fight as a mere human and you get raped if caught. If you can’t break free from her grasp you’re faced with the game over screen where you get infinitely raped as her slave/husband
(The game is impossible to win)

>Pokemon talking in human speech are not so uncommon
>Pokemons society is a Matriarchy

Pokemon is the OG ADHG/HMOFA society

>Ever since the anthrostate has taken over Television, the depiction of human males and female anthros have changed since then
>The reason for this is to insure the future generation of female anthros and male humies’s mindset and beliefs
>Female anthro are now depicted as the “man” of the house. Taking roles that a male would obviously take
>Female anthros would be portrayed as some loud, rowdy, juvenile
>Their designs are more cartoony, goofy, sometimes gross to complement their new role of the generations such as getting harm in a cartoony way, being a jerk, tough, or being punks.
>While the humie boys are depicted as beautiful angels wearing regal robes, tender, skinny, gentle nature and flirty
>These depiction of the two species and gender are spread everywhere kids media in order to get used to their new role as female anthros are becoming stronger, bigger, tougher, and the humans becoming sweeter, younger, gentle, and kind hearted

>you groan and try to rise from the hard metal slab you're lying on
>but you cannot move
>your ankles and wrists are shackled down
>you groan louder
>you were attempting to say 'what'
>but your vocal cords aren't working
>"Did it work?"
>a feminine voice, somewhere below you calls up
>you realize how high up you are when the platform you're on starts descending with a mechanical whir
>a roof closes over your head, cutting off the storm and the lightning rods
>you turn your head stiffly to examine your surroundings
>it's like something off a cheap horror movie set

>she has goggles with green lenses over her eyes

>"You're awake! You're awake you're awake you're awake! I did it! Yes!"
>she jumps in the air and pumps her fist several times
>her tail lashes
>"That'll show those bitches at the ethics boards!"
>the snow-leopard starts to laugh maniacally
>"They said it couldn't be done! They said they were pulling my funding! They said I was undateable!"
>suddenly she stops, a look of puzzled thought on her face
>"No wait, that was my mom."
>the scientist looks back to you and smiles
>this one is slightly more normal
>"Hi. I'm Avery. I brought you to life!"
>you blink slowly
>well
>that explains why you aren't dead
>you open your mouth to try and question her
>but all the comes out is another low moan
>what you tried to say was 'what happened to me?'
>what comes out is
"Whaaapenmurrr."
>Avery pulls her goggles off
>her eyes are wide open
>and though her smile remains plastered on, it fails to reach them
>"Oh. Oh no. Could you repeat that for me dear?"
>you try to speak again
>this time to ask what she meant about 'undateable'
>but once again all the comes out is unrecognizable wheezing
>the smile turns downward
>"Well that is a problem. It looks like your vocal cords just aren't up to snuff."
>that frown turns back into a smile just as quickly as it showed
>this time Avery lights up entirely
>"But that's okay!"
>the snow-leopard hops across the room, tail sweeping side to side
>she stops behind a counter and starts digging around in the cabinets beneath it
>"I know just how to fix it!"
>oh
>well that's a relief, you think
>you'd like very much for things to be fixed
>you're a resurrected corpse
>you don't want to look too closely down at your pale skin
>so you watch the doctor's tail sticking up from behind the counter as she clatters around beneath it
>"I've got a spare set of vocal cords in the fridge you can use."
>she let's out a small 'oh' as she stops rustling around
>"Don't worry, I didn't take them from anyone alive!"
>the clattering starts up again
>until she comes up with a smile
>and a fire-axe
>"Okay! I just have to chop your head off to get at those vocal cords!"
>whoa!
>what?!
>you try to tell her no
>you fail
"NURRRGLHLGH!"
>Avery seems to get your meaning as she bounces over on mud-stained paws
>"Oh don't be such a cry-baby. Your nerve endings are dead. You won't feel a thing."
>you strain against your bindings as the maniacal Avery approaches
>you catch a glimmer of amusement in her eye as she brings the axe up over her head
>"You know, probably."
>the axe comes down, and it all goes dark
>BZZZT
>you jolt awake again
>which is a very odd thing to do because some crazy cat bitch just chopped off your head
>there's a strange tingling sensation in your neck
>which is pretty reasonable given what's happened
>you're lowered back down to into the laboratory once again
>to see Avery, happy as can be, bouncing in place and clapping her paws together from the wrists
>"Okay! Okay! Now try to say something!"
>you open you mouth and let out a low grown
"Urrrgwwwhat's happening?"
>Avery bounces even harder
>then throws herself over you and the table, wrapping her arms around you in a hug
>"Yes! Yesyesyesyes! You can talk! I did it!"
>her arms around your neck brush against something on each side of it
>sending another jolt of electricity down your entire body
"Ah! Ow!"
>Avery jumps back
>"Oops!"
>the snow leopard giggles
>she reaches her paws down and you feel the jolt again
>"Sorry! Those are the neuro-bolts I installed in your neck so you could feel things again. Here!"
>Avery ducks again
>this time rattling around beneath your steel bed
>you lift your head to watch her work
>and twitch as the bolts in your neck send another small jolt down your spine
>but you see she's definitely not wearing pants under that coat
>Avery comes up with a peculiar looking length of leather
>"This should keep those bolts stable!"
>you pick your head up too peer closer
"Looks like a collar."
>Avery smiles wider
>nervously
>"Ha! That's funny. It's not a collar. It's a neuro-bolt stabilizer! To control--protect your neuro-bolts!"
>she slips the loop around your neck, and you feel another tingle as it's fitted to the metal bolts in your neck
>you sigh
>at least they feel a little more comfortable when you move your head
"Okay, that's better. Thank you."
>Avery beams
>"You are welcome! How are you feeling?"
>you try to shrug
"Weird. I should be dead right now."
>Avery frowns
>"Oh no, suicidal thoughts. Don't worry, I can fix that too!"
>she pulls out a ball-peen hammer
>your eyes bulge out of your head
"Whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!"
>she freezes, paw up in the air
>you shake your head fervently
"Not suicidal! I'm okay! I'm okay! Just confused."
>Avery sighs in relief
>tossing the hammer aside to smash something glass elsewhere in the lab
>"Oh well that's a relief. Let me explain then. See, you're the culmination of my life's work! The dead brought back to life!"
>yeah you got that point
>you're a regular zombie
"So why me?"
>Avery shrugs
>"Humans are easier to stitch. No fur to get in the way. Plus you're cute."
>she boops your nose and giggles
>"Just wait until those bitches at the regulatory committee see me with my very own Lazarus boyfriend!"
>you take a deep breath
>that's what you were afraid of
"Uh hey, Avery, listen, I can't be your boyfriend."
>no way you're dating this maniac
>Avery lets out a squeak of shock, her tail shooting up in the air
>"Wh-what?"
>well damn
>she's almost too cute to turn down
>but you nod grimly
"It just--I don't think I could--"
>"Get it up? Oh sweetie you're already thinking ahead! Don't worry, I can fix that too!"
>then she's off again
"No, wait--"
>she disappears into a closet set in the back of the lab
>you're left to dread and contemplate what horrid household implement she could be returning with
>maybe a rake
>or...
>you shudder
>...a cheese grater
>you're not left waiting long
>Avery appears in your view, smiling as manically as ever
>she approaches the table and rests a paw on your thigh
>the other is holding what looks like a mini two-pronged lightning rod
>"With the simple application of a light current, I can easily stimulate--"
>she presses the prod against your balls
>and you feel a jolt of electricity as bad as the lightning storm
"Oh fuck!"
>you jerk against your restraining bolts
>thankfully Avery pulls the prod back with a gasp
>"Oh my, that IS a reaction!"
>you thought she meant how you jumped
>but then you see
>your zombie cock rising from the grave
>despite your distinct lack of a pulse, the organ throbs and hardens slowly
>Avery leans in closer
>watching with dinnerplate eyes
>"Let's see the reaction from a second stimulation."
>you try to jerk away again
>no luck
>the cuffs hold fast and she brings the electric prod up with zero hesitation
"Wait waitwaitwa--"
>BZZZT!
"Ow motherfucker!"
>you squirm, reeling from another jolt straight to the undead coinpurse
>you let your head fall back on the tabletop
>you can feel your cock is getting even harder somehow
>"Amazing! Pre-ejaculate from only two applications of the stimulator!"
>you feel Avery's breath sniffing over the head of your member
>"Actually, it may be embalming fluid."
>if any of your bodily functions besides your dick worked right now you'd be sick
>then you feel something warm and wet
>your eyes snap open
>to see Avery licking a clear liquid from your tip
>the feline works her tongue in her muzzle for a few seconds before smacking her lips
>"Nope! That's pre-cum!"
>you sigh in relief
>shit is weird enough without cumming fucking formaldehyde
>Avery raises the lighting stick again
>"I bet if I do it a third time he'll--"
"No!"
>Avery finally acknowledges you again with a look of surprise
>"Oh! What am I thinking?"
>you hold your breath
>ready for her to break out some other ridiculous implement to torture you with
>"Your first post-death little-death--"
>she snickers
>"--should be inside your girlfriend!"
>Avery throws open her lab coat, revealing that she is indeed wearing nothing at all beneath it
>in spite of, or perhaps because of, her scientific pursuits, the snow leopard has a curvaceous figure
>thighs nearly as thick as your body, with wide hips and a very shapely rear beneath her tail
>and big, perky breasts
>with soft pink inverted nipples
>"Good right? I'm sexy?"
>she leans over you, cupping her breasts
>her pupils dilating as she presses them together
>her smile turns crazed
>"You'd definitely have fucked me without me having to bring you back to life, right? You'd have consented? You'd be my boyfriend without any more neural recalibration right?"
>as the mad scientist looms, you can really appreciate how big she is
>towering over you in height
>you also get to appreciate how massive those tits are
>you nod
>for your own safety
>and cause goddamn
>you wanna drown in those things
>Avery sighs in relief
>"Good. I was afraid I'd have to go find my hammer again."
>she fishes in a pocket of her lab coat
>and comes out with a long pet leash in her paw
>"This is a behavior correction modulator. When attached to your neuro-bolt stabilizer..."
>Avery trails off, looking from the leash to you
>she shrugs
>"Fuck it. It's a leash. I'm gonna put it on you cause you're mine. I raised you from the dead so you're mine."
>the babbling goes on as she clips the leash to your collar
>and clambers up onto the metal slab serving as your surgical bed
>Avery strips out of the lab coat entirely and throws it aside
>more shattering glass
>and some fire
>but you're focused on the weight now settling on your lap
>"Oh man this is gonna be so good. Watch, I think I can get a reaction if I--"
>your head jerks forward with a harsh yank on the leash
>another set of volts runs down your body
>your cock twitches against Avery's ample rear
>and she chuffs
>"Oh yeah that works. Almost as good as the stimulator."
>your legs tingle
>and not just because the full weight of an oversized snow-leopard is resting on your lap
>but because her tail is brushing over them like mad as she grinds on you
>"Whew. It's a good thing I reinforced your bones before I do this!"
>you think you know what she means by 'do this'
>and you're right
>Avery pops off your lap
>"Be sure to document all your sensations. As a scientist, I have to know how great having sexing with me is, and how much Ricky Kellerton should regret turning me down for prom."
>wow
>she's got issues
>but you're a talking corpse, so it's hard for you to judge
>at least not while she's got a leash around your neck and the tip of your cock prodding her vulva
>the heat coming off of it the first sensation of real warmth you've felt since your revival
>it gets a lot warmer when she slowly lowers herself down your cock
>"Mmmfffuck. Sufficient size. A little..."
>Avery bottoms out and shivers
>"Ooh. A little cold."
>she looks down at you
>"How would you feel about a nuclear generator in your chest to keep your tissues warm?"
>you groan and tug against your restraints
>that zap to the balls made you super sensitive
>with Avery wrapped around you all the way to the base, every little movement she makes has you twitching with pleasure
>the slightest stimulation is overwhelming
>Avery leans over forward
>"Hello? Any response?"
>she tugs on your leash
>and you buck off the table
>thrusting up with enough force to make Avery bounce off the table
>then when she comes down you reflexively thrust up again
>this loops twice more before you manage to go still
"Ouff. Fuck."
>your moans are matched by Avery
>whose smile grows wider as she looks to the leash in her paw
>"That...that's a good reaction. Let's get a little more..."
>Avery bounces on your lap
>this time keeping your body pressed down to the table
>every time she wants another reaction she tugs on your collar to make you thrust up
>only to slam you back down
>Avery rides you hard
>panting and groaning and muttering to herself as she bounces on your lap
>you get a good view of her tits bouncing as well
>"Fuck--maintaining erection through--through ongoing coitus. Physical responsiveness is--is acceptable."
>she slams down and sits for a long few seconds
>"Pr-production seems adequate. Temperature still a problem. But I'll solve it. I'm--I'm smart."
>the temperature doesn't feel like a problem
>you're warming up considerably
>feeling more alive by the thrust
>the only problem is...
>you've felt like you were gonna cum from the moment she started
>but you can't
>no matter how hard and fast she thrusts
>over and over again she puts your apparently augmented bones to the test by slamming her full weight down on your lap
>Avery drops down again and slowly grinds with your cock fully inside her
>"I'm so smart. I'm so fuckin' smart."
>with bared fangs she snaps the leash tight
>forcing your to buck up while she grinds down
>like she's trying to mash your pelvis to dust
>"Say it! Say I'm smart! Call me a genius!"
>you grit your teeth and try to speak
"You--Goddamnit!"
>your cock is throbbing and twitching like crazy
>making it impossible to think
>but Avery just keeps grinding, her grip on the leash refusing to slacken
>"Say it!"
>she yanks hard
>your body spasms and your mouth falls open
"You're smart!"
>Avery gasps
>then her body spasms like your own under the lightning rod
>it feels like she's trying to pull your head off with her grip on the leash
>and her thick thighs squeeze you tight
>you think you can feel the plates bolted to your femurs creaking
>Avery yowls triumphantly
>her fur standing on end and her entire body perched rigid on top of you
>then slowly she relaxes
>panting
>shivering
>pupils dilated to needlepoints as she stares down at you
>"I...I am smart aren't I?"
>she wriggles her rear in satisfaction
>making you grit your teeth again
>you still can't cum
>Avery blinks
>"What's wrong?"
>you shake your head
"Can't--cum!"
>Avery frowns
>"Well that's not right. Obviously it's not a fault of my technique. We're in agreement I'm a genius sex goddess."
>you didn't agree to that
>but you can't get more than three words out the way she's wiggling and wobbling while you're still balls deep inside her
>"It may be a problem with the nerves. Long-term fine tuning of neuro-bolts would remedy that. But for the immediate need, I can fix it!"
>your eyes widen
"Not--the--stick!"
>you hope she gets what you mean
>to your momentary relief she does
>"The stimulator? Oh no that won't do."
>you manage almost a sigh when she releases your leash
>but then the snow leopard leans over
>and yanks on a lever set in the floor beside your metal bed
>the bed slowly starts to rise again
>and your stomach, dead and empty as it is, falls through the floor
>"Obviously we'll need continued physical stimulation, combined with a massive electro-shock to cause climax!"
>you try to shake your head no
>but she grabs the leash again
>and starts bouncing again
>then all your can do is squirm and stare at the hypnotic sight of bouncing snow-leopard breasts
>a torrent of rain flows over you as the ceiling opens
>dowsing you both
>she goes on bouncing as you ascend through the roof
>her ass clapping against your thighs with every bounce
>then there's a flash
>BZZZZZZZT
>CRACKOOM
>the lightning rods funnel 300 million volts through your body
>right up your cock
>and into Avery
>you cum harder in death than you've ever done in life
>both your bodies locked rigid by the force of the lightning strike
>you smell burning fur
>your cock feels like it's shooting miniature bolts of electricity
>then it all goes dark
>when you wake up, you're inside again
>Avery is sitting on your lap
>her fur standing up straight at all angles, and singed on the edges
>"W-wow."
>she breaths
>"What a reaction. Probably not the safest to demonstrate to the science board."
>with a sigh, the weight is lifted from your lap
>Avery clicks a switch at the head of the table and the securing bolts around your wrists and ankles click open
>"You can sit up now. We'll get you some pants."
>you go to sit up
>but your body refuses to obey
"Oh. Fuck. I can't feel anything again..."
>Avery frowns
>"Oh no. That lightning strike must have shorted your neuro-bolts. But not to worry!"
>Avery bounces across the lab
>and returns with a set of jumper cables and a car battery in hand
>"I can fix it!"


"_psst!_ Miss!"
Chewing on your lower lip in worry, your gaze drifts to the beach's edge, where a set of swim trunks were being lapped by the waves. Your swim trunks, in fact. The fact that they were *there* on the crowded beach instead of on you was cause for alarm. Peering around the outcropping you were hiding behind, you resumed trying to attract the attention of your nearest fellow beachgoer. This mostly involved lots of furtive waving and trying to strike a balance between shouting and a stage whisper. After all while you needed help you needed the public spectacle and potential citation even less.
Help, in this case, was the lapine woman currently relaxing beneath her beach umbrella. Part of you felt bad for needing to interrupt her calm. She had obviously planned on enjoying a quiet day under the sun - the large umbrella and chair couldn't have been easy to carry out this far. And while she was wearing a bikini top it appeared as if she had leggings on as opposed to a skimpy thong like some of the others nearby. Just a nice day with the sound of waves and the book she was reading, interrupted by the idiot who hadn't bothered to tie his pants on properly.
Your goal at the moment was to get her attention without the rest of the beach noticing your predicament. While you had luckily washed ashore on the far end of the populated section there were still too many potential witnesses for you to risk running several dozen or so yards bare ass. Another wave tugged your trunks that much closer to the water. "Could I get a hand? *Please*?"
Your frantic calling and furtive waving was finally too much for her to block out, leading her to give a visible sigh of frustration and close her book over a finger to keep her place. Still sitting, she turns her head to glare at you and calls out. "What?"
"I, er, could you do me a favor, miss?" You gesture out towards where your trunks were at risk of being claimed by Posideon. "I sort of, you know, *need* those?"
Sweeping her lop ears back from over her eyes, she peers over at you then down to the shorts. For a moment you dread that she's just going to ignore you in favor of her book. Then, shaking her head in clear annoyance, she puts the book down. Getting to her feet, she begins to walk languidly towards the shore.
"Thanks hun!" You're too relieved to notice her stiffen at that word. Thank god for helpful strangers!
Whatever hopes you have about the kindness of strangers are dashed when, rather than returning them to you, she returns to her chair. The trunks are idly tossed to the side next to the towel she has laid out. Then you can only watch in dull shock as she picks the hardcover back up. "Hey! What are you doing? I'm over here!"
The book snaps shuts with a thud loud enough for you to hear as she rises to her feet. There is no hurry in her gait as she calmly walks towards the outcropping, but everything about her body language suggests that an unstoppable force is plummeting your way. She radiates cold anger as she draws closer and closer. You immediately begin to regret ever raising your voice as she comes to a stop well outside of lunging range, arms crossed under her small breasts, and fixes her lavender eyes on you in a silent glare.
"Um... Sorry for, you know, yelling, miss." You try a smile, fighting the urge to cower from a woman who is almost a foot shorter than you. It doesn't help that there's something about her presence that seems to be playing havoc with your subconscious. A part of your brain humming away in the background politely informs you that the previous assumption about her outfit was incorrect. She was, indeed, wearing leggings. Only they stopped mid-thigh. The blue thong was just as skimpy as any of the other bottoms in the distance. Your steadying gulp is audible as you try to turn on the charm. "Could you *please* bring them to me?"
She doesn't say a word as you speak, clearly waiting for you to come to a stammering stop as she transfixes you with her gaze. Only then does she slowly and firmly shake her head in disapproval, the motion causing an ear to flop forward over an eye. When she speaks without having to project over distance her voice is a sultry contralto. Just hearing it feels like velvet running up your spine. "No."
When you start to respond, she holds a paw up, the nails a carefully manicured pink. Your words die in your throat. "No one raises their voice at me. Ever. Do I make myself clear?"
"Yes, miss," you manage. God, *why* were you getting turned on so much?
"Do *not* call me miss again, ever. Or hun. Or any other sort of pet name. Is that clear as well? Good. Now step out from behind there." It was not a request. It was a command.
"Ah, but I'm-" you start, only to be silenced by the barest showing of a scowl. Why on *earth* is it so hard to think straight? The woman's sheer confidence was almost overwhelming. Well... She *did* ask, and she'd block most folks behind her from seeing you. And it'll give you an opportunity to shatter that confidence and turn the tide to your favor. With a shrug, you do as requested, hunched slightly and with both hands covering your crotch.
While her expression of artful, practiced disdain stays the same, you do catch her eyes sweeping down your body. Weighing. Measuring. Perhaps even approving? It's enough to send shivers down your back. As her gaze meets yours again, she arches a brow and speaks dismissively. "You have *terrible* posture. Stand up straight when someone speaks to you."
"Wait, really? Are you, I mean, I'm no-" Your protestations die in your throat under that gaze. Fuck it.
"You asked for it." You do as commanded, letting your arms fall to your side. Basic biological impulses have already started to pump blood to your cock, but to your surprise - and disappointment - she doesn't spare more than a quick glance. Instead, she keeps her eyes locked on yours, as if she's reading your mind and judging what she sees. When she speaks her tone is thoughtful and considerate.
"I have zero intention of getting out of the sight line of anyone on this beach." She's crossed her arms over her chest again, pushing up against the swell of her breasts. It might just be your imagination but her breath seems to have quickened slightly. "Do I make myself clear?"
"Um... You know what? Makes perfect sense. Can't really fault you for that." Whatever burst of bravado filled you earlier is gone. Still standing straight, you try letting your hands fall back to cover your stiffening dick. Your arms are not quite long enough. "Lots of weirdos out there."
"Quite." There's just a faint flicker of disappointment at your efforts to cover yourself again, but a note of approval creeps in her voice when you agree with her. "Since I will not be getting any closer you have two choices. The first? You wait for me to go back to my book. You count to ten. Then you walk over and join me. *Walk*, not run. Running attracts attention. Move calmly and confidently."
"And what's the other choice, m-" You manage to catch yourself from calling her 'miss' again, earning a ghost of a smile that is gone like a lightning flash.
"You say no and deal with the consequences." She twists slightly to look over her shoulder, idly rubbing a nipple through the fabric of her top with a thumb. It's the only concrete sign of her arousal. "And if you *must* call me anything, then 'Mistress' will do. So. Which choice?"
"I guess the first?" Your head is spinning again as you watch her thumb, but you realize the lapine woman's still expecting more from you. She's waiting for you to accept. "I mean, I'll wait until you get there and count to ten, mistress."
"Good. You do know how to count to ten, correct?" With a nod, the sultry rabbit walks away, her broad paws making moving across the sand easy. You are *certain* at this point that the sway in her hips can't be an accident. The other beachgoers are too distracted by their own merrymaking to pay any attention to one lone woman, no matter how magnetic her personality might be. You, meanwhile, risk a glance away from her to the various species frolicking about in the water. And playing frisbee. And volleyball. Holy *shit* are there a lot of people out and about!
By the time you tear your eyes away, the woman, Mistress, has already settled back down in her folding chair and was once again reading. Kicking yourself for getting distracted, you count down. Then, swallowing the lump in your throat, you begin moving as calmly as possible to the square of safety. Your heart is pounding, but even worse, your cock is *throbbing*. You're uncertain whether that's from the unexpected exhibitionism, the danger of getting caught, or the possibility of impressing Mistress.
"You're late." That's said in a dispassionate tone when, after a walk that felt like it took ages, you sit down on the sand next to her chair. Her chair shields you from the view of the others on the beach. She doesn't bother looking at you, too engrossed with the book she's reading to do more than _cluck_ her tongue in disapproval. "I told you to count to ten. Did you forget how?"
"I got distracted," you mumble as you shift, trying to keep your erection under control. "Can I have my trunks back now? Please?"
"No. You kept me waiting *and* you're not speaking clearly. That displeases me. Thirsty?" She reaches into the cooler next to her and pulls out two bottles of water. One she offers to you, which you take, while she presses the other against her neck and chest to cool herself down. Your eyes linger on the drops of condensation that drip onto the dual-toned fur between her breasts before you crack the cap off and take a sip of the cold water. "You have to be punished before I give them back. Is that understood?"
Your mouth goes dry despite the sip you just took. The idea of *displeasing* this woman troubles you for reasons you can't quite understand. So, tentatively, you nod.
"Good." The way she says the word causes electricity to shoot up your spine. Her tone is thoughtful as she continues. "You're embarrassed about being nude, being caught, yes? Then I feel a good punishment is to be even *more* embarrassed. Because you deserve it for making me wait. In fact, you deserve even more. However... I'm feeling merciful today. So the only thing I want is something you'll probably feel the urge to do anyway.
"I want you to masturbate."
It's a jaw dropping statement. That hardly seems like a *punishment*. Hell, it seemed like a reward!
And then the reality of the situation dawns on you when a football lands in front of you, a missed catch. Panic grips you as you look over her legs and see the excited canine male jogging towards the ball. He'll *see* you!
But just before your predicament is noticed, a towel is dropped over your lap. Mistress continues to read while you struggle to keep your composure, able to do little more than offer a responding wave to the man's. When he tries to strike up a conversation, he's cut off by the rabbit. Her tone is curt and, you're relieved to notice, lacks the more sultry aspects from before. "Not. Interested."
"Suit yourself, miss." His tongue lulling out of the side of his mouth, he turns, throws the football back to the group, and jogs back. She throbs with barely contained outrage at the use of 'miss' but then lets it fade. Instead she turns her face expectantly to you.
You *finally* let the breath you were holding out with a relieved _huff_. You move the towel and prepare to get to work, thinking there was no better time than the present, only for the rabbit to _tut tut_.
"If you had asked I'd have let you sit on that towel instead of right on the beach. Go ahead, I'm in no rush." Shifting a bit she watches as you spread the towel out before settling on it. But she interrupts yet again just as your fingers start to encircle your shaft. "You're coated in sand. This is meant to be a punishment, not torture. So...
"Best wash it off first." She lazily holds out her half-drunk bottle of frigid water.
"You're kidding ri-" When you turn to look up at her, you're met with a lavender scowl that makes you shirk back. No, Mistress is evidently *not* kidding. Bracing yourself you do as commanded, the cold water completely killing your erection. After you towel off your flaccid cock, but before you can nurse it back to life, a gray paw reaches down, fingers trailing over your sack and shaft. Her soft touch is only heightened by the feeling of her fur, teasing and caressing. You _groan_ and glance over, but other than leaning over slightly to tickle and tease Mistress is still engrossed in her book. Once you're hard again, she wipes her paw off on top of your head before straightening back up.
"Give me your hand." Offering it in stunned silence you're elated to feel her kissing and licking your palm. Her cheek is just as soft and feels like a furred glove before she gives a final spit, lubricating your palm with drool. Then she sits back up, engrossed in her book while wiping the corner of her mouth on the back of her hand.
The message is clear: get started.
For the first several minutes or so, other than the noises from further up the beach, there's only the soft sound of _squelching_ as you work your shaft and your panting breaths. She never touches you directly again or even deigns to speak. But she does take hold of your wrist and arm to set the speed whenever she feels that you're going too quickly. Whenever she comes to a page-turn in her reading she takes just enough time to pull your palm up to her lips to lubricate it. Clearly she does not plan on this edging torture to end any time soon.
After what felt like an eternity of denied release the relative silence is broken by Mistress, her tone one of boredom, but her voice more sultry than before. "Which of those women over there would you fuck, if given the chance?"
You look past her to a small group of what you assume are college girls; one of them is wearing a T-shirt from the local university. It's an eclectic mix of multiple species, ranging from a buxom vixen in a string bikini to a lithe otter in a one piece to a rather embarrassed looking raccoon. She was the one in a T-shirt, which when combined with her fur only made her seem chubbier than she actually was. They were all scrambling about, throwing a frisbee at one another, cheering loudly at each catch. The question causes your cock to twitch in your hand.
"The fox has those tits and is probably the most adventurous. If you trust the stereotype at least." Mistress turns a page in the book, a slight rasp in her voice as her thighs unconsciously clench and unclench. Even she seems to have a limit to her composure. "The otter is athletic and probably quite flexible; could easily get her knees to her ears. And the raccoon? She is probably the most eager to please of the three , hungry and aching for someone's touch. Rather like how *you* are aching and needing please me."
"I, er... " Your hand continues to work your shaft, your head spinning. Straightening up to get a better view, your gaze drifts down to the rabbit's lap. She is *soaked*, her bikini bottom and the fur of her inner thighs are drenched. Your balls *tighten* at the thought that you've played a part in it.
"It's a simple question. Pick one." Another page is turned while her pink tongue dances across her lips. "Perhaps if you *behave* yourself I'll see about making it happen. As a reward."
"I'd rather just have you." The words escape your dry mouth without bothering to consult your brain.
"Good boy." The honesty is rewarded with a gentle headpat followed by her fingers combing through your hair. "You're smart after all."
You risk twisting your head just enough to kiss her wrist, quivering that you have overstepped. That initially seems to be the case as she draws her hand back. Bracing for a slap your cheek is instead gently caressed.
"A reward for good behavior might be in order." She pulls her hand away again to untuck one of her small breasts from her top, the pink nipple poking out from her gray fur. For the first time since you sat down next to her Mistress deigns to look at you with something approaching affection, sultry eyes sparkling. "I'll allow you to finish now."
"Your turn to fetch it, Cassie!" That's shouted out by the otter just before the frisbee lands with a _thud_ in the sand before you. But it's too late for you to stop, the arousal overwhelming. Mistress gave you permission to cum and you will not disappoint her. Which is why, when the raccoon stoops to pick it up, she catches you furiously masturbating.
The world slows to a crawl. Your heart is in your chest. The onlooker's eyes are wide with shock. And Mistress closes the book and, with the same composure and presence as always, turns in her chair and bends down to take your cock in her mouth.
Rather than simply bobbing down your length she runs her tongue over your head. The chair creaks ominously as it threatens to tip over while she takes one of your balls in her mouth. Only then does she allow her gaze to focus squarely at the other woman. Is it a way to lay claim to you? Another expression of her unspoken authority? You find yourself unable to care as your cock hardens, almost painfully, ramrod straight and swollen. You feel the rabbit's hot breath and the _moan_ as she closes her lips around you.
The racoon woman's jaw has dropped as she stares, engrossed by the sight of your cockhead in Mistress' mouth. You have to brace yourself with your arms behind you to keep from falling back, head lulled dreamily as you _grunt_. For her part, the lapine woman either doesn't notice or, far more likely, doesn't care as she tongues you. Her nose twitches when she takes you completely down her throat. Then your hips jerk and you're cumming with an audible _groan_. Each pulse is swallowed with a thirsty _gulp_, theatrical and loud enough that Cassie could hear. And the whole time, the witness can only watch, entranced, gaze drifting from your cock to the one exposed breast and back.
Releasing your drained cock Mistress sits back up, her composure never once shattered as she licks her lips. Patting the top of your head in approval with one hand, she fixes the raccoon with a thoughtful gaze. Her tongue lulls out enough to show the last ropes of your jizz before she dreamily swallows. The rabbit runs her fingers over your shoulder while pressing a finger against her lips with a soft _shh_ aimed at the onlooker. That seems to break the spell and the raccoon stiffly rises to her feet. The other woman stumbles back towards her friends on unsteady legs. You're left with the impression that this is a moment Cassie will replay in her head over and over tonight as she repeatedly brings herself to climax.
"Good boy." The rabbit's words send a jolt of pleasure through your body and a final twitch through your cock. Then she drops your trunks onto your lap. "You've earned these."
"Thank you, Mistress. Um. May I ask you a question?" When she nods, you continue, pulling your trunks back on quickly. "What would have happened if I'd, you know, said 'no'?
"I'd have thrown your pants at you, gone back to reading, and had nothing else to do with you. And wouldn't *that* have been a shame." It's another statement of fact instead of a question. In the distance Cassie and her friends were huddled together in discussion, their gazes darting furtively at you. This isn't lost on Mistress who lets out an annoyed sigh before stretching her arms in the air. You have one last look at her breast before it's tucked back away.
"I've had enough of the beach for today... " She languidly begins to pack up her things while you recover. "You have nothing else planned until tomorrow, correct?
"Help me carry my things to my car and join me. I need someone to brush the sand out of my fur before we shower."

>Haha! And the humanist honestly thought their human candidate is gonna win the race? Nah, they need to remind themselves where they belong!
>In the kitchen, Stacey!

>You've dine your best to hold out but you can tell you're nearing the finish, you'll be surprised if you can walk in the morning but god is it worth it for this experi-only for her to abruptly stop, grabbing your srms and holding you down with surprisingly little wiggle room
>The blue balling burns, and for all your worry the irritation you're feeling burns even harsher.

>such tales did nothing but scare the younger men and make them jumpy
>Which made them a liability
>things were hard enough out on the icy ocean without some teenaged fool jumping at shadows and falling overboard
>so as headman, chosen by the chief of the village, you set an example, scorning the stories and accusing the tale-tellers of being weak-minded like the southerners
>for the most part that shut them up
>They knew you were right, or at least knew you would beat them in a duel if they challenged you
>But this tale…
>They kept babbling on about it
>”I saw its eyes, boss! Beneath the waves!”
>the man was beside himself, shivering despite his heavy furs, harpoon shaking in his white-knuckle grip
>”It's a bloody seal, you moron,” you tell him, poking him in the shoulder
>”It’s not a normal seal, sir,” said another man, one of the young lads who’d come along for his first fishing trip
>”It's the Shreen.”
>”Bloody boy, I will knock your head off if you start that shit again! You spent too much time sucking your mother’s teat and listening to fairy stories! There ain’t no ghost seal! There ain't no curse!”
>The two men shrink back, shamed, but several of the others seemed spooked
>You snarl, frustrated
>You'd had to cut short a day’s work because of this nonsense
>You sigh, and step up to the starboard side of the ship, taking in the thrumming arcs of the aurora as it lights up the night
>The sea is calm, the black waters broken up here and there by floating lumps of ice
>Your kind of place
>cold enough to keep the southerners away, wild enough for a man to prove himself
>then you see the eyes
>Glassy, reflective plates, like the silver mirrors the traders used to bring north with them
>Staring right at you
>A cold shiver runs down your spine as you meet their gaze
>the eyes of a seal stare back at you
>But not a normal seal
>You'd hunted those before, and they'd been good strong prey
>but this thing was a predator
>Just from the murky impression you had you could tell it was a big, lean creature
>the silver eyes held yours, before tilting to one side, as if curious
>throwing off your fright, you bare your teeth, raising your harpoon to throw
>the eyes vanish, and the half-seen shape of the creature’s body turns, moving off with distressing speed
>you watch as it goes, following its trajectory across the bay your boat is moored in
>At one end of the bay, in the direction of the creature’s departure, sits the half-flooded ruins of an old fort
>you grimace, and turn back to your men
>”Boss, what is it?” one asks
>”It’s the Shreen! Isn't it boss-”
>”Shut it, the lot of you!” you yell, and point your harpoon towards the ruins
>”Take us over there. Whatever it is, I'll kill it.”
>You stand in the doorway of the ruined fort
>You've no idea who built this place, and you don't really care
>history, like jewelry and reading, was something for women and southerners
>your men, simpering cowards that they were, had dropped you off at the coast
>you had loudly proclaimed that none of them were worthy of accompanying you
>you’d let them simmer in their shame until you came back with the beast’s head
>you proceed inwards, passing under the rough stone arch and into the gloomy murk of the dilapidated structure
>the water here was ankle deep, and still as glass
>your footsteps are the only disturbance
>here and there, though, you can see deeper pools, leading into hollows and flooded chambers now claimed by the sea
>you make your way deeper, your harpoon clutched in your brawny fists
>It’s several minutes before you hear a sound
>a drip
>tensed, you turn, and see an icicle shaking, barely held to the crumbling ceiling, another head of water welling at its tip
>you shake your head and turn back to continue deeper
>the beast states back at you
>eyes like reflective gemstones staring at you from the dark
>for a moment it is motionless, before it gently move forwards, out of the shadowy pool and into a beam of aurora-light shining from a crack in the wall
>the seal, now revealed, its slick fur spotted like an ice-leopard, stares at you from the pool it occupies
>its predatory snout splits, lips pulling back from gums, revealing a horrifying array of monstrous flesh-tearing teeth
>this would be bad enough, the sight of this monstrous predator, but you had a heart of ice
>you were strong
>or so you thought
>the beast begins to laugh, its voice an uncanny imitation of a human being
>the shock of it makes you take a step back, makes you blink in shock
>you grit your teeth and steel yourself
>”Face me, monster! I am-”
>”Meat,” the monster says, amused. “You are meat.”
>once more panic fills your bones but you force yourself into action, lunging forward with your harpoon to spear the creature’s neck
>it vanishes, plunging into the pool and through a flooded doorway underwater
>you hear the laughter echoing through the ruins
>you suddenly realise that coming in here alone may have been a mistake
>you begin to move, making your way back towards the exit as the Shreen, and it could only be a Shreen, stalked you through the ruins, emerging from pools only to dart away at the last moment and back into the sunken chambers
>several times the demon-seal lunged at you from pools of water, its jaws snapping shut on empty air
>panicking yet still brave enough to fight you jab at it, only for your harpoon to miss every thrust
>as you round another corner you spot the exit, the way back to your ship and crew
>you begin to run
>only for the monster to leap from a pool ahead of you
>the sheer scale of the trouble you are in reveals itself
>the Shreen is no leopard seal
>it wears the guise of one, its head and fur the duplicate of its natural cousins
>but it's body is that of a woman, swollen to unnatural size
>she stands before you, huge clawed arms spread wide, her body even more muscular than your own, her gleaming eyes alive with cruel amusement
>”Running away, are we, meat? I'm not done with you yet.”
>the monster runs her tongue across her lips and chuckles
>you snarl
>”Begone, demon! Or I will slay you!”
>you sound a lot braver than you feel
>the Shreen, backlit by the aurora spilling in through the entryway, tilts her head
>”Slay me, will you? Like you slew my kin, who came to beg for scraps from your boat?”
>you blink, uncomprehending
>you’d killed seals before, yes, but nothing like this monster
>”What? They were only animals-”
>”They were innocent! You killed them for sport!”
>the creature licks her lips again
>”So now I'll make sport of you, MEAT!”
>She moves, her towering body moving distressingly quickly
>you have to fight!
>despite the chilling fear in your bones you lunge out with your harpoon, only for the Shreen to dodge aside
>The manoeuvre gives you a moment’s space to roll under her attack, a clawed hand tearing the air inches from your face
>you’re past her, but to run for the exit now would see her run you down before you got anywhere near
>so you back away, keeping your harpoon pointed at her heart
>she looks at the weapon and her horrible grin resurfaces
>”Are you going to stick me with that, mighty hunter? Oh, how terrifying”
>she comes straight for you
>you strike, thrusting with all your strength
>the Shreen moves aside again, but not fast enough
>elation fills you as the harpoon buries itself in the meat of the seal’s shoulder
>she grunts in pain
>and grabs the haft of your weapon
>you try to pry it away, but with no luck
>panicking, you yank, pull and-
>a massive, monstrous fist catches you in the gut
>you gasp, all the air driven from your lungs as you are flung backwards and into an ancient wall
>gulping for air, clutching your abdomen, you try and fail to rise as the Shreen advances on you, her hungry grin splitting her snout
>she reaches up and pulls the harpoon out of her shoulder with a grunt of effort
>bright red blood stains her spotted fur
>she licks it from the tip of your weapon
>”A strong strike, little meat, but not strong enough,”
>she takes ahold of the harpoon and snaps the haft in two, before throwing it into a nearby pool
>that dealt with, she saunters over to you and grabs you by a fistful of hair
>she starts to drag you, making you gasp in pain and struggle as the huge monster takes you deeper into the ruins
>”Release me, you vile creature! I have hunted fiercer things than you!”
>that gets a genuine laugh out of the massive seal-woman
>”Oh? A hunter are you?”
>she throws you ahead of her, sending you rolling through the shallow puddles of icy water
>she spreads her arms out wide
>”Then I will show you what it means to be prey, little meat!”
>she begins to chase you again
>you run, sprinting through the dark
>only this time, you realise you’re running deeper into the ruins
>the air grows more chill and dank with every step
>you hear the BOOM of the seal diving into the flooded underground
>the noise of the water echoing through the whole structure
>and you keep running deeper
>this is bad
>you try to double back, to head towards the exit again, but each time she lunges out of the shadows, her jaws snapping at your heels
>she’s toying with you, tiring you out
>driving you deeper into this place where she can play with you at her leisure
>you can’t keep going like this, you have to make a stand now, before cold and exhaustion rob you of your only chance of fighting back
>you skid to a halt in a dripping, gloomy antechamber
>you force yourself to calm down, to still your breathing
>you stalk silently over to a dark corner with a good vantage of the way in
>and pick up a fist sized lump of ancient stone from the floor
>and wait
>you sit there, still as the grave, a hunter awaiting the sign of his prey
>you can hear her moving about on this level
>plunging into the water, then emerging elsewhere
>occasionally a growl or cackle echoes through the halls
>or a taunting call
>”Where are you, meat? Are you hiding from me?”
>she’s close
>you remain absolutely still
>she enters the chamber
>she moves silently, stalking forwards
>she doesn’t see you until you strike
>you lunge at her, swinging the rock at her skull
>the impact is savage, whipping her head to the side
>she roars in pain, stumbling, and you lift the stone again
>one more hit and-
>she grabs you, her clawed hands wrapped around your waist
>you swing, but she dodges your attack
>lifts you up
>and slams you into the ground
>you nearly black out from the pain, the rock falling from your hand
>he shock of the impact and the sudden chill of the icy water filling your bones
>you gasp for air, try and wriggle out of her iron grip
>but she has you
>her snarling face sneers at you from above
>she winces slightly, a little blood running from the side of her head
>”You know, meat, maybe you aren’t quite as useless after all”
>she licks her lips, running her tongue across the terrifying array of teeth that make up her smile
>”Maybe I’ll keep you”
>you are still shivering, the icy water stealing your body’s warmth
>she tears off your furs, appraising your body with her hungry eyes
>god knows what she wants with
>she hold you down with one hand and flicks your genitals with the other
>you quail
>surely not
>surely this creature won’t-
>your thoughts are interrupted by the sensation of the Shreen’s warm, fat tongue running up your abdomen
>you gasp, both at the sick sensation and the worryingly pleasant warmth of her touch
>you’re so cold
>the heat of her wet tongue felt so good on your skin
>you shiver
>her tongue goes lower
>you moan as she bathes your genitals in spittle, her tongue coating both your cock and balls with a single forceful lick
>your body is responding with enthusiasm
>you want to be warm
>you don’t want to be eaten
>you’ll do anything she wants
>you try and focus, to fight
>but there’s no use
>you don’t resist as she drags you up onto a dry slab, poking out of the water
>or when she presses her muscular body against yours
>she laughs mockingly as you cling to her, instinctively seeking the warmth of her furry form
>”oh, given up, have we? Where’s the mighty hunter now?”
>you turn your head away in shame, but she grabs you by the jaw
>”What are you?”
>”I’m meat,” you whimper, the words ash in your mouth
>”Yes, good meat, you’re going to be my little pet now, you know that?”
>you nod
>she snorts with amusement, nostrils flaring in her blunt snout
>then she rapes you
>her body pinning you to the slab
>her claws drawing blood as she grips you with savage strength
>you cry out as she takes your cock inside her
>she’s so warm, the powerful muscles of her cunt sucking you in
>it almost hurts
>you lay there, humiliated and broken, as she humps you, riding you for the sake of her pleasure alone
>you wince at every meaty impact, your hips and back bruising under her onslaught
>she runs her tongue across your face, forcing it into your mouth
>you can’t fight her off
>you submit, unmanned and humbled by a monster that hunts men
>her teeth scrape across your skin, drawing cries of pain
>she laps at the wounds, savouring the taste of your flesh
>you feel her accelerating, growing agitated
>her cunt feels even tighter, nearly pulling you off the floor on every upstroke
>the sloppy meat sounds of her assault on your hips growing faster and faster
>then she clenches, her whole body pulling you into a crushing embrace
>she roars in pleasure, in triumph, as she cums, her cunt disgorging a flood of slick, warm fluid all over your groin
>after a few moments of her panting on your face, tongue hanging loose as she shudders in delight, she stands
>the sensation of your cock finally slipping free from her pussy’s deathgrip with a *pop* sends you over the edge
>you cum, spurting all over yourself, whimpering in shame
>the Shreen laughs
>”heh, you’re pathetic, meat. It’s cute. Come on, I’m hungry, maybe I’ll let you beg for scraps from my next hunt”
>and you were never seen again
>another victim of the Shreen to populate the tall tales of spooked fishermen

>Skaven are notorious for being scheming little shitstains, every single one having their own agenda and view that they are the only competent rat around while everyone else is holding them down.
>Ogres are similarly cunning when it comes to extorting food, money (for food), or any other business (usually for food), though are definitely on the duller end of the intelligence spectrum.
>Combining the two creates a beast that has none of the benefits of either and all of the downsides, at least mentally, practically making rat ogres near if not completely non-sapient; it's even debated that they hardly qualify as sentient at all, requiring the guidance of another skaven to even function properly.
>Of course, not every rat ogre is the same, especially when a skaven mutator wants to enact their own secret plans and create a strain of beasts that could potentially outclass every other rat ogre.
>This one, for example, seems to have an unintended, more muted bloodlust and hints of buried sapience under her rearing years of "murder-kill-kill"-ing anything and everything (that which lead to her "creator" being murder-kill-killed by her in classic skaven hubris, something he realized as he was choking on his own blood that he neglected to instruct that HE wasn't a part of everything and everyone), including a fascination with man-things that doesn't immediately end in leaving them a red-stained splatter on the ground.
>Or, at least, one particular man, who isn't sure what in the everloving name of Sigmar to do with the impossibly passive monster that he was convinced didn't even exist just a week ago

>Human soldier/commander is the one to land the final blow on some weird, fancily ornamented leader rat in the middle of a heated battle while his two massive guards are distracted with the rest of his squad
>Left barely standing in the end, completely exhausted with his squad nowhere in sight (probably dead), and the sound of both rat giants approaching. He expects to die but at least he'll have gone out having dealt a successful blow to the scourges moral
>Next thing he knows instead of being pulped by a pair of raging rodent monsters they both apparently decided with their master dead then his killer might as well make the best choice for their next charge
>Now he has a pair of towering, heavily armored rat woman (and wouldn't that have been a surprise the first night after they shucked nude and manhandled him into a sleep-rest pile) following him everywhere
>And they're extremely possessive of their new 'cute man-thing lord' (and incredibly horny too)

>a petite leopard, in a pristine white button-up with a red tie with black slacks
>you try not to look to closely at the way they're snug to her thighs

>you smile, brought back to the moment
"Just a water for now, I'm waiting for someone."
>she bobs her head
>"Ooh! A date! Good luck."
>she fills a glass with ice and water and slides it across the bar to you
>you thank her and take a sip
>then you sidle away from the bar so a paying customer can take your spot
>you arrived a little early so you find an empty spot along the wall and watch the room
>it's a quiet night, but the room has a few patrons at the tables and booths
>it's kind of relaxing being with your thoughts while the soft conversation buzzes around you

>when it's empty you check your phone

"Another water."
>the bartender flicks an ear
>which you just notice is pierced with a diamond stud
>it's cute
>her ears are extra fluffy too
>"Hey, you listening hon?"
>you blink
"Sorry, what was that?"
>she has her paws on her hips
>"You invite a girl out to a bar and only get water?"
"Still waiting. Plus I don't drink much."
>the bartender puffs her cheeks in exaggerated exasperation
>"You gotta have a little something. Liquid courage for your date."
>you roll your eyes
"Alright fine. Just a beer."
>the smile returns to her muzzle and she pulls a pint from the tap
>it's a pale golden brew that has an earthy scent
>"Here you go! My personal favorite."
>you take a sip, finding the drink pleasantly crisp
>you give the bartender a thumbs up
>"Cheers hon."
>you wander back to your little corner and wait

>and finally you return to the bar with an empty glass to pay your tab
>the leopard leaves a couple on the other end of the bar and greets you with another bright smile
>"Anything else I can getcha?"
>you set the empty glass on the bar and shake your head
"Nah. Just gonna close out."
>her smile immediately drops, and her tail and ears slump
>"What's the matter hon?"
>you shake your head and pull out a bill to cover the beer plus a tip
"No-show. It happens."
>the leopard huffs, her fur puffing up as her sorrow turns to indignance
>she crosses her arms across her chest
>"That's not right, standing up a cute thing like you!"
>you find your face heating up a little at the compliment
>but write it off as her just being nice
>you've never thought of yourself as good looking by human standards
>you shrug
"It happens. I'll try again some other time."
>the anger burns away to sadness again
>she slides the twenty back over the table
>"It's on the house tonight, hon. But if you wanna stick around, I could use a little company."
>she gestures to the mostly empty bar
>"Not exactly an exciting Tuesday night."
>you sigh
>may as well
>you're already out and you could use another drink
>maybe a bite
>you sit down on a stool and lean against the bar
>"So what's your name hun?"
>you tell her your name
>she giggles and bobs her head as she pours another beer
>"Anon! I like it. Very mysterious."
"Ah well. It's a family name."
>she giggles again
>you find yourself enjoying the sound
>"I'm Tara. Like Sara with a T."
>it's your turn to laugh
"It fits. Very cute."
>that sets the bubbly feline off again
>her tail threatening to overturn bottles and glasses as she flicks it side to side in satisfaction
>"Aren't you a charmer?"
>you find yourself blushing again
>wringing your hands a little nervously
>she keeps staring at you with those bright blue eyes
>even as she pulls a couple bottles and a lowball glass
>"Here, hon. Try some of this."
>you blink
"Oh, I'm not uh, much for liquor."
>Tara just chuffs
>and leans over the bar to flick your chin up playfully
>"Just a pick-me-up. Take little sips and you'll be alright."
>after mixing a few different things into the glass
>she sets the wide-mouth glass in front of you
>"And the finishing touch..."
>she pulls out a mint leaf from beneath the bar
>and she's about to drop it in your glass when a voice on the other end calls for attention
>a couple customers yelling for drinks
>the leopard rolls her eyes
>"I'll be right back."
>then she lifts the mint leaf to her lips
>kisses it
>then drops it in your drink
>Tara turns and leaves with a wink and lash of her tail
>leaving you staring into the glass with your face burning
>Tara bounces from one customer to the next
>you watch her work with new appreciation
>she handles the bottles nimbly, and always has a big bright smile
>and her ass is amazing in those little-too-small pants
>the drink she gave you is pretty good as well
>tangy and citrussy, and not too heavy for you
>but you must be a lightweight because you feel a little giddy by the time Tara returns to lean over the bar
>"So whaddya think hun?"
>her eyes twinkle as she bounces from one paw to another
>her hips swaying back and forth
"I love it."
>you hold up the glass and take another drink
>Tara beams and flutters her eyes at you
>"You are so sweet hon! Why don't I fix you another and you can tell me a little about yourself..."
>after that the night seems to fly by
>you get a meal from the kitchen, and Tara plies you with new concoctions to try
>every time she watches you take a taste she bites her lip in anticipation and demands to know your opinion
>whenever she's on your end the bar, the night seems so much brighter
>you pass the time chatting and joking with the bubbly bartender
>she's only tending bar part-time while she works on her degree
>"A masters in Supply Chain Management!"
>she proclaims proudly with a puffed up chest
>at some point in the night she must have undone her tie
>it hangs half-undone around her neck
>you nod approvingly of the study and the fashion choice
"Impressive. All I studied was uh...you know, welding."
>Tara chuffs
>"I like a working man. A little tough guy who earns his pay."
>that had set you both laughing as she goes to answer more orders
>when she comes back, the top couple buttons of her shirt has come undone
>revealing some very impressive chest fluff
>Tara asks about hobbies next
>you're embarrassed to admit your rather nerdy interests
>but she gasps and hops in place
>"Oh! I've heard of that game! You should teach me to play. I saw my brother building those little wizard guys, I could totally try!"
>this time she gives you a quarter glass of red wine
>"Just a taste. I know you've had a lot but I picked a good one this time."
>you take a taste
>because you have had a lot, for you
>it's warm, and slightly sweet
>you swirl it in a hand and ask about Tara's hobbies
>"Oh I play volleyball! It's too cold to play at the lake though."
>she pouts
>then puffs up again
>"Oh and I watch those cute Japanese movies! Like the one with the girl and the magic walking castle! I have the whole collection."
>oh!
>you love those movies
"I've seen a few of those! The spirit world one was always my favorite."
>Tara peaks her chin up and lets out a satisfied chuffing sound
>then you feel soft fur against your hand as she leans over the bar to take the hand hand that holds your wine glass
>and lift it to her lips for a taste
>she watches you past lowered eyelids as she does so
>then stands and swallows
>"Mmh. I knew I picked a good one. I'll be right back cutie."
>you watch her go with your jaw dropped
>only just managing to pick it up when she's back
>"Well hon, it looks like you closed out the bar."
>you blink, and then look around the room
>you're the last person here
"How long have I...?"
>Tara giggles
>"Not THAT long. We're closing early for the holiday."
>you start to stand, but stumble a little as you do
>Tara looks concerned, and gestures back at the stool
>"Why don't you sit down, hon. I'll stay with you tonight."
>you must have heard her wrong
>but you gladly take a seat again
>and instead start reaching for your wallet
"How much do I owe you?"
>once again Tara waves off payment
>"Don't worry about it sweetie."
>you cock your head in confusion
>a pity beer after getting stood up is one thing
>but she's been plying you with drinks half the night
"I can afford it."
>Tara laughs
>"Don't you worry about a thing. I'll pay for your drinks."
>oh
>you nod slowly
>Tara giggles
>"You're so cute when you blush, you know that?"
>that just makes you blush more
>which just makes Tara giggles more
>she suddenly bounces up, her face brightening
>"Hey! While we're waiting, why don't we play a little game? A drinking game!"
>you shake your head slowly
>you're already feeling a little fuzzy, a drinking game seems like a bad idea
"I've already had a lot..."
>Tara pouts, her ears flopping and muzzle curling into a frown
>"Aw, it'll be real easy hon, I promise. Just two shots. One for you, one for me."
>you hate to disappoint her
>especially after she's kept you company all night
>you chew your lip
"Alright. Just one shot."
>Tara beams again, cheery as ever
>then she waves her paws in your face
>"Okay! I'll get it ready, you...you just close your eyes and wait for me, okay?"
>you kind of want to question her
>but what the hell
>you shut your eyes
>the first thing you hear is another of Tara's giggles
>then glasses and other things being moved about
>a bottle set down
>and then a soft 'hup' and the bar creaking in front of you
>"Okay, keep your eyes closed, then I'll give you a shot and you drink it!"
"It's not a shot of hot sauce or something is it?"
>you feel something furry bat you on the face
>"What kind of girl do you think I am? No peeking!"
>you roll your eyes behind their lids
>but nod your head
"Alright. Let me have it."
>you hear something being poured into a glass
>then again
>"Okay! It's right in front of you."
>you reach out
>but feel something warm and fuzzy instead
>Tara giggles
>probably just her paw
>"Bit to the right hon."
>following her direction, your fumbling fingers find the shot glass
>and you take hold of it
>"Okay, so when I say, you take the shot and open your eyes."
>she counts down
>you brace yourself for a mouthful of hot sauce
>"Three. Two. One."
>you pick up the shot and throw it back
>and at the same time open your eyes
>you choke
>first because whatever was in that glass tastes like pure rubbing alcohol
>and second because the sight that greets your eyes is Tara seated on the bar half dressed
>she looks down at you with lidded eyes and a smug grin
>her tie still hangs loosely around her neck, but now runs down ove bare fur
>her shirt undone to show a whole lot of fluff
>toned stomach
>and perky breasts that bounce as she giggles
>her lower half is nearly bare as well
>nothing but functional white panties
>and a pair of plush, soft looking thighs
>that you realize now you're trapped between as she leans forward
>revealing pink nipples when the motion makes her shirt fall away
>"Oh hon, was that a little harsh for you? It's okay. Let me show you how to do a tequila shot."
>the leopard reaches beside her and plucks a salt shaker off the bar
"First, a little salt."
>she holds out a thumb to sprinkle some salt on it
>then she holds that thumb to your lips
>without thinking you open them for her to push the thumb against your tongue
>Tara shudders
>her tail lashes
>she pulls her paw back and picks up the shot
>"Then you drink."
>instead of feeding it to you, she pour the drink into her own maw
>then kisses you!
"Mmh?"
>you try to gasp
>only for her to force her tongue into your mouth
>the bitter taste of cheap tequila mixes with the warm, slightly sweet taste of Tara
>force-feeding your alcohol as her tongue slides over yours in a french kiss fills your mouth with tequila and leopard in equal measure
>you have to swallow just to keep from choking
>but she goes on kissing you
>until you're breathless
>Tara breaks the kiss with an airy giggle
>"Oh dear. I think that's one too many..."
>she traces a paw up your chin so you look into her eyes
>right now she's the most beautiful woman you've ever seen
>"I'll just have to take you home myself~'
>Tara reaches beside her again
>this time picking up a lime wedge
>"Finish with some lime, to get the taste of something better in your mouth."
>she takes the lime and puts it to her chest
>"Oh!"
>she gasps as she runs it over one nipple
>then the other
>before pressing the bitter fruit to your lips
>you suck greedily
>and swallow
>Tara smiles down at you
>"Cheers~"

It would be E-thot furstreamers doing that to horndog high-school seniors & frustrated college freshman
Kidslop would be focused on fantastical adventures of the mc(s) with their childhood anthro friend with heavy undercurrents of romantic focus, females taking a superior position, and 'normalizing' the acceptance of the rougher forms of waifur affection (bites, scratches, etc)

You stare at the blinding red and blue lights reflected in your rearview mirror.
Just what you need, a cop on your ass.
You swear there was enough time for you to beat the red light, but that doesn’t matter now. Hopefully, you can plead with the officer and get him to let you off with a scolding and a warning.
You hear the officer’s boots saunter up to your window but you keep your eyes straight ahead. You’ve seen enough live leaks to know sudden movements will only give you more trouble.
“License and registration, sir”
Oh, it’s a woman cop. That could be good, you might be able to wring some pity out of her. Maybe even work some of your charms on her.
“Sir, show me your license and registration.”
Maybe it’ll even lead to something fun~ or at least funny that you can tell the guys about.
“SIR” She pounds the side of your driver door, “I will not ask again, license and registration!”
You snap out of your ill-timed idle thoughts and realize you haven’t even looked at this bitch yet. You turn your head and look at the officer.
Oh. Fuck.
She is a bitch; like, a literal bitch.
Glaring at you through your window, you see it is one of those new Anthro-women you’ve heard about over the internet; well, new to you. You don’t get out much, so you’ve never personally seen one; but apparently, these freaks of nature spread themselves all over the country just a couple of years ago. You were hoping that it was all just some shitposts, but this aggravated Doberman’s presences begs to differ.
You grimace and hand her your papers. You wish you could just leave this half beast freak, but she is a real cop, as far as you can tell, so you reluctantly comply and hope you can still get let off with a warning.
She holds up your license and studies it’s photograph of you and your face. Scribbling who knows what on her notepad.
God, why did you have to run into one of these, these … things?! Looking at it feels so wrong, unnatural. It’s the same feeling you get seeing one of those fetish weirdos walked on a leash or those adults who are way too old for Bisneylan---
“Sir, you know that running a red light is a traffic violation, right? Doesn’t matter if it was yellow when you entered the intersection; you’re supposed too ---”
SHE’S GOING TO TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT. THAT … THAT, BITCH. You can’t let her treat you like a child who just learned to drive. You’re probably even a little older than her given how new the Anthro situation is. You’ve had enough of this thing. You interrupt her, “I don’t need all that BARKING from something that can’t even see what COLOR the lights are!”
Her eyes narrow.
“Excuse me?!”
You spit some venom, “You’re excused, freak.”
She stops leaning against your car window and stands up straight, pulling her ears back. She simmers and spits back, “Okay, buddy. I don’t know what your deal is, or why you decided on bigotry today. But I am in no mood for it. Maybe you had a tough day; I know I certainly have, but that doesn’t give you the excuse to---”
You roll your eyes and flap your fingers and palm in that yapping motion you’ve seen teenagers make. Gonna belittle you? You can play the same game.
She scowls. “Whatever, I was planning on just giving you a warning, but you’ve talked your way into a ticker sir. Wait right here while I get my ticket book from my cruiser. I will be back.”
She starts walking back to her car. Great, a ticket. You mutter under your breath, “Fucking bitch.”
In your side mirror, you can see her stop and her ears perk up. She growls and begins to huff and puff, muttering a quiet but stern, “Not now” under her breath.
>Whatever. Sounds like she’s about to sperg out so you reach for your keys in the center console so you can dip. She’s away from your car, out of hers, and her cruiser isn’t even idling. You might have a couple seconds head start to run. Heck maybe a full minute.
>You pick up your keys from the center console and they make a small jingle sound. But before you can stick them into the transmission, you feel a woosh. The cop is clenching your arm with the keys. How’d she, how’d sh-?
>“Not. So. Fast.” she growls, “attempting to escape a police stop is a crime and warrants detainment.”
>You try to slide from her grip, but you can’t, she has an iron grip. Instead, she says … no … commands you to “step out of the vehicle” before quickly popping open your car door and dragging you out of your seat. You land belly first on the road and she presses her knee down your back. You can feel the weight from her leg alone is enormous. She’s borderline crushing you as she cuffs you.
>She pants and huffs while reciting what sounds like the Miranda rights to you, dragging you in your cuffs. “You have the obligation to remain silent until spoken to. Anything you say can and will be used against you as punishment. You have the right to talk, when I say so, if you beg. You have the obligation to be obedient during questioning. If you cannot obey, you will be forced to, if that’s what you wish. If you decide to be a good boy …” she slams your back and head against what you guess is the side of her police car door, “I MIGHT be gentle”.
>In your now blurred vision, you look up at her towering frame, and spit into the dirt. She’s far taller than even you thought, at least seven feet tall; and even for a Doberman woman, she seems quite well built. Her shoulders and hips give her a square yet shapely figure, well balanced and toned. She must be well exercised, no running out of this one, you’ll have to think of something more sly.
>She pants and stands almost on top of you, blocking out the light from a streetlamp above. “Usually … humies like meeting an Anthro. Why are you different? Hmm? Why the hate for anthros?” She keeps panting as if she’s somehow out of breath. “Did your mommy not love you enough, humie?”
>“Oh? My momma? You wanna talk about mommas? I bet that’s because you must not have one. Cause’, I mean, you freaks surely aren’t born naturally. Look at you. You must be from some god damn test tube. Because there is no way someone would have sex with something that looks like you. Half person, half beast. All abomination. And somehow all of you look like you’re women?! That’s how I know some pervert made you.” You spit into the dirt for extra effect, you’re really on a roll here. “That’s why I hate anthros, all of your bodies disgust me.”
>“Oh” her tone changes, the growls mellowing but the sauciness growing, “Anthros are made the natural way, but it seems you need to be a little more educated in what anthros are really like. Perhaps even, given some … instructional correction. As a representative of the state” her brow lowers, casting shadows onto her growing sneer of a smile, “I’d be more than willing to provide such discipline.” She pulls out her gun and holds it at her side.
>You’ve got no idea what’s going on at this point, but punishment? From this thing? You want out. Now. “ALRIGHT LADY, just throw me in the back of your wagon and get this over with, okay? I’ll pay whatever fines I owe at the statio---”
>She firmly interrupts you, “Stop talking.” And then she drops the gun.
>You see her hands … paws? whatever; move from her hips to the clip of her belts, popping them open one by one. The gun belt, then the utility band, and then her pants belt. Each of them springing open with a deep pant from her.
>You can’t tell if she’s about to switch to some belt with even worse weapons on it, or if she’s taking them off just to beat you up with them. “Listen lady. I don’t know what you’re doing right now. But it’s starting to wig me out.” You jerk fruitlessly against your handcuffs, the lock won’t budge. “Look” You try to be diplomatic, “I’m sorry for being an ass. Please let me go, I’ll---”
>“Stop. Talking.”
>You can see her whole-body heave with each breath. The clouds of her condensed exhales in the cold air billow from her snout like an angry bull. Her sweat runs in rivulets down from her forehead, across her cheeks, and along the underside of her jaw before dripping onto your body.
>You try to scramble away from her, but between the slippery dirt on the road and the heavy cop car behind you, it’s too easy for her to grab your head with one hand and hold you in place. With the other hand, she unzips her uniform’s pants. Revealing her throbbing anthro pussy.
>You finally realize what’s about to happen. Tears well up in your eyes, “Please. Stop, please.” You heave with little sobs while she uses a hand on the roof of her car to balance herself. She swings her legs behind your back and slides your head into the vice of her thigh gap. You cry as she gets closer, “I’m sorry for what I said! Okay?! I don’t like anthros but … b-but I didn’t have to be mean! I admit it! Just don’t---”
>“STOP.” She pants, “TALKING.”
>She slams her anthro pussy straight into your face. Oh god. It actually touched you. Fuck. At least you closed your mouth before it actually hit, maybe it’ll be over quick. Please god, let it be over quick, you cope.
>She starts to slowly grind up against your face, thrusting her hips into your head. She shudders a little and groans, “That’ll … shut you up.”
>It’s revolting. Violating. You try to squirm away but her legs keep you from getting away. You can’t say anything without opening your mouth, otherwise you’ll end up tasting her canine pussy. All you can hear is the distant music of her car radio, her labored breath, and the sticky squish of her lips over your mouth and against your nose. Despite it’s doggy look, it actually smells a lot like human pussy, albeit a bit muskier, earthy-ier. You close your eyes and pray it’ll end.
>“You’re not leaving … until you start cooperating” she moans, “with the law.”
>Oh god. She seriously expects you to pleasure her. You feel sick to your stomach, but then, you have an idea. If she wants you to open your mouth, you think mischievously, maybe you should.
>You wait and time her thrusts. When she pulls back, you throw your mouth so wide open that her whole mound pops all the way in. She moans, “Finally.” And you bite down, hard.
>Her breath hitches and lets loose throaty giggles, “Mhmmm, love bites already?”
>What the fuck? Was that trade for nothing? You didn’t even break the skin. If her genitals are this tough, how thick is the rest of her hide?
>“Come on~, don’t stop there. It’s not enough!” She isn’t pulling back much further now, so her cookie is wedged in your mouth. Her huge sex, growing engorged with her rising arousal, corks your face hole. You can feel her lips rub the sides of your mouth. Back, forth. Back, forth. Back, forth.
>You try biting and chewing to no avail; worse, it just makes her moan louder. Her lips feel so damn meaty in your mouth, like a slab of prime rib wedged in between your jaws. The taste is … surprisingly … pleasant? You were worried it would be the way wet dog smells. But, it also tastes a lot like human pussy, albeit a fair bit stronger. The earthy and metallic notes are also well pronounced too in her thick grool. It slowly oozes out across your tongue and down your throat. You almost didn’t even notice that your tongue started prodding her opening, pushing and toying with her hot folds.
>“Hehehe. Are you finally starting to enjoy yourself?” She coos. She gently rubs her thighs against your head. They’re the only source of heat out here in the cold night. “I was hoping you might warm~ up to me.”
>Admittedly, this was not nearly as bad as you were worried it’d be. Though she is still an animal, and she forced herself on you like this. You try to hold onto your anger.
>You look up at her as she rides your face. Her eyes look down and meet yours. Her tongue is hanging out and some of her drool dribbles onto your face. It adds even more fluid to the splash zone you’re becoming. Between her sweaty legs and quickly gushing cunt, you’re turning into a gooey puddle. What you don’t swallow oozes out your mouth and a little even bubbles up and out your nose.
>As she continues to rock on you, she looks behind at your crotch and then smirks back at you. “Hmm, so you are having fun? Or is he just more honest than you?” Damn it. It might be called your head, but your dick clearly doesn’t have any brains. It’s betrayed you. You can feel yourself growing hard with arousal too. How can this be happening? You and your body are supposed to be on the same team. You can’t be falling for this, this be---.
>“Does my little criminal wanna cum? No hands allowed, but you may cum if you can.”
>No.
>No. No. No.
>NO.
>This can’t be happening. This can’t be happening. You don’t wanna cum. But she’s beginning to taste soo good. It’s like warm honey spilling down your throat. And your arousal, it keeps rising. No matter how hard you try to push it down. It feels like your balls won’t stop churning and churning. You don’t want what happens next you don’t want what happens n---”
>“Come on” She whines, “Cum for me, naughty boy. Cum for me. Show me how much my disgusting body really turns you on.”
>You twitch and throb. She does too. You can feel yourself leaking. She already is. Her fluids are filling your throat. You try and suck and swallow as fast as you can but you’re still choking. You can’t hold on much longer.
>The damn breaks.
>You feel yourself burst. She does too. Ropes of cum fly out your shorts and up into the air in little arcs, spilling out onto the road. She shakes and her throbbing sex pours more grool than you thought possible down your throat and out your nose. You feel hot. Weak. And dizzy.
>You look up to her face and as she slowly pulls back, you see the streetlight shine down from above.
>“And what does my little criminal have to say for himself? Has he learned his lesson about anthros? And about cooperating with officers of the law?”
>Her cookie pops out from your mouth, leaving a long string of fluid between your mouth and her cunt.
>“More. Please … ” you beg.

common or "boring" superpowers when anthros exist too leads to some funny situations

a story prompt:
> The guy gets sent by the Anthrostate to the countryside to become a Peon/Slave to the big farmer families there basically.
> Every family is a different species of farm animal and specializes in two or three vegetables and fruits.(Rabbits, Cattle, horses)
>The Rabbit family is by far the biggest in numbers and likes to mess with him and fuck with him while he is working (makes him repeat the same tasks serval times and humiliates him) and give him little food to eat.
> The cattle family isn't as big but they overwork him to the bone which makes him unable to work for days even if he can't afford to rest but their food is way better.
> The Horse family is by far the smallest in number but largest in body and more abusive than the two families, Physical and Verbal abuse is certain but they gave the best and more food

The idea of a mature anthro businesslady who wants to keep me as her submissive slutretary is one of those things that makes me feel genuinely depressed ar the fact that it will never be real.

Alright Anons of /ADHG/ which scenario would >(you) pick:
1) Humans are way more populous than furs, leading to the creation of harems. The longer one fur manages to "hold" a human the more respected she is as other furs usually trade and change out most of their prized possessions on a regular
2)Humans and furs are almost perfectly matched in terms of populations, overwhelming majority of them live in monogamous relationships. Change in partners is somewhat common, mostly innitiated by the fur rather than the human.
3)Furs are way more populous than humans leading to extreme hoarding and jealousy. Most powerful furs have harems of humans who aren't allowed to leave. Lucky furs get to live in a monogamous relationship. The social standing is tied to the amounts of humans in fur's possession.
3a)Same as above but with the most wealthy of furs emplyoing hit squads, made up of other furs to "forcefully transfer/liberate/choose your political option", humans to add them to their own harem

>In a world where anthros are hated and reviled by humanity, having sex with them is seen as a sin on par with bestiality or pedophilia at best, and a form of treason against your own species at worst
>But, since it's wildly believed that anthros are instinct-driven savages who lust after the beautiful humans, there's a level of sympathy offered to humans who are raped by anthros

>Nine Sols
Maybe something like:
>Yi manages to put New Kunlun's systems into the lowest power mode possible.
>It orbits the "blue planet" while he researches a cure for Tianhuo planet-side, since he's functionally immortal.
>In the hundred of years that pass, the Ape Men become humans and together they find a cure
>Though technology here has advanced to basically modern day, New Kunlun is still far, far more advanced than anything Humanity is capable of
>Now that the remaining Solarians are being reawakened and cured, they can start expanding their empire again....starting with the human race
>Having recognized Human intellect and ingenuity, they aren't treated as...poorly as the Apemen before. Many Solarians have even become quite fond of them
>However, the Solarians are still far more enlightened and advanced than humanity is - and the best way they can return the favor for dealing with the Tianhuo crisis is to "enlighten" them too.
>After all, even though humans are much more evolved, there's still a lot of primitive savagery that needs a bit of "ironing out"
>And even if the Sols are extraordinarily capable, the New Kunlun project has shown some obvious flaws that need to be addressed, let alone other matters like the repopulation of their species

Nice idea anon. Although some more ideas.
>Eigong has found a half work around the Tianhou virus in male apemen.
>Modifying their DNA or the solarian females to reproduce
>Next generation is now immune to the virus but at the dangerous cost of female apemen potentially being wiped out and male solarians slowly dying out

>"A female threatening a male into dominanting her is still maledom."
This only applies if you don't take the psychological/emotional side into account

>she uncrosses and recrosses her legs, giving me a flash of her panties
>it's apparent what she really wants isn't me doing anything actually work-related in the evening
>"And don't whine to me about that girlfriend of yours. Be serious, you worked hard to get here. Who do you love more... her, or your career?"

>It’s been an uneventful day for a hyena police officer like myself
>Nothing happening for the past hours
>No robbery, fightings, gang wars, or nothing
>Just a few punk rat girls spray painting and slapping ahego anime humie boys onto mail boxes
>”when are we gonna go home? I’m getting bored and just wanna go home. My favorite show is on tonight and I rather be there watching than just sit my furry ass on this car all day”
>My partner, who’s a Doberwomen with a deep scar mark on her face, looked at me while she chews her hot dog from the gas station she saved, “Until, about an hour. You’ll catch up to your tv soon enough”
>I sighed in relief, “Oh finally! I was about to starve to death here! Don’t you know how many chips or junk food I have to keep my belly full? I feel like a junk food addict buying these cheap ‘foods’. Gotta keep my body in shape!”
>”Jane, you’ll be fine. Eating a big hot dog isn’y gonna make you chunky in mere minut-“
>The police’s radio spoke
>My cop partner, Mary, listens to the radio closely
>Mary’s eyes perked up and threw her food into the bag, “Ok, we’re close to the location. Get yourself ready, Jane”
>I adjusted myself and put on my seatbelt on, “What’s the deal this time? People jay walking?”
>”Domestic abuse” Mary responded sternly
>As my eyes widen, we’re already heading to the call
>As we reached our destination where a suburban neighborhood takes place, the front door was already opened but no policewomen in site
>Mary grabbed her stun gun, “Come on, follow my instruction and don’t fall behind”
>As we steadily walked towards the brick house, we heard struggling and pleading from the inside
>I tighten my legs to stay on edge in case the abuser have a gun in her hand
>As we peaked inside the house’s living room, we see a tall lioness in her business suit pinning down an innocent soft human, which I assume that’s her husband
>The human husband was covered in sever scratches on his face bleeding, black eyes while his eyeballs are red, and tears running down on his face
>”POLICE! GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF THE HUMAN!” Mary shouted at the, admittedly intimidating, lioness. Doesn’t help the fact that the house is shrouded in darkness and the only light source is the living room lamp on the ground lighting up half the room at our direction while the victim and the abuser was behind the light’s direction, I can still see the human’s feared and tired expression
>Can’t say the same for the lady in the suit
>The lioness looked at us with the most primal stare I ever seen in my life. The lamp barely showed her face as it showered in the dark. The only thing we can see is the bottom half of her face where her sharp teeth’s reflects from the light. White teeth being presented to us as if she found a new meat to eat. Her yellow feline eyes is the only thing that is visible as it glows menacingly in the darker part of her face almost like she’s a monster that hunts at night. She looked like she was ready to slowly walk around us and pounce at us like how us anthros used to be back before fucking wheels were invented
>”Get the fuck out of my house”, the crazed feline growled as she pierced her sharp claws on to the human’s neck causing him to squirm
>”Let go of that human and calmly kneeled down with your paws behind your back”
>The monstrous lady stared at us for a moment then obey by pulling her claws off of her husband’s neck, causing the human to finally breath
>The abuser slowly back away into the dark leaving the bright glowing yellow eyes be the only thing we can see
>As we see the yellow eyes slowly bounce around in the abyss of the house, she just stood there. Staring at us.
>”Ma’am walk towards us so we can escort you out of the house” I stated, while doing the most toughest voice I can mustered without sounding nervous
>…No response.

>Be Anon, be living in college town.
>Attending the local military academy. It's out of the way and everyone's a furball, but it's closer to home and tuition is cheap.
>Bunch of anthros migrated in about a decade ago. Still not used to seeing so many around at once.
>Not used to being the only guy in most classes, either.
>Be walking around the quad on a Sunday one day, doing a summer term.
>Just finished a good run. Been feeling lonely lately, having trouble fitting in and finding friends.
>Suddenly this cheetah girl jogs up from behind and taps you on the shoulder.
>Real high energy type, literally circling around you and bouncing on her feet as you talk.
>"Hey! You new? You go here?"
>"Uhh...Yeah?" You reply nervously.
>"Cool! We're going on a date tomorrow!~ I'm buying, mess hall at 1400, don't be late!~"
>Turns around and is gone before you can even ask what her name is.
>Huh...
>Guess you've got a date tomorrow.
>Be Rebecca
>An enthusiastic, athletic cheetah cheetah chee-chee!
>Be feeling glum.
>BF of 4 years gave you the "it's not you, it's me" speech.
>Said he wanted to enjoy life as a bachelor for a bit.
>Already dating a LtCol with two kids and a fat wallet.
>Fucking *hell*, at least pretend you weren't a gold digger, Dave!
>He got bored the moment you stopped buying him shit.
>Should have trusted your "second sense," as mom calls it, and followed your instincts.
"Anthros just *know*, these things sweety. You shouldn't have tried to force it. You'll know your human when you see him, I promise."
>Jogging off your problems when suddenly a qt3.14 humie walks by.
>Got a hoody on, vague scent of sweat. He actually exercises in it.
>Shoes worn and brown around the edges. Enjoys a jog like you.
>Not too muscly. Calves good, but arms unimpressive. *He wants a gym buddy!*
>Clothes are secondhand.Thrift shop stuff. Doesn't have much cash, which means he won't care you're not super rich.
>Wait, he's a student? He's here to be an officer like you! *You can deploy together, this is perfect!*
>Smells subby too.
>Big ticket, deal cincher: Cross tattoo, Catholic embellishments.
>*He wants a big family!* Aaaaahhhhh! HE'S PERFECT!
>Shake your head. Play it cool, Becky.
>He looks uncomfortable. Not used to being around anthros. Play it casual-like.
>Run up behind, tap his shoulder.
>"Hey! You new? You go here?"
>Can't contain excitement, bouncing around him like a kitten with the zoomies.
>"Uh...yeah?"
>"Cool! We're going on a date tomorrow!~"
>Don't even give him the option of saying no, he's not used to female attention. He'll chicken out otherwise.
>"I'm buying, mess hall at 1400, don't be late!~" You say casually to ease him in, and take off running as if you do this every day.
>*Fuck you, DAVE!* You and--
>Uh...Kyle? He looks like a Kyle.
>--You and Kyle are gonna get married!
---------
>"And that's how I met my wife. Anthros just *know, man.*"

>Ryan was giddy. His local Stardoes, the corner one past an alley, was selling fall lattes. He ordered two for himself; one for here, another for later. The coyote cashier slipped a smile, "Two? Ur ass is phat enough already~." He rolled his eyes and took a seat.
>He knew mom would be upset, tuition wasn't cheap after all. But, he needed a mood lift, bullying was bad. Speak of the devil, she was here. Her back was toward him, thankfully, but he could tell it was Kristen. He'd seen her back too many times. He didn't know why that cat did it; she had plenty of money, friends, and admirers. She said 'the weak should fear the strong'. Whatever it was, he was glad she hadn't seen him; he'd slip out safely.
>"ORDER FOR RYAN" yelled the cashier.
>In a split second, everything moved. Kristen's head spin round to the counter and then him. He leapt, took the coffees, and ran. He heard a crash of chairs behind him, but outside, he was alone. He breathed; maybe she tripped and busted her snout. He sipped his brew contentedly.
>As he walked by the alley though, he was pulled in. "Where ya think ur going?" a voice growled. She threw him down and stood in front, blocking him. "It's rude to avoid people" she taunted.
>Usually, he'd be scared. But not today, he wasn't letting her ruin another good day. "Good thing you aren't then" he said curtly. His comment caught her off guard; she quickly bared her teeth, "What’s that supposed ta mean?" He slowly stood up. "I don't care what the scientists say, you aren't human anymore. You certainly don't act like it either." She folded her arms, flexing her claws in and out. "That hurts. It's not like I, or any other woman, could help it." He shrugged, "Yeah, but you could not be an ass. You're twice a monster for that"
>She turned her head, was that ... embarrassment on her face? "Didn't think ya'd be this rude" she grumbled, "I wanted to give a gift" A gift? Fuck, was she gonna swirly him? She opened her bag and shoved it to him
>He set his drinks aside and looked in, pulling out his gym shorts? While in shock, she swiped a drink. "Why…do you have...?" he asked. He remembered when they went missing. His locker empty; the latch busted. She sipped louder and smugly said, "Ya sure know how to pick good stuff, loser"
>It dawned on him; mother said girls are mean to boys they like, something about shit emotional processing. "Oh no" he moaned, "you can't like"
>She interupted, "You? Yeah, can't believe it. But hearts want what they want, and mine? Well, it wants ya between my knees"
>He didn't want to be his bully's boyfriend. He tried slipping out. Her arm shot out, blocking him. "Don't go, please" she begged. He slipped under and backed up. "I can't be with someone who's mean to me"
>"I know" she said solemnly, "I talked with my mom and...she made me realize I've been too rough with ya" She held out his drink, "I'm...uh" Her words stumbled like a foal learning to walk "...sorry, I took this from ya." Suspicious, he snatched it back. "I can be kind" she pouted "I think"
>He didn't know what to say. A trick? Some ploy to toy with her prey like the cat she was? But, could she be different? Should he do like ma said and give an anthro a chance; then he'd’ve one less bully, right?
>He shielded himself with his bag. "Fine. If you can be kind, then show me." Her ears peaked; in a flash she was on him, claw to his throat. She slowly dragged it, shaving the little stubble he had in one smooth stroke. Her teeth flashed a cheshire grin. "It's a date" she said giddily. "It'll be so wonderful..." she gripped his arm like an eagle crushing an orange, "that u'll take back those awful things ya said." He looked away, embarrassed by what he said in anger.
>She gave a paper to him and licked her thumb, rubbing it on his jaw. "Here's my number. Text me and I'll tell ya where I'm taking ya out." He pocketed it, "What was that for?" She smirked, "So no one steals my cutie in the meantime, stupid"

not exactly a fetish but just more odd or out there body types for anthros would be nice
>getting pouches more involved for marsupials
>lamia/naga style bodies for snake/eel/etc anthros
>seals/sharks/fish/etc with mermaid style bodies
>maybe some taurs
>bat anthros with bat accurate wing arms
>basically anthros that lean more into their feral counterparts body shapes while still being anthro

>Normalize girls walking into your home
>Sexually dominating you
>Then going "I live here now" and moving in.

>In mixed anthro gym
>"ma'am, you are lookin huge today"
>she gently bumps your crotch with her knuckles
>"So are you shorty~"

>Maria's hooves cut through jungle underbrush like machetes. She panted of thirst, dripped with sweat, and shuddered from exhaustion; but she was thankful. Six weeks at sea nearly broke her. The rocking, burning sun, and pure isolation; the trip was torturous. And that didn't include the worst, no men. It'd been forty days since she last tasted one. The other conquistadoras couldn't take it; falling to debauchery, fisting and pegging one another desperately for relief. Maria mustered her fury into a swing of her blade, sundering a sapling. Her crewmates would find no relief in damnation, she thought piously. She remained clean. She was a woman of god spurred on by promise; she'd snuck up the navigator's quarters often and knew how close they were to landfall. How close they were to heathen men they'd find and claim. Gold? Fame? These may have led her on board, but now it's carnality driving her on. She may have been a mare, but in this jungle, she was a predator.
>Maria was no stranger to violence. Her armor wordlessly attested it. Countless slashes from moslem hyena blades, gouge holes from backstabbing spies, claw marks from vanquished foes begging their heathen lives. All sung her grit, stubbornness, and brutal capacity. She had a destructive gift; a longing to trample. Her captain however, didn't appreciate her gift in this new world as much as she did in the old. So here Maria was, trailblazing for others who took it easy on the beach. She was only little drunk, slipped a couple words about being more charming than her commanding officer. She's a sore loser, she mused, no wonder boys don't like her.
>To most, it seemed as if Maria took her punishment hard. Crushing any foliage in her path; fuming snorts and huffs. But, she was wickedly giddy. Time away from the crew? Time away to mount men. And after a particularly thick thornbush, she found one.
>Javier, as his name would come to be, never saw a horse before, nor an anthro. So when Maria crashed through the thorns, he thought her some strange beast. Some muscled deer wrapped in shining stones. Fearful, he asked it to leave in peace, spare him and his wife river fishing. He couldn't understand her tongue, "No necesito que hables. Solo necesito que gimas." He watched her peel away the stones, waterfalls of sweat and hair pouring out her neck and rear; and under all that stood a...womanly figure? No, it can't be, he thought, what god would allow this? His wife pulled his arm, pleading him to flee, but he wasn't quick enough. The beast fumed at her cries. Taking one a hoof, she launched her into the stream with a foreign growl, "Vete a la mierda." The once clear water bubbled rose red.
>Javier spun round and leapt for his wife, but the beast caught his leg and cast him down. "Oh, ¿quieres unirte a tu mujer? Todavía no, todavía necesito usarte." In her grip, he felt his shin snap. A terrible scream erupted from the bottom of his throat. "Relájate..." his other leg snapped; hot tears poured down his face, "no puedo permitir que huyas." He tore his nails apart trying to crawl to the crimson stream, but she flipped him over like a coin in hand. She licked him, "Tan salado...Podría lamer hasta que tu piel se despegue." He begged she'd kill him too, but realized his fate was far worse than he feared. She began to tear their clothes to shreds.
>Javier screamed curses at her and threw fists into her. Nothing, her face was like a mossy stone. "No te preocupes pequeño, puedo verte como ásper". He begged his god stop his heart, spare him the torture. She thrust one hand over his mouth and the other under his sack. He felt blood forced up his shaft, some evil trick from her homeland. Under her crushing weight, she began to take him. Hours later, she drug his body of broken bones to the ship. They'd bring him back from the brink of death to live in hell.

>Sincity would kill him one day, John thought. He'd been here three years and nearly died twice from work. He shouldn't be surprised by this though, it came with the territory. John didn't work in the casinos, the bars, or even the shows; he had the only job desperate for men: a whorehouse. Specifically, Whores R Us Corp. John, or Juniper as his clients knew him, never understood the name; some play on words of a before-times toy retailer. Toy, he mused. Guess it's pretty apt, he thought. That's all he was to everyone. He lit a cig to steady himself; the tip glowing in the dark.
>"Done brooding?" a butch voice asked sternly,"Your next client is already inside. If she's kept waiting, the Madame will---" He calmly cut Asha off,"No need" and turned on the lights,"I was wrapping up anyway" John took in a few more draws, squirrel away some warmth. His employer kept the room unnaturally cold; for the goosebumps, to put his hairs on end, and make his nipples attractively stiff. The madame, his employer, said clients liked the look; but it was a cold comfort. He wished for somewhere warm, somewhere cheap and free.
>"She's here" the bull woman said flatly. Before the knock came to the door, John, no, Juniper, readied himself on the Cal King bed and Asha stood guard.
>A short sheep stood at the door, wearing loose joggers with a slick coat on top and shaggy wool covering her eyes. A stark contrast to Asha's tailored business suit and Juniper's slim crop top with skinny jeans. "Hi Hi" she giggled. "Y-you must be Asha" she said vigourously shaking the minotaur's hands,"T-thank you for assisting today" The handshake felt suspicious to Asha, but the rest of security said she didn't trip any alarms, so she brushed it off as nerves. "Its my job" she responded cooly with a sip of her freshly poured gin. She sat down in the security chair facing the bed and watched the client timidly approach Juniper.
>"And you must be...uhm" Her nerves lost her words. "Juniper" he finished,"got a pretty name to go with that pretty face?" "Oh. I'm Dolly" By now he was used to this little dance; so many jittery women came knocking, whether it be from heats or anxiety from finally getting a chance to do what most of their classmates and coworkers already womaned up to. She shivered,"It's kinda chilly in here. Is it supposed to be like this?" Juniper trailed a finger down his hip,"It...shouldn't be a problem, with how warm we'll probably be getting~" Blushing, she bleated,"Speaking of, can we start actually? I've been looking forward to this for so long" she rubbed her legs together, "that I'm already ready" she asked with a bashful breathiness. Unusual, but not unheard of. Juniper adapted and casually gave her the cliff notes,"Fine. Just tell me why you came and what scene you'd like to try" She removed her coat,"I've been lonely for a while now. Ever since my herd moved away, I've been longing for some company. But" she tripped over a heavy pause,"My heat is pretty bad this year. So I want some CNC" Juniper resisted an eyeroll. The usual request. Juniper went straight into his routine, faked a coy smile, and teased,"But I was hoping 'ewe' and I could just talk"
>In a moment, he could almost see her mood flip.
>Slowly, she bowed her head low and rammed him in the gut, sending him in a short flight to the bed. He groaned, holding his rapidly bruising belly. Virgins never knew how much stronger they were, but the way she began to prowl up to him on the bed, crawling low and slow, her horizontal pupils locked into his, told him this was no ordinary woman. Here and now, she seemed more wolf than ewe. She gripped his calves, then his thighs, and pulled taut his waistband, letting it slap back in a quick snap. She shook her fluffy head with a toothy grin,"I can't believe your mama lets you dress like this. You're practically askin for what's gonna happen~"
>Time for him to continue the act, play his part so she doesn't go off any rails. He gave her puppy eyes,"I dress bad? Then...can you take off these naughty clothes and show me what I oughta wear?" For a moment, she was stunned; he could practically see the horny blood spill out her nose like a before time animation. "I–I–I" she stammered, struggling to collect herself,"I think you should wear some of my lipstick" She shoved her face into his, more licking and pushing than kissing like she thought she was. If it weren't for his well timed lean-backs, she would have busted all his teeth. She pulled back and before she could catch her breath, she tore his crop top with her. Below her, he was a mess of green lip prints and tattered clothes, puffing clouds of needy breath in the cold room. "Do I look pretty now?" he pleaded playfully. At the sight of his defenselessness, the doubt and anxiety drained from her eyes; instinct took the wheel.
>She pinned him into the downy pillows. "Aren't you gonna get me some clothes? I'm so cold" She panted in great huffs, "Baaaa-d boys like you don't get clothes. You've been so naughty" she added with a whine,"teasing me you little rape-bait. I'll have to punish you" She suddenly bit his ear and ripped into his jeans with her hoof, barely missing his rod. Pain rang through his head. Fuck, he thought, been a while since a client bit me, the madame will make her pay extra for it. She kicked off her joggers and rubbed her sopping cunt, already dripping down her leg. She stopped chewing his ear like cud and looked back down at their sexes, "Fuck" she muttered to herself, "gotta stop, for a sec, to, line it up" Reaching down, she gripped his viagra pumped cock and coated it with her juices. "If you know what's good for you" she licked his blood from her lips,"you'll cum hard for me, little lamb; like the whore you are" With a short wiggle to line up, she dropped herself onto him, a sticky thwap echoing as their loins linked.
>Her eyes rolled back and she moaned a quiet,"so that's what it feels like" He feigned another moan,"No, I'm supposed to save myself for a good woman" but realized his mistake as soon as it left his lips. "Good woman?" She scoffed and started pumping her hips up and down his cock. "Save yourself?" She gripped his throat and started choking him. "Should have been a good boy if you wanted that, whore" she added flatly. He couldn't breathe. He coughed the little air he had left, "Air...I...need-" She moved her hand and sealed his lips shut, growling,"Good little lambs are silent. Not. Heard." Fuck she's rough, he thought, at least virgins never last long. Her grip on him, in her hands and cunt, grew tighter. She continued her one sided conversation,"You gotta make me cum" He feigned a few squirms, most clients liked that, and so did she. "If you're good for me" she cooed and trailed his chest, "I'll weave you a warm sweater with my wool" Juniper let a smirk slip from the thought; she could, she had plenty for that. But she could feel his grin in her hand and she didn't like that. Reaching into the fluff of her back, she pulled out a large pair of cutting shears and held it to his throat,"I could wear your hair too" she cooed. A real squirm; he panicked. How the fuck did she– He tried to yell through the meat of her palm, "I think maybe we should take a breather" She slammed harder onto his cock, "I think" she responded curtly, "I told you to shut. the. FUCK. UP." He looked over at Asha. He needed her to do her job. Right now. Intervene. But, she was passed out in the security chair. Dolly squeezed his jaw tight and forced his head back to her,"Keep your eyes on me little lamb. She can't save you. I slipped six roofies in her drink during that handshake" His eyes went wide and so did her wicked grin. He couldn't even scream for help, there was too much soundproofing in the walls. The room was silent, save for the rhythmic thwap, thwap, thwap.
>The company had security incidents before. He remembered when a coworker of his was almost kidnapped by a roo stuffing him in her pouch. Didn't know who she thought she was fooling with a screaming belly like that. But...fuck...this might be it, he thought, Sincity is finally gonna kill me. He could feel bruises blossom in his hips as she thrusted harder and harder; her body jiggling furiously with every bound. Little nicks from the bouncing blades started to ooze his blood out, which she greedily lapped up. Psycho or not, her hips were working on him, edging him closer and closer to climax. "When you cum..." she grinned and pulled the shears up a bit to her other wrist,"I want you to sip my blood too" The tip of the blade easily sliced into her skin, making a little red horizontal line on her arm, slowly trickling down on it's way to his mouth. "It'll make you fall in love with me" she moaned,"Then. We'll have a shotgun wedding and run away together. Be our own little herd. Make me a little herd too~" This lady is--- she wouldn't even let him finish that thought. She began to full-on buck into him, the wet thwack ringing in the room and the gentle crunch of hip bones pitifully following them. He couldn't bare it any longer; cum erupted from him, oozing and splashing out in her violent thrusts. Agony consumed him as his ejaculating muscles pulled and flexed on his cracking bones. He screamed with pain into her hand and he could feel her spasm. With a wickedly gleeful giggle she cut the shears deeper in her wrist and held open his jaw, dripping her blood down his throat. She massaged it down his throat and choked him again,"No throwing up now. I’m never letting you go" As Juniper's vision grew darker and darker, he couldn't even hear her mad ramblings anymore; the room slowly and quietly turned pitch black. The nightmare finally ended.
>"I think I woke up a few hours later" John recounted,"Asha was still passed out, but so was...the client. I think" he struggled with his words,"I think she, in her delierium, eventually wore herself to nothing. Just collapsed atop me" John paused for a long while,"After I pushed her unconscious body off me, I had to crawl to the door for help. I could feel my pelvis was broken. I didn't even notice how much blood my chest smeared on the floor…I'm sorry to whoever had to clean that up" "Don't be" the Human and Anthro Affairs Inspector stiffly replied,"Be glad; you're alive" They shuffled some papers on the interrogation desk, "And thanks to your promptness, Asha should make a full recovery" John fidgeted in his seat,"What about...?" "Dolly?" the agent replied,"we'll catch her soon" Packing up their suitcase, the inspector left John with one last message,"Most agents would say part of this is your fault; as soon as she said her herd left her, you should have screamed for help. Prey-pack anthros like her don't do well with isolation" "But?" John prodded. "But, I won't lay the blame on you. I know how it is. All I'll say is" the man paused and looked John mournfully in the eye, "I'm sorry you suffered so much. That the world’s been so cold to you. I won't just prosecute for you. I'll pray that goodness and warmth in equal measure finds you too."

>Have dog wife
>Love her to death
>She loves you just as much
>Then death comes, and you can show it no more.
>You're hit by a car crossing the street on a Wednesday morning.
>Some concrete cowgirl's truck, who drives off without stopping.
>You're dead before the ambulance even gets there. She sobs and cries the whole way to the hospital, and hysteric and unhinged when at last they try to take your corpse away.
>There was no hope.
>There were no children.
>Only promises and dreams of what could have been.
>You were her human. You were a good boy, well behaved and submissive, and you never complained about the leash to your collar.
>She stands there for hours when they finally put you in the ground.
>"How could they put my human in the cold ground...?" She asks in a daze. "He loved the spring! He-- HE NEEDS THE SUN!"
>She stands there for days before someone finally comes to pull her away from her grief.
>Ages pass.
>No one comes to pull her away anymore.
>Children can smell her from a mile away, reeking of sweat and grief.
>It's another Wednesday.
>Traffic comes to a halt.
>This has happened before.
>A decrepit old dog anthro lays a bundle of flowers by the divet your skull made when it hit the pavement.
>Tears touch the ground.
>"I love you Anon..."

>Get kidnapped by North Dakota anthro
>Forced to have dinner with her
>"So, what are your interests?"
>"Corn, corn husking, potato farmin', admiring other people's cars, farm equipment, and complaining about Chicago online."
>Take kitchen knife and run it through your heart.
>No waifur on Earth, no matter how hot, is worth dating someone with no personality.

>Be Anon
>Tracker and security detail up in arctic research facility.
>Things have taken a turn for the worst as suspicions of sabotage have been ignored too long.
>Critical infrastructure has been rendered useless and in need of critical repairs.
>Doing so as a group is not an option.
>A blizzard is on the way that will kill everyone on the base due to the lack working necessities.
>You have to split up.
>A problem when you realize that there had to be at least 2 traitors in your midst to have crippled this many systems across the base.
>The group decided to prioritize evacuation.
>The timing of this crisis was planned in order to avoid the base going dark too long and provoking an investigation from outside.
>Help from the outside would only justify sending a party out if the base was dark for awhile - and even then any preemptive attempts will be delayed by the blizzard.
>You would only repair the generator, and comms outpost before hailing an evac.
>You couldn't just worry about the generator and wait it out inside in the heating as the heaters were irreparably damaged.
>Your intuition told you it'd be a bad idea to let these turncoats herd you into the same building like sitting ducks anyways.
>At least on the move and spread out there's a chance to get what you need done in time.
>And more grimly, to delay the works of the hidden hands by covering more ground and spreading out.
>It was the only option the group was left with after all the time spent arguing and evaluating the damages to begin with anyways.
>This was made more apparent when the group realized the lengths these traitors were willing to go to.
>While the group assessed the damages and grouped back up, reported their findings and then argued - the fighting only stopped when it was brought to everyone's attention that someone hadn't come back yet.
>A deer anthro who had been sent to retrieve the radios.
>Sending a portion of the group out to investigate revealed that he'd been killed and the radios destroyed.
>You didn't just have spies in your midst.
>You had calculated, cold-blooded killers disguised among the flock.
>The news didn't set well with everyone, so you all took what weapons you had and what few radios were in possession and broke off to complete the tasks when you understood what it was that you all needed to do.
>And so you set about getting your tasks done.
>Trying to keep in contact the best you could.
>You teamed up with someone you knew you could trust.
>A wolf anthro named Jane.
>She always was cool with you around the base.
>Taking jabs at you with taunts about how bundled up you are up here.
>Naturally, since you didn't have a fur coat to help insulate you.
>Though now, you're both too wary to find the time for jokes.
>The two of you go to handle the generator first.
>Grabbing the things you need to fix it and heading back to the cabin to warm up first.
>Traversing the base you spot some of the other faces going about their tasks and warming up as well.
>But with a lack of comms and the increased activity its hard to tell if anyone else has been murdered.
>Returning to the generator you managed to get it in functioning condition.
>With just a few more steps to have it up and ready long enough to hail support you tell Jane that you've got it handled.
>She agrees and decides to go check on how the teams working on the comms are doing.
>A half hour later and you're finished.
>With power restored you know everyone else on the base should be happy to be one step closer to the end of this ordeal.
>Heading to where Jane broke off to you prepare to assist with whatever's left to do with the comms.
>At this point you don't seem to be able to get any responses from the other 2 with radios.
>Cautiously you trudge through the snow and approach the building on the other side of the base fearing the worst.
>Once you arrive you bump into another group of two anthros.
>A male dog and female snow leopard.
>They assessed the grease stains on your clothes and the current availability of power and knew you could be trusted since you weren't inhibiting the endeavor to flee.
>They had just finished up fixing the lines to the cabin themselves.
>Entering the comms room building you all notice the room looked worse than last time you were here.
>Venturning deeper into the facility you all found a shell shocked rabbit girl.
>You rush to check on her and see what had her so shaken.
>"T-they... they got him!"
>The other two set about assessing the comms while you checked her over and calmed her down.
>Turns out the comms had been fixed by her group before being sabotaged again.
>When they returned to check they were ambushed by one of the killers and she managed to run away.
>She was in shock, so most of what you gathered came from their analysis of the comms and what little of her babbling you could piece together.
>Though the presence of you three managed to calm her down somewhat.
>The dog and leopard suggested you break off and bring back some cables and wire to fix the machine.
>You tell them to keep an eye out for Jane since you split up awhile ago and she could still be out there.
>A quick trip to the nearby storage shack turned up something thankfully.
>Returning to the comms building you noticed it was quiet.
>Entering cautiously you looked around and listened.
>Then you heard it, a scream in the back of the building.
>Unholstering your sidearm you run in the direction of the scream.
>Hopefully it was just that bunny girl overreacting to something due to the after effects of her shock.
>Rounding the corner you spot the snow leopard leaning over the bunny girl at the end of the moderately sized research machine room.
>The dog from earlier already dead.
>The leopard overpowerd the bunny and sunk a blade into her stomach just as you came upon the scene.
>A pained wheeze capitalized the imminent fate of yet another member of the team just before you raised your gun to take aim.
>The leopard took notice of you as you stopped, using her feline reflexes to jump away behind cover just as you fired.
>The bullet hitting the wall just above the dying rabbit.
>With time of the essence to administer aid before she bled out, you needed to act fast.
>But not foolishly.
>Cautiously sweeping the island desks lining the room you waited for a sign of the killer.
>Just as you both got close enough, she leapt out at you.
>Firing another shot, you missed as she swatted your hand holding the gun away as she pounced.
>The pistol flew a few meters away as she knocked you back against an island desk.
>Instinctively you barred her arm with yours to push away the knife attempting to plunge into your neck.
>Hitting her right arm right below the wrist with the side of your left caused the knife to be flung from her hand as well.
>With the immediate threat to the both of you, neither you nor the feline opt to recover your weapons.
>The left arm that batted away your pistol had no glove, so you knew what she'd opt to do with it.
>Protecting your neck by scrunching up your shoulder to cover the vital arteries while winding up your arm for the counter at the same time, you receive some claws raking deep into your shoulder.
>Numbed by the cold and adrenaline, there is no moment to wince from the pain before you deliver an uppercut, using your unoccupied left arm and bodyweight to push off the countertop behind you.
>Seemingly trained, the assailant anticipated this and jumped back.
>You connected with her chin still, but she knew how to take a punch and rolled back with it - cutting the knock out strike back to a solid hit.
>She continued to stumble back for a moment and your momentum from bouncing off the desk made it easy to keep up the pressure.
>Taking a big right step forward, you throw another punch for her head with your left hand.
>She dodges again, pivoting her head to the left side of your fist.
>She thinks she has you for a split second.
>You twist your wrist and open up your hand.
>Grabbing her by the back of the neck, fingers holding her white hair to keep her from getting away this time, you follow through with the rest of your momentum.
>Pulling her head down, you swing your left leg to deliver a knee to the face with the power of a full-bodied wind up pulling her down into it.
>The effect was immediate.
>The force no doubt breaking her snout with a satisfying crack.
>She bounced back up on reflex, the momentum flinging her down the walkway rather than back into the other row of desks.
>You stumbled slightly but regained your balance shortly.
>Looking where she landed, you spot her on her back in the aisle closer to her knife.
>Her honed instincts and spatial awareness knew this fact and actively fell in that direction on purpose.
>You knew your gun was farther away on the other side of one of the rows of desks.
>You chance it and pounce on her.
>A running headstart and a leap later found you on her stomach, pinning her arms to the ground.
"WHY! Why did you do this?!"
>Spitting a wad of blood at you caused you to straighten up just a little bit to avoid it.
>"Why does anyone do-"
>A sudden shift in her body weight indicated she was curling her lower half in on itself.
>Unexpectedly she hooks her boots by their heel right under both your arms.
>"ANYTHING! UGH!"
>Using the raw power of her leg muscles, core and arms, she straightened out her body - throwing you off of her.
>Hurling you straight into the ground with sudden force.
>The back of your head colliding with the frozen floor violently.
>You don't remember what happened for a second.
>Everything having gone dark briefly.
>When you can process what you're seeing again, you're no longer in a right state of mind.
>Borderline delirious from an obvious concussion.
>The heavy snowboots of the killer echo across the floor as the snow leopard stands over you with her blade.
>"I don't care what she thinks, I'm going to make you regret what you did to my face!"
>Words were said, but you were a bit too loopy to really process anything, only offering groans of pain in response.
>But the weight of the killer straddling you back brought you ever closer to reality.
>Sobering up even more as the blade comes into view above your eyes.
>Hustle and bustle of a winter coat and snow boots pounding and skidding to a stop around the corner signaled the arrival of someone else.
>"Hey! What are you-"
*BANG*
>The leopard slumps off of you onto the ground.
>"Anon! I came as soon as I heard the gunshots!"
>It was Jane.
>Concerned for you, she immediately dropped down to survey your injuries.
>As she did so, you heard whimpering and shuffling from the other end of the room.
>Shit, that's right!
"Uhhh, h-hey... Jane. Beth over there. She needs aid now."
>Jane turns to the other end of the room.
>"I'll go check on her."
>She gets up and runs to where the rabbit was.
>It's not long before she's back and helping you up.
>"She didn't make it Anon, I'm sorry."
>Saddened by the news, you wearily rise to your feet.
>You need Jane's help to walk back through the building.
>"C'mon Anon, let's go signal for help so we can bail!"
>And with that you two march through the snow back to the cabin.
>Once inside you warm up next to the dying fire while she gets on the radio to call for evac.
>"Alright, Anon! They'll be here in just a moment. Sit tight and I'll be right back!"
>You do as you're told, waiting for your mental faculties to return to you.
>Knowing not to fall asleep, you pace the room a little to stay awake.
>Passing by the radio you notice something peculiar.
>It wasn't on.
>Then how-
>Your thoughts are cut off by the sound of a loud snowmobile ripping through the landscape and up to the cabin
>Did she just find that?
>You thought they were all disabled in the sabotage.
>She must've been fixing it while you were split up.
>Jane enters while letting the engine idle outside, scanning for any other necessities presumably.
>You spot the rifle slung around her shoulder as she does so.
>The swaying catching your attention.
>That doesn't look like any of the rifles we keep in the armory.
>A creeping unease becomes a torrential downpour along your spine.
>Your eyes wide, you look at the radio again.
>You were bringing back the material to fix the comms again.
>Something none of you got to do.
>Comms was never fixed, was it?
>Your awareness returns to you, sharply recalling that Beth wasn't afraid of the leopard killer and allowed herself to be in that position.
>Meaning there had to be another responsible for the previous incident she experienced.
>You do your best to hide your suspicion when you look at Jane.
>She locks eyes with you.
>Shit!
>A wry and predatory smile graces her features.
>"Well Anon, are you ready?"
>You try to stall for an opportunity to escape.
>The blizzard building outside, beginning to drown out the motor just outside.
"Uh- hey Jane? How did you... know which one to shoot?"
>She quirks an eyebrow at you.
>"I think you know the answer to that question."
>The bemusement palpable in her tone alluding to the confidence that she's secured her next prey.
>Abandoning subtlety, you press.
"You killed your partner, why?!"
>Mirthfully giggling at your position she unholsters the rifle, aiming it at you.
>"Because there's only room for 2 on our ride out. Now get moving. Your sharp wit cost us a quick ride on the snowmobile. We have to book it to make it in time."
>She didn't exactly answer the question.
>Or maybe she did, you can't get a read on her.
>This isn't like the Jane you thought you knew.
>You follow her commands and lead the way north with her following right behind.
>"The evac is south east Anon.
>What?
"But the landing pad is in the north?"
>"Seriously, after all this trouble to secure you a fast ride when you were discombobulated. Though..."
>Sensing her frustration you turn eyes facing forward and listen to her.
>*CRACK*
>Falling like a sack of potatoes into the snow, your head rings in pain once again.
>As your consciousness fades you hear her voice her thoughts.
>"You seem to be faring well from earlier. Surely whatever brain damage you'll sustain from being unconscious will be minimal, right? Do your best Anon~ I plan to keep you forever..."
>You pass out.
>Jane loads you up onto the snowmobile behind her as she takes off to the southeast break in the ice where a 2 man sub is awaiting for extraction.
>After loading you into it and restraining you, she closes the hatch.
>Giving you a kiss before descending the depths to flee to wherever she came from.

>anthrogirl rapes you
>she thought she was raping a virgin
>turns out every anthro in the apartment complex has already raped you
>hfw
>she sues you for not being a virgin and wins damages

>High fantasy world of humans and anthros with magic and swords.
>Naturally there is a need to train battle mages for the defense of countries.
>Having been an accomplished battlemage yourself, you were invited to act as a live demonstration instructor.
>Even though it was an all girls school, you were welcomed as a temporary staff after signing some paperwork.
>You skimmed the textbook worth of legalese meant to cover the various anticipated and past incidents.
>Absolving the academy of any culpability since you were warned.
>Probably just an extended version of what the students were handed.
>So you skipped the rest of it.
>And with the formalities out of the way you were an official instructor.
>You couldn't help but notice that the girls listened to you much better than the other instructors.
>Perhaps this is why they brought you in?
>Lord knows young boys would be willing to play teachers pet for a pretty female teacher.
>Professionally of course, you play off any of the obvious hints and advances.
>Either way, you handled the live application of the critical working theories behind many of the elements and even odd magic types.
>While you observed and oversaw duels and other trials, ensuring nothing got out of hand, you also stepped in as an opponent to demonstrate creative applications of knowledge and especially environment.
>Most duels took place in contained biomes.
>Eventually at the end of the year, there is a final battle royal duel among all the students in the largest biome stage.
>And performance weighed heavily on your marks as judged by an unbiased judge.
>There were 2 win conditions.
>Survive as the last one undefeated.
>Defeat the instructor.
>That meant you.
>You would be participating directly, responsible for really testing your students for their hard work over the last year.
>It wasn't long into the exam that many were already eliminated.
>Some of them by your hands.
>What?
>It's not like you could afford to hold back.
>These girls were extra motivated today.
>Guess they were taking it seriously.
>But if you had guess, it was like most of them were coming after you directly.
>Not many of the girls possessed a will strong enough to fully utilize earth magic, so when you had to rely on it for defense it only gave away your location.
>While you managed to fend off the groups and cause infighting with some clever illusions, you were getting tired.
>Evasion and multiple front defense against this many near full fledged mages would tire even you out.
>That's when you bumped into her.
>She was one of your more diligent, albeit quiet, students.
>A white rabbit hybrid anthro with a professional air about her.
>Always greeted you with a smile, never bothering you unnecessarily either.
>Where some students would lag behind or ask questions they knew the answer to already when they felt they weren't getting enough of your attention, she wouldn't do that.
>No.
>She chose to get your attention through excelling.
>And now here you are against the most capable of your students.
>Borderline exhausted after 12 hours of fighting and running.
>Low on mana.
>You hate to admit it but you might need to rely on your artifacts and capability to win this unbalanced fight.
>She opened up with a front meant to corner you but you knew better.
>Waving it aside with a counterspell you opted to march straight through the offensive.
>She put up a great fight, eventually catching you on the backfoot.
>That's when you decided to fall back on your backup plan.
>An artifact that temporarily restrained the opponent.
>But when you went to use it, it's malfunctioned.
>Turning on you.
>Magical glowing chains firmly held you to the ground, as she saddled up to you.
>That's when she explained that she invented a whole new spell with her research.
>She'd been eyeing you the entire time, studying you for weaknesses.
>That's when she realized she could turn the tide of a stalemate by sabotaging an artifact.
>She cast it on you from the very start with the initial offensive meant to distract you from the spell temporarily destabilizing the mana flow of your artifacts.
>You had to admit, she got you good.
>She commanded the chains to pull you up into a kneeling position before her.
>Before she bent down and kissed you on the lips.
>Stunned by the action of what you thought to be your most innocent student, you didn't fight back.
>She broke off the kiss and you were brought out of your stupor by the announcement that the exam had concluded.
>Flushed red and embarrassed, you proved her on that uncalled for kiss.
"W-what was that for?! Don't you know that everyone is watching?"
>Unphased by your chastising, she adopts a Smug and predatory smirk, quirkiness an eyebrow.
>"What do you think, professor? That signals the end. I caught you."
>The visible confusion written on your features prompts more of an explanation.
>"The rules were simple. Whoever catches you at the end of the year, gets to keep you~, didn't you read that in the contract?"
>The what?
"What part?! Who would agree to that!"
>"Aw, so thoughtful and eager to teach, you skipped that part didn't you? And here I thought that you would be able to appreciate the fact that I invented a new spell all so that I could catch you."
"Uh, listen. You're a great girl and all - a fantastic promising mage. But I didn't sign up for this."
>"Oh but you did, and that contract is magically binding Anon. Or should I say, Nonny!"
>She giggles to herself in glee like a little girl.
>"And that kiss, inside this arena, binds you to me."
"I-uh... but-"
>"Oh, imagine how strong our children will be! Let's have many!"
>The hungry look in her eyes tells you everything.
>You try to get up and hop away in your bindings, only falling over and managing to squirm a couple feet away as she approached.
>By the time she's on top of you she's already removed her undergarments.
>"Let's start now!"
"HELP! DIRECTOR, SOMEO- MMPH!"
>She stuffed her panties into your mouth to muffle your screams.
>"Now now, can't have you ruining our special moment."
>And with that, she pulls off your pants.

>Karen never could understand why an unclaimed human man decided to be a professor at her college
>whatever, humies were just dumb sex toys anyways
>he even had the nerve to give her a failing grade for a test
>one order to obeyhumies.com later, and she was ready for her revenge
>Professor Anon was about to learn why it was a bad idea to cross avians
>during his office hours, she tore her skirt and told him she was going to tell administration that he raped her
>unless he did exactly as she said
>her fake tears and wailing convinced him that they would believe her over him
>she tied him to a chair with his pants and underwear off
>slowly and teasingly, she used her hands to jerk him off
>bringing him close to the edge, then using her feathers to tickle his balls until he went limp
>enjoying the look of misery in his eyes, she brought him to the edge again, this time just leaving his dick bouncing with the pulse of his blood
>once limp again, she rapidly and brutally jerked his dick until he came hard and thrashed around before going limp
>only to start thrashing again, as she hadn't stopped her assault on his cock
>begging and pleading had no effect on her, she continued until he came a second time
>she continued on, bringing him close to a third, then abruptly stopping
>once half limp, she resumed, then again left him on the edge
>she did this once more, followed by applying ice to his abused bits until he was limp and shrunken
>before he noticed, she put the chastity cage on him and locked it
>with the key held in front of his pleading eyes, she told him he would now be calling her mistress
>he would be licking her talons and cunt clean every day
>he would be getting tied up and uncaged, edged, then put back in his cage daily
>if he was very obedient and servile, she might let him have another orgasm in a month
>with a sadistic smile, she said she would be more than happy to teach him his proper place
>swans deserved the best, and humans were meant to serve

>Anon is friends with a fem pit bull
>She’s stupidly horny and it’s making it impossible to do her job
>Asks if Anon will just put some puppies in her really fast so she can get back to work already
>Anon says “wtf no i dont want to be a dad! we’re friends, not dating what the actual fuck?”
>Girl says “You don’t have to be invoked at all. I can take care of the whole thing myself.”
>”bullshit. i’m not putting you through that alone.”
>”Anon, I’m basically invincible NOW. I don’t know about humans, but getting pregnant will pump me full of so many hormones I’ll basically be a terminator. And not that pussy one that dies to a hydraulic press. The liquid metal one.”
>”how dare you call the T-800 a pussy”
>”Anon…”
>”he saved humanity! and they STILL cant think of a cooler design than-“
>”ANON SHUT UP I CAN PROVE IT.”

>New Year's Day. Outskirts of Old Dallas.
>Surrounded by a cheering crowd, Miguel never felt so alone at a party.
>Most people, like the ones around him, would be celebrating; Texas had won its independence day. But it was a pyrrhic victory.
>Unlike a lot of others, he saw the ruins of what this country used to be. He knew the vastness it once possessed. He knew how many people it had before the pandemics. He felt humanity fall down a darker path. Nueva Texas, the Lone Star Nation, was an Anthrostate. Not that he hated anthros or anything; hell, his sister was one now. But he no longer felt represented or seen in the government that called itself his protector.
>However, in that rowdy and dimly lit bar, someone did see him. And she liked what she saw. A sultry butch voice in the next barstool tried to cozy up to him, "Hey. You from Tennessee?" Oh god, don't- "Cause, you're a ten that I see~" The cringe alone made him wish the wars took him. The voice lightly shoved him, jovial but pushy, "Hey, partner. Don't you know it's rude to ignore someone talkin to you." Miguel turned from nursing his drink to look at the anthro. She was a bottom-heavy brown boar with a wild black wolfcut and amber eyes. Just below them, twin ivory tusks spiked up from her lower lip. Each at least four inches long, they framed her diamond-shaped snout on either side. Miguel could see she sharpened the tips to a razor's edge. Realizing she finally had his attention, she hurriedly straightened her clothes and cobbled together a cocky grin. "I don't want to be friends with you, ma'am" he said flatly, almost depressed. "Good. I didn't want to be, just friends~" Oh god, these anthrowomen all have one thing on their mind.
>He gave her a look, the kind of look you give to big idiots that you're too tired to be mad at, and turned back to his drink.
>She coughed, an awkward one that rubes spit out to fill the silence they wish wasn't there. "Why you so down in the dumps litte humie? Plenty to celebrate, new year, new century, new millennium, new country ... new people~" He shrugged and sipped. "My name's Charlotte, by the way. You should remember it." "Why?" he said cynically. "Because, uhhh..."
>She didn't plan this far ahead. According to all her friends, Cutie was supposed to be in her pocket by now. But she wouldn't let his sour mood stop her; she still had a friend already in her pocket, money. "... uhhh, because I'm buying all your drinks tonight!" Finally, something Miguel was glad to hear. "If you can uh" she continued, "drink me under the table." It didn't matter if she looked like 400 pounds of nearly pure muscle, Miguel had been stealing from his father's liquor cabinet since he was sixteen. He eyed her suspiciously, "You're all brim and no cattle". She responded with a fistfull of dollars slammed to the counter. "Okay" he said, suddenly animated by her challenge, "you're on"
***
>Seven pints of beer later; Miguel knew he lost. He was only able to muster two, but the other five? All her. She wiped the foamy froth from her snout with a satisfied exhale. He struggled to speak, his words stumbling like they had a bad leg, "I, losht. What do I... lose?" Charlotte looked at the four Miguels before her, "UuHhh" and grabbed the middle one by his shirt collar, "I win this.." She missed his lips and tried to mouth his cheekbone instead, licking him and huffing his face. He tried to shove her off, "My daddy shays I shoud sav mysef fur a gud wuhmon, a huemen one. She easily muscled him back into her burly arms, "Your daddy, *belch* shouldda taught you how to hold your liquor"
>They played their little game of tug of war till she had enough. Lifting him by the back of his collar, she threw him onto a pool table and straddled him. "I'm gonna fuuuckk you. Rodeo style. And you're gonna like it; cause it's not good that you ain't celebratin like everyone else." She affectionately trailed her hand along his side, "Itt's a whole new world, so you outta get a new girlfriend too"
>Hooking her tusk into his fly, she tore through his jeans, shirt, and belt in one swipe. She grinned and fondled his portly hairy belly, "Mmm, guess I'm not the only piggy here. Me likey~" He tried to leave, but her trunky arms pinned him to the pool table's field of green. He weakly tried to look to the crowd for help, but half of them, mostly anthros, were cheering her on. And the others, well, they tried to pretend it wasn't happening in front of them. Fumbling with her own clothes, she finally managed to tear them off and sat up on him, "Like what you see, boy?" The hanging lamp above her painted her whole front in shadow; save for her eyes bearing down on him, glowing like smoldering embers, dreamlike and hazy.
>She ran her hands slowly all over his body, toying with his fleshy bits, ogling and fondling up to his chin. This time, her kiss landed on target, but soon her slobber slid everywhere. All the air around them sank in hazy clouds of dirty musk. She smelled like the earth gave her up, refused to keep her. Mushrooms. Manure. Body odor. A little piss. Droplets of sweat fell from her like sporadic rain, coating him in her stink. "Enjoying it, piglit?" she said trying to hold a sly smile. But even he could see it was merely a sod-like facade; her horny needs growing beneath the surface of her confident mask.
>Arousal quickly building, she got tired of foreplay and started to grind her slippery snatch up and down him slowly. She snatched his wrists up and forced him to fondle her big doughy tits, "You say no, but your body, says yes"
>He didn't want to admit it, but Miguel could feel himself grow with each of her slimy grinds. At this point, he reluctantly accepted he was having sex tonight, not like he could stand anyway between the liquor and her two ton arms. Besides, her softness was almost a welcome alternative to the stiff tabletop beneath him. He lowered his hands to her sides and ran fingers through her bristly fur. It felt like grass, and the sweat on it felt like morning dew. He pulled his palms up to her potbelly, kneading her plump flesh. He could feel stiff nubs along her, about six or eight, evenly spaced. "Those'll grow with a bun in the oven hun" she whispered in his ear.
>The gathering crowd around them cheered them on, "Fuck his willy already" yelled some lady in the back. Charlotte panted, checked his cock, "Looks hard enough" and slipped him in. She moaned and he gasped. She was burning up, her blood boiling around his dick. He thought his sword would melt like iron in a kiln. Her walls sucked on him, ate him, greedily. She looked down hungrily at him. His hair tousled into wild cowlicks, his skin a glistening mess of slobbery kisses.
>On the bar's speaker, a guitar began to play. Some old song about a man falling into a ring of fire. She gripped his head in her hooved fingers, "Ready to burn, pretty boy?" and started to thrust. Her body quaked with each pounding. Desperate not to be crushed, he reached up and gripped her tusks tightly. A mistake. One she would enjoy. She shook him with her hips and her jaw, driving him as deep as she could. The motion and heat made him sweat buckets, running in little rivers along his skin before pooling underneath.
>It wasn't long before she started to reach the edge, of both her pleasure and the table. All the thrusting and pounding winding her insides into a spring ready to pop. She threatened between panted breaths, "You better cum. It's rude not to when someone's fucking you this good." At this point, he couldn't even deny it. He could feel everything building in him like a dam ready to burst. His muscle's tension. Her scent in his lungs. His pleasure in his cock. And he came first, just before her; humies always do. Everything about her had vice-like grip for a moment. Her pursed lips. Her locked limbs. Her lower lips. The final squeeze wrung the cum out of him. A little bit of it spilled out the back and the crowd of voyeurs cheered. Charlotte leaned back in victory, twice a winner tonight.
>The shouts finally woke the sleeping bar owner, a gazelle. She stormed in to find the cummotion and screamed at the two up top. "I told you you're not welcome here Charlotte, GET THE FUCK OUT! And take your grimy little humie with you!" When she started to throw empties at them, Charlotte grabbed Miguel and ran outside, her tail swishing with excitement. She looked down at him with smug pride, "Now I know you just lost two to nil, but I'm willing to go double or nothing on a round two~". Miguel, looking back up at her and seeing himself in her eyes, took a gamble and decided to play along to her little game. "What happens if I lose again?" he asked coyly. She leaned in close and pressed her nose to his, "If you lose, I win a husband~"

>an worker for the assignment office walks by with a big box
>they couldn't beat the curiosity out of you
>"what's in there, miss cat lady?"
>"Oh these? They're stuffed toys for the assignment humies; we make the toys look like their assigned wives so humies like you can ease into it. It's for your comfort :) See, they even come with a little message from your future wife.
>she pulls one out that looks like a busty warthog

>"you'll be getting a-lot-el sex with me!"

>they're all so pervy
>these are the first words they want their humies to hear?
>the cat lady talks to you, "You'll get yours soon sweetie. They're still making yo--"
>A goat runs down the hall with a bag in hand, "Tabitha! it's finished. You can give it to the hum--. Oh. Here ya go buddy!"
>you open the bag
>it. uh, your wife, is a mouse, with a little heart shaped wheel of cheese in her hands.
>it says, "Cheesed to meet you!"

>Paul pulled at the collar around his neck. He was uncomfortable. There were too many people at the mall. Of course, all the malls he visited as a kid were pretty empty. And abandoned. But somehow, it was even more unnerving that they were almost all anthros.
>He moved his little cart along the walkway like a little shield between him and everyone else. But as afraid as he was, he wouldn't let anything stop his mission. He wanted a gift for his wife before she went to the hospital, and there was no chance that he'd put it off any longer. She told him he'd be a father whether he wanted it or not, and now, it's been a whole year since she told him she was pregnant; so the baby had to be due soon, right? How long does pregnancy last for elephants anyway?
>When he first met Debbie at the assignment office, he thought he was going to die. A woman this big might not even crush him on purpose, but just by accident. But he knew better than trying to run, time in the pens taught him that if nothing else.
>Paul decided to stop at the chocolatier's for a gift; she loved her sweets. But before getting there, he noticed a kid's toy store and thought he ought to look for what gifts he'd get one day for their child, or children? She refused the ultrasounds, she wanted a surprise. He chuckled at the memory, the nurses really didn't like her decision. They said it was unfair and would keep the maternity ward statistics in the dark. Of course, it was probably just them wanting to snoop and see if it was a human boy or an anthro girl. But it wasn't their choice and Debbie didn't care about the government supplementary income for mothers expecting boys. With her cushy job, it's not like they needed the extra money.
>Paul strode down the aisles of the toy store. There were far more men here, mostly with their anthro daughters, but it was a welcome change of pace.
>He started where all the infancy toys were, the shelves practically overflowing with products. He thought about what his father would say, back at the end of the before times during the wars. How every store was empty and all the shelves were bare. How the cities had nothing for them but danger. Paul guessed it would have made sense to pack up and leave for the wildlands back then. It didn't help him growing up though.
>He picked up a toy. It looked like it was some kind of mobile, but heavy-duty. He swore if he hit the wall, it'd make a hole into the adjacent store. He picked up another toy. Some kind of rubbery sound box with buttons to push. He pressed a few and noises came out: a tiger roar, a dog woof, and a human yelp. Odd. He never had something like that growing up. But he assumed kids needed exposure to lots of things to grow up right, and then set it back down.
>He wheeled to the next aisle. He picked up a toy for slightly older children; it looked like it was marketed for little boys. A dollhouse with little anthro women and human men inside. There was a tiny kitchen full of men busily working away preparing food. Whole roast feral chickens, baked feral turkeys, and whole trays of sushi. In the rest of the house, anthro women trotted around in suits, gowns, and sports jerseys doing... Paul couldn't really tell. They were probably meant to be working in a separately sold office playset. He set down the dollhouse and picked up a toy with anthro girls all over the cover. It was a little league baseball set. A small tiger hit a home run in the package's picture. He remembered when his father would play sports with him on their farm in the wildlands. He missed not being able to get out and run like that. "It isn't right for a man to do such things, to risk injury like that," his pen counselors told him.
>He cried for a long time after that. A tear slipped from his eye and hit the baseball kit. He thought, hopefully, his wife might let him teach their daughter if they had one. He reluctantly set the sports gear down and left the aisle, passing the rows and rows of dolls of various anthro girls.
>The next aisle had toys for slightly older children. For boys, there were coloring sets, more dolls of popular characters from movies, and friendship bracelet sets. For girls, there were science experiment kits and kinetic dolls. 'Oh whoops,' he mentally corrected himself, 'action figures'.
>But one toy at the bottom caught his eye. It was the last one. Must be a popular toy. It felt like a stuffed doll, but a rather large one, about three feet tall. It looked like a generic human boy, but that wasn't what concerned him. The whole toy, with the presumable exception of the stuffing itself, was made of thick coarse rope and rawhide. He turned it over and looked at the tag. "Little Bill: The Chewable boyfriend. Made tough for growing girls ages 11 - 16. Let them learn with him first; he ain't fragile!" Paul's stomach turned. This is what's popular for girls? Ragdoll humies?
>A paw gently pushed his shoulder. "Hey, buddy" a frustrated voice called. Paul jumped nearly a foot. The voice belonged to some store worker, a tigress. "If you're not buying that, I need that toy for an online order. Some lady's kid keeps chewing through them, but won't buy the extra tough edition, so she needs another." Paul kept his distance and handed the toy to her, "I... I didn't want it anyway" he said dejectedly.
>Paul left for the next aisle. City life in the anthrostate kept surprising him. How different things were compared to the farm.
>But then he came across a toy that looked familiar. The shelf was full of it, a poor seller. It was a metal dart game, for older girls, of course, to be played outside. The kid was supposed to throw the dart straight up in the air and hold a ring out to have it fall back through. His dad loved dangerous games like that, kept his own dartboard set back at the farm. He remembered his father's lessons on the game, "Gotta keep a balanced grip. You want power, but not too much. That'll just lead to shitty aim and you'll never get bullseyes like that." Paul set the darts down. These ones were as big as his hands. An excess. Too dangerous even for his father's liking. He didn't see many toys marketed to older boys, but there were some plastic building sets of flowers and houses that had some pictures of them in the advertisements.
>He moved to the last row and picked up one more toy. It was the biggest yet, a large foam dart machine gun. It was bulky and as large as his torso. "20 BAJILLION ROUNDS" the box screamed. A water buffalo on the cover held it in a heroic 'Rambo-style' pose, spraying down imaginary shadowy anthro enemies. He looked at its shelf. Empty. Another best seller. He looked back at the woman on the packaging. She wore a torn crop top and a single bandolier. Anthrostate soldiers don't look like that in person, he remembered. They wear lots of gear and heavy combat boots.
>He remembered the day a squad of them arrived on the farm, the day he had to leave forever. From his bedroom, he saw them sprint from the tree line toward the home. He could still hear the gunfire from his father downstairs; hitting the rifle against a wall when it jammed. "Fuckin useless! Don't know why I worked so hard to get this damn thing. Ugh! It ain't slowin them down!" He could feel his mother's soft human arms protectively hold him. He could hear the crash of glass and wood as four soldiers broke into the home. His father sprinted up to his bedroom doorway, gun in hand. "I've got four bullets left," he mimed with his hands. "Come out with your hands up!" shouted a soldier, "You are in violation of anthrostate law. If you come peacefully, you and your son will be unharmed." Father let off another round, "And what about my wife?" Combat boots below suddenly stopped. "She'll be submitted for... processing" the voice called, unsure how to mask the truth. "Three bullets, just enough" Father signed. Father held him and Mom in arm, gun pressed in hand. He was shaking, and crying. "I can do it. I can do it" he said softly to himself with his most convincing voice. The boots downstairs picked up his whisper and rushed, but they couldn't reach the room before Mama was already dead. The soldiers arrived and one aimed her rifle into the room. Paul could feel the metal pressed against his head, could feel it shake with each of his father's ragged breaths. "Damn you, you freaks! You were supposed to get help, get treated for your disease. Why?! Why did you turn the whole world upsidedown?!" he screamed in frustration. The soldier growled, "Step away from the boy, sir." "You want my little boy? My only boy? I know you would've taken my wife, made her one of you freaks! But I'm not letting you! I'm not letting you take them!!" He cried and wiped a tear from his eye. The soldier made a small step forward. His father got quiet, "We're keeping our humanit--"
>BANG.
>"Oope, sowrry." A fox woman chuckled. Paul was deathly still. He didn't even notice how close her runaway shopping cart came to hitting him, crashing into the shelving instead. He was still there at the farm, holding his father's dead body. He dropped it to the floor, the foam gun making a loud thud against the wood floor. "I need to go," Paul said abruptly.
>Paul didn't notice the crowd watching him exit the store. He was used to it now, the stares, the memories. Or… at least he thought he was.
>His exit counselor at the pens said he should try and slowly work through those, preferably with a state-licensed therapist. But after the last one… he'd rather push it all down. Keep it to himself. Live in the moment, the here and now. And right now, he just wanted to find a gift for his pregnant wife.
>The chocolatier had just the right stuff. Plenty of fruit-dipped chocolate. And the store itself was pleasant too; far less for the mind to wander on.
>Walking back, a sound caught Paul's attention in his troubled stupor. It was a display TV in the window of an electronics shop. Displayed was some re-play of a concert over on the West Coast. Some up-and-coming popstar. Raytan? Rayband? Whatever. The name didn’t really feel that important. What did though, was the fact that this rayban was a human man.
>'What if Debbie has a boy?' he thought to himself. He stopped at the window and watched the young man sing slowly in a chair on stage. It surprised Paul how little clothing this popstar had on, a crop top with decorative feathers and stylish jeans. Doubly surprising considering the tone of this song. But, he thought, it was probably some performance stunt for the other songs, something to rile his fans up even more. He stood for a little while, absorbed in the melody.
>He began to wonder. To wonder if this boy was happy, doing the things he does, leading the life he leads, performing for these... anthros, living in this kind of world. He wondered what his parents thought when he was born. If they knew how they would take care of him in this world. Paul wondered if his son could be happy, living in this world with so few choices and so many dangers. He had no answers, only questions that worried him more than any anthro he had ever seen.
>As Paul left the window to walk back to the bus stop home, the pop star's song looped like a record in his ear.
"And I wear all your old clothes
Your polo sweater
I dream of another you
One who would never
Never leave me alone to pick up the pieces
Daddy to hold me
That's what I needed
So why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to go?
Son to father, son to father
I don't know you, but I still want to
Son to father, son to father
Tell me the truth, did you ever love me?
'Cause these are, these are
The confessions of a broken heart
Of a broken heart"

>"In here. Walk forward." you're commanded.
>The guard marches you forward into the opened concrete hallway, shutting the door behind you
>Compared to other sections of the pens, this hallway is quite clean

>But as far as you were concerned, you, your spirit? Unbreakable.
>And the guards thought so too; most of them argued they outta shoot you so they can spare stretched resources for more "cooperative ones"
>You wished you could shoot them.
>Not the guards, no. That's obvious.
>The "cooperative ones". Fucking traitors.
>What you'd give to take out your anger; put the muzzle to the back of their heads and---

>"New room, walnut. Maybe this'll crack your shell."
>She opens a heavy metal door,
>Behind it is a dark room, so dark you cannot see the other side
>You're shoved in and the door gives a metallic clank as it locks behind you
>There is no light here.
>Except for a hanging bulb a few feet to the right of the door. It is so dim, that it took several minutes for your eyes to adjust and notice it.
>Beneath it is a plate of food and water.
>You walk over to the plate and don't eat. You've been drugged before, you're not gonna make it easy.
>Plus, sitting under the little light you had was better anyway. Rather than trip over, whatever is in the dark.
>You sit and wait for whatever is coming. There's always something.
>Some guard wanting to blow off steam. A nosy counselor. A twitchy researcher.
>But nothing... so far.
>You wait longer, a few hours, maybe.
>As time passes, you notice it's just a bit cold here.
>Not like when they left you in the freezing Sierras, no.
>Just a bit, maybe 60 or 65 degrees.
>You wished you had a longer shirt, thicker shirt, hell, a better shirt.
>All you had were rags. Clothes torn and mended by pent-up anthros a looong time ago.
>There's no breeze in here, the air is still.
>More time passes, nothing.
>You decide to pass more time with some slumber and lay on your side on the smooth floor.
>You wake.
>They don't usually let you sleep. One of their tactics.
>But the food and water next to you have been changed for fresh stuff.
>They've been here.
>Your eyes have adjusted as far as they can, and you see a little ridge in the wall you didn't notice before next to the food plate.
>It looks like a trapdoor for swapping the food.
>You turn away from your discovery and make another.
>There's a drain cover in the floor near the door
>It's probably the best place to piss and shit, considering it's too dark anyway to see if there's a toilet over there, in the dark.
>The hours drag, but soon days begin to pass.
>You know by counting how many fresh platters of food and water you've been given.
>Only one meal a day; it's always been this way with how thin supplies are.
>You've counted twelve plates.
>Part of you worried.
>Nearly two weeks of fresh food, full sleep, no forced contact or mind games. No fighting. Silence.
>Maybe they put down the stick and are trying the carrot again.
>But you rested your head on your arms, you were too smart for such a simple trick.
>Or was it more than two weeks?
>It wouldn't surprise you if they were only giving you food every two or three days, many already wanted you dead.
>What if it's less?
>Ridiculous. They wouldn't waste resources like that.
>The pens were too frugal for that.
>It didn't matter though. Two weeks or not, time could make no difference in how you leave this place.
>You rested your eyes to take another nap.
>"You're so handsome when you sleep" a voice crooned.
>You bolt up and scoot closer to your light.
>That voice, a woman's voice.
>It came from inside your room.
>From the dark part concealing half the solitary cell.
>You can hear your breath, nasally and rushing.
>You slowly calm yourself.
>Nothing.
>Maybe you imagined it, dreamt it.
>Wouldn't be a surprise in here with how hard it is to orient yourself
>No sun and moon or constellations like in the open pens.
>No clocks or calendars like in the building pens.
>Just four walls, a lamp
>And the fog of darkness on the other side of the room
>"I’m still here you know" the voice gently chimed.
>You stood up closer to the light, eager to put more distance between you and, whatever was happening
>The voice giggled softly, "You don't need to be scared little humie; I just want to talk~"
>"I’m not afraid of you" you hurl back
>You assume a loose fighting stance, something you had to pick up instead of food rations sometimes
>"Are you sure about that?"
>You pull a little closer to the wall, but not the corner to trap you or against the wall to restrict you
>You hear a paw step
>The voice continues, "I can be nice, very nice... to the good ones. I'm only mean to the naughty ones. Which are you?"
>Another freak here to jump your bones
>You’re so sick of it, so tired of it.
>You don't know how this wannabe rapist got in here, but you know you will make her leave
>Your eyes dart over to your plate
>An idea
>You grab it and fling the food into the inky black which swallows it whole
>You smash the plate against the wall, picking up a spindly shard
>You hold it in front of you, ready to jab and slice
>"STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME. DON'T TAKE A STEP"
>The voice stops moving. It giggles.
>"Oh no. My weakness. Small knives."
>A single glint splits the other side of the dark
>"YOU DIDN'T THINK I WOULD HAVE ONE TOO?"
>You couldn't tell what the flash of light was
>A blade?
>A claw?
>A fang?
>A scalpel?
>Whatever it was, something was definitely there in the dark
>Your voice shakes, weak from fear and skipped suppers
>"What do you want?"
>You hear a rushing, like fur wagging? Twisting? Brushing? You can't tell.
>"Only what's best for you" the voice cooed,
>"But you make it so difficult, refusing to eat, refusing to play nice with others... refusing to obey"
>You force your eyes open more, straining to see your foe. Your lids are tired, exhausted
>"You're even refusing to sleep; is it because of me? Scared I'll come over and do what I want when you can't defend yourself?"
>Even if you weren't before, you're definitely not sleeping now. No way you'll let that happen.
>"I just want to be left alone!"
>The voice tsked you.
>"That's not an option," the voice said coldly, "Humies, Anthros; they're meant to be together. The way God intended."
>She sounded like one of those more culty counselors you had
>"What are you? There's no way you're a guard, they're too lazy for this. A counselor maybe? A researcher?"
>A scrape along the floor came up to your ears. "I can be anything you want, walnut. You just gotta open up for me."
>"NO. No. I just. I just want you to leave."
>"But there's only one door, right next to you. I'll have to get closer to go. Do you want me to get closer to you?"
>Fuck. Let that thing get closer? Or stay stuck with it? Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
>No, it had to be a lie. There has to be something else here.
>You strain your eyes against the inky air. "No. Just. Just stay over there. Let me make up my own mind."
>The voice pouts, "But shouldn't I be doing that? Every choice you've made has hurt you. Look at you, starving and sleep deprived. I could help you."
>"What do you mean sleep deprived?" you retort, "I just woke up."
>"No," the voice chides, "We've been at this for hours, nearly two full days. You're torturing yourself."
>"That's ridicridiculous. They haven't even changed out my food ye-"
>You turn and see a fresh plate.
>No.
>Two fresh plates.
>What the fuck.
>How did you not notice?
>How did it get in here?
>Did "she" put the food there?
>You scream, fear slipping through your voice, "I said STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME! I HATE MIND GAMES!"
>"Mind games?" the voice feigns confusion, "You think there's something wrong with your mind?"
>"STOP PUTTING WORDS IN MY HEAD!"
>"I just want what's best for you" the voice coos, "I want you to feed yourself, to rest yourself, to love yourself, to... pleasure yourself. You just need to do as your betters ask and you'll be happy"
>You've had enough of this.
>The torture.
>The games.
>The lies.
>The monster at the other end of this room.
>But now, unlike any other time before, you realize you have a choice you didn't before.
>You hold your plate shiv to your throat, its jagged edge slicing a few facial hairs off as you press it.
>"Woah, woah, woah." The voice suddenly says. "You want me to leave? Fine, I'll make you a deal."
>...
>"I'm listening," you say coldly.
>"Pull out your cock. Masturbate for us." a new woman's voice says.
>"Give us a show, and we'll leave" the first voice finishes.
>You jump back and look around wildly, fear gripping your body.
>You should've known there'd be more, they're animals. Travel in packs. It's how they work.
>"H-How do I know you're not lying to me?" you shake.
>"I haven't moved since you asked me to. I've stayed in the room with a feral like you. I've shown you trust, you ought to show me yours." the original voice calls.
>You can't bear it. You just want to be alone, rid of these perverted demons.
>Fine.
>Make a deal with the devil.
>You loosen your drawstring and your shorts fall to the floor.
>Once this is over, you can finally be alone, hopefully.
>You, for the first time, see the light reflect in an eye. Floating in the dark.
>"Good boy." the new voice coos.
>"Do as I say, and we'll leave." the original gently commands.
>You stay silent, but nod your head. Anything to get her, no, them out, but no more talking than needed.
>"Good, now step into the light and remove your shirt. I want want to see you better."
>You do just so.
>You feel even colder.
>It's not like those rags did anything, but, you feel even more defenseless now.
>You wish you had them back.
>The eye winks, blinks? and croons.
>"Good, good. You're soo skinny. Almost bones now.
>We'll fix that,
>in time.
>But
>good for you I like bones."
>She whispers from across the room, "You should grab your bone now."
>You take your cock in hand.
>It's been so long since you've done something like this.
>Couldn't with all the snouts around. They'd pick up the smell for sure and then there'd be no end to it.
>It feels... good. Natural.
>"Not to many fingers" the second voice hurridly juts in, "I want to be able to see."
>You keep your grip down to two and begin to slowly stroke. Hate in your eyes for these perverts; making you degrade yourself.
>"That's it" the first voice breathes, "That's what I like to see. Doesn't it feel good?"
>You keep your glare, but a sigh escapes you.
>The familiar touch of your hand is comforting. Warm. Human. Everything this place isn't.
>She has you stroke for several minutes, or is it a few hours?
>Your frail blood slowly pumps into your cock with each movement.
>You almost want to close your eyes. Relax. Enjoy this moment.
>But you can't.
>For obvious reasons.
>The second voice commands, "Faster."
>You scowl harder. It's masturbation. Shouldn't you be the one in control?
>"Faster Faster Faster" the first voice rushes, "Don't you want us to leave soon? Don't you want to enjoy it?"
>The thought of them leaving even quicker makes your heart begin to race.
>You stroke faster.
>"So you can follow instructions~" the second voice croons, "Good boy, Good boy".
>But they quickly stop you.
>"SLOW DOWN" the second commands.
>"IF we don't get a good show, we won't be satisfied enough to leave" the first scolds.
>You slow, you need them to actually leave. But,
>"Satisfied? Are you--?"
>The second voice drowns you out, "NO TALKING. MORE STROKING."
>"I never said you could ask questions" the first finishes.
>You can hear a third sound though, the light and wet suck of a moving finger.
>Figures. There had to be some string attached. But as long as you didn't have to see them, in the dark...
>"Faster. Again." she second says.
>You do so, eager to pick up the pace.
>She adds, "Tighten your grip, boy. Add another finger."
>Finally, something you were actually wanting. It's almost spooky, like they're inside your he--
>"STOP" blurts the, now breathy, second voice.
>What the hell. Frustration. Anger.
>You yell into the pitch-black room, "What do you want from me?!"
>"A show." the first voice pants
>"Your cum." The second adds
>"You shouldn't get to be the" the first moans, "the only one enjoying themselves"

>"We want to savor this. It's been so long since you've opened up even a little" the first bemoans
>"You have to perform for us, think about our needs." the second chuckles
>"That's what we get out of this" the first finishes
>"What if I refuse? Cum when I want?" you challenge.
>You see that glint again. Sharp. Percise.
>"Then we'll just have to take what we want. Make you cum again" the first voice threatens.
>"We thought you wanted a little control. We could just grab you and--" the second posits.
>No. You don't want them touching you.
>"Fine" you cross your arms.
>"Good boy" the first voice croons.
>"Play with your hole" the second moans, "I want to see you do it"
>You reluctantly reach for your butt before she stops you
>"No no. The other one. Your urethra. Pinch and rub your tip in little circles"
>You lean back and do as you’re told.
>Fully erect from all your stroking, your cock twitches in your hand. The tip is soo sensitive.
>A whimper escapes you.
>"MORE!" the voices cry in unison, "AH GOD. MORE!"
>They're chomping at the bit. They must be close.
>So are you.
>"Go back to stroking. Quckily." the second breathes desperately.
>"Fast Fast Fast" the first begs.
>You switch and feel the pressure build inside you. You start to sweat and pant.
>"Medium speed." the second coos
>You slow and lean against the concrete wall for support. You feel weak. Desperate to
>The second voice interrupts your thoughts, "Pick up the pace. You will cum at, and only at, my command"
>You pick up the pace. The end is near.
>She begins to count down, "5"
>The end is near.
>"4"
>Soon you'll finally be alone.
>"3"
>Soon you can finally sleep.
>"2"
>Soon, someday, you might be free.
>"2"
>Wait, what?
>"2"
>Oh god no. Oh god no. Are they tricking you? Are you hallu--
>"2"
>You stroke as fast as you can, all fingers. But nothing comes. So close to the edge and you can't cum.
>"1"
>The fever pitch, boiling kettles, the groan of an engine ready to blow.
>"Cum"
>You explode. Thick ropes leaping free in little arcs from your throbbing cock.
>You hear them panting. Sighing. Maybe they got what they wanted. You hope desperately they got what they want.
>"Good boy" they both call.
>You collapse to the floor. Exhaustion is taking you. Your eyelids feel so, so heavy.
>You hear footsteps come from the dark. But you can't move away, you're too, too---
>"Exhuasted?" she first voice asks smugly, knowingly.
>She isn't going to the door.
>No.
>She is headed straight for you.
>A cheshire grin glimmers like a string of sinister stars in the night.
>"No. No. We had a deal. W-we..." you struggle
>"I call the shots. And now that you'll obey, I say we're not done with you yet"
>The glimmer.
>It's dancing, flashing wild. It isn't stopping.
>"I need something from you. Something still inside of you. If you want to leave... you'll have to give up the most precious thing you have."
>You can't let her touch you. You don't want her to cut you. Slice into you. Take from you.
>But you can't move. Not even a muscle.
>She tricked you.
>Masturbation.
>Just to spend up the little energy you had.
>You do the only thing you can. The only thing you have left.
>You beg.
>You cry.
>"Please. Someone save me. Save me from her. I fucked up. I don't know what to do. I need someone to protect me. Please. I'm begging you. I'll do anything."
>The eyes are closer than ever. Wide and wild. They have no pupils, no souls.
>The glimmer splits into five. Reaching for you. To drag you into the dark. Never to return.
>You hear a scrape. A burning light engulfs you.
>Paws grab you from under your armpits and drag you from the cell. It's the guard.
>You can't see her in the light. For now, until you adjust, you're blind. Completely dependent on her.
>You wrap your arms around her, crying into her furry ample chest.
>"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
>She gently rubs your head. Her claws comb your matted hair.
>You hear another voice. A researcher you've met before.
>"That's more like it, walnut. Maybe we can make a good boy out of you yet."
>You smile softly and fall asleep in the safety of the guard's arms. You can't hear what she says next.
>"It only took five days. Looks like I won the bet, doc"

>"Get up."
>another soldier, this one a mule, reaches out to seize your arm

>you freeze
>until another sharp jab of the rifle gets you moving again

>you hear a lioness on guard duty muttering as you pass by
>"...poor bastard..."
>you look for any sign she might intervene
>but she just looks away and you're pushed along into the Major's personal quarters
>little more than a shack, but better than the tents the rest of the soldiers have to barrack in

>the Major is waiting for you
>standing in the middle of her plain quarters
>in front of the wooden, high-back chair she tied you to the last time she interrogated you is an otter in a sleek uniform
>she's not much taller than you are, and seems young and fresh-faced compared to some of the soldier's on-base
>but an air of malice and terror lingers about the Major
>the otter's violet eyes are narrowed as they stare at you
>"Put him in the chair."
>you're dragged to the chair and shoved in roughly
>you look up to the human soldier
"Please..."
>he ignores you, turning to face the Major and stand at attention
>"Anything else, ma'am?"
>the Major dismisses both of the enlisted with a wave of a paw
>"Come fetch him at eighteen-hundred hours, corporal. And see we are not disturbed until then."
>the pair of them snap a salute and a pair of 'yes ma'am's
>then march from the room to leave you to your fate
>a fate now in the hands of the most sadistic bitch you've ever met
>though her previous interrogations were measured to maximize pain while minimizing damage, you are still covered in testament to her efficiency and her cold cruelty
>just like the previous times, she's silent
>watching you, unmoving
>unblinking
>you suppress a tremble
>you resisted before, sticking to your story as a lost civilian
>but you don't think you'll be able to survive another session
>you still have to try
"Pl-please. I told you everything. Everything. I don't know any more. I'm just--I was just looking for something to eat!"
>though her face is unchanging, you can tell she doesn't believe you
>so you try to lay it on thick
>even throwing in some tears that aren't as fake as you wish
"I can't tell you any more! Please just don't hurt me again--"
>you flinch and shut your mouth when she raises a paw
>but there's no pain yet
>she just holds her paw up to silence you
>and she speaks
>softly and without emotion
>"Do you think I enjoyed hurting you?"
>you tremble
>too afraid to answer
>"Do you think I'm a monster? A sadist?"
>the Major watches you
>those terrible purple eyes boring into you so you can't bear to look up at her face for long
>"I am not. I did what I had to do for my mission."
>your jaw is seized
>forcing you to look her in the eyes
>"My orders were to obtain anything useful to the Federation."
>the otter leans in closer
>her eyes scrutinizing you
>"But I see you are too strong to break."
>then there's a flash of fangs in a smile more terrifying than expressionless cold
>"And that is useful to me."
>the Major's smile does not reach her eyes
>but it's still there as she continues to speak at you
>"Since you will not tell me what you know, I can tell you what I know."
>your jaw is released and the Major steps back to start counting on her fingers
>"I know what you are. An insurgent smuggler. I know what little information you might have is outdated by now. I know that my orders are to execute any prisoners once their usefulness is expended."
>purple eyes drill into you
>looking for any reaction
>you give one up, a small gulp
>and her smile grows wider
>"And I know you can keep a secret."
>the Major leans forward and presses a thumb against a more recent wound she gave you
>making you squirm in pain
>"I know that very well. So I have a proposal for you."
>she pulls her paw back to steeple her fingers
>"I will let you keep your secrets. I will also let you live. If..."
>once the pain has subsided to a manageable level, you look up to the Major's eyes
>there's something new there
>a light
>an inkling of conspiracy
>or of madness
>"...you keep a secret for me too."
>you wrestle with your emotions internally
>you knew you were dead the moment you were captured
>and this is probably just a trick to try and get information out of you
>but...
"A secret?"
>her smile widens, and you know you've made a mistake
>but it's too late
>the Major plants both her paws on your shoulders
>raising more pain from the bruises there
>her smile starting to look manic
>"A secret! Something I cannot share, with superiors, with subordinates, or with peers."
>she squeezes
>you groan
>"But a secret I can share with a lone prisoner I can execute if he should ever let that secret out."
>suddenly her smile disappears and she releases you to stand at attention
>and she even frowns
>"Or you say no, I extract whatever useless information you know, and I put you in front of a firing squad anyway."
>well
>fuck
>what kind of choice is that?
>you sigh
"Okay. What's the secret?"
>the smile returns
>the otter even does a little hop, twisting in the air as she lets out a chirp of happiness
>"Perfect! Yes!"
>she grabs your shoulders again
>this time drag you out of your seat and onto your feet
>the only thing keeping her claws from digging in are the military gloves she wears
>at least, she wears them normally
>she always took them off before an interrogation
>you try to drive that thought from your mind
"What's the secret?"
>the Major lets out a giggle
>the sound so alien you can't believe you heard it
>you're pulled to the metal-framed cot set in the corner of the room
>the Major sits down
>and drags you down with her so you're awkwardly fold back on the bed beside her
>"It is easier to show you."
>with her grip on your shoulders she manhandles you so you're lying across the cot
>with your head in her lap
>the tough fabric of her uniform pants are rough
>but they're a cloud compared to the ground you've been sleeping on
>the Major has you on your side, facing the room
>you lay there, not willing to move as you try to figure out exactly what she's doing
>you hear the shuffling of fabric, and then see her gloves tossed across the small room to land on the chair
>oh fuck
>here it comes
>her body shifts
>and you feel her paw
>resting on your head
>slowing it draws back through your hair, before lifting to repeat the motion
>the Major slowly strokes your head, using her claws to scratch your scalp gently
>what the fuck is going on
"Uh, what are you--"
>there's a finger pressed to your lips in an instant
>the claws on your head clamp down
>"Shh. Be silent."
>you follow the order and clamp your mouth shut
>after a second, the finger leaves your lips and the other paw starts stroking again
>time passes slowly, with only the slow, repetitive movement of her fingers through your hair to mark the time
>after an indeterminable amount of time, the Major speaks
>two hushed words
>"Good boy..."
>you aren't quite sure you heard that right
>the otter said it so quietly you could barely understand it
>it sounds like she called you--
>"Good boy. So quiet. So obedient. Laying in mommy's lap."
>you blink several times, now on full alert once again
>the words so bizarre to hear from your torturer, you're sure they precede some further torment
>but the Major just goes on stroking your hair
>"Are you scared? You're so stiff."
>her other paw now rests on your shoulder
>but this time it's gentle, and caresses your bare skin
>"You don't need to be afraid of me anymore. I was telling the truth when I said I don't like hurting you."
>oh god
>it's hard to comprehend it
>good sense keeps you from opening your mouth
>so she continues on cooing in your ear
>"I have to do these things. It's my job. But secretly, what I really want..."
>the Major sighs
>a sad, wistful sigh, like a love-stricken teen
>"...is someone to be mommy's good boy. To hold, and cuddle, and keep safe. Will you be that good boy?"
>holy fuck
>how the hell do you answer that question?
>fifteen minutes ago she was ready to arrange a firing squad
>and now...
>"Just say yes for mommy. Say you'll keep my secret and I won't have to hurt you ever again. I'll take you to my quarters every day, and I'll treat you just like this."
>fuck it
>what have you got to lose?
>if you say yes she'll probably still kill you
>but if you say no she'll torture you and kill you
"A-and I don't have to talk. About the secrets I don't know?"
>the Major snickers and pats your shoulder reassuringly
>"No. As long as you're mommy's good boy, the only secret you need to worry about is mommy's."
>you shiver
"Fine."
>the Major chirrups again
>and leans down to kiss your forehead
>"Good boy! My brave boy. So strong. So tough. Mommy had to hurt you so much, but you never gave up. That's how I know you'll never give up mommy's secret."
>the secret that she's fucking insane?
>you don't think anyone on this base would believe you if you told
>she goes on stroking your hair and skin
>and even more, you feel the brush of sleek fur sliding over your stomach
>"Why don't you hold onto mommy's tail?"
>the Major gives you no choice, forcing the tip of her tail into your cuffed-together hands
>"Just lie down and let mommy take care of you. If you're a good boy, I may even reward you in our next session..."
>so you lie there, held in the arms of the military officer who put cigarettes out on you
>resting your head on her lap like you're lovers
>while she whispers sweet nothings in your ear
>it's the best you've felt in weeks
>but it comes to the end suddenly with a knock on the door
>the voice of the human soldier that brought you in sounding outside the door
>"Major. It is eighteen-hundred hour."
>your eyes snap open
>the Major goes rigid, her voice returning to its cold, unfeeling timbre
>"Very good sergeant. I will be finished shortly."
>you glance up at her
>she looks down at you, eyes full of concern as she raises a paw and whispers
>"Mommy's sorry, sweet boy."
>then she drives her claws into your bare chest, raking five lines of bloody cuts across it
>you scream out in sudden shock and pain
>"Keep screaming."
>she doesn't have to tell you twice
>because she keeps digging her claws into your flesh as she whispers
>"You're still mommy's good boy, and you just have to be brave for a little bit longer. I have to keep my secret too."
>you whimper through grit teeth
>then the Major pulls back her paw, still dripping with blood, and caresses your cheek
>"See? Now it's over. Stand up."
>you're pushed out of the cot so you have to stand to catch yourself
>the Major directs your back toward the chair
>"Come in sergeant."
>the human steps just inside the door
>eyes averted from your wounds
>the Major gestures at you
>"Take him to the infirmary. I want him ready for another interrogation by tomorrow."
>you’re taken by the shoulders and led out of the room
>but as you glance back you see the Major staring at you
>that same toothy smile on her face
>what have you gotten yourself into?

>Some rich weirdo buys up an island and makes a park full of genetically engineered dinosaur Anthros, presumably for sex tourism.
>They all break loose and subsequently hunt down and rape everyone on the island.
>This does not halt the construction of the resort at all.
I would pay good money to be hunted throughout a tropical island by busty dino sluts who want my cock for a week or two.

>"Alright humie, I scared off those freakshow preds. Now you owe me a proper milking."
>"Get to suckin', these puppies are sore. And get those damn pants off."

>Your ass is now shipped to a dumpy Anthro State trailer park town.
>Life now being ran by retarded Anthro women that drag you into their bullshit >Every week.
>The State inspectors act like Great-Value brand knockoffs of actual inspectors.
>There's not even a real State HQ
>They just took over the Slop-Stop/Fried-Fish-Queen combo store.

>while doing your best to clean your love shack
>Your Wolf Wife bursts through the front door
>She's in her Iconic husband beater and camo pants combo
>"Nonny..."
>this sounds serious.
>"The girls and I just spent all week digging a giant hole behind the retard HQ"
>she's trying to catch her breath, but you know she's not done yet.
>not stupid enough, you can feel it.
>"we're opening a pool and Bar to prove a point to the state"
>This doesn't even surprise you anymore
>now she's carrying you over her shoulders while rushing to the rape van
>"I need to wrestle you in there"
>She gives your tush a proud squeeze
>"to defend your honor as my husband to these fucks"
>you've given up at this point and accepted this will be your entire day now.
>It's been 2 months of shit like this every week
>You hate that you can already guess the context
>"you didn't want me doing the 'scared straight' program the State just made up."
>it's not even a question, you just know how your wife thinks
>Just mentioning them gets her growling
>"YOU'RE ALREADY STRAIGHT ANON"
>"I'm already scared"
> as you drive off you wonder if all trophy husbands have to deal with this.

>You come back home late at night
>Had to spend all day at the DMV
>Some nonsense about your trailer home counting as a vehicle under Anthrolaw and needed new registration renewal
>It doesn't even move
>But neither does your wife
>Won't get off her fat ass except for the occasional paid gig
>Hence why you went and not her.
>You open the door
>The screen falls offs
>Great another thing to fix
>You leave it outside and shut the door behind you
>All things considered though, it felt good to get out for a while.
>Left after a big fight with her.
>She wants to act like she's some kind of alpha or some shit but won't even get up for her own beers
>You rub a sore spot on your head from where the empties usually hit you
>You rub out a 'what-if' thought
>Think of what would've been if you got assigned to your best friend, a calico named Jack
>Would've been nice
>She was fit, fast, financially intelligent, and successful
>Instead you got Ruth
>A wolf
>A 'wire black' haired wolf with a busted sniffer and all the opposite qualities to the calico
>A fat ass with an even fatter stomach
>Won some sort of local lottery that let her pick from a higher assignment pool

>... all of this
>You were thinking about a divorce, even picked up a form while you were at the DMV
>It was uncommon, especially for men trying to leave, but not unheard of
>You would have to prove spousal neglect
>Shouldn't be too hard
>What was hard, though, was the feelings of it all
>You wanted it to work out
>Mama always said you were a lover, not a fighter
>Mama
>If only she was still with us, here right now
>You look over at your 'wife's' TV chair
>She's not there
>Wtf
>You walk over to the giant butt indent in the plush cloth recliner
>She's always there, awake or not
>But not now
>Whatever
>You were tired
>You need a nap
>You go to your shared bedroom
>The door is already open, just a crack

>Would it kill her to pick up her pants?
>Tail or not
>You can see her whole ass-crack
>Did she pass out drunk halfway into bed? Again?
>You could smell the alcohol
>You were just about to walk in, when you heard her start talking
>No
>Praying?
>She wasn't religious. Was she?
>You got on your knees and eavesdropped
>"God" she sniffled, "I'm sorry."
>"I spent so long askin fur ya tuh take away muh husban"
>How could she--?!
>"I know he's suffrin. I know I'm no good for em."

>"I'm sorry God... But I've changed muh mind"

>The sheets lifted a little when she gripped them in her clenched paws.
>"I love em too much"
>She cried
>Little tears soaking the sheets
>"But I'm no good, I don't know no way tuh show em I love em..."
>She whines, "I've sinned God, I barked at em fur that pool"
>"But how am I tuh accept it? I'm so damn fat from sittin all day... I ain't got no beekeenee... I'd look no good for muh mans"
>She heaved great sobs, "I ain't even got the money tuh fix it. No jobs. My little humie's gotta use the welfare money"
>"Please help me God. I don't wanna lose em... Please make me a woman good enough for em."
>You sit quietly on the floor
>You touch your cheek
>It's wet
>God, why wouldn't she just tell you all this?
>Was this even your wife?
>Had someone come and replaced her with someone who looked exactly--
>"Oh and God?" She sniffled and wiped a tear away, "while you're at it, could ya make em a lil' faster? He takes so long beer fetchin fur me"
>No, yeah. That's your wife
>You look at the divorce form in your hand
>You could finish signing it
>You silently walk outside
>You get up on the roof and sit
>You grab a sheet of metal she was supposed to fix the roof with
>You look through the whole below you into your bedroom
>Your wife is still crying into the covers
>You shake the sheet metal
>Wobbling it hard
>Making a metallic storm sound
>Your wife looks up, but she can't see you
>Just starlight
>You bellow your deepest voice,
>"Ruth. My child."
>"God?" she asks.
>"Yes child."
>"God, God I." she wipes her face, "I wuz worried ya wouldn't' answer"
>"I'm here for you my child. I've heard your prayer. You tell me you love your husband, but I see you don't show it."
>She sniffs, "Yeah God. I don't know how... I feel so useless"
>"Hush my child. I am God, the great comforter. I will help you in your hour of need."
>Her tail tip wags just a little, "Ya will?"
>"Yes, my child. I will provide for you. Go out and look for jobs. I will bless your efforts and the money will surely come to you."
>"Okay" she said softly, "What 'bout muh house?"
>"Help your husband clean. It will make him feel appreciated and let him rest his weary body."
>She looked to the side and reluctantly said, "Okay God. I'll do that... But I got one more questin."
>"Ask and you shall receive an answer, my child..."
>"What should I do 'bout that pool muh husban gave me? I'm so happy fur the water, but I'm ashamed of muh body. I won't look no good in it for him."
>"My child..." you bellow as softly as you can, "Did I not make men and anthros for each other? Did I not put in them the spark of desire? Your husband loves you, curves and all. He will be overjoyed to see you swim no matter what you look like."
>She looks straight up into the heavens, tears pooling in her eyes
>"Really God?"
>Out of sight, you smile
>"Yes, really; my child."
>"But, my child, you need to cool it with the alpha attitude. You don't need to be strong all the time for your husband. He is your mate, I made him to support you when you are weak, to help you when you fall; just as you are to be for him. You are a pack of two. You're already the alpha."
>Her tail wags faster
>"Thank ya God. I. Ya don't know how much I needed tuh hear that. Well, I mean you're God, ya probly did know. But I" she stammers, "I-I-I promise tuh go tuh church more. I swear God"
>"Yes my child, but also promise not to throw empties at your husband in anger, it hurts him and he doesn't like it."
>Her face looked like she was going to have the most trouble with this one
>"... 'kay God"
>"Good. Now, say Amen and clean your house before your husband arrives. I will bless your efforts."
>"Amen." she says before getting up and stumbling out of the room.
>You can hear her clank around trying to figure out how to clean.
>You lay back on the tin roof of your trailer, exhausted from your performance
>She probably won't do an impressive job, but it's the thought that counts
>You'll head back down after you rest and pretend to arrive at the house
>You look again at the divorce form
>You crumple it in your hand and throw it as far as you can into the woods behind your house

>But she's also filling out job applications
>Baby steps
>She takes a dry swig and scowls
>"Honey?! Where's muh next-?!"
>Her arm is lifted, empty can in-hand ready to throw
>Her face softens
>Her arms slowly drops

>after many months at sea the troop of mares finally disembarks on the sandy beaches of the new world, fresh air to their lungs after dealing with the scent of fish and saltwater so long
>the first thing they find past the lush forests were these small furless bipeds, running around almost naked and up for grabs, staring at them like sentries from a safe distance
>natives, they weren't dumb, they just didn't know as much, they didn't even know anthros this big existed, for what little of them already lived on the new world avoided contact with these natives, no more than myths to their culture
>at first things seemed to head in the right direction, seen as goddesses by their clad armour and impressive trinkets, the native humans welcomed them in with open arms
>offerings of chocolate, tamales, fruits that they had never seen, dances and spectacles only for their eyes
>they had been so long at sea and deprived from phisical contact that many of them had the chance to intimate with the other group, one of the highest showoffs of trust between two parties
>but sadly, the hunger of the crown can never be satiated
>gold was abundant on their land, they were open to trade for it, many more mares came into this land to facilitate its transportation back to their homeland, but once it began to ran out is when the pillars began to bend
>those that hid gold got capital punishment if they were lucky, those that resisted the expansion of the empire had it even worse, many natives became the target of slavery and abuse
>to call it a war would be understatement, it was genocide, to the people and their identity
>religious artifacts sent to museums or smelted into usable ingots of precious metal, their temples demolished to make way for expansion, their way of living, what they wore, how they spoke and everything that made them human was removed from them, it wasn't rare to hear ''saddleboy'' as a slur to natives, given how any equine female would have her way with them
>and the mares? they saw all of this as a good thing, ''taming the wilds'' as documents say, the only good native is a tamed native
>all forms of organization ran by these humans fell, and soon they had no other option than to blend into equine culture as their servants
>it is barely now after decades passed that these facts see the light of day by the hand of archeologists, but it's too late, there is nobody left to blame that is alive, the damage is unreversible, and their image as a once proud species has been reduced to being good for nothings stuck on their broken home breaking their backs for scraps, or sucking up as a toy to one of the many wealthy groups of anthros that got rich off the exploitatio-
>as you almost finish reading the small pamphlet that you found tucked between two bricks, you trip and fall, it drops into a puddle of dirty water, sure as all hell it's ruined now
>looking at who did it, a mare two heads taller than you smiles with ill intent
>''damn saddleboy, you never know when to shut up do you?''
>she keeps walking, you feel that tug on your face again as she drags you across the floor behind her
>''speaking that crap is what got you in here to begin with, so if you have enough neurons left to read, you'll have enough to stay silent until we get you tagged''
>nodding, you get up, trailing behind the mare once more, guess revolution isn't really meant for you...or your direct lineage if this continues
>we thought they were gods, but we were fighting demons from the very start

NTA but this is the best explanation for a human inspector I could come up with:
>guy is assigned to an inspector who at some point is moved into detective work, turns out she's the kind of officer who takes work home with her
>she lets her husband take a look at her notes with her one day, turns out he has an extremely good nose for detective work and all but cracks a tough case that had stumped his wife and the other inspectors working on it
>wife is honest and doesn't take credit for it at work
>he helps her solve a bunch more cases at home
>someone eventually decides to float the idea of giving this guy an official position where he can have direct access to the State's resources (and maybe there's some shit like a horrible serial killer on the loose putting immense pressure on officers to get shit solved ASAP at all costs), this guy gets the position of Inspector because the State has a remarkably inflexible rank system and past a certain point most people are Inspectors with different duty assignments rather than having specific ranks for different roles
>intended to effectively be an office worker, but on paper has the full authority of any other anthro Inspector because the system wasn't designed for oddball situations like this
>guy is permanently assigned as his wife's junior partner, is supposed to be at her side at all times when on duty
>inevitably some shenanigans happen because drama and he ends up caught up in street work and has to try and throw the weight of his office around, to mixed results

>One Huge Toy Collecter
>Be me.
>I broke af and need money to survive until my next paycheck.
>goddamn it, I need to find a way.
>Look around the house for something i can sell
>What's that? A figurine from the Feline Strikers© series
>it looks good and it's in good shape.
>Well at least some nerdy collector will appreciate it.
>I clean it a little and put it online
>I wait for a message
>Two hours go by.
>got one message from KittyFan99
>ok weird name but sure.
>Oh they are gonna pay for it in cash and want to meet.
>What are the chances of me being kidnapped or robbed? he's probably a fat nerd so no need to worry.
>We agreed to meet at a local pizza place.
>I reach the pizza place and sit down waiting for KittyFan99.
>I got my figurine with me and I'm waiting.
>i got a message telling me that they had reached the pizza place
>"I'm in table 7" I replied
>ok this is the time let's see how they look.
>Oh here comes a guy with glasses...and he's with his family, Wrong person.
>it might be this woman...oh she works here.
>Wait someone is coming.
>Woah that large cat, she looks like a gang member with her buff body and scars on her face.
>Oh that's not Kittyfan99
>Wait...why is she coming to me? oh fuck it's her she's KittyFan99.
>I'm so going to get robbed...or raped...or both!
>" are you BiggusDickus69?" she asked.
>i stayed silent because of course the person interested in the fucking figurine is a fucking six foot seven dark blue cat.
>"i said are you BiggusDickus69?" she repeated.
>"Y-yes?" i replied with a bitch tone.
>"Good," she said and then sat down next to me.
>The table shook from the impact of her butt sitting on the chair.
>"I am KittyFan99, Nice to meet you," she said and went to shake my hand.
>ok maybe she isn't that scary and I just judged her.
>i went to shake her hand.
>HOLY FUCK! THIS BITCH HAS STEEL FOR HANDS!
>What the fuck is she eating? fucking sharks?!
>"So BiggusDickus69, do you have the stuff?"
>Why did i choose this name? i thought it would be funny but now i realize that the joke is on me.
>i shook my head and showed her the figurine on the table.
>"Nice," she said and then put a magnifying goggles and started analyzing every inch of the Figurine.
>She looks like a pro while checking every paint in the figurine.
>"This is a Christina Ronaldo© figurine from the 2022 World Cup collection and she's in good shape,a little scratch in the right knee but I can fix it"
>"So you are satisfied?" i asked curious to know her thoughts.
>"Well it's better than what i thought so i might give a little bonus for that haha"
>oh shit! well, that's good! really good
>"but i have a question," she took off the magnifying goggles and looked at me with a curious face,"How did you manage to find this? are you also a collector? do you like Feline Strikers©?"
>well shit i don't know shit about this, should i lie and pretend that I'm an expert?
>Nah let's just be honest she's already sold.
>"Not really i found it for sale one day and i thought that it looked good"
>"Interesting," she nodded and looked at you with a stern face,"Well you see, i care a lot about Feline Strikers© and they are an important part of my life..."
>She pointed to her facial scars," You noticed those didn't you? i got them in prison when someone tried to steal my shit"
>Oh fuck i was right she went to prison, but she looks peaceful.
>"and after I got out, i wanted a hobby, something to fill the void in my life, and one day I found a figurine of Ronna "the Phenocat"© in a garage sale and bought it and i instantly fell in love with the whole Feline Strikers© brand and it became my life, i met a lot of friends online"
>"Wow...that's incredible"
>"Oh my name is Paula, what's yours?"
>"Anon, you can call me Anon"
>"Well nice to meet you Anon," she said with a smile,"i think that we are gonna be very good friends!"
>"I'm sure we will"
>she looks nice let's hope that i don't get on her bad side.
>What is she pulling from her pocket?
>is that a fucking knife?!
>why does she have a knife?! am I going to get robbed?!
>i knew it! i should have used other methods to get money damn it!
>streaming? nah too controversial to be left alone with an open camera
>Onlyfans? Oh yeah, I have a dick
>all that for a fucking figurine?!
>"What's the matter anon?" she asked.
>"is that a knife? Why are you pulling a knife on me?" i asked again like a bitch.
>"oh no it's just a pen, a knife-shaped pen haha"
>why the fuck does she have a knife-shaped pen, who even sells that? fucking ISIS?!
>"oh haha" i faked a laugh
>"so anon," she said while writing something in her notebook and then looking at you with a sly smile,"about your pay"
>she reached for her pants and unzipped them.
>ok this is not what i was expecting
>i mean that would be good but I really need the money though
>Sex or money? hmm the eternal struggle of the human desire continues.
>She started pulling benjamins from inside her pants.
>Did...did she hide the money in her underwear?
>Bitch you crazy!
>"Here you go anon," she hands me the money," nice and warm"
>it was indeed warm and kinda moisty
>" And for your bonus," she said while reaching to her back.
>is she going to pull money from her ass?!
>Oh she has a back pocket?
>She pulls out exactly 150$ and hands it to me.
>Money is money
>"...thanks"
>"You are welcome!" she said and giggled a little.
>ok now I think we are done now.
>What a journey!
>"So anon," she said with a little blush," this is my first meeting someone in a pizza place..."
>oh fuck..
>"and i was thinking hehe" she chuckled
>OH FUCK!
>"Maybe we can...pfft i don't know haha... hang out a little?" she said with a smile.
>OH FUCK GOD WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?!
>ok anon just say no and you are busy or some shit.
>"ehhh...sure"
>FUUUUCKKK!!!!
>Regret level: Rising™
>Why the fuck did I say yes? I could've just said, "Nah, I gotta go," and left with my cash.
>But nooooo, dumbass me had to say "ehhh...sure" like a fucking pushover.
>Paula's face lights up like I just handed her a winning lottery ticket.
>Her big, scarred-up feline mug grins ear to ear, showing those sharp-ass fangs.
>"Really?! Oh, hell yeah! This is gonna be fun!" she says, tail flicking excitedly.
>Oh god, oh fuck, what did I just sign up for?
>Need to defuse the situation before she gets any ideas.
>"Uhh… so, uh… you hungry?" I ask, hoping maybe if she eats, she’ll calm down.
>Her smile gets even bigger. Oh no.
>"Oh, starving."
>Fuck.
>Paula doesn't wait. She slams her massive paw-hand on the table like she's about to place a bet in a mafia-run casino.
>Table shudders under the impact, my drink jumps an inch off the surface.
>Half the restaurant turns to stare at us.
>Goddamn it, woman, why are you built like a fucking demolition truck?!
>"WAITER!" she booms, voice loud enough to rattle the cheap plastic pizza place decorations.
>Shit, shit, shit, please stop making a scene.
>Waiter finally arrives.
>Oh.
>Oh my god.
>It’s a young deer girl, cute as hell, probably a college student working part-time.
>Big soft eyes, delicate little features, the kind of girl you'd see sipping tea in an aesthetic café, not serving greasy pizza to behemoth cat criminals.
>I desperately wish I was on a date with her instead.
>She smiles nervously. "H-Hi, what can I get for you today?"
>Before I can open my mouth, Paula slaps the menu shut.
>"I'll have four large meat-lovers pizzas. Extra cheese. Extra sauce. Extra everything."
>Four.
>Large.
>Pizzas.
>For herself.
>Oh fuck, I’m sitting across from a black hole in the shape of a woman.
>The deer girl hesitates. "Um… did you mean for sharing, or…?"
>Paula leans in slightly. "Nah, just for me. My boy Anon here still needs to order."
>She grins and looks at me expectantly.
>My brain is fried.
>I can’t even process food at this point.
>Panic order mode engaged.
>"Uh… just a veggie pizza, I guess."
>Paula snorts. Loudly.
>"Veggie? The fuck are you, a rabbit?"
>She laughs like she just heard the funniest joke of the year.
>The deer girl giggles a little too, trying to stay professional. Goddamn it.
>Paula leans back, still chuckling to herself.
>"Man, I knew you were a soft little guy, but damn, Anon. You eat like a prey animal."
>Oh no, she’s bullying me now.
>My fate is sealed.
>I'm stuck in a pizza place with a six-foot-seven beast of a woman who just ordered four whole fucking pizzas and is now making fun of me.
>I have made a terrible mistake.

>Her face twisted up in sudden flashes of discomfort. “Mon Cheri! No. Mon Cheri! No. No no no, not like zat!"
>He pulled his face from her legs, panting, and sat back to the floor, "Sorry, I just don't think I've got the stuff"
>She looked down at him, a pity and glow in her eyes. Her rat claws stroked his head. "It's fine >Mon Cheri, we can attempt again later." She lightly kneaded his shoulder, "You just need more practice to dine well on me. Lots of practice~"
>He laid back on the floor, exhausted from his fruitless attempts. He stared at the ceiling wishing he knew how to pleasure her right. Impress her even.
>She left the couch sauntered into the kitchen; her hips swaying to and fro with her tail lazily following suit.
>"’ow about some water for now? Hm?" she called bent over in her fridge, "Or per’aps somezing to nibble on?"
>He let out a sigh, his cheeks red from the mention of 'nibbling'. But his stomach was actually hungry. "Both, please!" He called back as he rolled up from the floor.
>"Oh ho! Demanding aren't we?" she playfully teased. "But, I will prepare somet'ing. I will be a few minutes."
>He smirked and looked around her apartment to find something to occupy him while she rummaged through her kitchen.
>Her apartment was unbearably messy. Messier than any anthro he's dated before. He sat down on her thrifted broken couch. It sat amongst small stacks of saved newspaper. Some of which had been pulled and crumpled into moving boxes. The makeshift packing paper cradled a seemingly innumerable amount of trinkets, artifacts, and curiosities.
>He picked one up, a pressed stem of flowers stored between two thick sheets of glass. "Mon amour, you have such a lovely little set of white flowers pressed here. Tell me, where did you pick it?" Her head popped up from the fridge, "Hmm?" She mused with slight agitation, "Why are you looking t'rough my zings?" He blushed, feeling like he yelled out that his hands were in the cookie jar. "I'm sorry mon amour; I-I just became curious, I wasn't trying to pry." She smirked and rolled her eyes, "Shouldn't you know zat curiosity killed ze cat? You son of a tabby. You should ‘ave asked me first." He hung his head; she couldn't stay cross with him. "But. I'll forgive you. Ze flower was one I pressed in French Guiana during research for my master's program. It's a Degranvillea dermaptera". He traced the flower's contours over the glass with his fingertip. A master's program? He wished he finished college.
>He set the preserved plant down and picked up a box filled with gaudy purple, green, and gold beads. Behind it were several other boxes just like it, filled to the brim. "What are these for mon amour? There are soo many beads. Where did you get them?" He could hear the rhythm of her slicing something in the kitchen, "Oh my Mardi Gra beads? Zey were t'rown to me during ze parade for flashing my tits. I've taken zem down from ze attic to rearrange ze space."
>"Oh, do you go every year?"
>"No. Just ze once. It was quite difficult to carry zat many beads, I do not wish to risk collapse while simply walking again."
>He couldn't quite place it; why he felt a stroke of melancholy closing up the boxes upon boxes of beads. His mind strayed to a stranger's compliment he heard years ago.
>He gently shook the thought from his head and moved on past the boxes. The wall behind them held some suspended bookshelves adorned with traveling photos and a number of charms and kotchkeys. He picked up a picture frame and looked at its photo.
>His amour was posed on a rock overlooking the sea.
>"Where's this photo from? The one with you overlooking an ocean?"
>"Oh zat old zing? It's from when I went mountain climbing in Algeria."
>Algeria. He knew Algeria. It was a country he couldn't find on a geography test. But it was also a vacation spot his neighbors visited often. They had invited him a few time, but he had had to decline. He wished he had gone.
>He picked up another photo. In this one, there were three rat women with toothy grins. They were sharing one cramped moped in a crowded street lined with jungle foliage. "And where's this photo from, mon amour? The one with the moped?"
>She picked out some fruits and hummed, "Ah! I love zat one. It's when my sisters and I visited Vietnam. Beautiful country, lovely rivers."
>"You look quite lovely in it too," he said in a sigh that was becoming too common.
>She smirked, "Mon Cheri. Go down zat road and you'll make a river out of me~".
Rivers. His first date with her was on a riverfront. She told him to go there for a 'magical night'. How did he ever get her number?
>He set the frame back down and walked to her window sill. He looked out at the city with a melancholy in his eyes. All these places she's been; all these things she's collected; all these worldly skills she has...
>Even though he was half a foot taller than her, he felt so small next to her.
>She walked back into her living room and placed a platter of cut fruits, meats, and veggies atop her coffee table. "Mon Cheri?" she asked, "Why do you look so sad?"
"I just... You've done so much, been so many places, so many people... And I have only left home once." He turned to face her, little tears welling up in his eyes, "I can't pleasure you. I can't possibly interest you. How could you be happy with someone like me?"
>A diminutive scowl creased into her face, "Don't say such zings." She placed out their silverware in forceful little thumps, "Zere is no joy in comparing ourselves to ot'ers. We ALL have our own lives to live. And what we cannot get ourselves, we benefit from ze shared experience of ot’ers." She sat down, "Besides, you are far younger zan I. You have time to breathe the world in, if that is what you wish." He slowly walked over, weighed down by his emotions, and eased in next to her. He gently laid his head in her naked fuzzy lap.
>She continued to chastise him, soft yet firm, "And even beyond zat, I am insulted by your words. I tell you I love you and you question ze truth of my words? As if I would not be ‘onest wit' you?" He looked away in shame, "I'm sorry mon amour."
>Her eyes drifted to her makeshift charcuterie board and she smirked, "If you are really sorry..." She gingerly plucked a few grapes from her table and dangled them above his nose, "zen you can start by feeding me a few of zese, Mon cheri~"
>The first few grapes went fast. She gulped them down before he even had a chance to let them completely go. He chuckled a little from the tickle of her whiskers on her hand.
But the next few went slowly, she took his arm in her hands and guided each to her mouth, sucking teasingly on his fingers after each grape.
>She wiped her hand and nodded to the platter, "Eat your vegetables and I'll let you ‘ave dessert~". Confused, he searched the platter with his eyes.
"What dessert? What do you---" and then he saw how her thighs rubbed together, "Oh~".
>He took a stalk of celery and re-sat himself on the floor with worried eyes, "But what if I'm bad? I still don't know what I'm doing." She gently held his cheek in her palm, "But I do zough. Zis time I'll ‘elp you. Give you a little guidance~" she combed her claws through his hair, "And I have just ze idea~"
>He munched on his greens, talking with his mouth half full, "You know how to eat... [munch munch swallow] puss?" She put a paw on his shoulder, "For one, I'm bisexual mon cheri; I ‘ave experience." She pulled him to her knees, "And for two," she spread her legs and leaned her loins forward with a smug grin, "It's my puss".
>As he leaned in, her claws wrapped around his head; her fingers grouping his locks in two big bunches. "Mon amour?" he asked. "Shhh, mon cheri. Follow my instructions and ze tugs. You will do just fine so long as you obey~." "Tugs?" he asked with a little worry before being mushed into the silence between her thighs. She giggled, "I said no more talking. You want to get better don't you? Zen listen to ze chef serving your food."
>Longing does indeed make the heart fonder, and harder.
>She was warmer than before. Wetter than before. Little dewdrops of her grool stuck to his lips and cheeks. "Don't forget to breathe zrough your nose" she teased. He felt a light and gentle tug on his right scalp. "Go with ze motion Mon cheri, and slowly press your tongue out".
>The tugs on his hair didn't feel bad. Usually, a single hair yanked from the skin produces a sharp pain. But thousands at once? The pull spreads out into a sensual grip.
>He followed her slow pulls side to side, his slick tongue teasing her plump outer lips. "Hmm" she said with a please chuckle, "A good start" she pulled him back, letting him surface for more air, "But ‘ere is where ze real fun begins. Run your arms up ze small of my back Mon cheri. You'll need ze grip~" and she speedily pulled him straight in; making a little wet smack as their lips kissed.
>Her ran his hands round her hips, through her downy soft fur, and up along the sides of her spine. He made little greedy kneading motions in her muscles and she responded with little grinds into his face, smearing shimmery grool from his chin, over his knobby nose, and up to his brow.
>She tasted slightly sweet, like a little sugar of her love had distilled down to him, but she also had a slightly acrid and sour after taste, like that of a mature wine.
>She took in a few hot breaths, "Time to quit wit' ze appetizers Mon Cheri. You'll dine on ze main course now" and she rocked him up toward her and back. Her grip on his hair tightened just a bit, "Ze most important zing... [pant huff pant huff] Keep my rhyt'm." His head was pulled along in little circles, his tongue moving like a spoon stirring her honey-pot. Little quivers shook from further in her. He wanted to speed up so badly, scarf down his food before it had a chance to go.
>But he couldn't even if he tried. Her hold on him was firm, using his locks like handlebars. Her legs gently squeezed around his sides and she slowly leaned her snout up into the air. Her tongue hung out in a growing delirium, "Hmmhmmhmhm, much better Mon cheri! Ah haa!"
>The sweet rhythm continued on; till the last little sliver of sun dipped below their horizon.
>His tongue began to feel like it was pruning.
>His head was sore.
>His core ached.
>And his dick throbbed from this endless teasing.
>But he could tell she was close; and he knew he needed to send her over the edge soon before he was too tired to even lick.
>But it worried him, her slow moans alone told him he was doing so much better, and he wanted to make her feel good. Wanted to show her he learned. Wanted her to cum.
>He tiptoed his fingers down her back, and before she could notice it in her glazed pleasure, he lightly wrapped his humie fingers around her thick rat tail.
>"MOn cHeri? W’at aRe you- ooOOh?!"
>He gave her fuzzy soft tail little tickles up from its base; keeping his motions in rhythm with her tugs. She bit her lip and looked down into his eyes. It looked like her eyes were about to pop from their sockets, "Cheri. Cheri! I zink I'm gonna---" She couldn't even finish her sentence.
>Her spray hit the back of his throat and her legs nearly crushed his sides. "OOOHH HOn HOn HOn".
>After a minute or so, she finally let him go and he wheeled back for air. Heaving and panting. >She giggled and looked at his face covered in her juice and his hair tousled into her paw-shaped bunches, "You look so cute like zis mon Cheri." Her eyes were going to pop from their sockets. "Well ‘ave to do it more; practice so much more."
>He slowly crawled up onto the couch and into her arms, dripping and exhausted, "I'm just glad I get to learn with you mon amour. Pleasing you makes me feel worth a little more."
>Her smile dropped a little from his insistence on his inadequacy. Self-confidence. Something I could, hopefully, teach him she thought. She looked down softly and combed his hair straight again, saying, "Ze bitter truth we critics of ourselves must face is zat, in ze grand scheme of zings, ze average person, as ‘umble as zeir aspects may be, is more meaningful zan zeir criticism designating zemselves so. Give yourself time, and I'm sure you'll impress anyone you want to, Mon cheri." and she kissed him lovingly on his head.

"Would it make you feel better if you could tear off my undershirt? I've got a few dozen of these."
>Her tail flicked back and forth a few times
>"...yeaaaah..."
>You rolled off the bed and began stripping your well loved work shirt, putting it aside on her dresser
>Grabbing her paw, you pulled the tigress up to a sitting position
"C'mon, let's go back in the hallway and try this again, alright? These pants are pretty worn out too, you can shred them if that'll make you feel better."
>She looked up at you with big hopeful eyes
>"And your underwear?"
"Yes, and my underwear. You're lucky my gym bag is in my car with spare clothes."
>Her gleeful smile turning into one of mischief, she hopped off the bed and nearly began dragging you to the hallway for a scene reset
"If we keep doing this I'll have to go to Goodwill for a cheap wardrobe for these times"
>Ahh, the things you do for her predator instincts...

>be me
>be kickboxer who doesn't grapple
>be training at the gym
>wmma anthro chick is in heat
>she grabs my ass and says she wants to grapple
>agree to her challenge
>1 minute later she gets me in a armbar smoothering her ass against my face

>Your girlfriend took you out tonight
>You had so much fun dancing with her
>The club played all of your favorite songs
>Your partner bought all your favorite drinks
>You both found the perfect table to rest at with a good view of the musicians on stage
>You kissed her on the beak for another wonderful night.
>Everything was going perfect,
>But
>You heard a commotion on stage.
>Someone was arguing with the event director.
>Oh god...
>It was your ex.
>What was she doing here?
>You watch her on her knees begging for something.
>You remember yourself doing the same
>Begging her to stay
>Begging for just a little of her attention
>Begging for her just to put the music down and enjoy some time together
>But she never did
>She chose her 'career'
>Endless nights of practice and unpaid gigs
>She never made any time for you
>You wanted to make things work...
>But, like your friends said,
>You can't tango without two
>You left her... how long ago? Two years?
>She looked even sloppier now; baggy clothes and matted fur
>It made you feel so-
"Hey sweetie? Are you okay?"
>Your girlfriend put her feathers around you and looked where your eyes led
>Hers widened in surprise,
>And scorn.
"Hey. If you need to leave, we can go. Just say so and I'll-"
"No, babe. It's - It's probably just coincidence. She was always at some gig anyway."
>You take another sip of liquor.
>Your ex finally persuaded the MC and the stage cleared
>She sat at the piano, her tail dragging side to side on the floor.
>You say, "I'll finally get to see what the other half of her life looked like"
>Your girlfriend still looked worried, but she rubbed your back
"Just let me know if you change your mind"
>The lights dimmed
>The audience grew quiet
>The tabby on stage began to play the piano
>It started slow, her fingers pressing firmly into the ivory
"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same"
>She always had a lovely voice, when you heard it anyway. Soft but strong, wide but smooth.
"When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little, when I hear your name"
>Wait, was this about---
"It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo-oooo
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should’ve bought you flowers.
And held your hand,
Should’ve gave you all my hours,
When I had the chance.
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But he's dancing with another woman"
>Means a lot saying that now, you scoffed to yourself
>Couldn't she realize---
"My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways...
Caused the good man like you to walk outta my life.
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oooh
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes"
>It should.
>You thought of the sleepless nights spent up waiting for her.
>The food you made growing cold.
>You growing cold.
>Wishing she was there to keep you warm.
"It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo-oooo
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should’ve bought you flowers"
>You remembered your first valentines together. She forgot the roses.
"And held your hand"
>Sang you a song instead.
"Should’ve gave you all my hours"
>Her claws dancing along guitar strings, just like her claws on the ivory keys right now.
"When I had the chance"
>It was such a sweet song, but oh so short.
"Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was daance"
>All those practice sessions.
>She didn't notice before how damaged your love had become.
>And you didn't notice how good a musician she became.
"Now my baby's dancing,
But he's dancing with another woman."
>You remembered when you broke up with her
>How angry she was with you
>That love couldn't be done alone
>How angry you were with her
>That you already were alone
>Oh how she's changed.
>She flung her head up as she played, her song climbing to crescendo,
"Although it hurts...
I'll be the first to say that I was wroonngg"
>Her eyes closed
"Ohh, I know I'm probably much too late"
>Tears well in
"To try and apologize for my mistakes"
>And her fingers pounded the keys with the weight of a broken heart,
"But I just want you to know..."
>The keys grow quiet, and she sings the last chorus alone.
>Her voice breaks a little with every line.
"I hope she buys you flowers,
I hope she holds your hand,
Give you all her hours,
When she has the chance.
Take you to every party,
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance.
Do all the things I should’ve done,
When I was your woman.
Do all the things I should’ve done,
When I was your woman."
>The crowd cheered, a rain-shower of applause
"Sweetie, are - are you-"
>You didn't see your girlfriend next to you
>You saw your ex standing at the back of the stage
>Looking straight at you
>Her fur soaked in her tears
>Your cheek soaked in yours
>She hung her head in guilt before she gave you one last look
>And left out the back door.
[END]

>Tending to my crops while a traveling band of mercenaries pass by, leering and making rude gestures while yelling
>"Bedwarmer! Come hither!"
>"I have some fields you can plow!"
>Trying to ignore them
>Trying

>You must choose which rat ogre to breed with you
>One will break your pelvis, the other will also break your pelvis
>Your choice and the number of pups you will sire, will affect the lives of the surface dwellers above.

>your village gets raided by anthro amazons

>"C'meeeeere hon!"
>there's a giggle behind you
>then suddenly there's a big paw on the side of your face
>and a slobbery smooch on the other side
>not quite getting your cheek, so your ear has a tongue in it for a second
>the owner of the paw and snout snickers and wraps her arm around your waist
>"Babe! You ran off to talk to your little work friends. I lost you!"
>the eight-foot wolf putting your paws on your chest and dragging you into her embrace so your head is nestled back between her ample breasts is your wife
>your wife on her second glass of red wine
>"Oh baby I missed you. Are these your co-workers! Oh gosh hi! I'm Maxine!"
>she leans forward to offer a paw to the co-worker you had been speaking to
>in the process stepping forward and ensuring her entire body is pressing into and down on you
>you're practically drowning in plush she-wolf in a clingy, low-cut blue dress
>"Anon has told me all about the office!"
>Maxine laughs
>"It's so funny he still works! I could pay for everything but he wants to be a big strong man, don't you baby?"
>you're freed just enough for Maxine to put a patronizing paw on your head, ruffling your hair
>then the arm wrapped around your chest pulls and you're dragged back to your soft prison
>"He won't let me be his sugar mommy, but--Oh!"
>she starts giggling again
>you can feel her body oscillating against you with the motion of her laughter
>"--My baby still calls me mommy when I want him to."
>holy shit
>you're on fire
>and not in a good way
>you can see the goggle-eyed looks your co-workers are giving you
>and you know it will be absolute torment when you get back to the office on monday
>but on the other hand
>holy shit
>you're on fire
>in an amazing way
>Maxine is all over you
>her paws know just where to go to get your blood pumping
>your entire world is framed by her tits
>and she's leaning down to give you another kiss with lots of tongue
>so fucking worth it
>a wandering paw starts straying southward
>and you worry she's about to start really groping you at a work function
>thankfully Maxine seems to catch herself as she starts giggling again
>"Whoops. That's for later."
>she whispers in your ear before straightening out again
>"Whew! Well it's very nice to meet you all, but I think me and the better half need to have a dance!"
>you're dragged bodily away from the little knot of humans towards the cleared dance floor
>Maxine snickering to herself all the while
>"What do you think babe, did it work?"
>you let out an exasperated huff when she releases you
"I think you laid it on a little bit thick."
>Maxine just smirks
>"I'm on my second glass. You know how I get."
>she gets clever when she's on her second glass
>now all your co-workers will think your wife is a lightweight
>instead of a pervert who's taken an excuse to molest you in public
>"Besides, you loved it."
>damn it
>you did
"So what's your plan now?"
>Maxine puffs her chest up
>to your delight
>and beams with wagging tail and fangs flashing
>"I've already enacted my plan. Drag my darling hubby away from his boring co-workers for a dance."
>you have to admit
>it was well-executed
>you offer your hand, and Maxine takes it
>to pull you face-first into her chest
>you're swayed back and forth
>Maxine holding you with one arm around your shoulders and her paw resting on the small of your back
>the taller wolf once again using her size to bear down on you, forcing her body against yours
>so she can feel your boner against her thigh with every other step
>you hang on to her hips for dear life as she takes too-long strides that leave you half-pulled off your feet
>and when you stumble again Maxine readjusts her grip
>her lower paw grabbing your ass and squeezing possessively
>"Careful hon, I don't want to lose you."
>you let out a muffled yelp of surprise as you feel her claws dig in
>and your surprised squirming makes her legs tangle with yours
>you and Maxine trip, only staying upright because she sweeps you off your feet entirely
>but it doesn't stop you from bumping into someone
>nearly as big as Maxine
>a panther with pure black fur, wearing a garish pink pantsuit that fails to serve her complexion
>your boss
"Miss Logan."
>you stare at her
>she glares at you
>"Mister Wolfhart. Had too much to drink?"
>there's a derisive snarl to her voice
>and a scowl of distaste on her muzzle
>"Oh no that's me! I get a couple glasses in and I can't help myself!"
>Maxine giggles
>the she-wolf sets you down to her side so she can stand face-to-face with the feline
>she has her bright, false-drunk smile on her face again
>but her tail sticks out straight and her ears are swiveled forward
>she's angry
>"So you must be Miss Logan! My dear darling husband has so much to say about you! You must work so hard to get so high up in the company."
>Maxine giggles
>Ms. Logan's tail lashes
>"My poor Nonny-poo can't keep up. He's got too much home life. I can really be a handful, can't I dear?"
>you open your mouth to try and keep things from getting worse
>but Vanessa throws her arm around your neck and pulls you in so your words are muffled through the side of her chest
>tucked under her arm you get a hefty dose of floral perfume mixed with wolf musk
>"It's a miracle he does so well when he has me waiting for him at home."
>you're manhandled again
>this time lifted off the ground for Maxine to bat her eyelashes at dramatically
>"Oh but he's so irresistible!"
>then she kisses you in the exaggeratedly sloppy way you expected
>a long rough tongue pushed into your mouth
>slobbering on your cheeks
>from what little you can see of your boss she does not look happy
>her teeth bared in a grimace
>"Ugh."
>your boss stalks off
>in the direction of the bar you notice
>Maxine releases you with a gasp and a malicious giggle
>"Whew! I wanted to do that ever since I heard of her."
>you gasp
"Holy shit Maxine you're gonna get me fired."
>more batting eyelashes
>"Would that be so bad?"
>you set your jaw and glare
>as much as you can with her paw on your crotch
>the wolf just smiles and wags
>"You'd better take me home before I make MORE of a scene then."
>oh
>you know what that means
>you can't reach for your keys fast enough
>and it looks like Maxine can't wait for you to walk, because she scoops you up into her arms to carry you out of the room in anthro-sized strides
>until you're out in the parking lot in front of the luxury SUV your wife insisted on buying for you
"Okay, I should drive."
>"Nope!"
>you look up at Maxine's grinning face
>a grin that says mischief and horniness in equal measure
>"Unlock the car."
>you do as she says, hitting the key fob
>instead of setting you down by the driver's side, she pulls open a back door and throws you inside
>you land on your back across the bench of the back seats
>and look up to see Maxine leaning over you, half in and half-out of the car
>the position leaving her tits fall out of her breast
>all the more now that her breathing has her chest heaving
>she sniffs hard and lets the breath out hard from her mouth in a gasp
>"Fuck I wanted to do this right in front of that stuck-up bitch."
>it's lucky you were already undoing your belt
>because a big paw grasps the front of your pants and pulls down, dragging belt, pants, and boxers down to your knees in one forceful yank
>leaving your throbbing cock free
"You are drunk."
>you accuse
>"Just give momma a taste."
>Maxine holds you down by the thighs and lowers her head
>first she sniffs deeply at your balls
>then your shaft
>then your tip
>then a splash of slick heat
>her tongue wrapping around your member and lapping at the tip
>you whimper
>been waiting for this all night
>so has she, as Maxine dives in
>she drags her long tongue over and around your cock
>again and again
>from base to tip and all around it
>until your whole crotch is soaked
>rearing back, Maxine gasps and pants
>her tongue lolling out
>"Fuck yeah that's the stuff--"
>suddenly she dives back down for one more lick before regaining some control
>with another quick move of a paw the straps of her dress are pulled aside and her heavy breasts burst free
>you stare
>"Yeah that's it. You love mommy's tits. Had your face in 'em all night."
>not that you had any choice
>or complaints
>"You wanna feel mommy's tits?"
>you nod fervently
>and Maxine flashes her teeth
>your cock is enveloped in warmth as the she-wolf lowers herself down to trap it in-between her breasts
>already slick from her spit, it slides against her fur very pleasantly
>using her paws, Maxine squishes her tits together, rubbing them against your cock up and down
>your pre-cum quickly adding to the slickness
>"Tell momma how much you love her tits."
"They're the best. Biggest. Softest."
>you try to think of more words
>but all that comes out is moans
>Maxine laughs
>"Like that baby. Just keep telling me like that."
>you let your head fall back
>staring at the ceiling as you focus on the sensation of two hefty weights dropped on your lap
>faster and faster
>with your cock lost entirely between her cleavage, Maxine starts bouncing her tits up and down in rhythm
>the car fills with the soft sound of flesh slapping against flesh and slick fur gliding over sensitive skin
>you're twitch and moaning
>and Maxine's making the entire car shake with the speed and force of her titfucking
>your legs would be kicking if they weren't held down by her weight
>you gasp
"M-Max--close!"
>you're near to bursting
>the burning pleasure growing with each move of her heaving chest
>you can hear her panting
>"Give it to me baby! Cum for momma!"
>you cum for momma
>cock spasming and balls tensing
>cumming between her tits until it starts leaking out of her cleavage
>Maxine keeps bouncing her breasts, milking more pleasure and seed from you
>until you're both exhausted, sticky messes
>all too soon the warmth of Maxine leaves you
>you're left laying in a puddle of sweat and your own spunk on the back seat of the SUV
>you pick your head up
>Maxine stands over you, paws on her hips, proudly displaying her cum-spattered chest
>"Look at you. In no condition to drive. Don't worry baby."
>her teeth flash one more time
>"Mommy Maxine will take you home."
>ELSEWHERE
>Henrietta Logan stared out over the nearly empty bar
>this 'company party' was a fucking disaster
>that stupid wolf bitch...
>the bar was almost entirely cleared out
>it was just her and the bartender
>a human bartender
>a cute one with blond hair and a little bow-tie
>Henrietta undid two buttons on her blouse
>then leaned over the bar and waved over the bartender
>he came over, a little sedately
>though she noted the glance he stole of her chest and rumbled in satisfaction
>the human cleared his throat
>"What can I get you, ma'am?"
>Henrietta slid a fifty dollar bill across the bar
>"I'll have a gin and tonic."
>the human looked down at the bill, and then up at the looming panther
>"Right away, ma'am."
>before he got away, Henrietta grabbed his wrist
>forcing another bill in his hand
>"Call me...mommy."

>this place really was a dive
>You'd ended up out here through misfortune, having had an unexpected lay-over while your
truck got fixed
>Two days in a frozen nowhere town while the mechanics fixed the rather nasty gearbox
problems you'd reported
>Head office wasn't happy but there really wasn't much else for it
>If they tried to point a finger at you you'd point right back
>the trucks never got proper maintenance back at the depot
>A couple of days delay at this time of the year wasn't too out of the ordinary anyway
>so with your ass suitably covered and all parties informed, you'd decided it was time to make
the most of your unexpected break
>So, cleaned up and dressed as well as your grungy trucker ass could manage, you made your
way down the slushy, frozen main street
>it's about 6pm and already nearly pitch black
>you dodge an icy puddle and sigh
>you hate this weather
>at least when you're not in your truck
>after a few minutes of stomping through the miserable night in search of a bar that wasn't dead
or dying
>you're suddenly hit with a blast of purple light from across the street
>you turn, and see a big glowing neon frontage depicting a grinning leopard with a jagged
mohawk
>the intermittent flash of purple was the run of spots across her overspilling cleavage
>and the sign
>"THE HOT SPOT"
>figures
>anthros love their puns
>you squint past the obnoxious illumination
>place looks like a dive bar
>an anthro dive bar
>but the music was thumping, and there seemed to be a decent amount of people heading in
>fuck it
>might be fun
>you cross the street, dodging through the sluggish traffic and hoping that you didn't get any big stains on your one good set of clothes
>at the door there's a bored looking doberman dude
>stereotypical bouncer
>big biceps, t-shirt one size too small, little curly earpiece
>"Hey bud," he says, eyeing you up and down
>"You realise what kind of bar this is, right?"
>"the fun kind, I hope," you say with a rueful smile
>he snorts
>"Yeah, I know your type. Whatever, in you go"
>he thumbs over his shoulder
>what the hell does he mean, 'your type'?
>whatever
>maybe he just doesn't like humans
>you head past him and down a narrow set of steps
>down below street level
>the music grows louder
>thumping through the building
>you go through the door at the bottom of the stairs
>and emerge into a scene of total chaos
>the music blares out from a neon-lit stage where a pudgy raccoon girl is screaming her heart out while a human dude with a greasy ponytail rips at a cheap guitar and a badger does his best to obliterate a set of drums
>between you and the stage, the place is a riot
>a bunch of raucous tables yell, fight, smooch and drink round the edges of a big, packed dancefloor
>there's people everywhere
>and thankfully, you're not the only human
>though its mostly anthros milling around, some of your furless brethren can be seen here and there
>vaguely reassured, you make your way through the crowd, squeezing through to the bar
>you have to really push in to get served, but the place is decently well staffed and you have a vodka-coke in your hands before long
>price is a bit steep but hell
>what else are you spending your wages on
>you stand near the bar for a bit, sipping your drink and bobbing your head with the percussion of the band
>the raccoon's yelling about killing her man or fucking him, you're not too sure which, leaning into the lanky ponytail guy as he riffs away
>they aren't the best but they're giving it their all
>certainly beats being out in the cold
>it’s hot as hell in here
>you throw back your drink and turn back to the bar
>and that's when you see her
>across the room, leaning against the wall
>you're struck dumb
>a tall, chunky hyena, a fringe of black-dyed fur obscuring her eyes
>her shiny pleather dress, barely reaching her thick thighs, leaving nothing to the imagination as it hugs her tummy and tremendous breasts
>a pair of fishnets
>and big stompy boots
>god
>she's perfect
>you wouldn't really consider yourself an anthro-chaser
>but holy shit
>standing there, agog, you nearly forget to pick up your new drink
>you grab it hurriedly and gulp some down, loath to take your eyes off of her
>you look back
>she’s looking right back at you
>tilting her head back a little, her black-rimmed eyes visible under her fringe
>watching you watch her
>a toothy grin crosses her face
>and she sticks her tongue out
>a silver stud gleams in the half-light
>you’re left speechless for a moment
>before your frothing, rabid desire gives you a slap and sends you stumbling across the bar towards her
>you desperately fight your way through the mosh pit, trying your best to defend your expensive drink
>panting, out of breath, you make it through the jumping crowd of crazy furballs and to the side of your new goddess
>she looms over you
>you want to say something
>but she beats you to it
>”Like what you see, stranger?” she grins
>”uhhh, yeah,” you manage, still ogling her
>she really does fill out every inch of her dress
>she definitely notices, and snickers
>”You from out of town?” she asks, drinking from a bottle of hipster beer
>”truck broke,” you gulp out
>damn it man get it together
>”This place is pretty cool, huh?” you ask
>still smirking at you, she nods
>”yeah, it’s the only bar worth a damn in this dump. You wanna dance?”
>boy do you
>you nod enthusiastically, which gets another giggle out of her
>she pushes off of the wall and grabs you by the hand
>dragging you towards the dancefloor
>you slug the rest of your drink, dump the glass on a deserted table and join her in the madness of the crowd
>squished together in the press of crazies
>she’s bouncing to the beat of the band
>rubbing her body against yours
>it all becomes a big horny mess
>your dancing along, entranced by her
>you try your luck and grab her around the waist
>grinning, she grabs your ass with a clawed paw in retaliation
>you’re moving, eyes glazed over, both of you moving with the tidal motion of the crowd
>apart for a moment, then shoved together
>pressed into her cleavage, breathing deep of her musky scent
>both of you are sweating now
>one song turns to two, then three
>some more drinks
>bleary eyed, grinning, throwing yourselves about to the beat
>yelling til your hoarse
>hands roaming everywhere
>you’ve got one hell of a hard-on, which is making dancing a bit more difficult
>she’s enjoying herself too, clearly
>her nipples are visibly poking through her dangerously overfilled dress
>and she’s panting, her teeth bared white in a mouth rimmed with black lipstick
>at some point she kisses you
>tongue straight into your mouth
>her piercing clinks against your teeth
>now you’re both gasping for air
>and she’s growling
>you can’t hear it over the music
>but you can feel it rumbling through her body as she pin you against her
>you meet her gaze, her black-rimmed eyes glimmering in the flash of the club lights
>her teeth bared
>then she grabs you by the collar of your shirt, dragging you away from the dancefloor
>there’s a few whoops and whistles as she parts the seas of other dancers before her
>you’re just going with the flow
>she pushes her way out, dragging you towards the bar
>she yells to a blonde human girl serving drinks
>who rolls her eyes at the sight of the two of you
>”For god’s sake, Hailey, not again!”
>”Shut it,” growls the yeen. “Keys, now!”
>the girl reaches under the bar and tosses a keychain
>catching it out of the air, Hailey drags you onward, past the bar and over to an unmarked door
>and pulls you into a janitor’s closet
>it’s barely big enough for you in here
>but she squeezes in, crushing you against the wall
>she kicks the door shut behind her with one swipe of her big boot
>and before you can breathe she’s hitching up her dress
>your desire, good friend that it is, kicks you back into gear again
>and you’re scrabbling to yank your belt off and get your pants down
>your erection barely springs free of confinement before Hailey slams you against the wall with a growl, toppling mops and buckets
>she kisses you again, tongue down your throat, while her sharp teeth tease your cheeks
>her hands reach down, one tugging your cock while the other pulls her panties off
>you’re pretty sure you hear the fabric snap before she pulls away from the kiss and shoves the bundle of musky, dripping lace into your face
>holy shit
>then she’s on you
>your rock hard rod pushing between her soft, giving thighs
>she’s all over you, crushing you into the wall
>then you’re in
>”Fuck yeah,” she growls,
>and starts humping you
>her soft tummy and fat tits slamming into you again and again as she pounds you against the wall
>all the while, the muffled music from the bar thumps through the walls
>her hot, sloppy cunt is like heaven
>her tits spill out of her dress, and you reach up and dig your hands into them as hard as you can
>she moans, gritting her teeth, and throws aside the panties she’d been grinding into your face before shoving a nipple into your mouth
>all too willing to go along with it, you suckle on her teat, rewarded by more moans
>and slightly worryingly, an increase in pace
>she’re really going for it now, her tongue hanging out, your sweaty bodies wetly slapping against each other
>the closet stinks of her
>like you’re getting hotboxed on yeen smell
>she kisses you again, a clumsy smooch that smears her lipstick across your face
>then she’s just licking you
>whining, grunting
>while you’re doing your best to stick yourself as deep into her as you can
>you can feel things start to tighten,
>your blood is thumping in your ears
>your head tilts back
>fuck this is too good
>clearly she agrees
>she grabs your throat as she arches back and screams as a hot wet gush covers your groin and waist
>you barely notice her ruining your jeans as the twitching deathgrip of her pussy sends you over the edge as well
>it’s the hardest orgasm of your life
>you nearly black out as you blow your load inside her
>you collapse to the floor, leaning against the wall while Hailey flops onto you
>”Holy shit,” she groans, softly panting
>you can feel her heart thumping
>you just shiver beneath her massive bulk, stars in your eyes
>not like you can see much buried under her tits
>or breathe
>after a few pokes in the belly, she leans back to let you get some air
>you gasp, a bleary mess, and grin
>”Wow,” is all you can say
>she snorts
>”Soooo,” she says, trying to fix her hair with an idle paw, “you said your truck is broken, right? How long you here for?”
>”Couple days, I guess,” you say with a shrug, totally zonked
>her teeth gleam white in the dark
>”Plenty of time, then, huh?”

>you try to put on a brave face as you march out from the palisade gate of your village
>you make it a dozen steps before you're grabbed, stripped, tied up, and dragged into the camp of the mercenaries
>the wolves bray and howl and jeer at your naked form
>"They sent a runt!"
>"He'll be dead in a week!"
>"Should have sent two!"
>you're pushed along a the point of a spear into a big tent in the center of the camp
>the inside of which is rather luxurious for a tent
>a sprawling bed of furs
>a collection of bottles of liquor
>a chest no doubt filled with looted treasure
>and two wolves that await you in the back of the room that you're forced to kneel in front of
>one lounges on a high-backed wooden throne, with a smirk on her muzzle, and a spear resting against the arm of the chair that she holds casually
>she has luxurious white fur that looks like it's been washed in pure moonlight
>the other stands at her side, taller than any other wolf you've seen, with broad shoulders and covered in battle scars
>her fur is dull gray and less well-kept, her paws stained with mud
>she glares at you with a deep scowl as she holds a spear that's serrated and spiked at the ready
>both are nude as beasts
>the silver one speaks first
>"Is this it? I ask for a tribute and they send me, what, a dying dog? I wanted a boy! A pretty little plaything! I wouldn't touch that thing if I were kicking it to death."
>the whole time she keeps that smirk on her muzzle
>she even starts laughing
>cruel mocking laughter
>despite your fear, anger burns inside you
"Y-You said you'd spare us."
>the silver one breaks in to even more laughter
>slapping the arm of her chair and howling
>"It speaks! It speaks! It's not a dog after all!"
>the silver one leans forward, looking down at you with eyes so blue they're almost white
>"If you speak again I'll cut your throat and hang you upside down so all your blood runs out."
>you shut your mouth
>fear snuffing out any anger
>the silver wolf leans back with a sigh
>"Oh well. I think I'll kill you anyways. Then I'll kill everyone in your village, steal anything worth taking, and burn it to the ground."
>you gasp as the wolf rises from the throne and picks up her spear
>you try to stand, a last attempt to flee, but it's too late
>she's already on top of you
>with that same mocking smile on her face she raises the spear--
>"Astrid, wait."
>for the first time the gray wolf speaks
>her voice is gruff, lower than the silver's
>and it works to stop the spear from the descending
>"Oh?"
>she turns her mocking smile toward the gray wolf
>whose expression is equally unchanging
>"I want him."
>the silver one gasps
>"Really? Sister! That's amazing! Did you hear that, human? Dear Mathilde will take you. Isn't that perfect? I won't have to kill you after all!"
>you say a quiet prayer of thanks when she lowers the spear
>Astrid plods back to her chair, tail swishing in the air, and drops back down to lounge easily
>"Tell me sister, why have you taken a liking to this one?"
>Mathilde looks at you, her amber eyes hard
>but warmer than her sister's ice-blue
>"He is brave."
>Astrid laughs
>"Oh Mathilde, you've killed plenty of brave men. If I didn't know better, I would think you wanted to show pity!"
>the silver wolf laughs and laughs
>you think you're going to be sick
>Astrid goes on mocking
>"But you recall the last time you wanted me to show mercy, don't you?"
>for the first time the gray wolf's expression changes
>her scowl deepening as she refuses to meet her sister's eye
>"Yes."
>Astrid nods
>"Good. If you truly want him for yourself, take him."
>Mathilde steps forward now and takes you by the arm
>she starts dragging you toward the exit of the tent
>"Come."
>Astrid laughs again
>it's starting to grate on your ears
>"Oh no sister! Take him here. Now."
>Mathilde growls and throws you to the ground
>raising her spear
>"No."
>for the first time, Astrid's expression changes
>her smile widening into a malicious sneer
>"You wish to test me again? Looking to grow your collection of scars, sister?"
>when the silver wolf grips her spear, Mathilde flinches
>her spear wavers in the air a moment
>then lowers
>Astrid's smile turns into a pout
>"You're no fun, sister. Now get to it. Claim this whelp if you want to save his life so much."
>you look at Astrid, who doesn't even glance at you, the silver-furred warlord lounging on her throne
>you look at Mathilde, who stares down past your eyes
>"Very well, sister."
>a rough paw grabs your hair and drags you upward to your knees
>and then yanks you forcefully to kneel between Mathilde's legs
>"Get to work, boy."
>you tremble
>unsure what she wants you to do
>her pink slit just visible through her rough fur
>your heart thumps
"I--I--"
>Astrid bursts into more laughter
>"Oh! I think--Sister I think he's a virgin! What a treat!"
>Mathilde just growls and yanks your hair again
>this time dragging you upward while opening her legs so your face is pressed against her groin
>you feel heat
>and slickness
>and rough fur on your cheeks
>and a smell like sweat mixed with salt and earth and days of travel
>you twitch, trying to act
>do something
>Mathilde just growls and starts rolling her hips
>grinding that slick, hot flesh against your face
>you can hear, muffled by the gray she-wolf's thighs, Astrid's laughter reaching fever pitch
>"That's it! Mark his flesh!"
>more growls from Mathilde
>your face is being rubbed raw, the rough fur made a little more tolerable as she coats your face in her juices
>all you can do is stay on your knees, whimpering, while your face is dragged up and down the she-wolf's cunt
>"Oh what a show! Listen to him whine. I think he likes you, sister."
>the movement stops as Mathilde barks
>"Shut up! Let me--Just let me do this."
>you pull back enough to take one gasp of breath before you're shoved back between her legs again
>Mathilde growls and grinds and yanks
>until you feel clumps of hair ripping out
>and she dribbles down your chin and over your chest
>and you can't even hear Astrid's laughter anymore
>your legs tremble, the great gray wolf pressing more and more of her weight on your head with every thrust
>you can hardly breath
>Mathilde's growling suddenly hitches and then turns into a series of whines
>her thighs clamp around your head entirely, wrapping you in coarse fur and suffocating you
>and she bathes you in a torrent of her juices
>the whining slowly winds down
>until Mathilde's just panting
>then she releases you
>you fall face-down on the ground, gasping for breath
>you can hear Astrid laughing again
>"Oh goodness! Is he dying? I think you might have killed him."
>Mathilde's paws turns toward the source of mockery
>"I am taking him to my tent. Good night."
>you're grasped by the arm and lifted off the ground
>you take a shuddering breath and stand on unsteady feet
"Wait."
>you pull against Mathilde as she tries to drag you away
>to turn toward the silver she-wolf
"I'm here. She took me. Spare my home, please."
>Astrid gasps
>covering her mouth with a paw in mock surprise
>"He is bold!"
>hopping offer her chair, Astrid looks down at you
>"I told your village I would spare them if they sent me a plaything. But my sister claimed you. So I'm going to kill everyone you love and burn your disgusting little home to the ground!"
>Astrid giggles like she's sharing a secret
>your heart falls into your gut
>and then turns to burning fire
"You liar! Murderer!"
>Astrid waves her paw at Mathilde
>"Take your pet human away sister. He's starting to annoy me."
>you struggle, trying to break free from the she-wolf's grip
>Mathilde grabs both your arms and throws you over her shoulder
>the she-wolf ignores your struggles as she carries you to another tent and sets you down on a bed of straw
>"You are mine now, boy. Do not fight it. It is better for you this way."

>talking to high society dame at a party
>she's so nice and civilised
>(and sexy, of course)
>but you keep catching glimpses
>when she smiles
>or laughs at your jokes
>she's got the teeth made for stripping flesh from bone
>she's an apex predator
>and you can't help but feel like prey

>"Next!"
>the guard calls out
>the chains around your wrists rattle as you're forced to the desk where a rabbit in a black uniform glares at you
>"Name."
>you glare at her
"Anon Nymous."
>the rabbit rifles through a file cabinet then pulls out a folder with your name on it
>as she reads she scowls
>"Resisting arrest. Speaking out against the anthrostate. Refusing a lawful order."
>the rabbit slaps down the folder
>"It's rebels like you that keep the state from running smoothly. Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
>you just stare at her
>these damn anthros took over the world and now they're trying to ruin your life
>you hate them
>"Very well. Punishment is sixty hours in the communal cuddle repository. Guards, take him away."
>just another day of oppression

>The scene before the sheriff's eyes was as grisly as the night was dark.
>Bodies littered the yard of a little sod house. She approached the empty home, the spurs of her leather boots clinking in step with her stride.
>Her deputy was examining the homeowner, a rat woman with at a dozen scars and a fresh bullet wound on her head that would never heal.
>"Seems like she put up quite the fight. Killed near about 15 before them raiders got a lucky shot off. Damn shame sheriff, damn shame."
>The sheriff lowered her Stetson to her chest. Her momma always taught her to respect the dead, and the honorable.
>"So no survivors?" She solemnly asked her squirrel deputy.
>"Actually," she responded, "I haven't found her husband."
>She nodded at little grooves in the dirt of the threshold, "Them tracks is probably from draggin em away".
>The deputy got back on her feet "No leads. No suspects. No witness. How're we gonna save that poor man, sheriff? If we don't stop em here, they'll take even more men."
>The duty didn't know much about Sheriff Short-Tail, despite being deputy. The sheriff never let anyone close. Never drank. Never gambled. She was a mystery to everyone who met her.
>But the deputy, through the long hours of shared work with the coyote woman, knew one thing about her, what anger looked like. And right now, it clouded her face like a storm of retribution sent from God above.
>The sheriff lit a cigarette. It glowed like a firefly in the dark, dimming in time with her breath. "Ever hear of a woman named Sherman, deputy?"
>"No ma'am. Was she a cop?"
>"No. A general from during the war back east. She had a little method for solving unsolvable issues?"
>"What was it?"
>"Scorched. Earth. Gather up any woman you can find in town with a gun."
>The sheriff dropped her now spent cigarette to the ground, grinding it out in the dirt, and said, "Find every crook we know. We're filling the jailhouse tonight. Come tomorrow, we will have answers."

Anthrostate Renegade:

>It was a moonless night and the Mojave was burning.
>During the night, the desert turns on its head. Frozen, dark, and swarming with life.
>Your car, or rather the cruiser once holding you, was also turned over on its head.
>The glass sprayed out in a large circle from the car. The car's weight crunched down on the windows, completely busting them open.
>You could see all of this in the fire-light of the car. Flames had erupted out of the engine. They were building higher and higher, quickly consuming the car.
>A hand grabbed you, dragging your bound arms out of the car, over the broken glass, and out into the cold desert.
>The shards hurt almost as bad as the sandy gravel. They cut into your back and leave long grooves down your calves, but you couldn't be happier to be out of that car.
>The figure dragging you huffed and puffed as she marched with you in tow.
>You could feel something wet drip down your arm from her grip.
>It’s warm and sticky.
>It smells like iron.
>You could smell the smoke building from the now distant car.
>With a crack, pop, and a final bang, the tank caught fire and exploded.
>And in the light's brief life, you could see your so-called 'savior'. Her clawed hands. Her matted black and red stripe tail. Her torn uniform from some country you don't know. Her matted crimson hair. Her torn panda ear.
>She finally stopped dragging you, collapsing to her knees.
>You’re dropped into the dirt with a small rock right under your back. You grab it nearly on instinct.
>She dragged herself around to face you.
>You could see her freshly scarred eye, completely torn through.
>Her good eye scowled at you. Hate burning in that eye like that car, ready to explode.
>She laughed. A wicked snicker mounting and mounting into a wild cackling.
"I jusst ... can't WAIT ... till they rrrRAPE ... some obedience into you!"
>She fell onto her back, unable to keep herself up any longer, her chest heaving over and over.
>You couldn't exactly get up either. Beyond your fresh scrapes and your bruises. You think your leg is broken, but you still have too much adrenaline to tell. But hell, a broken bone was worth crashing that car.
>You were both looking up at the sky, obscured by the smoke and light from the car fire.
>It'd be romantic if she wasn't here to incarcerate you.
>You turn your head in the dirt and stare at her in the dwindling firelight.
>She was exceptionally curvy for a runaway hunter.
>Excuse you, Search and Rescue operative, you mockingly correct yourself.
>Maybe the job isn't as demanding in her country. Maybe her country is smaller, so not much space for men to run.
>Her clothes are torn in several places. Once across the belly, revealing what could become a great scar. Two on her left thigh.
>And another across her arm, tearing a red sun. You look closer; it's an oval. She couldn't even paint her faschy memorabilia right.
>State officers were bad enough, but you despised the foreigners the republic hired for wet work even more.
>Why can't they leave your fucked up country alone?
>Her breathing began to slow.
>Maybe she'd pass out?
>Instead, she slowly sat up, leering over you and struggling not to slur her words.
>She had an accent you couldn’t place,
"I can see how you evaded ‘state-assistance’ for three months"
>You cough,
"Honestly I'm ashamed of myself," you taunt, "Everything's been beginner’s luck so far. At least now I get to prove why I deserve to be free."
>She snickered,
"Free? But you are already free. Free to marry a strong woman. Free to clean her home as you wish. Free to serve your state with many children..."
"I don't want any of that horseshit. Keep your propaganda,” you spit on her.
>Her false smile falls as she wipes the spit and blood from her chest and awkwardly crawls on top of you.
>She has been avoiding using her left arm, it might be broken.
"You know, humie, your bounty just states to bring you to Lakehead Correctional Facility alive. Not un-raped~"
>Lakehead. Where men are murdered and obedient boys are born. You hated even the idea of it. The fact that they mulched the biggest small-town city in America to build a concentration camp just added insult to injury. The erasure of history, the erasure of manhood; all in one place.
>Your hands and feet are still bound from when she loaded you in the car, so all you can manage is a little wriggle away from her.
>But you also wedge the rock further in your rope.
"You don't want me; I bite, I kick, I yell"
"That isn't a problem. I like fighters. I enjoy 'rough-housing'"
>You scoot back further.
"They'll be cross if you do; they like their experiments untainted."
"Too bad, I'm not able to wait anymore"
> She says as she undresses her top with one hand.
>She straddles your waist, no getting up for now.
>You rock the stone in your hands behind your back steadily, trying to loosen the knots.
"Why even rape me? I thought you hated me?"
"I do" she nods, "But you misunderstand. Rape isn't just about desire. It's also about hate. It's about power."
>She points to the flaming car,
"You steal a little bit of power and use it to fuck me…"
>She presses a pointer finger into his chest,
"So I'll use what power I have to FUCK you."
>She opens your fly in a flash and your half mast cock falls to the side.
>She licks her lips,
"I just can't get over a man's junk. The way that it just all hangs out of your body. All your sensitive parts, right where they can be grabbed and molested. You wanna believe you're so strong but your 'manhood' can be squashed like a grape. It's like god made you to be raped."
>As she unbuckles herself with one hand, you work the rock further, it's slowly coming along.
>She rubs her snatch against your groin, leaving a slick trail with little droplets of blood and fur. "You know…"
>She waxes on between little hitches and whines,
"...I was thinking for sooo long about taking you in the back of my car. Fucking you right in the back seat…"
>She ran her fingers through her lips and held them up to the light.
>Little shimmery strings connected them.
"... that I'm already soo wet... I don't need to wait anymore"
>She lifts herself up and mounts you.
>Her snatch slaps against your skin.
>She starts already worked up into quick grinds.
>The sickening pain from the crash and the sickening pleasure from her furry body are distracting, but you wiggle your rock faster now while she's distracted.
>Her eyes wander up in the pleasure of fucking you.
>She giggles and says to herself, "Best perk of the job!"
>Wiggle your rock and endure her grinding. Wiggle your rock and endure her grinding.
>It goes on like this for god knows how long.
>But eventually, you become close.
>And the rock has almost wormed its way through your rope.
>Just a few more tugs. Much bigger than the last.
>But how would you pull them off without her noticing?
>You have an idea and feign a moan.
"You already liking it, slut?" she grinded deeper.
>Your bound feet scoot up, scraping the dirt, you need more leverage.
>You whine like an actor you once saw in a porno,
"I, I can't I don't wanna. Ugghhn why does it feel so good?"
>Her mouth hangs open and her tongue bounces to her hips' rhythm,
"God, I didn't realize you were such a whore. They're gonna have so much fun breaking you in at Lakehead!"
>You finally get your legs in position and start bucking your hips into her.
>She loves it, muttering passionate and hateful nonsense at you.
"Mmhm whore... slut you're gonna... uggh you fuckin I mm God I you'll look so pretty with fang marks I uggh mmm"
>She doesn't notice your hands moving down with each buck.
>She doesn't notice how loose your ropes have become.
>She doesn't notice you scraping up sand underneath you.
>You want to strike now, your hips hurt and what good skin you have left is bright red from the scraping.
>But you still need her to be more vulnerable.
>You squeeze in all you have to your legs and throw your hips straight into her; holding her up in the air.
"Uuugghhhmmpf"
>She cums and her face flings open.
>Jackpot.
>With your now free hand, you sling all the sand you can into her good eye.
"AHHHH"
>She gives a shrill scream,
"I'm blind you fucker! I'll kill you, I'll"
>She reaches for her boot knife,
>But you thought ahead and grabbed it first with your left hand.
"Whore! I don't even care about the money anymore. You're dying!"
>She lunges for your shoulder, sinking her fangs into your muscle.
>You try and ignore the searing pain
>You've got to hit hard.
>You lunge at her head with the knife
>But she catches it…
>In her left hand.
>At this point, the way she's crying now and the fact that you're inching the blade closer and closer to her neck despite her anthro strength,
>It's clear her left arm is broken.
>As the blade catches her throat and splits it open, she snarls.
>A hateful sneer burns into her face and as the blood sprays out, she slumps over you
"They get everyone, you know. One way... Or ugh another. Your state has its ways. They'll get you too."
>She dies.
>You finally relax.
>And the light of the car fire finally goes out.
>You can finally see the stars; innumerable constellations to guide you

One-Shot Special: Anon's Itallian Stallion:
>Be anon
>Live in Philly your whole life
>Was always a scrappy kind of kid
>Lots of fights growing up
>Learned some MMA… the hard way
>Learned you could take a licking and give one too...
>Well at least when it came to the other boys
>Once the anthro girls on the block hit puberty, they beat your ass black and blue more times than you could count
>Decide to hit the books instead, get into college, leave the slums
>You make it, but no job. Markets 'bad' or something

>Look at floor
>Crude advertising flyer
>"South Side Brawl Out: Next Friday. Win big for a cash prize! All can enter. Mixed MMA and Traditional Boxing bouts available."
>Don't have too much to lose and enter
>You make it half way through and lose to some anthro with no training
>Wasn't too bad though; twelve fights and only four bruises.
>Someone else noticed that too
>Back side of the event
>Get approached by a group of sleezy guys
>Four of them. Are they going to jump you?
>You only won a few dollars, but some people are getting that desperate
>You get into a light stance, nothing obvious but something that'll let you think on your feet
>Lead guy in the group notices, puts up a friendlier tone
"Hey anon. Saw you fighting out there, nice moves"
>Gives you some cheesy finger guns
"Shame you didn't win the big prize, but..."
>He puts his arm around your shoulder, real friendly like, and walks you to where you can see the ring
>A match is going on
"We can both tell that you're in this for more than just money, ain't cha?"
>Hard for you to admit, but he's right
>Felt good to be back in a fight
>So swift on your feet
>Ducking and dodging
>You did need the money...
>But
>You'd be lying if you said you didn't feel like this led to something bigger
"Yeah" you say as you rub your neck, “I could certainly have used the money, but I really wish I got to be in more bouts. I like the challenge"
"Well anon, what if I told you, that you could be in way more bouts and have the money too?"
>You listened
>Apparently their boss, some anthro lady over the local crime ring, was looking for people to take dives in rigged matches and entertainment shows
>Lots of money gambled on both kinds of fights
>And a tidy sum would be yours in exchange for your cooperation
>You think about your empty apartment
>You think about your empty wallet
>You think about your empty stomach
>A few handshakes, a few months' meetings, and a large cheese steak sub later: you're a dive fighter on the till
>The mob takes care of everything
>Training? Yeah, gotta make it look real
>Gym? Of course, can't let somebody too scrawny go up lest someone suspect something
>Doctors? Some of the best in your town, gotta keep you ready for the next fight
>Cops? Suddenly a few on the force are really nice to you all the time for no particular reason at all
>And the money? Duh.
>It ain't a lot, gotta keep the lion's share for upstairs, but you have what you need
>A few years go by
>The work gets tough
>You are getting stronger, faster
>But no fight is a challenge; you always know what's going to happen
>Gets boring
>Gets mind numbing
>Gets to be a drag
>But, you still need the money
>Everything blurs together into two kinds of fights: Men or Anthros
>Fights with other guys are always at least a bit fun
>You can put on a show and try out new moves; fights are pretty good but the pay is mediocre
>Anthro fights are the other way tho
>The money's good
>Like
>Reallllly good
>Apparently lots of horny women like watching a man be "put in his place"
>Whatever
>The actual action tho usually sucks
>The boss will occasionally have you win a few; it keeps the numbers up and people guessing
>Better gambling that way
>But most Anthro fights are loses for you
>And it's never any close
>Get absolutely clobbered
>You remembered one fight with a flying squirrel woman in a colorful mask pounced on you...
>From a rafter in the ceiling
>How she ground her mound into your neck
>Whispered to you, "Those nuts are mine! Boy!"
>You were 27 at the time. Wtf?
>Another time, with a kangaroo fighter, she stuffed you in her pouch to take a victory lap round the ring
>Or victory leap?, damn roos always jumping

>It's hot
>Lotta lights on you
>You warm up with a few in place jogs
>People always forget to say about how the mats in the ring are actually a little soft
>Feels nice
>The MC starts his spiel
>Classic narrative
>You're the villain
>Some punk humie making trouble for everyone
>And then here comes the anthro hero to save everyone and remind you of your place
>Beneath her paws
>The MC announces your weights
>195
>Huh nice, you lost a few pounds over the weekend
>And 110
>Wtf
>The MC leaves and you can finally see your opponent
>A little Shetland pony woman with big bangs over her eyes
>She looks like she's barely five feet tall
>Not too surprised, weight classes work differently with Anthros and were irrelevant for most inter-species fights
>The bell rings
>The match begins
>You rush in, go aggro, drive up attention for the acting
>She kicks out your leg from you
>Usually that's your move
>But it's probably part of the act, getting served your own medicine
>Fall on your side to the floor
>Kick to the back of her knee
>She buckles, but doesn't fall
>You use the opportunity to get back up
>She charges
>Rushed you onto the ropes
>Forgot where your hands were
>Right on her tiddies
>Crowd jeers
"Ooh he wants it!"
"Give him what for, the little tease in those tight shorts"
"Show him what a real woman is like!"
>She grunts angrily and picks you up off the ground
>Body tosses you back to the center of the mat
>You roll back into your feet and almost laugh
>It's just soo funny, the little woman lifting you off your feet
>She is on you in a moment
>Barely have time to block her punches
>Shoulda focused
>Quickly shoves you in the stomach and you fall over
>She's over you and you quietly say
"Okay, give me a few more throws and I'll make my dive. Trust, I'll make it look good"
"The fuck are you talking about? Why isn't your head in the game?"
>Wtf
>Is she not aware of the 'arrangement'?
>Shit, she might really beat you to a pulp
>You roll back up
>Fine, just one more go and then you dive
>It'll look bad because you'll have to fake a pass out on the mat, but better that and losing a portion of the cash than getting laid up in the hospital
>You go high and bob and weave in a rush to her, get a swipe on her chin
>She goes low and kicks you over
>Onto her shoulder
>In a fireman carry
>Trots around the stage
>Won't let you go
>The crowd loves it and goes wild
"Bridal carry! Bridal carry!"
"Break him in!"
"Fuck him on the mat! I'll pay extra!"
>Whatever
>At least you didn't get any broken bones this time
>The MC announces the end of the fight,
"Looks like that's the end folks, cause she ain't lettin go of the Terran Terror. The pint size powerhorse, Cosmic Clydesdale, wins another match. Everyone in the stands and at home, make sure to turn in those bets by midnight tonight to collect your winnings!"
>Rest of the night goes as usual
>Get the big envelope

>But when you get inside, someone is waiting for you
>The Shetland pony
>Cosmic Clopper? Galaxy Galloper?
>Whatever
>Why is she here?
"There you are, Anon"
>How did she know your name?
"I've been waiting for hours"
>You turn for the door but she's already between you and it before you finish your turn
>Fuck
"Oh. hey, uhm" you stumble unsure of what to say so you just blurt out, "What do you want?"
"A real fight"
"Huh? But we just had a match?"
"No Anon, a real one. I could tell you were faking."
"You sure? Remember, humies aren't that strong."
"No, not strength anon. The way you rolled back up after I threw you. The snap to block at a hair's breadth of me clobbering your face in. The way you could take whatever throws that did connect. You're way more skilled than you ACT."
>She jabbed you with an accusatory finger,
"You're holding back. Why?"
>You shake your head,
"Can't tell you. Them's the rules"
"Whose rules?"
"It's..." you sigh. You're tired, "it's complicated. There are some powerful people in this, I'm just a small cog. >They wouldn't care if I was gone tomorrow, and they certainly wouldn't care if you were gone tomorrow."
"Mob? Cartel? Local thugs?"
"You don't want this whole mess."
"But-"
>You put your hand in her shoulder and look her in the eye,
"You don't want it"
>She turns her head, looks away from you with a huff
"Well Anon, I still want a fight. A real one"
>You look around the gym
>No one in sight
>It had been years since you've fought on your own terms
>And with an anthro, you'd have a real challenge
>No one will probably be mad, there's no audience
>But maybe doc will be mad, you did promise you'd get nothing but bed rest
>You pick up your gear
"Fine. Gear up and meet me on the mat"
>She got giddy
"What kind of match are you up for? Boxing? BJJ? I have some sticks, we could do some escrima!"
"Whatever you want is fine... uh, what's your name?"
"Oh it's Cosmic Clydesdale. Thought of it myself!"
"No, your real one. You already know mine so it's fair"
"Oh yeah" she rubs her neck with a blush, "it's Silvia."
>You giggle,
"that's a pretty name"
>She gets a little upset,
"Oh yeah well," she crosses her arms, "...better get used to saying it! You have to beg it when I pin you!"
>15 minutes later you're both ready on the mat
>You opt for the light headgear and hand wraps, gotta max your maneuverability
>The ring is much darker than the show one
>Quieter too
>You can hear her hooves shuffle on the mat, they're covered in cloth to protect the mat
"I'm ready when you are" she says
"Read-"
>She instantly rushed you
>But you're already out of the way, a quick step to the side
>She's barely turned her head before you chop her shoulder
>She's top heavy with that big chest of hers, use her weight against her
>Kick out her leg
>She falls to the mat
>She swings out a leg on her way down
>But you already moved back
>Anticipation is the first strat you learned, all the way back in the streets
>Though you should have been paying attention
>She's already rolled toward you and grabbed your ankles
>You hit the mat with a thud
>She starts dragging you to the side,
"You're mine now, smooth moves!"
>But you still have tricks up your sleeve
>You do what you always do when you fuck up, you turn into the skid
>You cross your legs, thereby crossing her arms
>And flip toward her
>Her arms are locked out
>Her legs are far back
>But her face is wide open
>One swift uppercut later and your back on your own two feet
>She holds her snout in slight pain and walks to the side
>You do the same, time for your words to fight
"You're good anon. Really good. But you know you can't beat me."
"Why's that?"
"Com'on anon. We both know how this ends. It's just nature"
"If you wanna talk about nature then you gotta know, I'm a survivor"
>You rush her this time
>She isn't as fast as you, but your punches felt like they hit solid brick walls
>Furry, Muscly, Sweaty
>She countered with a left hook
>But you dodged
>Forward
>Dumbass
>Your faces mush together for a second
>You both jump back
>You wipe your mouth and say
"Sorry… your hook just came so fast and-"
"J-just shut up and put your fists back up"
>Is she blushing?
>The two of you fight for 20 minutes more.
>Four more rounds go by
>You're bent over on your knees and so is she
>You're both panting and sweating
>But you're grinning
>This is the best fight in years
>She rushes you, again
>You slip to the side, again
>You go for the chop, again
>But this time she's ready for it and body slams you as a counter
>You're both on the floor
>You try to crawl out
>But she has your legs
>Can't twist 'em; she's not letting you
>Fuck her grip is like iron
>So many muscles grabbing you
>She's pulling you in
>Pulling you under her
>Into a pin
>She laughs
"This has been so much fun anon. Was worried I wouldn't get you for a bit. You're as good as I thought you were..."
>She pauses as a pervy grin creeps over her face
"But it's time to end this... I hope you're good at wrestling~"
>She says the end with a grunt, mangling you in
>She grabs you from behind your back
>And wraps her arm in front of yours, trying to pin it back
>Her head is pretty close
>So you use your other arm to try and push her head away, leveraging it against the mat below for strength
>It works for a minute
>But you feel her jaw shift
>And open?
>But her face is wide open
>One swift uppercut later and your back on your own two feet
>She holds her snout in slight pain and walks to the side
>You do the same, time for your words to fight
"You're good anon. Really good. But you know you can't beat me."
"Why's that?"
"Com'on anon. We both know how this ends. It's just nature"

>But you feel her jaw shift
>And open?
>Your arm feels very wet all of a sudden
"Mmm, Anon... You taste so good all sweaty and salty~"
>Wtf
She's cute and all...
But shit you haven't even been on a date together
"Heh heh, maybe we'll just have to fix that"
>Oh shit, you said that last part out loud
"Tell you what anon, if you win this fight..."
>She kisses your wrist
"I'll take you somewhere nice. Some restaurateurs owe me favors."
>She paused
"But if I win..."
>She thumped her hips into your ass, lightly grinding your loins into the mat
"...then I'll take something I want. Right here on the mat~"
>You've never won against an anthro before, at least legit anyway
>You could call Uncle and hope she just lets you go
>But that wouldn't be like you
>You've always been stubborn
>You've always been a risk taker
>You've always been a fighter
>And damn! What you'd do for a good meal right now
"Whaddya say anon?"
>She lightly tugged on your trapped arm
>Her long horse tail brushed the mat as it swayed
"You game?"
>You had an idea
>You whispered quietly
"I can't hear you anon, speak up!"
>You whispered again
"Fuck anon what are you saying, just speak up!'
>You whispered one more time
>She leaned in against your ear
>Fell for it
>You twisted your head and shoved a kiss on her
>She leaned back, startled
>And conveniently let loose your arm
>You wasted no time
>You spun out of her hold
>And got back up
>You readied a stance, and with a smile, said
"I hope you're ready to use up all those favors. I love fancy dinners~"
>She grinned ear to ear and rushed you for a tackle
>She went low
>You went high
>And over her shoulder
"Too easy Anon! Fire-woman carry for the win!"
>Pride before the fall
>You leaned your weight forward and got upside down on her back
>From the back you wrapped your arms through her legs
>You briefly grazed the bulge of her mound
>You could practically hear her blushing,
"Eager aren't we anon?!"
>You slung your weight and pulled her backwards towards the mat
>She tried to make it so she'd land on you
>But you already swung to the side
>You both landed on your sides
>You rolled back onto your feet
"I'm just hungry~" you teased
>She stumbled up slowly
>You're both endurance animals
>And she is stronger
>But she was also running out of steam
>You still had a chance
"You sure you don't want to call it quits early Silvia? I already have a place in mind!"
"Nah..."
>She charged
>Too quick to dodge
>You were caught and she tackled you into the ropes
"... you'll eat where I tell you to!"
>She slammed a few haymakers into you and then slung you to the floor
>She straddled your chest
>Even though she was only 110 pounds
>The weight felt crushing, maybe it was the exhaustion? the punches?
>She leaned back, pointed to her crotch, and said between labored breaths
"I hope... you're so hungry... you could... eat a horse... because that's what... you're eating tonight!"
>God
>You could feel the heat waft off her snatch
>You were both so hot
>So sweaty
>Wait
>You had an idea
>With the last bit of energy you had
>You finger combed your hair
>She let out a menacing giggle,
"Thrown in the... *pant* .... towel? Makin yourself pretty for me already?"
>You put your hand up, as high as you could reach it
>It was nearly dripping with sweat from your hair
>She opened her mouth to taunt, but nothing came out
>You moved your hand side to side
>Her eyes followed side to side
>You waggled your fingers
>And her eyes went wide
>You said,
"Bet you're exhausted huh? Would like some of my yummy salt huh?"
>Her eyes narrowed and her brow furrowed, darting between your face and your hand
>She lunged for it
>But you dodged her mouth
"You can have all my salt... at dinner tonight."
"What's gonna stop me from just taking it all right now?"
"Nothing. Though, you won't see me again after. Buuuut, if we were going out on dates... you'd see me all the time~"
>You could see her mull it over on her face, her lips squeezing together every time she had a second thought
>You waited with baited breath
"..."
"..."
"..."
"... ... Fine. Uncle. You win, Anon."
>This time you didn't dodge
>You let her take you
>Her lips swallowed your hand whole
>Her wide tongue wrapped down your arm
>You could feel the strength, the need, in her tongue as it squeezed you down to the bone, trading sweat for saliva
>You could feel the back of her throat
>Warm
>And wet
>Her eyes rolled back in her head from the pleasure
>And her moan vibrated down into your bone
>When she finally pulled off, your arm was freed with a wet pop
"Maginonies at 10."
"And save room for dessert~" she added, dragging a finger along her soaked crotch before licking it
"And when's our next wrestling match?" you replied with a smirk
"My place. On my bed..."
>She trailed a finger up your chin
"And make sure you don't hold back~”
[END]

>see the biggest dogs and wolves fall before the scritching hand
>Sharks and tigers bend and nuzzle against the palm
>Even the mightiest of elephants love the promises of pets
Anthros may dominate human mens' bodies and dicks but they'll never beat the hand and a scratch behind the ear

>"N-Nuh uh! Anthros have actually evolved to not be effected by stupid humie's feeble attempts to make us melt in their hands through amazing petting, and even if they did work it would only make Anthros dom you harder!! All fuzzy women are stone cold!"

You think human men are any less vulnerable to head pats? With how touch starved the average human man is, all it would take is a gentle pat on the head and a kind compliment, and most humies are reduced to blushing messes.

>be you
>ten year old boy
>out on walk in the park
>get tired
>take a rest on bench
>sigh a sigh of tiredness
>"ooooh, what do we have here?"
>you pause
>that's a woman's voice
>you turn
>two big ladies walk up to you
>ones a tiger and the others a wolf
>they wear sweaters and jeans
>they got big boobs and butts, and theyre looking at you funny
>you get a little nervous...
>"My, my, Giselle, isn't he cute>"
>"You said it, Sasha! Mmmm, I could just eat him up..."
>you're really uncomfortable
>the two ladies take a seat at either side of you
>what're you doing out here by yourself, little guy?"
>"uh... My mom says I'm not supposed to talk to strangers..."
>"What's your name?"
>"Uh... Anon?"
>"I'm Giselle"
>"And I'm Sasha!"
>"There, now we're not strangers anymore!"
>Okay, now you're REALLY wigged out by these ladies
>"Uh... I should realyl go..."
>You try to leave, but the tiger name Sasha puts her hand on your belly
>What's the rush? We really wanna get to know you better."
>You're sweating now (well... you were sweating before, but now you're like, REALLY sweating)
>"P-please get your paw off of me..."
>"Okay, I will.. but not before doing... this!
>In one fell swoop (lol, love that word... swoop xp), she lifts up your shirt
>HEY!!!!!"
"Aw, look at those little things! So cute! Sasha, you wanna have a little taste?"
>"You read my mind, Giselle"
>The two dive their heads down and start sucking your nipples
>You moan
>It feels... weird
>After a few minutes, they pull away, leaving a string of spit on each nipple
>"Did you like that, baby?
"I'm not a baby! And.. Why did you do that???"
>Because we like you alot! In fact... we like you so much, we're gonna do this!"
>"They quickly grab your arms and legs and take off all your clothes, leaving you butt naked!
>You gasp
>Aw... you look so cute nakey like this!"
>Sasha bends her head down to sniff your thingie
>"Ew... it smells like pee down there!"
>They giggle as you blush at them
>"Stop laughing!!! IT ISN'T FUNNY!!!!!!"
>"Oh, relax, twerp! it was a compliment!"
>"Yeah! It smells good! I bet it tastes good too! In fact..."
>She bends her head to start sucking your weiner!
>And worse, it feels kind of... good?
>What kind of witch is this lady?!?!?! Meanwhile, Giselle presses her boobs into your head and moans. "You like that, don't you?"
>You groan even more in rsponse
>She takes her lips off your privates with a pop and a grin, leaving it covered in her spit
>"My, my! Look how hard you are ! I think he's ready to go all the way!"
>"So do I! Get ready, Anon! You're about to have the time of your life!"
>They put you on the ground and then drop their pants
>What on earth are they doing now?!?!
Sasha sits on your hard wiener and slips it into her parts, somehow
>Meanwhile, Giselle drops down on your face
>It smells so weird
>Sasha bounces up and down on it, while Giselle smears your face with her... pee? It doesn't smell like pee.
>It's making you feel really funny down there, and the smell and taste from Giselle's parts is weird too
>Eventually, you feel a jolt of a really good feeling and spray white stuff into Sasha's parts
>At the same time, Giselle lets out some of her juices ont your face they both make weird moaning sounds
>They pant and get up, leaving you twtitching
>"That was fun, wasn't it, Giselle?"
>"It was! Thanks, Anon! Come out her eunattended more often!"
>They laugh and walk away, leaving you sprawled out on the floor
>That was weird!

>Be Anon
>Be the most strongest Alpha est Giga chad in the entirety of Caesar's Legion.
>Things are getting pretty loud over at the Dam, but it will probably turn out fine.
>Hear your Legionaries screaming in abject terror, but that's probably just the wind.
>A massive beast strides up to you soaked in fresh gore.
>Worse than that she has massive titties.
>There was word about these kinds of things happening ever since some dumbass courier got shot in the head in bum fuck nowhere and activated something called a "Mods list".
>No matter. You'd put this (Literal) bitch in her place using facts and logic!
>"And who are you to come before me... you don't bear the mark of the bear, yet you are ready for battle."
>She wipes some wet brains off her snout before responding. "Maybe you're willing to listen like a good boy."
>You start to actually get scared of this 8 foot tall muscle bound freak.
>At least some of your boys should still be near enough to help you... if things get bad.
> "I see you fight with words, like all beneath the flag of the bear. Let us hope your skill with weapons proves greater."
>"[Horny +-E99/099] Hrng, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this my way." She growls the words at you while rubbing her bloody thighs together.
>[failed] You seek to buy my conviction, like some merchant from the west. Your words have done nothing but delay the inevitable. Now, see what my hounds and my blade will bring to you.
>You're based and red pilled. You can't lose to this thing.
>[speech 100] "How about you legate sum bitches? Hell, why not let them get you?"
>[succeeded] The west's treatment of bitches such as you is their weakness. But... by my honor, I shall face you alone."
>At least you think that's what she requests.
>"Woman of the west... you will learn your place - in my tent, and again, when you beg for release on the edge of my blade."
>You lift up your weapon to fight, but you had no chance from the start.
>You don't even see when she turns you out like a light, you're just out cold all of a sudden.
>Hours later you wake back up to the sounds of revelry. You know that she's captured you and brought you tied, back to her encampment, utterly shaming you.
>But the more pressing thing is that her naked body has been violating you throughout the night.
>"Get off of me you disgusting mutated whore!"
>She just laughs while riding your bruised penis.
>"What was that? I couldn't hear you from inside that stupid helmet. Here."
>She takes it off for a brief second, only to shove her massive tongue down your throat, utterly flooding it with her saliva. Just as quickly she slaps it back onto you, so you can't spit her out.
>"What did you say back there? I'd beg for release? I'll make you a deal. If you beg like the little puppy you are, I might give you a break. A very small one."
>Such a ridicules notion. You would never beg for mercy.
>Just as you think that, she rocks her hips into you, to force you deeper into her snatch. Her wet, blazing cookie is frying every ounce of resistance you have.
>As bad as begging is, cumming inside your rapist is far worse.
> "P-" The word is stifled in your mouth the moment she grabs your nuts.
>"What was that? You're talking too softly for me to hear."
>You're seconds from boiling over. Her sweaty beast titties are actually starting to look appealing in your lust ridden state.
>"Please!" You cry out as your whole body shudders in orgasm.
>Her sadistic grin goes absolutely manic seeing you like this.
>Tears well up in the corners of your eyes.
>"Fuck!"
>She doesn't hold back now that you've said that.
>"I gave you one chance for a little mercy, but you're just insatiable aren't you? 6 hours of me fucking you, and you don't even want a break? God your perfect! Come here my little puppy."
> She kisses you once more while forcing you to get hard again inside her.
>You get a creeping premonition that this will be your life from now on, being a living fuck stick for some kind of Uberfrau in a land you thought you were strong enough to rule over.
> You notice copious amounts of cum leaking from her nethers.
>Before you pass out, your exhausted mind grants you a small respite in thinking of all the strong pups she's going to force you into making with her.
>MAXIMUM OVER RAPE ACOMPLISHED

>During the big Fur War 2, I was captured on A.P. turf alongside a squad of hyena fighters.
>We got sent to one of the worst snuggle camps active during the war, Vrakund.
>I saw those girls go into the showers an hour after we were taken off the train.
>They came out really poofed up, and angry, because you aren't supposed to wash yeens, they're just supposed to be musky and stinky.
>Anyway
>I was there for like 11 months before the main army pushed up enough to liberate us.
>The things you see in a snuggle pit.
>20 horny, needy, sweaty anthros all gropping at you, clawing you, trying to put your virgin penis where it doesn't belong.
>They didn't even make me do any hard labor, the (literal) bitch commander would just say,
>"He can serve the motherland far better, by servicing anthro cunt."
>Anyway, the war ended almost immediately after, and that's how I met my wife. :)

>Looking back on things now, it was all so silly.
>Why the heck was my tribe even fighting back against fluffy women?
>...
>Oh ya, my tribe used to have human women in it before the war. I forgot.
>Huffing bushy tail is better ngl.

i sometimes wonder what would human's specialty in a whole ''slavery'' centered society/hierarchy be? we are somewhat dextrous compared to others, we'd probably be used for maintenance of equipment in less than desirable conditions
>artic fox runs down to the office of her polar bear superior
>aye, cappie, them's naked monkeys, we found another haul of 'em across the tundra
>trying to breach the frontline? i thought the intel said they'd hold for reinforcements
>intel is screwed cappie, informant wasn't a wolf, just a white dog, 'dem traitors tryna help out their ''masters'' or whatever, shame they're so stupid after interacting with humans screwed their nogging bad enough to fight for the enemy, got a whole platoon of 'em males, sent to the infirmary, looks like they haven't eaten nothin' but ice soup for the last month
>of course, their supply lines are on disrepair, they are not build for the winter season unlike us
>do we return 'em to sender in pieces or in ashes?
>we're soldiers, not villains, plus we're understaffed, get them fed and clothed, half to the radio station and the other half to general maintenance, give one or two to the nurse, she's tired of the foxes dropping hair everywhere, tell the secretary to interrogate humans that resists and pass around the ones that still do around the barracks to give the girls some morale, those slender hands better be as usefull with electronics and delicacy as she says or else im cutting off her wings
>last thing cappie, 'dem dog girl was the girlfriend of that group's leader, what do we do with 'er?
>bring both of them to my chambers come sundown, i want her to watch what happens to triple crossers, hell i feel generous, maybe im even gonna let her join

Team Building Exercises:
>Never understood the hatred against office jobs
>You got a well paying job with coverage 
>Plans for retirement and a 401k
>Not to mention your own private cubicle you could customize to your own needs
>But there was one little pet peeve that you had to deal with 
>Team Building Exercises
>To ensure maximum cooperation between employees 
>The higher ups figured small games and the like would help improve morale
>From The weekly board game day
>To the monthly “Field day” trips 
>But there is a newfound interest with promising returns 
>”Excuse me, Anon?”
>Turning, you saw your secretary bird superior
>From what you gleamed from the older workers
>Shes been in this position 25 years since joining
>”Management has been noticing slipping results from you, is there anything on your mind?”
>Just tell her that it’s just a slump in production and that you’ll be at full capacity soon
>”Mhm, we both know that’s a lie anon, but management has approved a special plan.”
>”Think of it as a one on one team building exercise.”
>She beckons you to follow her, and you do
>Walking through the maze of cubicles, all decorated to each employees tastes
>From small things like coffee makers and posters
>To rugs and custom furniture
>Company certainly likes to show its employees freedom
>Eventually enter her private office
>Its rather monotone in nature 
>Well, nothing less for the uptight woman who’s been here for 30 or so years 
>”Now Anon, This session will be a sort of stretching exercise.”
>You notice her usually buttoned up shirt is missing a button or two from the top
>Showing her slim figure, and rather well formed breasts
>”Now, let’s start by stretching our arms all the way up.”
>Her shirt strains as she lifts her arms up
>Her Tits want to be let free
>”Now try to reach your toes.”
>As she stretches down, you see her massive cleavage
>And based on the shape, she isn’t wearing a bra
>”And finally, put your arms behind your back and stretch.”
>As she does, her shirt buttons finally pop off 
>Her well define, but modest breasts are exposed
>She plays up her shock with the wardrobe malfunction 
>”Oh! I apologize, I must’ve wore a shirt a size too small for me.”
>She pretends to be embarrassed, but as you turn to leave to give her some privacy
>”Wait! I…I have a meeting after this, if you leave, all my other co-workers will see me like this, you wouldn’t want that to happen, do you?”
>She rather sheepishly walks to the door to lock it and cover the window with the shutters
>As soon as the shutters are done, she immediately returned to her usual calm demeanor 
>”Ok, Now that people aren’t going to look, I’ll be blunt with you.”
>”I’m sexually frustrated right now, this job pays well enough, but it’s day in and day out.”
>”As such, I haven’t been able to seek a relationship, let alone a romantic one.”
>”And I’ve seen how you’ve been eyeing the female employees.”
>”While normally such actions are frowned upon, there’s something special about your case.
>”Especially when you swooned over me, those lustful eyes looking over every inch of my body.”
>”I got to admit, I fucking loved it, spent half my nights schlicking myself raw to thoughts of you ravaging me over my desk.”
>She gets too close for comfort, and you can hear her start to hyperventilate
>”But I know you wouldn’t do that, you’re too much a gentleman to do something so barbaric.”
>”That, or you considered yourself submissive in every sense of the word.”
>Shes staring to grind herself on your thigh
>”The dutiful worker, never complaining too much, always on time, never minding extra work.”
>You explain that the extra pay is based on performance, nothing wrong with that, right?
>”Of course, but you always tried to be sly about your other reasons you wanted to stay so late.”
>”Every time you got frisky, you’d rub yourself through your pants, always making sure nobody was nearby.”
>She leans to your ear, grabbing your hand to grab one of her exposed breasts
>You noticed a sudden wetness where she was grinding.
>”And whenever you finished, wasn’t it odd that I just so happened to be nearby?”
>You feel her other hand on your crotch, caressing it
>”I always made sure I got nice and close, I loved hearing your soft moans and squeaks whenever you got really into it.”
>”I imagined myself jerking you off, a supervisor rewarding a hard working employee.”
>”But imagining it wasn’t enough, I wanted to do it for real, but you always had an excuse.”
>”Oh, I simply have too much work, I have a meeting to attend, I was on paid leave.”
>You feel her talons start to rip at your pants, careful not to hurt what’s underneath
>”You Bluebeaned me for way too long, now I’m taking matters into my own hands.”
>You feel her feathered hand yank off your underwear 
>”Don’t worry, I made sure nobody will interrupt us for the next hour or two.”
>But do try to be quiet, walls here are pretty thin, or maybe that adds to the feeling, the risk of getting caught?”
>”Just try to relax, I’ll make sure it feels good to you as well.”
>She began to jerk you off, and you hear her mutter under her breath
>”Oh goodness, it’s even better in person.”
>She slipped her now free hand into her panties
>Based on sound alone she’s practically soaked in her juices 
>”I’m sorry, I though I could take my time with this, but I just can’t wait anymore”
>She slams her hips onto your dick
>Shes rather exaggerating her motions
>Looks like she only has experience with sex in the form of pornography 
>Wait, the dots are connecting 
>Her voyerism, Her exaggerated movements, And her frustration
>Poor gal, likely just wanted to get off
>”Oh man, the others on the thread won’t believe me.”
>Wait, Thread?
>”Imagine their shock when they see a woman like me with a young man like you”
>You realize her phones propped up on a desk lamp
>”Just noticed that? Say hello to the gals for me.”
>You have a small wave, just trying to ignore all this
>She eventually slams down as she orgasms 
>Her vagina begins to grip harder than a vice
>Eventually sends you over the edge, you cum inside her
>After a few minutes, she grabs her phone, ending the live recording
>”Smile for the camera”
>Your suddenly caught off guard by the light of her camera
>Eventually you dick softens to the point it pops out on its own
>After catching her breath, your supervisor walks to the desk, grabs a large office shirt and trench coat.
>”Thanks for the help, expect your bonus on your desk soon enough”
>Eventually return to your desk, your coworkers noticing your shaggy look
>”Jeez, what did you do with her? Professional wrestling?”
>You don’t want to know man
>You don’t want to know

P.O.W:
>The mortar fire has been shelling your outpost for an hour or so
>You’ve had to take shelter in a shabby section of the storage room
>Eventually, the Shelling stops, and you run out to open area
>Rush towards the armory, hoping it wasn’t to heavily damaged 
>But the sound of sniper fire taking potshots  at anyone who stands still
>Manage to reach the armory door
>But a sniper round goes through the tarsus of your right foot
>Suddenly fall to the floor in agonizing pain 
>Hear the sounds of Humvee’s and APC wheels
>One Humvee has its M2 pointed at you, manned by a golden jackal in desert gear
>Its doors open, four soldiers of the state bolt out
>One of them, a Dingo, put the barrel of her SOPMOD FN SCAR rifle on the back of your head
>”Today’s my lucky day, I get a shiny medal and see myself on tv.”
>She suddenly pulls out a camera or video recorder 
>”And I get to keep you under ‘rehabilitation’ rights.”
>She forces you onto your feet, the falcon combat medic motioning her to a makeshift hospital bed
>”Bleeding’s pretty intense, we’ll have to send him to a hospital to treat that gnarly wound, Sniper gals must be proud of themselves.”
>She grabs a syringe labeled “Transport sedative”
>Feel it enter your right shoulder
>”You’ll feel woozy when you wake up, but for now, try to get some rest”
>Fell your eyes get heavy, the last thing you hear is to load you up alongside the other men
>When you wake up, you’re in the cold antiseptic scented room of a military hospital
>Hear the door open, showing the dingo and a well dressed tiger officer
>Try to move your arm, only to notice you’ve been cuffed to the bed
>”What the fuck do you want from me?” You groggily ask
>”Names of the other cells in your division, counter-intel, Covert operations, anything.” 
>”You really expect me to just tell you? I’m not of those so called “Humies” who decided to stab their nation and species in the back in the name of getting some tail.”
>The tiger looks mildly disappointed, but her face indicates this is not her first rodeo
>”Should you willingly give up any intelligence on military operations, the state will issue a full pardon for any crimes committed during your time in the insurrection.”
>”And then what? State puts on a little show and dance, I grovel on my knees begging for forgiveness, then the next thing I know, I’m married to that 30-something year old she-beast?”
>The dingo suddenly forced your injured foot, now in a cast, downward
>You all but screamed from the pain, even when she let go, it was still agonizing
>”We don’t appreciate the use of such a language.”
>”Should you refuse, you will be sent to a holding cell in a prison in the Siberia district.”
>”And trust me, it ain’t gonna be the ritz, all those bears and snow leopards? they haven’t been able to get off in quite some time.”
>”I can see it now, you in that cute little prison garb, being watch by several pent up guards, looking at you like a raw cut of meat.”
>”Maybe it’ll be commissar Aleksándra, she’s always appreciated the tough to crack individuals”
>”And once you’re broken by her, all the guards will know your a free use slut.”
>”So I’ll ask one last time, will you reveal some information, and the state will provide you with a pardon, do you understand?”
>”Yes…Ma’am.”
>The officer lets out a smug smile of satisfaction
>”Thats what I’d like to hear, once you are discharged, we will talk more.”
>Both of them exit the hospital room, leaving you with your thoughts
>”Damn, I can see why some people defected.”

Inmate Pacification Program:
>You figured that prison guard was the best viable option for you
>Seemed simple enough, walk around, clang on jail cells for any disobeying anthro
>Maybe check for contraband, pays well, what could be the downsides?
>Well…many prisoners were well built and very tall
>And that was against regular Anthros, for a human like you? Not a chance
>But then you spotted it, a special job opportunity 
>”The Inmate Pacification Program is designed to ensure maximum cooperation with authorities while serving time.”
>Details on what the program offered to you were vague, but figure there’s no harm in applying
>Three weeks later, you got the job
>And after 2 months of training at a small jail, you were sent to the Jane Toppan institutional facility.
>The prison was split into two sections, one for predator based species, and one for prey based species.
>”Listen up ladies, I’m the new guy around here, so I expect you all to treat me with the same respect and humility that you show the other guards-“
>”Oh, shut the fuck up already! We know why you’re here, you’re our playtoy!” A rather rude hyena said.
>The cell block erupted into a cacophony of different attempt to lure you closer
>”Got some contraband in my pants, feel free to look for it!”
>”Feel free to pat me down, big boy!”
>”The canteen gave me two huge jugs of milk for you!”
>You waited for the heckling crowd to calm down, before leaving to attend some paperwork
>12:30
>Lunchtime, normally, the guards would have their lunch break, but you were a special case
>You had to remain on patrol at all times, until you clocked out.
>Walking through the bovine section of the herbivore section 
>You spotted a red and white speckled cow in her cell
>”Hey, shouldn’t you be in the lunch hall?”
>”Nah, not too hungry, but I’m way too fuckin’ sore to walk comfortably anyhow”
>”You know most of the milk you drink is sold by anthro cows? Interesting eh?” 
>She gets up, two noticeable wet patches on her bright orange jumpsuit.
>”And considering what job you signed up for, I figure you’d be willing to help a gal out?”
>She unbuttoned the top to her jumpsuit, her massive tits slipping out, her nipples poking out of the metal bars
>”You’re going to drain these milk tanks empty, and if you don’t? I’ll report that you failed to do your job in ensuring maximum compliance with the guards.”
>Her nipples leaked with milk, softly dripping down to the hard down
>”well? Lunch times about to end, last thing you’d want is for the gals to spot you like this.”
>You hesitantly latched onto her left breast, and immediately have your mouth filled with milk
>You suckled and licked at her nipple, eventually her breast felt much lighter.
>And when you finished, her breasts felt noticeably lighter
>And your stomach felt close to bursting
>Managed to leave the room when the other gals were returned to their cells
>Next day, you were the guard responsible for overseeing the prison commissary
>You checked that everything was stocked and ready
>During the weekly stop, your inundated with orders
>From candy bars to women’s underwear
>Occasionally, a prisoner will ask for “The Special Lipstick.”
>Initially, you were confused, they never specified the brand or its color
>until a rather sexually frustrated tiger slammed her fist on the reinforced metal door
>”Your dick, whip it out, NOW!” You could hear her tear at her clothing
>After unbuckling you pants, you hear her mutter
>”Fucking tease, I can smell you, stick it in the slot already.” 
>You felt the cold metal on your skin
>And the soft pads and sharp claws of the prisoners paw
>You then felt her hot breath and rough tongue on your erection.
>The clicking of her teeth audible
>”God, 6 years in the slammer, and not one conjugal visit, I’m entitled to this dick.”
>Feel your erection slip into her mouth, her rough tongue scraping against your erection
>She savored the time she had with your erection, before you hear her pants unbuttoning
>”Like a fantasy come true, rubbed myself raw in here.”
>She practically orgasmed when she slipped you in.
>She slammed the door with each thrust into your dick
>Feel like either the doors going to dent or the hinges will break off
>”God, Yes! Oh man! Now I remember why I was arrested, feels like a first time high again!”
>Well…At least you know why she was arrested and jailed.
>She felt yourself thrusting on your own.
>She pulls out, and begins to ferociously jack you off
>Feel yourself ejaculate into her mouth
>”Yum…Thanks for the frosting, is it on the house?”
>You just put your dick in your pants and just told her not to mention it to the other guards.
>Night patrol, making sure it was dead quiet, not noise after lights out, and all that.
>Notice a wet sound coming from the avian section
>Walk up to the offending cell, holding a red-tailed hawk
>”Knock it off! Y’know no sounds after lights out, and not to mention you ringing the devil’s doorbell.”
>The hawk merely stopped, but soon got out of bed, completely naked
>”Ain’t you that guard us gals can use to get our rocks off?”
>”Sorry, you can ask for my services after morning roll call.”
>She lets out a smug chuckle 
>”Oh no, that’s not how that works, once you clock in, you’re required to be available at all times, after lights out is the most popular time.”
>You felt her sharp talons fondle your pants
>”So do me a favor, I get to have my fun, and then I’ll be as quiet as a church mouse, deal?”
>You simply open her cell door
>”Fine, but we keep this under wraps, I want to keep my integrity in here.”
>She simply unbuttoned your pants and began to jerk you off
>”Fine…but you better let me have my fun with you.”
>She slammed you onto her firm bed, and she practically jammed your erection into her pussy
>”Fuuuck, Man, silicone ain’t nothing compared to the real thing.”
>”Hey, while you’re here, how about a nice game of 21 questions?”
>It was around 2:30 when she finally had your fill
>Your legs felt like gelatin while your hips were sore as all hell
>Managed to walk out her cell while she slept comfortably on the thin mattress provided
>You had to sit down on the stairs to the first floor to wait for your legs to stop wobbling
>The next day, a supposed prison riot broke out 
>Something about the canine gangs declaring war on the ursine gangs
>Medical ward is firing on all cylinders, more shank wounds than they ever had before 
>Guards were running to the armory for riot shields and non-lethal equipment 
>And you were relegated to the messenger
>You were responsible for ensuring that the guards learned of every development in the skirmish
>As well as noting down the leaders, something tells you that month long solitary confinement was on the horizon 
>Your job meant nobody wanted to hurt you,  lest they cut off the only source of male sexual contact in this prison
>That didn’t mean you were safe, however
>You’d be dragged into a cell with a frustrated canine or bear
>You were the bargaining chip in the cafeteria 
>And the other guards tended to turn a blind eye if it meant they got to use you after the inmates had their fun
>Eventually, after three weeks of nonstop usage to the point your legs gave out on you every half hour
>The skirmish was quelled, the leaders sent to solitary 
>And you got one week of paid leave for your troubles
>Well…Can’t say it’s a boring job

>Before they toss your ass in a snuggle pit for 40 hours in the winter, they often shave off any hair on your body so-
>1. the anthros can have easy access to your skin to cuddle, mark, etc
>2. they want to leave you completely helpless in regards to warmth, thus making you dependent on the anthros trying to molest you.
>They outlawed the practice after FW2, but they still do it in some of the I.A. republics.

>ever heard of the hibernation lock? that's some true stockholm shit
>long time ago, a female bear would take a human male to her den at the last days of autumn and keep him there, stripped from his belongings besides bare essentials
>from that point onwards, he could either leave the den and freeze to death or stay with the bear
>hibernation doesn't mean sleeping for months, it's more like slowing down every process of your body to a minimum
>basically bound to a sleeping ball of furry chub for the rest of the year and then some
>tend to her, tidy up the tight burrow/den/cave she made into a temporal shelter
>obviously humans can't hibernate tough, so they'd die quickly without a source of food
>hunting is not an option with no resources at hand, and good luck trying to eat a bear that can and will kill you if needed
>at best she made preparations and left some forage to subsist for a pair of weeks at the most
>many bears give birth during their hibernation so their cubs are ready to move by spring
>99% of the time the human they choose as a mate for the season (willingly or not) is also the same human they keep with them for their hibernation cycle
>she probably has enough milk for you and two cubs, but you'll need to stay stimulating lactation until they're born
this shit even happens to this day, do not trust a she-bear if she's come of age recently, DO NOT trust her either if she asks you to come to her apartment

>During the war on vampires, the united nations of lycanthropes began a full scale extermination campaign to end the parasite once and for all. >Besides the obvious stuff, namely genocide, it was also necessary to nullify the vampires capacity to breed.
>Because any human could be turned into a vampire thus adding to the problem, they came up with preventative measures.
>lycanthropes naturally secrete a mutagenic substance around the vagina during sex, this causes their partners to undergo genetic revisions to become more compatible with their species.
>A secondary effect that was discovered during the war, is that human men affected by this gene therapy lose the ability to become vampires, or even breed with non lycanthropes.
>Over the course of 2 decades countless millions of human men were forcefully vaccinated in this way, and quickly became the fathers to a new generation of lycanthropes.

>she's there again
>on the corner of your field of view
>you don't want to aknowledge her
>but she stands still like a picture, yet pops up
>you could try to ask
>but you don't want to risk it
>even looking at her properly feels dangerous
>so just keep doing what you were doing
>and do not adress her
>only once you saw her truly
>you woke up in a cold sweat, you could move
>but she was standing ontop of you
>your eyes were already set on her the moment you woke up
>she'd be beautifull if she didn't exhume dread whenever she was close
>she wasn't looking at you, unlike every other instance
>and when you blinked, she was gone
>but now she's back
>it's been months
>you can't live like this, doctors would call you a nutjob
>so one night you snap, and just stare at her
>you were right in her being pretty
>atleast for the first four seconds

>Be you
>Vercingetorix, 52 BC
>First of your name
>Leader of your people---
"Crawl faster CHIMP!"
>A paw kicks you in the back of the head
>You drop into the mud of your enemy's military camp
>How far you've fallen…
>You remember when you first fought the Romans
>A half legion of their bandits sacked your village looking for food
>Usually, you wouldn't have done anything
>The past five years of Roman aggression had taught you to keep quiet
>Bide your time
>Wait for a better time to resist
>You'd seen small bands of your countrymen lay waste to their wandering soldiers.
>And you'd seen what had become of the countrymen who weren't as crafty...
>Killed, Captured, Bound, Gagged, Raped, and Executed
>Rome had all sorts of ideas of what to do to you 'uncivilized' peoples
>But this time, when Roman bandits, excuse you, 'soldiers', sacked your village
>They came to your door
>And that may seem selfish, to only care when trouble found you
>But it didn't find you
>You were out in the fields, collecting grain
>Trouble found your mother, your elderly father, and your little sister
>The Roman wolves loved men, binding them and taking them as trophies
>And your father was a chief, a fine trophy no matter his age
>But, the wolves hated women
>Your home was up in flames when you came back
>You would've leapt into the fire yourself, had your uncle not held you back
"My boy..."
>He held you tight
>You could feel his tears trail down your neck
"...they're gone..."
>Or were they your tears?
>Your fists clenched his shirt
>You screamed and cried into his shoulder,
"It's not fair, IT'S NOT FAIR! It should have been me... not them..."
>He rubbbed your back, you heard his voice catch in his throat
"I'll miss them too, my boy"
>You looked into his eyes, anger drying your tears
"We have to do something, uncle. We have to fight back. We have to save them and the other villagers they took"
"We can't. You saw what happened to the Suebi when they fought back. It'll only get worse..."
>He held your head in his hands
"We need to save what we can"
>You pushed him away, your anger building
"I couldn't agree more, Uncle"
>That night, you gathered every young man you could trust and made for a Roman camp you heard was close by
>You all took as many knives and arrows with you as you could carry
>And climbed into the trees
>You would pick off their scouts and wandering drunks
>One
>By
>One
>Until you reached the inner sanctum of their camp
>From the branches, with your own eyes, you could see their debauchery
>Feasting on your people's bread
>Drowning themselves in your mead
>Pleasuring themselves on your captured brothers
>You didn't leave a single wolf alive
>In the morning, your villagers hailed you a hero
>A savior
>A king
>Your uncle couldn't look you in the eye that day
>All he said was,
"The die is cast, our fate is sealed"
>You never saw him again
>You had to leave
>You knew no one man could be a match for any muscle-bound wolfess
>But many men?
>Your strength lay in numbers
>You joined the Carnutes tribe's revolt
>And made great gains
>Village after village, you and your countrymen freed from Roman oppression
>From Roman degradation
>Until you worked up to retake your capital city of Gergovia
>And you worked up the military totem pole
>Your victories elevated you higher and higher
>The other chiefs made you the spearhead that they would drive into Rome's neck
>But your coming victories did not come easy
>Though small in number, your enemy was ferociously strong and well armored
>All out frontal attacks would only break you
>So you played your strengths
>They were few, you were many. You allied with as many tribes as you could.
>They were far from home, you were at home. You tricked them into becoming lost in the woods
>They had empty bellies, and yours was full on your fury. You starved them.
>Captured their supplies
>Killed their couriers
>Drowned their captured supplies so they couldn't steal them back.
>Burnt your fields so they couldn't pillage them.
>And it worked... for a time
>Eventually, you came across a city you couldn't raze, Avaricum
>Its people were too many
>Its stores were too large
>But its fortifications were impressive as well
>It would be safe
>Right?
>The Romans laid siege to Avaricum
>And when the wolves took the city
>In their anger, in their brutality
>They left no one alive
>No women
>No children
>Not even the men
>And they didn't even leave you the time to mourn.
>As soon as Avaricum was emptied of its larders, Gergovia was once again in their sights
>You barely got there in time.
>Your cavalry, ten thousand strong, barely held their vicious claws back
>At great cost
>Although the battle was won, you couldn't pursue
>You had to retreat to somewhere safe
>Alesia
>But it was not long before the Romans besieged you there
>It was like an impenetrable cage
>You couldn't fight your way out
>Your allies couldn't reach you within
>Eventually
>They abandoned you to your fate
>You couldn’t let your people starve like this
>It would shame them
>So you took it upon yourself
>Gave yourself up to the enemy so your people could go
>And for this you were drug out in the rain
>And led here. Caesar's Camp
>They stripped you of your clothes, and eyed your naked body in the cold
>They put you in chains. When you were too tired to march, they would drag you through the dirt
>You think they had some sick enjoyment in that, sexual or otherwise.
>When you finally made it to the edge of the actual camp, they kicked you down onto your knees.
>Bade you crawl like a feral dog
>All the legionaries lined up to see the 'last savior of the Gauls' on his hands and knees
>They jeered and catcalled you
>Denigrated your family name
>Cursed your countrymen with lurid obscenities
>One touched her paw to her scarred muzzle, said,
"Take a good look, Gaul. This is the prettiest face you'll see for a long long time~"
>Another jiggled her half full bowl of porridge at you,
"Hungy? Are you hungy little man? Ha ha" before hitting you over the head with the spilled bowl of gruel.
>And a third leapt in from the back. Ripped open her tunic, her furry breasts shaking in the air,
"Or perhaps you would like some MILK, HIGH CHIEF!" she taunted.
>Her gag sparked an explosion of laughter from the wolves
>The lead wolf pulled the chain leash around you tighter
>It was choking you
>She said, with a chuckle,
"Enough horsing around girls. SHE wants to meet her vanquished enemy"
>At merely the implication of Caesar, the whole of the camp fell silent.
>The howling wind barely managed a whisper
>The campfires cracked a little quieter
>The ravens of the camp ceased their caws
>All fell silent in a hushed fear
>The only sound now was the suck of mud as you trudged up to a large tent on a hill within the camp
>It was a bright ruby red and decorated with elaborate gold trims.
>Soft string plucks of music sounded from within
>You were forced in and made to sit on your knees, even though you tried to stand
>Within the tent was a small pack of wolves, Caesar's most trusted advisors and military leaders
>They were at ease, paying you no mind as they focused on their projects
>One mending cloth
>Another cooking
>Another writing
>Another decorating her claws
>And another fiddling with...
>One of your countrymen?
>He saw your gaze and hid himself.
>The coward
>The traitor
>It made you sick
>But one person in the tent had her full attention on you, smack dab in the center of the room
>Caesar, the red falcon, herself.
>You couldn't help but scowl. To be face to face with the high traitor herself. The so-called governor, of your lands. She was supposed to protect your people and keep peace. Not start wars
>She sat in a gold and red lounge chair. Laid with fur and cloth to look more like a throne than a military rest. She was shod with custom sandals for her talons, a bright white skirt with ample room for her tail feathers, a crystal white and gold tunic, and a large blood red cloak about her shoulders and over her wings. She was more of a copper color, with darker feathers rounding her neck and eyes.
>Her eyes.
>They were steely and piercing.
>They looked straight through you.
>A dark smile crept across her beak.
"At looong last; the thorn in my side finally plucked."
>Her wing patted a little stool to her right,
"I know you don't understand civilized speech, so I will speak your barbarian tongue. Come! Sit with me. Have some mead; it's y o u r ' s after all~"
>The wolf with your chain began to drag you when you refused to move,
"You'll move when and where the general says so!" she growled.
>You were sitting in her plush little stool, the fabric was surprisingly soft, perhaps Persian in origin.
>Julia Caesar leaned toward you, cocking her head left and right to see both sides of you,
"I don't think I need to introduce myself. You've surely heard of me."
>You spit onto the ground, and before you know it, you are hit with a slap from your leash wolf and fall to the floor
>You think you hear one of your teeth hit the ground.
"I love the unruly ones," Julia says as she twirls some mead in her glass
"They're always so much fun 'civilizing'. They spit and bite in anger, but eventually, they all spit and bite on command."
"You killed my father! You deserve to d--"
>Another slap. You definitely heard a tooth hit the floor this time.
>She leaned in closer, a knowing smile on her lips.
"Don't get to angry at me, it's not like I couldn't do it without help."
>You look at her, confused
>She laughs,
"How do you think my soldiers knew which house to hit? Not all of your people really loved your father, you know..."
>She picked up a leg of mutton and tore off a chunk, chewing as she talked,
"You're a lot like your father. Both of you, so ambitious. I wonder what he would have done had he seen you made high chief instead of him."
>You shake your head. Try to keep the thoughts from settling in your mind.
>Lies
>LIES
>LIES!!!
>You've heard how she's pitted Gaul against Gaul in this war.
>You won't let her do the same to you or your family.
>You pull against your chain,
"You're sick, you know that? You had an oath by your own people to treat mine fairly, but-"
>She raises her wing, pausing the officer who was about to hit you a third time,
"No, no. Let him finish. Let him have his fun while he can~"
>Your face is flush with anger
>How dare she treat you like this
>How dare she treat your people like this
>Who does she think she is?
>You raise your arms to all her ill-gotten goods
"But you steal from us. Divide us. Trick us. Lie to us. You're no governor, you're a thief! A petty tyrant greedy for power! Who do you think you are to do this to us?!"
>She glowers, her hawk eyes look as if they could gut you on their own
"You ask me who I am..." she trails a feather along her goblet, "But does that not imply you think you are someone of worth? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black..."
"You call me a hypocrite? Damn yo--"
>She nods to her officer who grinds your face into the earth
>Your earth
>Your people's earth
>Or at least it would have been, had these Roman rugs not covered the land she sat on
>The land she stole
>You grunt through the teeth you have left,
"Why? Why us?"
>Her voice was shrill, but commanding,
"I wasn't done speaking. But... I shall educate you. So country man, lend me your ear..."
>She stretched her wing out to a standard on her right
“Far from these dark lands, is Rome. The shining city on the hill, the light of civilization. She is the lighthouse that guides us from wrecking upon dark shores. And I am merely a keeper of this lighthouse. For all she does for the world, I love her. But not all feel the same way. There are... others... meddling senators and bumbling bureaucrats who darken her light, fearing it might blind others. And worse still are others who hog the light, shining it upon themselves and not the dangerous shores."
>You raise your brow, as if to ask what her point even was.
>She continues, her voice low and measured,
"It may not seem like it... but my people are in grave danger. And I am the only one who might be strong enough to save them, to guide the light back to the dark shores, strike at barbarity before it strikes at us. But my people don't see that... not yet at least. So..." she gestured her other wing toward her storehouse of plundered goods, "I shall give them proof of my cunning, my foresight, my might."
>You roll your eyes, but notice all of her officers have quit all that had occupied them before. All the attention was on her.
"And how do your people fit into all of this, little humie? I'll tell you."
>She pulled her blade from its scabbard, the razor sharp metal glinted in the tent's firelight
"Rome is not a republic, nay, it is a pregnant country, with an empire ready to be born. And empires..." she twirled her blade round and round, "suckle on conquest. New lands illuminated and, consequently, civilized. New men to enslave. I saw your dark nameless hordes, and I said 'et erit lux'. Conquering you, your people, will show my citizenry that I have what it takes to midwife an empire."
"So that's all we are to you?" you spit, your anger bakes the ground, "Publicity?!"
>A grin creeps across her face, "Barely. There is still much for me to do. To conquer. With Gaul and Carthage under my talons, there is still the Britons, the Egyptians, the lands of the Jews and the Persians, and the..."
>You laugh,
"That is impossible. You name nearly the whole of the world. You can't be so foolish to think you can rule the whole world?"
>A mad and blood curdling grin stretched her beak.
>Her eyes flung wide with unbridled joy.
>Her ruddy black wings
>They unfurled, stretching out at each side
>They reached the ends of the tent
>Sixty feet across
>And raised from the floor to the ceiling
>Twelve feet high
>They blotted out all the light, casting a shadow upon the entire room
>Only her head was illuminated, in an unholy glow
"Oh. But I shall... Rome will cover all the earth; and I will see all at its center"
"Y-You're crazy. You can't. Your mortal. Even if it's not at my hands, you'll die one day."
"Yes. And when I do, in old age, I shall follow the steps of Heracles up Mount Olympus."
>This woman is insane
>She
>Will
>Kill
>Everyone
>Her wings folded back in, the light returned as she shrunk and said,
"But I am a merciful empress-in-making, a merciful goddess-yet-to-be. Your people don't need to die to achieve my ambitions. They don't have to starve. And you can help..."
>Her sudden shift in tone concerned you
>You were allowed to sit low upon your knees again
"What do you mean, Caesar?"
"Acknowledge my leadership, my authority, my right to rule... and I shall spare your people."
>You brothers in arms
>Your village
>Your uncle
>They all appeared in your mind before you
>Even if you were to die
>Maybe you could still save what you could
>Tears fall from your eyes
"What do you ask, Caesar?"
>She twirls a talon at you
"It is customary, of civilized peoples, that the head of household should eat first. Before I can feed your people..."
>She twirled her talon at you again
"You must eat first~"
>Her foot talon reached out to you, long as a sword, black as a moonless night, and as sharp as a new arrow
"Polish my talon, Vercingetorix"
>With sorrow, you tear your loincloth off, your last piece of cloth, to do as she asks
>Her officers lick their lips at the sight of you
>She flings the cloth to the side with her tip
"No. You misunderstand. Your cloth will not do. You must use your tongue. Did you not understand when I said you must eat first?"
>You moan and cry as the realization hits you
>The shame
>To polish this beast's feet
>With your tongue
"Why do you hesitate, humie? I thought you would do anything to help your people?"
>You shuffle up to her foot on your knees, pain in every portion of your body and soul
>You take her foot in your hands and her guards point their spears to your neck
"No quick moves against the general, humie. Or your life and your peoples' will be forfeit."
>But you cannot hear them
>All you can see
>Is the mud of your people
>The spilled mead of your people
>And the blood of your people
>Caking her claw
>This is for those you can save
>You slowly lick her claw
>The iron is bitter in your mouth
>And her officers erupt in laughter
>And Caesar grows smug, "Is that how you barbarians really eat, humie? I won't have to spare much food for your people then."
>You lick harder and suck the end of her talon
"That's it humie? You only finish half your food? Your people will only need half the provisions then."
>You pray
>You tell your mother and father that you're sorry
>And you take the length of her claw to the back of your throat
>The room's laughter has died
>The officers are now focused far more on debasing themselves
>You can hear them finger themselves at the sight of you being degraded
>Hot chuffs and deep pants fill the room
>Her talon twitches in your throat
>It nicks your delicate skin
>Your blood drips down the back of your throat
>And when it feels completely smooth, you pull back
"So you can finish your food, humie. Good. For that one talon, one of your tribe shall eat. But if you wish the others to not go hungry..."
>She twirls her seven other talons
"Then you'll need to feast for faaar longer~"
>But you barely hear her words
>All you can see, in the mirror like shine of her black talon
>Is a man leashed in chains
***
>Julia Caesar twirls her eight spit-shined talons in the air above her
>She's giddy with glee
"Fuh fuh fuh, I'll have to keep you~"
>You cry into the floor
"Why do you cry, humie? You've achieved what you've always wanted, safety for your people.
>They will not starve. They will suffer no longer... under the protection of my wings."
>She gives you a sidelong glance
"Or, well, just the men at least..."
>What?
"What do you mean just the men? What about my sisters in arms? Our mothers and daughters?"
"I only keep what I can possess, what I can civilize. And your 'women' if you can even call them that, are not even mouths worthy of my feed. I cannot keep them, I cannot civilize them."
>The last piece of your heart breaks as you leap at her
>Your chains hold you mid lunge
>You scream
"BUT WE HAD A DEAL, YOU SAID YOU WOULD SPARE MY PEOPLE!"
"I did. But you can't call your women real people..."
>You collapse to the floor, heaving and sobbing
>You failed everyone
"But don't fret, little man, you still have a bright future ahead of you. I will take you at my side to Rome. You will be at the head of my triumph, paraded through all the city streets before we reach the steps of the senate."
>She lifts your chin with her claw, it pierces your chin
"And atop the steps, as you gaze at the most beautiful city in the world. Tens of thousands of anthros looking upon you. I will give you your final reward, and choke you to death as you cum"

>You storm through your tiny, stove-less kitchen and throw the bedroom door open.
>"I'VE HAD ENOUGH!" You roar, and hurl your ancient, useless-ass company cellphone onto your bed.
>A large lump of fur and muscle hiding under the covers jumps from the sudden noise.
>"Eep!" It squeaks.
>You blink in astonishment.
>"Cassie?!"
>A 7'9" white tiger anthro peers out from under the covers.
>"Not so loud..." she grumbles, and rubs the sleep from her eyes. "I just got back from the gym?"
>You facepalm.
>"Cassie, I love you, but what the hell are you doing in my apartment?"
>"Sleepin'" She says with a cute little yawn. "Was takin' a nap after the gym..."
>Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
>You sit down on the edge of the bed and start changing into your pajamas.
>...Wait a damn minute!
>"Sweetheart, how did you even get in? I always lock my door!"
>She holds up a bright green key dangling from her keyring.
>"Made a copy!" She chirps.
>That--!
>She--!
>You sign, and get back to changing clothes.
>This is exactly something Cassie would do.
>Anthros are so weird sometimes. They don't really "get" personal space.
>"Like, sadder than normal." She says, sitting up. "Like you couldn't shake things off, no matter how hard I tried. Have things really gotten that bad?"
>Oh, yeah, absolutely.
>Financially you're up a creek without a paddle.
>"I'm sorry Cassie..." You sign. "I didn't mean to snap. It just feels like everything is falling apart around me, no matter how much work I put in. I just want to feel appreciated for once, you know?"
>She nods, and touches your arm empathetically. "It's okay, Nonny. I know what that's like."
>Your port in every storm...
>"Hey, I bet I know what would cheer you up!" She calls energetically, and you hear the sheets rustle.
>"Therapy cuddles!~"
>You know what? Fuck it.
>You really need something nice to happen right now.
>Crawling into your girlfriend's embrance, you notice how overwhelming her body is.
>Far taller than you and vastly more muscular, Cassie has no trouble snatching you up and pulling you back into her embrace.
>She wraps herself around you from all sides, her large paws and firm arms sealing you in.
>The heat is almost stifling. All this fur and your mixed body almost make it hard to breathe.
>She has mastery of you in this moment.
>You never should have given in to the temptation to be held...
>"I know you've been working really hard..." She says, fingers in your hair, "and I appreciate that. I do! You aren't a pillow prince, you're a hard working man and I respect that part of you so much."
>Her paw feels the sweat on your brow. You feel her hands slip under your shirt, and soon she's working it over your head.
>"You okay love? You aren't overheating down there, are you?"
>You absolutely are, but that's part of Cassie's plan, isn't it?
>She wants you vulnerable and at her mercy, whatever keeps you from crawling out of bed and reaching for your cellphone.
>Your girlfriend, wasting no time and asking no permission, flicks her wrist, undoes the knot on your drawstrings, and removes your pajamas in one swift movement.
>She slips your head under the covers, and you feel her tongue lapping at the sweat on your neck.
>"Gosh, I love the taste of this stuff. Humans are so salty. Just another thing that makes you so wonderful, Anon. Why are you torturing yourself like this?"
>Her paw tighten possessively across your chest, locking you in place.
>"I just think that you'd be so much happier if you quit, y'know? It hurts my heart ache when I hear they're disrespecting you over there, and with your anxiety problems getting worse it makes me really scared for you."
>She runs her tongue across your cheek. An excuse to get close and whisper into your ear.
>"Remember when I said you were just like your father, and that you'd make an amazing dad?"
>"Stooop..." You groan half heartedly. "I don't have time for a baby...!"
>She keeps bringing this up every other day, as if she expects your whole world to have changed overnight.
>Only now Cassie has you trapped, and the ball's in her court.
>"I'm ovulating, Nonny. There's no better time than now."
>Her hand reaches into your boxers and starts stroking you freely.
>No consent wanted, no permission asked.
>Cassie is just taking what's already hers.
>"I know you're just as sick of waiting as I am, and work doesn't deserve your time. Don't our future kittens deserve you more?"
>"Cassie, I...humans are different. I can't let go of my career. Not after all the--"
>"Shhh, babe...It's time to let go. I'm here now." She croons, and rotates you face to breasts.
>She squishes you against her body, firm and sculpted, beautiful and broiling hot.
>You can barely breathe like this. All you can smell is tiger fur and sweat and--
>Her shorts come off.
>The scent of her dripping pussy overwhelms your nose.
>Holy fuck, it's intoxicating.
>The few uncompromised brain cells you have left are firing on all pistons, but it'll never be enough.
>You never should have crawled into Cassie's love trap.
>She starts grooming your hair with her tongue, tossing your boxers and her panties out of the bed.
>"Leaky boy..." She says, feeling the precum on the head of your shaft. "Tired boy... The human way is stupid! My baby deserves more than being yelled at!"
>You feel her paw come to rest on your ass as she guides your hips forward towards her waiting, dripping entrance.
>"Isn't this nice?" She giggles. "I don't even have to let go of you this way."
>It's like you're melting into her.
>"C'mon baby...just a little more. Mommy will take care of everything..."
>You shudder.
>"I'm an heiress, Nonny. You don't have to struggle like this anymore. Let Mommy make you a house husband."
>All resistance collapses.
>She coaxes your cock inside of her and you can't help but thrust needily.
>Cassie gasps, then giggles.
>"See Nonny? You're so ready to be a daddy! Gosh, I just can't wait to call you that for real!
>You silently thrust your hips and lose yourself in the smell of tiger fur, sweat, and moist pussy.
>God, the little wet squishing noise her cunt makes every time flesh meets fur is driving you crazy!
>She is so goddamn wet right now, and all because she knows she's finally won.
>"M-mommy's here!" She stammers. "A-and Mommy is (AH!) going to handle everything. S-she (Ah! More!)--"
>Whatever Cassie was going to say is tossed aside for whispy little moans and affectionate tiger chuffs.
>You really are one person like this. You can't tell anymore where your movements end and hers begin.
>Maybe that's why you lose control so quickly.
>"C-Cassie, it's coming out!" You moan, and she shoves your face in her cleavage.
>"Good boy baby! Cum for Mommy, Nonny!"
>She pulls your hips in one last time.
>No escape. No chance she'll finally see it your way.
>No chance she doesn't get pregnant this time.
>You let go and pop the most excruciatingly wonderful orgasm of your life.
>Overflowing out of her cunt, it even overwhelms the scent of her broiling hot cunt.
>Cassie shudders from head to toe and lets out one long, continuous moan as she rides out her own orgasm.
>You surrender control of your body as exhaustion takes you.
>Cassie is more than happy to take it from you.
>"I'll make the call tomorrow Nonny, I promise." She says after some time. "You don't even have to talk to them! Daddy is too precious for all that distress. Daddy belongs at home with his cubs, and if they don't like it they can pound sand..."
>Christ, you really can't breathe!
>Hot, God, Hot! IT'S TOO HOT!
>"Cassie, I need water!" You gasp, and push off of her chest.
>Your girlfriend slow-blinks at you curiously, then smiles.
>"Coulda said something sooner Nonny!" She giggles, and pulls her top off.
>What a weird way to die.
>Cuddled to death by a 7'9" tiger lady from-
>You feel something soft tickle your upper lip.
>"There you go Nonny..." Cassie croons. "As much as Daddy wants."
>Instinct takes hold.
>You reach out with your lips and suck.
>Life-giving tiger milk flows into your stomach.
>Cassie's looking down at you so adoringly, breast in hand, as if you were her most precious and delicate little cub.
>"It's okay babe. Go to sleep. Mommy will be here when you wake up..."
>Everything starts to fade away as you suckle Mommy's milk.
>What were you so upset about earlier?
>Guess it doesn't matter...
>None of it ever mattered in the end.

“—And that's the summary of benefits and insurance packages,” a cheery, well-dressed woman says to the gathered new hires. “Open enrollment begins thirty days after your hire date.”
The orientation trainer was very, very excited to explain the benefits of the company's 401k match and why it's far superior to the previous pension.
“Now that we've covered that, I'll hand the floor over to our Human and Anthro Relations Manager,” she says as she proudly exits right, waving to the “crowd” of a dozen or so men.
A much less bubbly hyena takes the stage and introduces herself.
“My name is Anita Frazier, and I will be your HARM for the foreseeable future,” she says. “You may call me Anita if you wish. For now, we must cover a very important aspect of workplace safety.”
Your eyes start to glaze over in anticipation of the corporate jargon that you're about to be subjected to.
“This subject is very relevant to the well-being of all our human employees. As you may or may not be aware, your anthro coworkers naturally go into estrus or possibly rut,” she explains. “Drug therapy to suppress these urges has existed for decades now, but not every anthro will choose to take them.”
A dim-looking man a few seats away from you shouts out a question while raising his hand.
“Isn't that dangerous?!”
The hyena's eyebrow twitches in annoyance, but she gathers her little patience to answer his question.
“Under Federal law, no employee can be forced to take estrus-suppressing drugs,” Anita says. “Some of you may be familiar that it goes against the religious beliefs of certain faiths, but an anthro can choose not to take medication for any reason and does not have to disclose why.”
“I would recommend not blurting out questions such as asking a woman if she takes them,” she says coldly. “Sexual harassment is not gender specific.”
This gets a chuckle out of the crowd, causing the man to sink into his seat in embarrassment.
“Now, we are required to show you a video explaining Best Practices and a real-life example of an incident,” she declares. “Without further ado …”
-----
Speaking slowly to the camera, a bored-looking Dobermann dictates a poorly rehearsed script.
“This video is brought to you by the United States Bureau of Reproductive Ethics and Diversity,” she explains. “BRED is your advocate for mutual understanding and respect in a diverse workforce.”
The canine gives one last forced smile before the screen fades into a panoramic view of a computer-generated factory. A deep-voiced man begins narrating over a foreboding, ominous music score.
“September Eleventh, Twenty-Sixteen. The Newmann-Briggs Industrial facility in Reno, Nevada.”
“Though occurring at a machine parts manufacturing facility, this was no industrial accident. An anonymous man was subjected to multiple rapes in the administrative offices over the course of several hours. The resulting physical and psychological trauma led the man to resign, and it required several years of counseling for him to return to the workforce.”
The camera pans to a clunky animation of a man with his face in his hands, fading back to the Dobermann standing in front of the official seal of BRED.
“BRED's investigation found that Newmann-Briggs did not have an appropriate program in place to address and prevent Sexual Emergencies,” she says. “The company did not have a Sexual Violence Prevention Program or an accompanying written Procedural Plan. The facility was lacking in Sexual Safety Rooms and Safety Surveillance Systems. These are just a few of the many critical violations of Federal Regulations that caused this completely preventable incident.”
With a loud boom, the dramatic title flashes on the screen.
WORKPLACE IN HEAT: EXPLOSION OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AT NEWMANN-BRIGGS INDUSTRIAL
A really cool animation of an eagle flies over the factory as the narrator continues.
“Newmann-Briggs is a facility employing over five hundred employees in both industrial and corporate positions. However, as a smaller company, the manufacturing division only operates through weekdays, while the administrative division is staffed every day. On the day of the incident, a Sunday, less than twenty employees were present in the entire facility.”
“There are several key failures that Newmann-Briggs did not address.”
“One: Failure to Adhere to Medical Regulations.”
“Sexual Regulations are entered into law by the Committee of Operational Mating and Estrus Regulations. COOMER specifies that any employer with over one hundred employees must employ at least one Sexual Enforcement Medical Examination Nurse and one Police or Uniformed Security Specialist. BRED recommends one SEMEN per two-hundred and fifty employees, one PUSS per hundred employees, and preferably an experienced medical professional as Chief. Newmann-Briggs did not adhere to these recommendations and violated Federal Regulations as none were on duty at the time of the incident.”
“Two: Failure to Report Sexual Status.”
“While employees are guaranteed their right to enter estrus or rut, COOMER requires disclosure of this state to a SEMEN. This applies to any volunteers or employees in a workplace, a non-profit organization, a religious institution, and students of an educational facility. Religious institutions are not required to place staff on leave, but they are still accountable for any crimes that may occur. All other mentioned groups are required to provide up to two weeks of paid leave if applicable or reasonable accommodations otherwise. The organization may be fined up to five hundred thousand dollars if an employee is allowed or forced to work when the organization has reasonable suspicion or full knowledge of Restricted Sexual Status. Individuals who conceal their Restricted Sexual Status can face charges from five hundred dollars up to five years in prison if bodily harm is involved.”
“The following is a description and recreation of the events at Newmann-Briggs.”
“The incident started at the very moment two administrative employees neglected to report that they were in estrus. They knowingly and willingly concealed their Sexual Status and reported to the administrative offices at 6:41 AM. The women, who will be referred to as Manager X and Manager Y, were both senior managers. They are quoted in BRED's report as claiming their superiors forced them to attend to duties, but Newmann-Briggs denied these claims. Neither employee was previously scheduled in any paper or electronic systems. According to the single employee who spotted the two women, they were observed as agitated. By 7:02 AM, I.T. records show that all activity on Perpetrator X's computer ceased. Under threat of perjury, the women reported the following actions.
-----
“C'mon, Y, hurry the fuck up!” Ms. X growls.
Ms. X, a lioness in a sharp-looking blazer, reclines in her chair with her legs spread wide. From the way she's hiked her sleek pencil skirt up to her waist, it's apparent that she's taking an unauthorized and very inappropriate break. However, she's not the only one shirking her duties.
Ms. Y is a somewhat smaller, equally frustrated lion, currently muzzle-deep in the other's sex. She grunts and glares at X angrily, resenting her rude, unappreciative words. Ms. Y is putting in a reasonable effort, seemingly anxious to get her own relief. Her muzzle is slick with the other lion's excitement, dripping down her chin and wetting her black nose. She tries her best to pucker her lips around X's dark black clit, but her feline lips aren't quite dextrous enough.
“—Fucking,” Ms. X sputters. “What the fuck are you doing? Put your neck into it!”
Y loses her temper and pulls back with a snarl.
“You think I just go around eating pussy all the time?” Y snaps back. “Shut up and cum already, or do it yourself!”
X does not take her defiance well but holds her tongue, other than commanding the other lioness to lick. Violently frustrated by the lack of relief from her heat, she pulls the woman's face closer to her ebony-colored lips by the scruff of her neck. Now that they're both in a rage, Y redoubles her efforts as she laps at her folds in a wide circle. The clumsy cunnilingus makes X lose her patience and reach down with her free hand to her clit. She furiously rubs it side to side, her chest starting to heave from rough groans.
“A-almost there …!”
She thrusts her hips a few times and lets out a roar when she reaches her climax, much to Y's displeasure. The lioness's thighs quake and squeeze the other's head as her claws dig into the loose skin of her neck. Y's annoyance reaches its peak as she gets an unwelcome jet of feminine ejaculate all over her face, trying to shake her head free. Still riding out her prolonged orgasm, X pays it no mind until the captive between her thighs gives her a much less than playful nip on her inner thigh. Extra sensitive, she kicks her legs out, her office chair rolling back.
“You BITCH!” X shouts.
Coughing a few times, Y catches her breath before instinctively licking her lips. With a suitably feline curl of her lips, she gags, her tongue lolling out of her maw.
“Ugh, gross … It got in my eyes …” Y groans. “—And you almost killed me.”
The post-orgasmic clarity soothes X's rage, replaced with guilt. However, her fragile ego would never allow her to apologize.
“You're a tough gal. Just walk it off,” X says. “I know my pride sister well enough.”
With a deadpan expression, Y hits her with a hard truth.
“You need a male to have a pride, X,” she says. “Even if we did, you'd never give me a turn. I'd rather not share, anyway …”
“You'll come around to it, little sister,” X says, despite being the same age as her supposed friend. “Didn't we promise to be together since we were cubs?”
“Yeah, whatever …” Y says as she rolls her eyes and flicks her tail back and forth. “God, I can't get your awful taste out of my mouth …”
Even if it wasn't intended to be an insult, Ms. X is offended.
“Funny coming from you,” she retorts. “—But maybe next time you'll learn how to use your tongue properly. I'd be better off with an angle grinder.”
The soreness and painful stimulation from the other feline's tongue has mostly faded, but the memories of the distracting scratchiness of her fleshy organ are still vivid in her mind.
“Get over it. I'm no lesbo. We're just helping each other through our heat,” Y replies, the disgust and annoyance starting to give way to painful arousal. “Now, do me so we can get back to work.”
A thoughtful yet bitter expression crosses X's face as she leans forward on the desk, folding her hands.
“No … No, It's not enough,” she mutters.
“I'm NOT doing that two times in a—” Y roars.
X authoritatively silences her with a wave of her palm.
“Not that. We need a man.”
“Well, I'd love to skip work to cruise for dick, but we have that Worker's Comp thing to settle,” Y says. “Not like we ever get any dick anyway …”
A leans back and folds her legs, putting her hands behind her head as she stares at the ceiling.
“We'll find one here,” X states.
The idea obviously excites Y as she grinds her thighs together and bites her lip, but she still points out a fatal flaw in the plan.
“The only guys in the office right now are dusty skeletons, and they're married, too.”
“I saw you making eyes at old Mr. J, but you're forgetting someone,” X says with an evil smile. “The new hire.”
“What new— Ohh …” Y recalls. “He started just a few days ago, right? The janitor?”
“Fresh meat. He looks really dumb, too,” X chuckles. “I saw him trip over the mop he was holding.”
Ms. Y starts trembling in predatory excitement, trying to keep her wits about her.
“But isn't that, you know …” she mutters. “The-the bad thing? You know what I mean.”
“They only say no at first. I'm sure we'll convince him really well,” X assures her, licking up a bit of drool dripping from her lips. “Go ahead and get him. We have a spill to clean up, right?”
Y's tail stands up rigidly as her instincts compel her to agree.
“Y-Yeah!” she stutters. “It's going to get a lot more messy here soon, though …”
The two share a dark, conspiratorial chuckle as the lioness rushes out of the office, sniffing the air for her prey.
-----
“Christ,” you whisper to the man sitting next to you. “Does this video have to be so … Explicit? I feel like I'm getting sexually harassed just watching it.”
Your newly minted coworker raises an eyebrow at you before replying.
“Uhh, seems pretty normal to me,” he says. “I know these things are boring, but I think you're letting your imagination run a bit wild.”
“Oh, uh, of course,” you say, embarrassed. “I guess I'm just daydreaming a bit too hard.”
He tries to hide it, but the slight wrinkling of his eyes betrays his discomfort.
He thinks you're some kind of pervert.
What a great first impression you've made.
Sighing, you return your focus to the video.
-----
You walk around the office hallways, unsurprisingly pristine since the previous day. Hardly anyone has walked through them, and there certainly haven't been any machine oil-covered boots stomping through the halls. However, someone has to keep them clean, so you dutifully mop the floors to pass the time. You just entered the workforce after a short break, and Mom never really made you help with housework, so you're more than a bit clumsy as you drag the mop along the floor.
“Ah!” you groan as you splash yourself with dirty water. “Dang it!”
You wrestle with the bright yellow mop bucket to try and wring out the stained ropes of the mop, but a strange set of sounds causes you to drop the handle. You would expect the sharp clack of shoes against the tile, but instead, all you hear is the slap of flesh against them. Turning around in confusion, the strange footsteps freeze just a foot or two away from you. You jump back from the sudden violation of personal space but compose yourself as you realize the woman before you is more than simple junior management.
“Uhhh, hello …?” you ask.
“Ah, um, yes!” the woman replies, wringing her hands. “You're custodial staff, right?”
Her behavior is a bit off, kind of like how your best friend would get every once in a while. Unlike her, however, this woman is doing anything but avoiding you. Your eyes flash to her feet, and you notice that she's completely barefoot, a strange choice even for an anthro. More than that, you don't like the deep growl rumbling in her chest, only broken by her forced coughs.
“I am,” you say. “Did you need something?”
“Yes! Yes,” she shouts. “There's a big, messy spill in our office.”
“Is it one of the offices with carpet? Let me go grab my—”
Her hands shoot towards you and wrap around your shoulders. Her claws twitch, prickling your jumpsuit but not quite penetrating the canvas.
“No!” she shouts. “It's too urgent! You have to come right now!”
You raise an eyebrow. The woman squirms and can barely keep herself from dragging you along to the spill.
It must be really serious.
So serious, in fact, that you notice a long, stringy dollop of liquid trailing from her eyebrow to her muzzle.
“Oh, that is pretty bad,” you say. “You, uh, got something right here …”
You point to your brow, and she lets out a rapid, embarrassed giggle as she smears it into her fur and all over her sleeve.
“Yeah, thanks!” she replies. “Let's go right now!”
She starts to pull you by the hand, stiffly power-walking so that you struggle to keep up.
“Are-are you sure you don't want me to grab my stuff?” you ask. “Mrs. …?”
“Miss. It's Ms. Y,” she corrects you. “But you can call me Y. Or mommy. It doesn't matter to me.”
All of the ladies in the office have been very friendly to you and pretty touchy-feely, but Ms. Y takes it to a whole new level. You understand that she wants to make you feel comfortable, but you haven't even called your own mother “Mommy” in almost two years now! You've been out of school for a while now, and even in your first job, people still treat you like a kid. You feel your face growing warm from the shame as the two of you near the office.
“Give me just a minute,” she says. “I have to get the lock.”
With shaking hands, the lioness repeatedly taps her badge against the doorknob, causing it to beep angrily and flash red in response. She gets only more frustrated and starts cursing as she slams her palm against the wood, losing her temper and scratching deep lines into the door.
“Open!” she shouts. “We HAVE to get in here!”
Tapping her on the shoulder, you offer an alternative solution.
“Ms. Y, try to do it a little slower, maybe?” you suggest. “—Or I can get the master key from the custodian's office, I think.”
You are not very sure of that last fact, but you want the anthro to calm down. For a little spill, she's acting like this is some sort of life-or-death matter. She lets out a horrifying roar and slams her shoulder against the door.
“RAAAHH!!!” she yells as she barrels through the door, splintering the frame. “T-There we go! Time to come inside, humie!”
Before you can reply, she drags you inside. You see that there's another woman in the room as well, wiping off some wet fingers on her blazer.
“Oh. Sorry, I should've opened it. I got a bit distracted,” the new woman says. “It'll still close, right?”
With just as much force, Ms. Y shoves the door into the fractured frame, the broken pieces jamming it firmly in place. You can hear the timber cracking as it compresses into an airtight, unbreakable seal.
“Wait, maybe maintenance should look at that …” you suggest.
“It's perfect that way,” the other lioness declares. “What's your name, meat?”
The way she licks her lips sends a fearful shiver down your spine for a reason you can't place.
-----
The narrator begins to explain various legislation once again.
“7:23 A.M. Just minutes ago, another critical safety issue was unaddressed, this time from the victim. The errors continued accumulating, dooming Anonymous to his tragic incident.”
“Three: Sexual Threat Identification and the COOKIE Method.”
“COOMER guidelines mandate that every male employee is educated on Sexual Threat Identification and Prevention. As part of Federally mandated occupational safety regulations, all male employees are to receive education on proper techniques to identify the signs that could indicate a Sexual Threat. Employees should not feel obligated to stand by or afraid to offend another if they feel unsafe. In fact, your coworkers will find your input rather helpful so they can maintain appropriate and respectful boundaries with their peers. BRED enforces any violations of Federal Law, such as unwanted advances and, more severely, retaliation for a reported Sexual Threat with the utmost importance. Fines for retaliation can be up to one hundred thousand dollars for a corporation that does not report and discipline such actions. The individual may face fines up to one thousand dollars.”
“The anonymous human employee, who will be referred to as Anon, did not exercise caution according to Sexual Safety Education as provided by his employer. However, Newman-Briggs severely breached Federal Law by having no training in place for Sexual Safety Awareness or for any appropriate practices involving Sexual Regulation. Anon was especially unfortunate as he did not receive any formal Sexual Safety Education as he did not attend a public education institution. Any student would have attended a mandatory Sexual Safety Education class and have learned the COOKIE method by graduation. Moreover, employers are required to review the subject on hire. The COOKIE method will be reviewed after the end of the recreation. Regardless of how familiar one is with the COOKIE method, BRED still recommends that every male trust their gut instinct when they feel their Sexual Safety is threatened.”
-----
“This guy is a fucking idiot …” you mumble to yourself.
“Well, what was he supposed to do?” the man to your side asks.
He has a decent point, but you have to try and think of something.
“Maybe he could yell or something?” you suggest.
“Who knows,” he says. “You're right about the idiot part, though.”
-----
The video continues to explain the main topics of interest.
“Even more gross neglect by the company allowed this disaster to unfold.”
“Four: Lack of Sexual Safety Infrastructure.”
“COOMER specifies that any workplace with more than one hundred employees, or spanning an area of over one square mile, has a dedicated Sexual Safety Room. BRED recommends an additional Sexual Safety Room per additional two thousand square feet, but Federal Regulations only require one per square mile. Every workstation must have a means of access and egress to an SSR, and SSRs must have regular maintenance and inspection. Emergency Evacuation Maps must designate SSRs and be posted in a public, easily visible place. Employees must be informed about all Emergency Action Plans for all indicated emergencies.”
“BRED requires very specific accommodations for a room to be considered a compliant Sexual Safety Room. To start, an SSR must have a regularly maintained door rated to a Security Rating Classification of SR3 and only lock from the inside. Preferably, the door should have a minimal viewport from the outside but allow any emergency personnel to see the entirety of the room if needed. An emergency, wired phone line must allow contact with both local Security Specialists and the greater emergency services. In the unfortunate event that a victim gets locked inside with an aggressor, several large push-button alarms need to be placed on every wall and on the door's internal handle unless disarmed by Security personnel. The alarm should be audible from all areas of the workplace and specify the emergency. For example: ‘SEXUAL EMERGENCY! SEXUAL SAFETY ROOM ONE!’ This prevents confusion between other emergencies such as fires or natural disasters.”
“A Sexual Safety Room should be a last resort, especially if Safety Surveillance Systems are appropriately installed. COOMER currently has no regulations necessitating surveillance over any areas other than Sexual Safety Rooms. However, BRED recommends a large and thorough network of CCTV monitoring over any facility exceeding one square mile, manned by a Police or Uniformed Security Specialist at all times. These technologies extend the range of a PUSS to cover a larger area compared to a foot patrol and cannot be recommended enough. A mix of physical and electronic surveillance will keep a workplace up to BRED's recommendations. More advanced systems may be used by security at the company's discretion, such as motion detectors for rooms, audio surveillance, and monitoring productivity for any Sex-Related discrepancies. BRED does not endorse any advanced systems as of this moment.”
“In the case of Newmann-Briggs, every one of these regulations was ignored. The investigation by BRED found that the supposed Sexual Safety Room was nothing but a broom closet with an inoperative phone. A pull fire alarm was the only emergency system in the unlit closet. The fire alarm was purposefully deactivated. BRED would argue that this SSR may be more dangerous than a standard room. The report states that there were also no Safety Surveillance Systems installed, not even the minimum required for the SSR. Anon had every opportunity for escape robbed from him before he even knew he was in danger.”
-----
“Do they really put all these rooms in buildings?” you whisper to the man beside you. “I've never heard of anyone using it.”
He nods in agreement but offers an example.
“Well, my friend's cousin apparently set one off in High School,” he says. “I think he got suspended for a week.”
“I suppose he ended up safe in the end …” you joke.
-----
“My name is Anon,” you say. “I just started here.”
“Oh! Good, we LOVE fresh new faces!” the lioness says. “You can call me X. Or your mistress.”
You pull at the collar of your jumpsuit and look towards the ruined door.
“Ha ha!” you chuckle. “H-hey, what are you doing, Ms. Y?”
The smaller lioness only chuckles madly. With terrifying strength and precision, she moves around any loose furniture and wedges it against the door. She's made an impenetrable door jamb, which would take an entire squad of firefighters to break in. Ms. X simply kicks her legs up on the desk and points downward to a spot on the carpet.
“The spill,” X says. “Come here and clean it.”
You walk over to see a large spray of fluid splattered over the flooring. You don't know how they expect you to clean it up without your tools.
“Do you have a towel or anything?” you ask, increasingly unnerved.
“You have a tongue, don't you?” X asks with an evil smirk.
“What are—”
The woman seizes you by the neck and shoves your face into the cold, sticky liquid. You shake your head from side to side, smearing the viscous slime all over your cheeks.
“Please,” you beg. “Stop it!”
“Clean it up, slut,” X demands.
Wincing and now deeply afraid to disobey the women, you grimace as you lap up the thick spill. The choking, musky smell makes its organic origins obvious even to your inexperienced palate. You aren't sure if it's the sharp tang stinging your tongue or the rough treatment affecting you, but you feel some sort of burning shame welling in your abdomen.
“I don't—” you choke out. “—rike this …”
Ms. Y trots over, dancing on her toes as she fiddles with her skirt. It takes a lot of resolve for her not to rip a hook loose, but the fabric eventually flutters free, showing that she has long abandoned any undergarments.
“Oh my God!” Y chirps. “That's so dirty! That's so …”
X pays her no mind as she further grinds your face into the mess.
“Yeah, slurp up that girlcum …” X says as she licks her chops.
“Whuh?” you mumble, confused.
The smaller lioness touches herself in a way unfamiliar to you, her fingers twirling with wet squelches between her thighs. With shaky legs, she shambles over to the two of you and begs the larger woman to stop.
“T-that's enough, right?” she says. “Y-you got to go first when I took care of you, right?”
Ms. X pulls you up by the scruff of your neck, pulling your body into her chest. Lazily licking the fluids off your face, she growls in frustration while deep in thought.
“I'm the leader of this pride, Y,” X grumbles. “I get to eat first.”
You start to shake and thrash as she begins to lick your cheeks clean, her awful sandpapery tongue rasping at your soft skin. You act as brave as you can, holding in your tears even as you hiccup in fear.
“Mmmm, you taste like me …” she moans.
“D-don't eat me, Ms. X,” you plead.
X stops for a moment and looks at her compatriot.
“This kid really is slow …” she murmurs. “He isn't like … special, right?”
“No, no, I think he's in college or something like that. He's just taking a break,” Y assures her. “He's just really sheltered. I don't think he even knows what sex is!”
“Mom said I can only do that with the lady I love!” you blubber, your cheeks still being licked by the larger feline.
“You'll be screaming how much you love me soon enough,” X says with a dark chuckle.
The lesser lion can't stand her friend monopolizing their fresh catch and pleads with her again.
“X!!! It's not fair!” she pouts. “You never share anything with me! I haven't even gotten to fuck a boy before while you're hogging the one I caught!”
The dominant lioness sits back and sucks in some air as she considers her options. Bringing her hand to your chin, she rubs it as if she were deep in thought. She tilts her head back and forth, tapping a paw as the silence drags on.
“Can you please let me go—”
“Very well!” X roars. “If I'm going to be Queen of the Pride, I need to provide for my little sisters!”
“Wait, really?” Y says in awe.
“La noblesse oblige,” the proud lioness replies.
“What?” the other says with a tilt of her head. “Does that mean it's time for mating?”
“Ugh …” X groans. “Yeah, go ahead.”
With frantic impatience, Ms. Y crashes into you and the woman holding you.
“UWAAAAH!!! SEEEEXX!!!” the woman shouts, thrusting her soaked pantyhose-clad hips violently against your body. “UNPROTECTED, DANGEROUS DAY, GUARANTEED PREGNANCY, IN-HEAT BREEDING, BABY-MAKING SEEEXX!!!”
“But I don't want that!” you protest.
Neither of them pays you any mind. X shields her face with a hand as the crazed feline showers the office and its occupants with flecks of her hot, fresh arousal.
“Jesus Christ, woman!” X shouts. “Calm down!”
Her request goes unanswered. Even in Y's animal state, she realizes she is getting nowhere and roughly hooks her razor-sharp claws into your uniform. With no care for your body's well-being, your clothes are shredded into tatters, your shame only covered by a thin pair of underwear. As much as you hate this terrifying assault, you find yourself becoming aroused. Even through the sheer pantyhose, her inflamed sex soaks your crotch, her sticky secretions practically searing your sensitive flesh. X is unamused that she's become mere furniture for the other lion to molest you on, and Y is too absorbed in the act to even strip you fully. X, hoping to speed things along, surreptitiously slices the fabric off of your waist.
“HA HA!” Y laughs. “RAW DICK!”
With both paws, she tears a hole in the crotch of her pantyhose, forever spoiling your virgin eyes with her lewd, dripping sex.
“Uh oh!” you exclaim. “This is seriously bad! What have I gotten myself into?”
-----
“Did he really just say that?” you say to yourself.
Having moved past your awkward interaction, the man next to you asks you a question in return.
“In the interview, you mean?” he asks. “Yeah, they really picked a winner there, didn't they?”
It seems your mind is still wandering, but at least you didn't say anything strange this time.
“I hate to say it, but it seems it was inevitable for this guy,” you comment.
“Heh, that's a pretty messed up thing to say,” the guy says with a chuckle. “You're not wrong though.”
-----
The graphic sex pauses for a moment for the narrator to add yet more dramatic facts.
“BRED condemns any discrimination or biases towards any species of anthro and towards humans, but certain factors may influence the nature of a sexual assault. The species of Manager X and Manager Y will not be disclosed. However, certain species may mate up to fifty times a day and, in exceptional cases, up to one hundred times a day. Estrus can be a very frustrating time for an anthro, and they may become agitated. Biting, clawing, and physical restraint may occur if the anthro's standards are unmet. Great care and patience must be taken even with a consensual encounter, but even more so in a Sexual Emergency.”
“Anon would be subjected to such extreme treatment.”
“What happens next is as follows:”
-----
“You're about to get into ME really soon!” Y exclaims, laughing to herself. “C'mon, c'mon …”
The other lioness holds you in a hug, blowing hot air over your neck as she lets out pleased chuffs. Y takes the opportunity to grab you by the shoulders and straddles the two of you. You wince as she digs her claws into your flesh, exciting X as well. Overtaken with lust, she growls and starts to nip the snack of your neck.
Y, however, struggles to escalate things even further. Her inexperience shows as she repeatedly tries and fails to get you to penetrate her. She humps her hips back and forth, unable to shake her instincts and instead grab you by the cock. As she growls in frustration, X takes notice and interrupts her.
“Hurry it up, Y,” she says. “Get it together. It's not that hard.”
“Grrrr …” she growls. “I NEED this!”
The woman pays no attention to her friend and continues to grind your crotches together fruitlessly. X tries to get her attention a few times until she loses her temper, sending the two of you reeling. You end up on your hands and knees while Y crashes into the desk, pushing it backward with an ear-piercing screech. A flash of anger crosses her face, slowly melting into confusion.
“You can't do anything on your own,” X groans. “You! Sit on the desk!”
The other lioness almost snaps back but begrudgingly complies in the end. X points at you next, ordering you like an unruly child as well.
“—And you!” she shouts. “Come here!”
“W-wait! No!” you plead. “It's not too late to stop, right …?”
“Listen here, you little shit!” she growls as she rushes towards you. “You're getting fucked, and you're gonna like it!”
She grabs you again by the back of your neck like some naughty kitten. When you try to pull away from her hold, she grabs your arm and twists it like a chicken wing, chowing you immediately. Marching you towards the other lioness, she barks another order at her.
“Get that stupid look off your face and spread your legs.”
Y finally catches on to her friend's plan and leans backward. Even though the desk is built for an anthro, she's so leggy that her paws touch the ground. As you're forced forward and your hips grow closer to their target, the less assertive lioness starts to blush under her fur.
“Hey, this is kind of …” she mutters to her friend.
Despite her weak protest, she hasn't taken her eyes off your bobbing erection. For some reason, being forced to walk with your hard dick exposed is even more embarrassing than your earlier exposure. The other woman's anger cools a bit once you're in between Y's thighs.
“It's easier for me to help you this way,” X assures her. “Plus, doing it like this isn't too bad sometimes. Make the guy do all the work for once.”
“Oh, you've tried that with the guys you paid?” Y asks her with a cautiously optimistic smile.
X sighs in annoyance, shifting her hold on you to wrap her arms around you. One arm twists around you, pinning your arms to your sides, while the other grasps you firmly around the base of your length.
“I'd rather you not tell people that,” she tells her. “Just shut up and let me take care of this.”
The other lion apologizes meekly, tearing her eyes off your crotch as she looks to the side in guilt. As X starts to line up your dick with her friend's pussy, Y's legs begin to tremble in anticipation and nervousness. Seeing this, X returns an apology as genuinely as her pride will allow.
“Hey, hey, don't worry about it. Just sit back and enjoy this for now,” X says with the gentleness of an older sibling. “I'm here to make sure everything's fine.”
“Okay.”
You don't want to ruin the “touching” scene, but you have to express your displeasure.
“This isn't fine for me at all!” you shout. “Stop it, or else I'll …”
The head of your cock makes contact with Y's swollen, slippery lips, causing the woman to claw rivets into the desk. It's an especially unnerving sight, seeing as it's made of metal rather than wood. Any embarrassment or shame that she had before is long gone as she pants wildly, her crazed eyes gleaming in excitement.
“Or what?” X says smugly.
Instead of telling her, you decide that it's time to show her just what you're capable of.
“HELP! HELP! RAPE!” you shout as loud as you can.
There's no response and the two lionesses don't even make a single attempt to silence you. X angles your organ up and down, lubricating the tip of it with her friend's copious excitement. Thinking quickly, you remember that yelling something different would be a better way to get someone's attention.
“FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!” you yell.
X can't help but snicker and explain the futility of your cries.
“Our offices are soundproofed. The line gets pretty loud, after all,” she says. “Not like there's anyone to hear you anyway. Go ahead and yell all you like.”
-----
The narrator gives Anon some light praise for once.
“Although unintentionally, Anon exercised one of the COOKIE skills by calling for help. However, it was much too late for it to be of any use. As Manager X claimed, the offices were indeed soundproof. While this may seem like a wise decision that helps administrative staff to focus in a noisy environment, this is actually a violation of Federal Regulations. BRED disallows any workplace to utilize rooms intentionally structured to muffle sound to prevent the very scenario that trapped Anon here. Some exceptions exist, such as rooms needed for work with sound or rare workplaces with extreme levels of hazardous noise. These rooms are surveilled, inspected, and constructed strictly to regulations. An employer can be fined up to five thousand dollars per room violating this law. The rooms may not be used until the issue is rectified, which can severely affect productivity. BRED suggests that areas that require a low-noise environment be placed in a separate building from the noise, and to space them adequately."
"Even if Anon could be heard, there was the serious risk that no one would be present to hear his cries for help. Non-essential employees are not required to be on-site to prevent isolation, but as found earlier, the mandated Security Measures were not implemented. A patrolling Security Specialist could have been able to intervene at this point. Anon's other choice to yell out ‘fire’ rather than ‘help’ can be a wise choice. It creates more concern and urgency, but it should be used wisely. Regardless, the tragedy that day would continue with its trail of destruction.”
“7:35 A.M. It may have felt like hours to Anon, but the nightmare at Newman-Briggs has just started.”
-----
Y’s legs wrap around the two of you as she pushes her hips forward, your dick slipping upwards and missing its mark. If she didn't have you in a leglock, you imagine that she'd spring onto you yet again. Even her friend's assurances are lost to her desperate need to mate.
“Stop moving if you want me to get it in,” X says. “It's already hard enough trying to put it in from this side.”
“Hurry up and get this dumbass in me, or else I'm gonna freak the FUCK out!” Y snarls.
Not wanting to deal with a lion in heat driven to desperate violence, X focuses a bit harder. After some probing, she finally finds her entrance and guides you in.
“He's ready,” she announces. “Push.”
You aren't sure if she was talking to you or Y, but Y does half the work with a sharp gasp of pleasure. X forces your hips forward with her own, a strange conga line of humping forming. Y's insides are as tight as a vice, only allowing you entrance thanks to the heat-induced fluids painting your nethers. X chuckles as the other woman grits her teeth so hard that you think she will crack a tooth.
“Oh fuck …” Y hisses as she takes you to the base.
“Better than you thought it would be, huh?” X asks.
“I-I gotta breed …!” Y grunts, grinding her hips against yours.
Shaky and overstimulated, Y manages to pull her hips away from you. With barely any delay, she slams her pussy against you again. She doesn't give you the slightest amount of consideration as she immediately starts jackhammering you by rocking back and forth. X starts to get into it as well, deciding to toy with you while you get assaulted from the other side.
“Virgins always get so impatient their first time,” she coos. “Well, I guess neither of you are virgins any more.”
X starts to nibble and suck on your earlobe, her hands wandering to your bare chest.
“How about you, fresh meat?” she asks. “Is it as good as you thought it'd be?”
The pleasure makes you squirm, no matter how much you despise the violent crime. You want to resist with words at the very least, but all you manage to do is whimper. Y's desperate humps only grow faster, grunting roughly every time your hips collide. The desk groans in protest as the legs rattle back and forth, scraping across the tile. Her sharp claws make an absolute mess out of the desk, abusing it even further. A strange grimace crosses her face as your wet thighs clap against each other, wet splatters of musky fluid soiling your bodies. The air is filled with a dizzying hot haze reeking of sex and sweat, condensing on the trio's bodies. Barely even a few minutes into the deed, your thighs start to sting from the force of her blows. Y suddenly twitches before yelling out.
“Already— Gonna cum!” she sputters.
Waiting until the last minute to announce her climax, she crashes into you as hard as possible, almost bowling over you and the other lioness. As her walls strangle your length, her legs squeeze you and her partner in crime with bone-crushing strength.
“Oof,” X groans softly in mild pain. “Easy there …”
After a few moments, Y's legs go slack, her lungs struggling to take in enough air.
“C-can you let me go?” you ask. “You got what you want, right?”
“What?” X asks in genuine confusion. “You haven't even cum inside yet. After that, it's my turn.”
The other lioness stirs, twirling her hips to warm her taxed muscles back up.
“Oh my God, that was amazing,” she sighs.
“I know it's your first time, but humans take longer to cum than us,” X coaches her. “Pace yourself so you can keep going.”
“Yeah …” Y mutters as she stares at you hungrily.
She starts to move again, controlling her movements and beginning to savor the subtler pleasures that come with more deliberate sex.
“Cumming inside …” she says with a disturbingly determined coldness. “… Have to make babies …”
She repeats the distressing mantra a few more times as she gazes into your soul. The seriousness of the situation finally dawns on you, and you start to tear up.
“No, I can't …” you whimper.
“What?” X asks smugly. “You want it rougher?”
“Stop,” you beg, your voice quavering.
“Oh, that's right,” X says, her cruel feline sadism starting to poison her words. “You didn't answer me earlier. Tell me it feels good.”
She starts to toy with your nipples with her soft paw pads.
“I hate this,” you reply.
“Wrong answer,” X says plainly. “Little liars get punished.”
You have no time to react before her fingers pinch your sensitive nipples, tugging them until you think they're going to bruise. You yelp, finally reaching your breaking point. A hiccup escapes your mouth as the tears start to roll down your cheeks.
“Aw, don't cry,” X coos sarcastically. “You should be happy that you get to be a daddy.”
Your complete submission seems to awaken dark desires in Y as well. By the question that follows, they are freshly unearthed ones as well.
“Is-is it bad that I like this?” she asks X, shuddering in pleasure. “I never wanted to make boys cry before, but …”
“I didn't think you had it in you,” X laughs. “It's okay. He'll end up enjoying it soon enough.”
You've given up physically and mentally, but the pair demands even more. Backing up her hips, X demands your cooperation.
“Don't make Y do all the work,” X commands. “Put your back into it, or else I'll get a little mean.”
To accentuate her threat, she starts mouthing at your neck, her sharp fangs poking your flesh. Terrified by the daggers pressing against your throat, you pull your hips back. Ms. X doesn't give you any chance to hesitate and slams your hips forward with her own. She timed it perfectly with her conspirator's thrusts, making your bodies clap together with a sharp, painful clap. Y lets out a surprised yet pleased moan as you pull away from each other, only to be forced back by the woman behind you. X starts to release a few breathy sighs before muttering to herself.
“Oh, this actually feels kind of nice …” she says. “I'm going to fuck you so hard for getting me worked up like this.”
Your body begins to betray you as the coordinated effort lights a fire in your loins. The measured, powerful thrusts force every possible inch of you into Y's depths. It almost feels like her sopping wet walls are trying to massage the seed out of you. Unfortunately, it's quickly working. To everyone's surprise, you can't help pumping your hips faster, the pleasure and trauma forcing the instinctive desire to cum out of you. After the shock wears off, a blissful smile crosses Y's face.
“You were right,” Y says. “Looks like he does want to put some cubs into me now …”
The other two match your quickening pace, the cacophony of noise almost drowning out everyone's voices. You're covered in Y's fluids and dripping sweat onto her, three orgiastic bodies writhing against each other. On the precipice of orgasm, you cry out as you grab Y by the thighs.
“Ugh!” you groan. “No!”
“He's gonna cum!” X says excitedly. “You have to put every drop inside.”
“Me too—” Y grunts.
You're much too feeble to try and push the two away with your arms, but Y's powerful legs seal your fate. With a muffled squeal, she climaxes again, pulling your body as close as possible with her legs. You shudder as your entire body gets crushed by the two women, her insides wringing your length right over the edge. With a muffled cry, you explode into her, closing your eyes in defeat. You feel your body spasm as you pump load after load into her deepest parts, eliciting satisfied mewls from the feline. X hums as she nibbles at your neck, gently stroking your chest as if to encourage you. The powerful orgasm continues for what seems like an eternity, your lower abdomen starting to cramp as you fill the other lioness. However, it does finally end. X notices your body going slack, and she pulls you free and into her arms.
“Ahh …” Y sighs. “I feel so much better …”
With a blissful, kitten-like smile, she rolls around a few times onto her belly and back, sperm spilling from her all over the furniture and floor.
-----
The narrator interrupts to provide even more facts about the quirks surrounding anthro biology.
“7:44 A.M. The first rape may sound short, but the extent of the sexual violence is anything but.”
“As you may be aware, estrus is the state when an anthro is most fertile, to the extent that it changes one's behavior out of a need to reproduce. However, the duration and timing of estrus varies between species, as well as the changes in behavior. Estrus already induces ovulation in the female, but certain factors may accelerate it even more. For example, the aforementioned species that mates dozens of times per day has her ovulation accelerated from the act of coitus itself. Such traits can create an instinctive vicious circle that few things can stop. Some species may even grow ill from untreated estrus. It is critical to understand not every species experiences estrus the same way.”

“Wait, they can die?” you whisper to yourself.
“Yeah, some of the mustelids,” the man next to you says.
You shake your head in disbelief.
“If someone told me that outside of a classroom, I'd think it was some sort of awful scheme to get into my pants,” you reply.
“Trust me, some have tried it before,” he says.
“Crazy world we live in …”

“See? That wasn't so bad,” X coos in your ear as her hands start to wander over your body. “You only have to last a few more hours, right?”
“No … No …” you plead, your sniffling starting anew. “Please, no more …”
“You're so cute when you cry. It makes me want to mess you up even more,” X says. “—But don't worry. I'll be nice and gentle the first few times.”
Y seems to have recovered already, approaching the two of you with a menacing, manic smile.
“Let me help you this time,” she says. “We're taking turns, right? I need to go again already …”
X pushes you to the ground, and you cover your eyes in horror, praying for this to end.
Your wishes go unanswered.

The film's musical score stops out of respect for the grim summary that follows.
“Nine minutes was all it took for Anon to get raped once. Manager Y recalled the time in full confidence. According to a statement she made, she proudly claimed that ‘she was 100% sure she got knocked up, just from the first time.’ Whether true or not, the fact is that the repeated assaults did result in the pregnancy of both assailants. All parties were unable to recall how many rapes occurred, but Manager X was the most certain in her estimate of over twenty times by each woman. It was reported that the victim was unable to produce sperm anymore, yet the women still continued to violate the man. Help did eventually arrive, but the damage was already done.”
“10:25 P.M. The operating hours of the administrative division long since ended, leaving only the three in the building. No one investigated the premises before leaving, nor did they attempt to account for any employees who did not appear to be present that day. Anon was subjected to nearly fourteen hours of rape, only spared from worse due to police intervention. According to a statement made by Manager X upon arrest, the two intended to kidnap Anon. They denied the charges, instead suggesting that he was their husband now. As you may imagine, Federal Law states otherwise.”
“Far from the company alerting the appropriate authorities, it was left to one distraught mother to call emergency services. Although it may seem premature, law enforcement decided to investigate a few locations at the insistence of Anon's mother. She is stated as saying, ‘My baby boy always calls me when he's coming home, and he said he'd be done with work by five.’ She waited until 7:00 P.M. to alert authorities, now very agitated. The 911 recording has her stating that ‘Little Anon should be at home right now, getting ‘welcome home’ hugs and kisses from Mommy.” Police were dispatched to search various areas, not reaching Newman-Briggs until 9:58 P.M. Although a cursory search would be standard protocol, the senior officer claimed she had a hunch to investigate further. While fortunate for the victim, the search did take over twenty minutes to discover him.”
“Upon seeing the officers, the exhausted victim managed to ask for help. Managers X and Y were ordered to step away from the victim but refused. Once the officers drew near, the women grew aggressive. Police resorted to less-lethal weapons and eventually incapacitated the women. Both the officers and the women sustained minor injuries from the scuffle. The perpetrators did not acknowledge their crimes, claiming that the encounter was consensual, and Anon said so at certain points when asked. Anon explained that he was under duress when making these statements. More officers arrived to tend to the battered victim, sending the two women into a rage. Yet again, they attempted to assault officers for the supposed theft of their husband. Over seven officers were needed to subdue the handcuffed women.”
“Anon was the individual who sustained the most harm from this tragic and preventable incident. Physically, he was found to be severely dehydrated, with evidence of muscle damage from overuse. Friction injuries were noted on his penis, and the majority of the rest of his body sustained mostly superficial cuts and bites. Two bites were more injurious, the women nonconsensually engaging in the anthro practice of ‘marking’ sometimes seen in married couples. Anon was treated at a hospital and held for two days, making a full recovery. However, the majority of his scarring ended up being psychological. He was unable and unwilling to return to Newmann-Briggs or any workplace following. Anon developed severe agoraphobia and could not be in public without his mother accompanying him. Eventually, a settlement between Newmann-Briggs and Anon was settled for what is believed to be an extremely significant amount of compensation. This, combined with fines imposed by BRED and the needed modifications required to the building led to the closure and dissolution of the company.”
“Manager X and Manager Y faced charges for rape, false imprisonment, and assaulting law enforcement. They remained under arrest until they displayed signs of pregnancy. Now moved to a maternal care unit, they were tried by a jury. The judge, in a controversial decision, acquitted the women of a few ‘redundant’ charges and suggested leniency in sentencing. She made a statement that ‘All women make mistakes every once in a while’ and stressed the need for parents for the women’s unborn children. Manager x and Manager Y were sentenced to thirty days in prison, along with ten years of probation and entry onto the sex offender registry. Two years later, these punishments were dropped due to good behavior. Although reluctant to reunite with his assailants, Anon did eventually start to correspond with them to participate in his children's rearing. As of twenty-twenty-four, it is reported that he is engaged to both women.”
“Some of the less informed may find this to be a happy ending, but BRED cannot stress how destructive and harmful Sexual Violence is in a workplace. Sexual Violence causes harm to individuals and, most importantly, extreme losses in productivity. It is estimated that over eight billion dollars are wasted due to workplace Sexual Violence. It cannot be allowed to flourish in a diverse and accepting workplace.”

The video finally ends, and you find yourself a bit pissed by the conclusion. No one got punished in any meaningful way. Mrs. Frazier, the company HARM, starts to review the ever-present COOKIE Method that every man has heard a million times before. The silly mnemonic is common sense for most people, but common sense isn't common, unfortunately. The group is forced to repeat the method with the hyena, obviously trying to hurry through it as much as the men are. As always, it goes as follows:
“C” the Signs
“O”bserve Behavior
“O”bserve Your Surroundings
“K”all for Help
“I”dentify an Opening
“E”scape Immediately
“Very good, very good,” the hyena says unenthusiastically. “Now go ahead, you know what to say.”
Reflexively, all of the men say, “I love COOKIE,” excluding one man.
It's the idiot who interrupted the HARM earlier, being a smartass.
“I love yeenis!” he says entirely too clearly.
Mrs. Frazier glares at him and clears her throat before concluding the presentation. She informs everyone that you'll be taken to your respective departments soon. Before that, the cheery cheetah from earlier walks up to the smart aleck, still all smiles.
“Mr. Gufus?” she asks with a radiant smile. “I'm afraid we have to discuss your future with the company in my office. If you'll follow me …”
That was no surprise for anyone. You honestly wonder how he got a job in the first place.
One by one, men get led out to their new departments by various managers until you're the only one left. You're a bit offended that no one values your time. After several more minutes of waiting, you hear the clack of heels down the hallway. Dressed in a sharp pantsuit, a stunningly beautiful and elegant wolfess greets you with a handshake.
“I apologize for the wait,” she says, her voice relatively dry and emotionless. “I wanted to welcome you myself rather than sending one of my subordinates.”
“Oh, uh, t-that's fine,” you nervously stutter. “Ma’am.”
The woman is massive, easily eight feet tall, and although she seems to hold no malice towards you, her eyes are ice-cold and analytical.
“I'm Vice President Maria Markoff,” she says. “I'm looking forward to getting to know you.”
“Me too, Mrs. Markoff,” you reply.
“Maria or Masha is fine. Don't be afraid to get more personal,” she says, less a suggestion and more an order. “You'll be tending to my affairs, after all. Now, if you'll follow me …”
As you enter the elevator, your boss attempts to make some small talk.
“So, are you married, Anonymous?” she asks with a barely perceptible smile.
“Well, I have a fiancé …” you reply.
You're a bit hesitant to explain your situation, but Mrs. Markoff is a very understanding and non-judgemental woman. Quite a few anthros would bristle at the fact that you're engaged to a human woman. If anything, your boss seems extra supportive, maybe even excited for the two of you. You may have misjudged the woman due to her demeanor. You, of course, can't bring up the relationship strife you've been going through, but telling your boss about your significant other reminds you of why you're due to be wed. Filled with fresh enthusiasm, you exit the elevator on the top floor, following the wolfess.
You have a beautiful wife, a kind boss, and a high-paying job.
Things couldn't be off to a better start.

>Her feet tapping against the floor as she walked in to the living room
>”Hey.” noting her presence, turning your gaze to her
>”Did you have fun with your friends?” you asked her
>She sat down next to you, barely any space between you two
>Her tail tickling your nose
>” I did, yes.” she answers
>”Do you mind? you waved her tail away from your face
> “What's wrong dear? Don't you like mothers tail anymore?” your mother cooed
>She placed her left hand on your thigh
>”Ummm” you looked at her hand on your thigh and back at her to question her actions
>She had a faint smile across her muzzle
>”You are not drunk are you?” you asked her slightly worried now
>” I only had a couple, I'm not that drunk.“ smiling back at you
>Her hand began to slide towards your crotch
>You grabbed her hand to stop whatever she was thinking of doing
>”Okayy, i'm going to stop you there. Clearly you are drunk.“ you noted to her
>“Don't you love me?” she shot back at you
>You were confused by this, of course you loved her as your mother
>But not like this
>”Of course I love you but as my mother, you know we can't do this.”
>”Go to bed, you're not thinking straight now.” you told her worried
>Your mother withdrew her hand from your thigh
>”Fine, I'm feeling tired anyway.” she pouted
>The vixen rose up from the couch, wobbling a little
>”D-don't you think you could help me up to my bedroom anon?” she asked you slightly embarrassed
>”Of course.” you replied and got up to help her
>Going up the stairs, your mother lamented how you were moving away soon and leaving her alone
>You told you would come visit her of course
>Your thoughts also mulled over her earlier actions, obvious
>Hoping she wouldn't remember it come morning
>Arriving at her bedrooms door, you opened it and both of you went in
>You stopped at the edge of her bed
>”Thank you anon.”she wrapped her arms around you in to a tight hug
>She flopped down on the bed on her back, pulling you down on top of her
>The vixen laughed as she saw your embarrassed face, cheeks all red
>”Wouldn't it be nice to spend the night with your mother?” she asked you with a smug smile on her snout
>”I-i uhhh.” you stammered even more embarrassed now
>oh fuck, oh shit
>”I didn't mean it like that.” she noted after seeing what you were thinking
>”Unless that's what you want?” her smile grew even more wide
>”That's the first thing that popped into your mind? you moron” cursing yourself in your head
>If you could die from embarrassment, you wished for it
>”I'm just teasing you, relax.” she placed her hand on your cheek caressing it
>Her touch was soothing to you, you relaxed a little
>”Think about it, it will just be like when you were little.” she spoke softly
>”You had nightmares, trouble sleeping, so you would spend those nights with me.”
>You remember those times, nestled against her soft fur and warmth
>”I'll stay with you tonight.” you spoke having made up your mind
>The vixen then pecked you on the lips which caught you off guard
>You were even more red than before
>”Oh you, what would I do without you.” your mother cooed
>And so you spent the night with your mother, nestled against each other
>It was mothers day after all

>Have Femchud wolf Romaboo GF
>Mostly just have fun listening to her autistic rants about the Roman Empire, leagues of wolf centurion women conquering foreign lands
>Her last rant was about something called the 'Rape of the Sabine Human Men'-
>*CRASH*

Angler fish gf

>expects you to do absolutely nothing
>forces you to marry her ASAP, keeps you in living conditions just one step above being a prisoner of war
>doesn't let you have independence for anything
>uses you as no more than a maletoy and sperm bank
>(You) are the one that stays at the love shack while she works, enjoying taking care of a school of fries

>you are Sinnominus
>servant to the priestess of Praevisexia, the Goddess of Foresight and Lust
>technically, you are a slave, but you do not mind it so much
>your duties are light
>keeping the temple clean, preparing meals for the priestess, record keeping
>though you also have one very special duty
>this duty starts with listening
>right now you are waiting in a special chamber built underneath the main hall of the temple, fitted with grates in the ceiling that lead through the floor above
>so you can hear the priestess converse with petitioners that come into the main hall
>”Praevisexia is not concerned with wealth or trade. Her predictions are not easily invoked.”
>the first voice is the priestess, a vixen you know as Flaminia
>another woman, the petitioner speaks in a soft bray
>"But this is a special venture! My interests are crossing seas and mountains, and I must know if it is safe to take my wares so far."
>the petitioner's voice lowers, so you have to strain your ears to listen
>"Knowing the future is worth very much to me."
>you know the priestess would be making a show of considering the matter
>she;s an expert at playing emotions
>putting just the right amount of guilt in her voice when she accepts
>"Very well. Perhaps Praevisexia will hear your request. Follow me, we will perform a reading on the marked stone."
>you rise
>you have to prepare the ritual before the priestess and petitioner get there
>you run through your quarters, throwing off your robe and taking up the proper vestments for the ritual
>a set of silk sashes you drape over your shoulders and around your waist
>then pad barefoot into the stone chamber set behind the temple's main hail
>you drag out the marked stone, a long flat slate with a channel set along its length
>and at equal distances along the channel are black marks
>setting the stone at the feet of a statue of Praevisexia, you slip your hands into a set of shackles hanging from the ceiling across from the statue
>just in time you settle in, turning to face the statue of a large-breasted owl with her eyes wide open and an unlit torch held aloft
>”Oh! Gods is that–”
>you hear the petitioner clearly now, at the entrance to the private chamber
>the voice of a woman in her middle age, if you had to guess
>Flaminia is right beside her
>”Yes, a human. A slave from the far east, plucked from Seleucia to serve as vessel to the goddess."
>you suppress a smirk
>it's always a different story
>for some you are an exotic eastern slave, for others a captured northern barbarian or a pure virgin blinded at birth to never see a woman's form
>but you manage to wipe the smirk off your face as the petitioner approaches
>you are not shocked to see a cow enter your vision from one side
>her footsteps were heavy
>she is well-rounded, with a round potbelly that you find quite charming
>her curving hips and heavy breasts befitting her nature are poorly contained in a colorful tunic and expensive looking stola
>her fur is a soft cream color that is pleasing to the eye
>her big brown eyes stare at you as though looking upon a miracle itself
>you give her the wide-eyed stare of a frightened foreign concubine
>the cow gasps and reaches out a hand toward your face
>"Stop!"
>the priestess cries out
>entering your vision from the other side
>as always when she is working, the vixen is without clothing
>her lithe, well-proportioned form on full display, as is pleasing to the goddess
>all her fur stands on end, and her orange tail is shot out straight behind her
>her black paw out-stretched in a theatrical gesture toward the cow
>"Do not touch the vessel with your unclean hands!"
>the cow gasps and snatches her hand back to her chest
>making it wobble most pleasingly
>"What--"
>before the petitioner can question her, the Flaminia leaps over the measuring stone and holds her paws up to the statue of the goddess
>"You must anoint yourself! In the sacred oil!"
>damnation
>you forgot the sacred oil
>and the way the priestess is looking at you, she knows it too
>and she won't forget
>but she's too good to let a little hiccup interrupt the ritual
>she returns her sly gaze to the cow
>"Make your petition to the goddess, speak loudly and clearly, and be reverent. I will return with the oil."
>with a swish of her tail, the priestess trots off into the hall you came out of a few minutes ago
>even when she's angry she still makes sure to sway her hips side to side seductively
>she's a very good priestess of Praevisexia
>"Oh goddess!"
>the cow throws up her arms
>making her form oscillate with the force of her cries to the goddess
>naturally you ogle her
>"I am sending my caravans far, far away! To the province of Cockerspania! I have a back-log of swords that I have not been able to offload..."
>the cow goes on explaining her woeful circumstances
>you go on staring at her wide rear stretching her tunic
>it's what the goddess would want
>until Flaminia returns with a wide bowl filled with fresh olive oil
>the fox sets at the feet of the statue, right next to the measuring stone, and bends over to perform a hasty blessing
>the goddess would surely want you to stare at the priestess's glistening cunt peaking out from beneath her upraised tail
>you know Flaminia likes it
>when she's done, the priestess steps aside to present the bowl of sanctified oil
>"Coat your hands."
>the cow dunks her hands into the bowl
>"Now apply the oil."
>the cow looks indecisive, chewing her lip
>before slapping her hands on your chest and slathering it down your body
>you almost flinch
>it's still cold
>Flaminia gives you a wide smile over the cow's shoulders, enjoying your momentary discomfort
>"Yes that is right. Be sure to cover both nipples."
>doing as commanded, the cow palms your chest
>her eyes are wide
>her ears are burning pink on the skin inside
>"Give them a pinch too. The goddess is feeling mean today."
>the cow looks in your eyes
>it's cute how nervous she is when she's a head and a half taller than you
>then she pinches your nipples and you squirm
"Ah!"
>you cry out and the cow immediately releases you
>Flaminia tuts, a wide smile still painted on her muzzle
>"A little more. Give them a twist. The goddess wishes to hear him moan."
>looking in your eye, the cow pinches you again
>"Sorry..."
>she murmurs before twisting them both
>the stinging pain is a powerful pleasure
>you grit your teeth and moan
>there are rougher rituals
>but the goddess loves a show
>you deserve it for your failing with the oil
>"Good. That's enough."
>the cow mumbles out, 'sorry'
>but you can see by the way her legs quiver and her breath comes a little faster that she enjoyed it
>and though she hides it far better, Flaminia enjoys a show just as much as the goddess herself
>"Very, very good. Now for the reading. Take his cock."
>rather than hesitant, now the cow moves too hastily
>grabbing your hard cock in one oil-slicked hand
>and starting to rip off her tunic with the other
>"Do I fuck him now?"
>you look to the priestess with undisguised shock
>and she intervenes immediately
>"No!"
>the cow is grabbed and pulled away
>impressive considering the petite fox is smaller than even you
>"Use your hand! Use your hand!"
>the cow whirls about, snorting indignantly
>"What? Isn't she--"
>she jabs a finger at the owl, who seems to be glowering down at her
>"--the goddess of sex?"
>Flaminia manages to regain her composure
>"Yes. She is. Yet the ritual calls for merely a hand-job. How else will I read the seed?"
>the cow pouts
>but relents, letting her clothes settle down on her shoulder once again
>damn
>one of her tits had slipped out
>massive as you thought, with a pitch-black nipple
>looked tasty
>at least you're getting your dick oiled up now
>the cow coating your cock with one hand and fondling balls with the other
>"Can I touch his balls at least?"
>the priestess spreads her paws in a magnanimous gesture
>"Feel free. It pleases the goddess."
>as though that would stop the cow
>she's already cupping and rolling your balls in the palm of her hand
>the oil now warmed and pleasurable
>she leans over low, exposing a great deal of cleavage as she goes on fondling your balls
>her eyes wide and round, her jaw hanging open
>you feared it might go on forever, but Flaminia intervenes, throwing her arms up to the air
>"Hear us! O Goddess of Foresight! Goddess of prophecies! Goddess of lust and love! Speak through your vessel, let his emanations be your word! Grant your humble petitioners clarity as they coax your knowledge from his engorged testes!"
>the cow only glances at Flaminia for a moment
>but turns right back to you, mumbling the last two words to herself
>"Engorged testes..."
>the fox clears her throat
>tapping the cow on her shoulder
>"Now start stroking it. When he cums, I will read the seed to determine your future."
>you don't think the cow heard her
>she just goes on playing with your balls and staring
>her tongue starts to stick out
>but then sense seems to come back to her and she brays in embarrassment
>"Yes. Okay. Stroke."
>her hands are big, yet she takes your shaft in an almost dainty grip
>making light, slow strokes as though she were worried of breaking your cock in half
>really all she's doing is teasing you
>you pull at your shackles a bit, after all this build up she's touching you like a virgin touching her first pecker
>oh
>that's probably exactly what's happening
>the oil-slicked fur of the cow's hand merely brushing over your skin, a light sensation that's not unpleasant
>but it makes you yearn for more
>her other hand though, it keeps handling your balls
>she seems more enamored with them
>letting them slide around her palm, or gently massaging them with her fingers
>she doesn't know it, but she is working toward a very good prognostication
>every light stroke of her hand, warm oil and soft fur, fingers wrapped gently around your shaft so they slide up and down
>shockingly dexterous for a big ox like her
>intentional or not, she has you teased to the point of sweating and shivering
>and Flaminia is lapping it up
>the vixen watching the proceedings with hungry eyes and a twitching black nose
>she can smell every little drop of pre-cum that flows from your tip and mixes with the oil soaking the cow's fur
>the bright orange tail behind the fox whips back and forth eagerly
>you just grimace at her and stifle another groan of desperation
>"Am I doing it right? It's not working..."
>the cow frowns in thought
>Flaminia puts a paw on front of her muzzle to keep from laughing
>"Try a little faster, with a tighter grip."
>the cow strokes you faster at the priestess's guidance
>to your pleasure and relief
>but then you shoot the fox another startled look as the fingers around your balls starts to constrict
>the fox's smile breaks
>"Tighter on his penis! On his penis. Be gentle with the balls. He needs those."
>the cow nods slowly, slowly tightening her hand around your shaft
>that's better
>so much better
>the twitching and throbbing grows along with the pace
>the long minutes of teasing your cock have left you ready to burst with only a little stronger stimulation
>so this little extra speed and friction unleashes the burning in your loins
>your cock throbs in her hand
>"Oh! I think he's--he's gonna--!"
>the cow gasps excitedly
>and in her excitement she goes wild
>in a feat of arm strength and endurance she starts jerking you off at a blinding speed
>your whole body jerks, and you thrust forward
>blasting ropes of cum into the air
>burning pleasure shooting through you as you shoot all over the measuring stone
>you almost cum on the goddess's feet
>but even as the last of your cum dribbles out on the cow's hands, she doesn't stop
>her hands a blur on your hyper-sensitive cock
>you whine and try to pull away
>the sensation too much
>but Flaminia lets it go on a little longer with a nod of her head and lick of her lips
>Praevisexia is a sadistic bitch sometimes
>but not so mean as to really hurt you
>once your eyes start rolling back, the fox intervenes once again
>reaching up and 'undoing' your shackles so you can fall back and away from the cow
>who looks indignant at her plaything being taken away
>"Hey! I wasn't done!"
>the priestess scoffs
>"Yes, you are. I am ready to make a reading."
>the cow seems to remember why she came here in the first place
>turning around to let you lie in peace with your back on the cool marble floor
>you stare at the ceiling as you listen to the priestess prognosticate
>"Hm. Good thickness. A slightly sweet taste. Very heavy pooling near the first and second marks. Thin at the midpoint, but oh! Goddess above so much at the very end of the stone. Yes. Yes. It is all very clear."
>you glance down
>the cow is watching Flaminia with most of her attention, as she's still licking her fingers clean
>the priestess has her arms outstretched to the statue of the goddess
>"It shall be fruitful! In the beginning of the venture you will see much return. Then you will come to struggles and lean times. But if you are strong, then like our dear vessel, you will come far."
>the cow gasps
>and then quickly bows her head
>"Thank you! Thank you goddess! I will outfit an expedition right away! And when I return I will share my profit with the temple!"
>the fox smiles beatifically
>"Go with the blessing of the goddess. May your ventures bear fruit."
>the cow quickly runs out of the temple
>braying happily about how wealthy she's going to become
>the Flaminia leans into your vision
>"Still alive?"
>you sigh and nod
>"Good."
>a cloth soaked in water and perfume is draped over you
>"Get yourself and the chamber cleaned. We have another prognostication soon."

>"It's time you were marked Anon!~ Kukuku!~"
>Oh fuck! She busted out the anime noises, your girl is about to maul you!
>Gently try to redirect her. Say you'll lick mistress's paws whenever she gets home.
>"What are paws compared to ownership? You're MINE meat, and everyone should know it!"
>Swallow. Prepare for the worst.
>She reels back dramatically, flashes her mice mouse fangs, plunges down on your shoulder!
>Shout in fear!
>Except she's just nibbling you again.
>Keeps readjusting her mouth. Chomps on you repeatedly. No luck.
>"You uh...you need help babe?"
>"Of course not! I'm an alpha anthro! Your neck is just, like, super thick because you're a dumb lummox in need of my guidance!"
>Starts chomping.
>Kinda itchy. No broken skin. She cleans the hair out of her teeth.
>"You can do it..." She murmurs. "He's practically begging for it, the little slut."
>"Maybe closing your eyes would help? Pretend I'm a wheel of cheese."
>"IKNOWWHATIMDOINGANON!"
>Realize she literally doesn't have the jaw strength to mark you. Feel bad for her.

>you step away from the oven, taking off your apron as you walk over to answer the call
"Yes?"
>there's a growl from inside
>"Get in here! And call me master or I'll whip the skin from your back."
>you step inside to see Camilla standing in the shower with the frosted glass door open
>water flows down the furred dragon's frame, defining her muscles
>her chest puffs out as she can see you admiring her
>she huffs and snorts
>"Took you long enough, slave."
>god she's beautiful
"How can I help?"
>Camilla lashes her tail and turns about
>"I...I need help with my back. And call me master!"
>her one remaining hand runs down the fur of her back
>she's dexterous enough to do it yourself
>but she likes when you do it
>you roll up your sleeves and step into the doorway of the shower
>taking the bottle of special shampoo that she hands to you
>your pour a generous amount into your hand and press your hands against her back
>rubbing it into her fur in gentle little circles
>massaging the muscle she works so hard to maintain underneath the layer of fur you keep silky and soft
>Camilla groans and rumbles
>her tail wrapping around your leg and soaking your pants with runoff form the shower
>you started with the small of your back where you can reach, and slowly worked your way up
"Could you lean down for me?"
>the dragon huffs
>"Do not presume to command me, slave."
>she still leans down so you can do her shoulder blades
>and her rumbling grows so loud you can feel it in your chest
>you finish with her shoulders, making sure she can hear you when you murmur in admiration
"So strong..."
>a shiver runs down her body
>"Hm. Good. You have done well, slave. I will not flay your skin as punishment. But tonight you will attend me with your body."
"Just like every other night then?"
>you stand on your tip toes to give her a kiss on the cheek
"Dinner's in the oven. Love you."
>"Love you too. Slave."

>You heard steps coming down the hall, stopping at your cells door
>Keys jingling in the cell door lock
>”Wait here.” a female voice spoke behind the door
>Followed by a male one confirming her words
>The cell door creaked open and closed as the person entering walked over to you
>The burlap sack over your head was pulled off
>You blinked at the sudden change in lighting
>Before adjusting your eyes on the person in front of you
>A Tanuki stood over you, wearing a NKVD officers uniform
>Fur colored in light browns, greys and whites
>Short rounded ears, tufts of fur at her cheeks and a long fluffy striped tail
>Her eyes stood out the most to you, crimson red irises
>Half circles of white fur under the eyes, white fur extending to her short snout
>She broke your gawking stupor by introducing herself
>”Im officer Hao, NKVD, i have some questions for you.” she spoke with authority
>”O-Of course, i'll gladly answer them.” you replied
>”There must be a reason I was brought here, no?” you asked her before she could speak
>”We have a reason to believe you are assisting traitors to the state.” Hao spoke
>As she began pacing around the chair you sat in with her arms behind her back
>”Traitors? I have no idea what you are asking me of.” replying with confusion
>Glancing at Haos fluffy striped tail as she passed
>”You are the one running the general store near the red square, yes?” Hao asked curios
>”Yes, what of it?”
>”And the basement under it, you use it?” asking as she passed your front again
>“The basements is cool and it acts as storage, of course i use it” you told her slightly nervous
>You hoped they hadn't found the hidden room in there
>That hope was crushed when Hao leaned towards you with a smug smile on her snout
>”The hidden room then, what's that used for?” her voice playful
>Drops of sweat forming on your forehead as you tried to think how to respond
>”I-I uh know nothing about it, didn't even know it was a thing.”
>Your poor attempt of feigning clueless didn't please her
>Hao let out a sigh and hopped on your lap, planting her left arm behind your neck for support
>You squirmed against your restraints caused by her sudden closeness
>”Don't play dumb with me, you know damn well what I'm asking about.”
>Her crimson eyes peering into yours
>Again you feigned clueless
>”I'm telling you I didn't know there was a hidden room in there.”
>Haos fluffy striped tail brushed against your leg, indicating she didn't like your answers
>”It won't help you if you keep lying to me.”
>”We know you let the traitors have their meetings there.”
>”You best be truthful if you know what's good for you.”
>Wry smile on her snout as her right hand undid some buttons of your shirt
>”I-im being honest i swear, i know noth-” you were cut off by sudden pain in your chest
>Making you grimace, teeth clenched, eyes watering
>Hao had slipped her right hand under your shirt, digging her nails across your bare skin
>Tilting your head to the side as if to get some distance from her
>As Hao leaned closer to your ear, whispering in it
>”Tearing you up is of no issue to me if I get what I want that way.” words of malice
>Moving her nails again, making her intent clear to you
>Moving her nails again, making her intent clear to you
>You hissed at the pain again before facing the tanuki
>Hao had toothy grin on her snout, certainly pleased by your discomfort
>Wanting to avoid further pain, you drop the act
>”I-i have no part in their schemes, i just lend them the room for their meetings.”
>You came clean to her
>”How come you didn't report them like a good citizen hmm?” She asked
>Tapping her nails against your chest
>”One of my friends came asking about it so i..” you paused
>Maybe pointing out that you were friends with a traitor was bad idea
>Seeing anger flare up in her crimson eyes, regret and fear came down on you
>Hao hastily stood up from your lap, sending her balled furry fist in your face
>It hurt, your head swung back from the force
>”You lying shit, claiming to not know them!”
>”Next you tell me you are friends with one!” she snarled in anger
>Before striking you again, knocking you out
>Next few hours were spent by Hao abusing your body
>Your upper torso was covered in cuts n bruises from her torture
>It hurt like hell
>Hao had stopped her torture seemingly having vented her anger to your body
>She stood before you without her tunic, she had taken it off to not get any blood on it
>Hands on her hips, clad in a sleeveless shirt
>Showing her brown fur covered slightly muscled arms
>You had not spoken a word since she had stopped, opting to stare at her boots
>Rethinking your life choices
>”You know..” Hao spoke up
>”This could have been avoided if you had been honest with me from the start.”
>”I guess so” you mutter back to her
>Silence filled the cell, both of you not saying a word
>Hao broke the silence as she remembered something
>”Ah, before I forget this is for you.” she pat down her belt and took something from it
>She stepped over to you and tied something around your neck
>”W-what are you doing?” you protested weakly
>”Giving you a collar, I'm not sending you to Siberia with the rest of them.”
>”You will suffer your punishment under me, understand?” her voice commanding
>”Yes.” you respond meekly
>”Good.” Hao stroked your hair and went to undo your restraints
>Your legs were freed first then your bound arms
>With now your free arms, you touched the collar around your neck
>It felt humiliating, as if you were some pet to her
>She had put on her tunic again, straightening any wrinkles from it
>”Get up, we are going to my office.” she said while inspecting her tail
>Standing up to your legs, they gave out almost immediately
>Luckily you softened the landing with your arms, not with your face
>The cool concrete floor felt nice against your bruised and cut torso
>Soothing the pain somewhat
>Rolling onto your back, staring at the ceiling feeling tired
>”Are you going to pull through?” Hao asked above with slight amusement
>Shifting your gaze to meet the tanukis crimson eyes looking down on you
>”I-i i'll just rest here for a moment….” you drifted off
>She got down on her knees, lifting your torso against her
>Wrapping her arms across your body for a hug
>First she beats you up then acts concerned over your well being
>That can't be right, no?
>”What's with the act? You torture me and then act all worried for me.” you ask tired
>”You think I'm heartless?” soft smirk on her snout
>”Yes.”
>”Well I'm not, I just can't have you giving up on me just yet.” Hao spoke softly
>Giving you a peck on your cheek
>You looked back at her, the ever so crimson eyes meeting yours
>Genuine care radiated from them
>Maybe after all you would be fine with her
>”Siberia sucked anyway” you thought as you closed your eyes

>Be you
>Wake up in the hospital after a year long coma
>Can't move shit
>Can't speak
>Your eyes kinda work despite being mostly closed
>2 anthros come into your room, a doberman and a fox.
>Only the fox is a doctor. The doberman looks far more shady.
>The dog gives her a wad of cash, and she clears her throat before checking that the door is fully closed.
>"Now before you go feral on Anon here, there are a few rules."
>"You said everything was cool as long as I paid."
>"Yeah, and I also don't want to get the chair for pimping out a state inspectors son. You can do whatever to him, but the 2 hours you paid for are binding, I can't vouch for your secrecy if you linger longer than that."
>"Second, the one thing I can't clean out of these beds is human cum, so use a condom, or make him bust inside."
>The doberman starts to blush. "He can still feel me? What if he wakes up?"
>Your doctor titters. "His cock is working, a kind of prehistoric survival measure I've heard, but the chance of him ever waking up is slim to none. I wouldn't worry."
>They'regoingtorapeyouThey'regoingtorapeyouThey'regoingto.
>Your panic doesn't translate to any movement.
>Your rapist straddles you, and the doc leaves.
>"I know you can't hear me, but it feels weird fucking someone I don't know. I'm Sasha, and we're going to have a little fun together."
>Her firm paws easily gain access to your cock. To your relief it's still flaccid.
>"Guess a coma patient would need a little wake up call. Stay with me Anon." She leans over, her misty breath tickling your crotch.
>She presses her tongue against your cock before wetting it with a smooch.
>Slow shivers run up your spine while she swirls her tongue over the head, forcing hot blood beneath your belt.
>She grips your balls. The pressure she uses is just short of being painful.
>"Good, you're not all asleep." She angles herself to slowly sink onto you. Her full weight is impossible to ignore once her shapely ass presses you down into the bed.
>The dark lips of her cookie suck you inside with a wet shlick.
>"Damn your a good fit! The best part is you won't fight back, so I can take what I want."
>A strange feeling overcomes you. While she thrust you into her depths, it feels uncomfortably warm inside your own head, like sitting in a bath for too long. You want to breathe very deeply.
>Her gyrations start out slow, forcing you to memorize the feeling of her pussy. Every nook, and cranny of her hot, drenched cookie is trying to push you deeper, grip you tighter.
>She pulls you out of her depths, dripping her musky glaze before shoving you back in, deeper than before.
>The tight resistance of her snatch slowly eases while she slides you into the back of her cunt.
>It's like her body is molded to sheath you inside.
>"Fuck! Your cock is like an iron rod inside me! I paid for you, so I want to leave a mark on your little slut body."
>A sharp pain shoots through your shoulder when her teeth penetrate the skin. When she pulls back, her teeth are stained with some blood.
>She growls while the slapping of her thighs gets faster. "That bitch better clean you up good. Once I'm through with you she's going to need a mop."
>The glaze of thick goo she's left in your lap starts to stain the sheets as she says this.
>The tight grip of her pussy overwhelms you with sensation. You throb inside her.
>"Ya, that's fucking it! Bust your load, and put out this fire in my pussy."
>She speeds up while licking your bloody shoulder, just ravishing your powerless body.
>Your orgasm is forced out of you, flooding her pussy. She rubs her clit feverishly to ride the excitement.
>It's not fast. You feel every time you pump more seed into this woman. She doesn't spill a drop. You just watch as she siphons out your progeny.
>The thought of her becoming pregnant makes you sick.
>Suddenly she stops.
>Mortal terror fills you once she locks eyes with you. Looking back at you.
>"Holy shit." She opens your eye further. "That fucking bitch! You're awake."
>Quickly she figures out that your eyes are the only exception to your paralysis.
>An evil grin crosses her muzzle.
>"You had me worried for a second. Now I'm thinking we should make this more than a one time arrangement."
>She grips your cock and throat. All air is cut off to you. The resulting erection is quickly forced back into her before she lets go.
>"Don't worry about the details, babe. It would be really shitty if you flew the coop once I have our litter, so I'll figure out some way to get you out of here."
>She licks the side of your face.
>"You'll walk out the front door with my paw on your ass, and then I can take you back to my place. But before any of that, I need to make sure that you won't do anything stupid like mentioning the little business going on here."
>Her laugh is so cruel. "I'll come back to see you as many times as you need, before you're ready to get out of this bed and into mine."
>Your sore dick is forced back into the embrace of her cookie, lubricated by the last round.
>"Let's get back to physical therapy. What kind of girlfriend would I be if I didn't take care of you Anon?"
