>basically like an in-heat male scent since human's mating season is year-round
>single human guys give off the scent strongest since it's just their scent
>even human guys with human GFs still give off the scent strongly since human women don't have strong scents that stick to the guy and don't rub against guys enough to even properly mark them

A fantasy of mine is to be the centerpiece of a high society anthro party.
The whole point of me being there is to be fawned over, adored, pet and played with.
An exotic thing that all the fancy and well-to-do animal women go crazy for.
Lost in a sea of huge, poofy dresses, claws and hooves running through my hair.
Eager old anthros leaving big, wet kiss marks on my face.
Getting pinned against a marble pillar by a huge, fat ass.
Scale and fur and feather passing me around like an expensive bottle of champagne.

>Suddenly, they pull away, and before you can gasp for breath...

>threatens to kegel you into red paste if you break her daughters heart
>sends you off without another word, and a pleasant toothy smile on her face

> Hound Goddess Luna Makes you her pet
> Be Anon, a curious and adventurous soul always seeking new thrills.
> One fateful day, you find yourself in a secluded forest, following a winding path that leads deeper into the woods.
> The air is thick with the scent of pine and earth, and the only sound is the rustling of leaves in the gentle breeze.
> As you continue on your journey, you come across a clearing bathed in golden sunlight.
> And there, standing before you, is a breathtaking sight: a tall anthro hound, her fur a mix of shades from deep ebony to rich mahogany.
> She stands at least a head taller than you, her powerful frame exuding an aura of dominance and raw sexuality.
> Her name is Luna, the Hound Goddess, and she looks down at you with eyes that seem to pierce your very soul.
> "Well, well, well," she purrs, her voice like velvet, "what do we have here? A little lost lamb wandering into my domain?"
> You can feel a shiver of anticipation run down your spine as you meet her gaze.
> "I-I...I was just exploring," you stammer, feeling suddenly small and vulnerable in her presence.
> Luna chuckles softly, a sound that sends a thrill of desire through you.
> "Exploring, hmm? Well, you've found something quite interesting indeed," she says, stepping closer until she's mere inches away from you.
> You can feel the heat radiating off her body, and the scent of her arousal fills the air, intoxicating you.
> "Tell me, little one," Luna continues, her voice low and husky, "have you ever been dominated by a Goddess before?"
> Your heart pounds in your chest as you shake your head, unable to tear your gaze away from her.
> "Well then," Luna smirks, her tail swishing behind her in anticipation, "it seems you're in for quite the experience."
> Without another word, Luna takes charge, pushing you down onto the soft mossy ground.
> You gasp in surprise and excitement as she straddles you, her powerful thighs pinning you down.
> "Mmm, such a delicious little plaything," Luna purrs, her claws grazing lightly over your skin.
> You whimper, feeling a mixture of fear and arousal coursing through your veins.
> Luna leans down, capturing your lips in a searing kiss, her tongue probing and exploring your mouth.
> You moan into the kiss, surrendering yourself completely to her.
> With expert hands, Luna begins to undress you, removing each article of clothing with tantalizing slowness.
> Your body is on fire, every touch sending shockwaves of pleasure through you.
> Luna takes her time, teasing and tormenting you until you're begging for more.
> "Please, Luna," you whimper, your voice filled with need.
> "Please what, my pet?" Luna smirks, her eyes glinting with mischief.
> "Please...please dominate me," you gasp, your body trembling with desire.
> Luna's grin widens, and she reaches for a length of rope that she had hidden nearby.
> "Oh, I intend to," she murmurs, her voice filled with promise.
> With skillful hands, Luna binds your wrists and ankles, securing you to the ground.
> You're completely at her mercy now, and the thought sends a surge of excitement through you.
> Luna stands over you, her powerful form silhouetted against the dappled sunlight.
> "Now, my little toy," she purrs, her voice a seductive whisper, "let's see how well you can please your Goddess."
> With that, Luna begins to explore your body, touching and teasing every inch of you.
> Her hands are everywhere, her touch both gentle and firm as she drives you to the brink of madness.
> You writhe and moan beneath her, unable to control the waves of pleasure crashing over you.
> "Yes, that's it," Luna growls, her voice filled with hunger, "give in to me completely."
> You cry out as she finally takes you, her body moving in perfect harmony with yours.
> The pleasure is overwhelming, blinding in its intensity as Luna claims you as her own.
> You lose yourself in the ecstasy of the moment, surrendering to Luna completely.
> And as you come undone in her arms, you realize that you've never felt more alive.
> Exhausted and spent, you collapse against Luna, your body trembling with aftershocks.
> She holds you close, her strong arms wrapped around you protectively.
> "Well done, my pet," Luna murmurs, her voice filled with pride.
> You smile weakly, feeling a sense of contentment wash over you.
> "Thank you, Goddess Luna," you whisper, your eyes closing as sleep claims you.
> And as you drift off into a blissful slumber, you know that you'll never forget this unforgettable encounter with the Tall Hound Goddess who dominated you completely.

>lots of variation and accessorizing
>can be generic leather collar or highly personalized
but
>no easy access to neck for biting/licking/nibbling
>also means no bite marks/bruises/hickey on neck either

>They came for me on the beach
>I was laying on a towel, soaking up the rays while my parents were back at the resort devouring the breakfast buffet when I heard footsteps somewhere behind me
>I thought nothing of it, but then they stopped right next to me, I looked up, and the next thing I knew there was a rag covering my mouth
>There wasn’t much of a struggle, I blacked out nearly instantly, but the one glance I got at my kidnappers made me more confused than anything else
>They didn’t have bandannas over their faces like some sort of gang, they weren’t skeezy looking yeens hoping for a quick ransom, hell, they were dressed in cheap swimming trunks with noses caked in sunscreen just like every other unfurred tourist on the island
>Just two human men, middle aged and clean shaven
>They could have passed for a couple of schlubby dads enjoying time away from their nagging wives if it weren’t for their strangely cold eyes and blank faces
>Not that it mattered who I thought they were, I woke up in what I can only assume is some kind of ship’s storage room
>The steady hum of a distant engine reverberates around the hollow space and I think I can hear the faint calls of seagulls from somewhere above
>A cloth sack is wrapped tightly around my neck and my mouth is kept shut with duct tape
>With hands and feet bound with rope I’m utterly helpless, and the more I struggle the more it becomes apparent that I won’t be leaving this place of my own volition
>It isn’t long until I hear voices and footsteps from somewhere above, and I quickly still myself so they won’t know I’ve been struggling against my binds
>The voices become clearer, it’s two men, likely the same ones that kidnapped me
>”-don’t think I’d be happy with that.”
>”It’s for life though, and unlimited! A chance like this doesn’t come more than once in a lifetime you know.”
>”I’d still prefer the cash option. Shit, I don’t even like her brand that much. Penguin pops are so much bett-”
>”Shut up!” The voice angrily whispers. “Don’t let her hear you say that. I hear she’s touchy about that sort of stuff. Family legacy and all that.”
>”Whatever.” He flatly replies
>The voices quiet as they stop right in front of me
>Two arms reach down and wrap under my arm pits
>”Up ya go.” One grunts
>I'm carried through the unseen bowels of the ship by the two men
>It’s oddly quiet as we progress, no sounds other than our echoing footsteps and the hum of machinery
>Guess it must be lightly crewed
>Eventually I’m pushed down into a chair and the cloth bag over my head is ripped off
>My eyes burn at the sudden increase in light, so I squint and slowly take in my surroundings
>I’m on a ship, on the bridge to be exact
>It’s in the shape of a half circle, with windows letting in plenty of sunlight and consoles covered in electronic displays surrounding the rounded portion
>Standing off in the corner of the room is a graying German Shepard man in a captain’s uniform and standing directly in front of me is a large polar bear woman
>Unlike the dog she’s not wearing a uniform of any sort, instead dressed in a tight-fitting cream-colored dress shirt and skirt
>Her ears are pierced with large diamond earrings and a shiny golden necklace sits around her neck
>She stands tall, arms crossed in front of her chest as she looks down at me with a barely hidden sneer
>I get the feeling that she’s the cause of whatever situation I’ve found myself in
>The bear leans down sniffs around my face, I reflexively close my eyes and turn away, hoping that she doesn’t feel like taking a bite of my neck while she’s down here
>Thankfully, she leans back up and looks to one of the men standing behind me
>”He’s young.” She flatly states, voice tinged with disappointment
>”Just as you requested. One college age human male, unharmed, and with an average build.”
>She cocks her head with a frown
>”Last time I checked seventeen was a little young to be going to college.”
>”I swear he looked-“
>”Don’t worry Ma’am.” The other one says. “We can liquidate this one and get another. No extra charge.”
>Liquidate? I feel my blood pressure starting to rise
>The bear exhales and looks to the ground, eventually rolling her eyes and motioning to my bound body after a brief period of deliberation
>”No need. I’ll take him. Have you all decided on method of payment?”
>”Yes Ma’am. I’ll take the cash payout. And my partner will have the…”
>”Lifetime of free Bearstein’s ice cream please!”
>Her lips curl into a smug smile
>”Glad to see another happy customer. I’ll hook you up with the proper channels. No more than a gallon a day though, don’t try to take advantage of me. You…wouldn’t like that.”
>”Of course not ma’am! Thank you ma’am.”
>”I believe we’re done here then. Pleasure working with you. Now get the hell off my ship.”
>”Right away!”
>The men behind me scamper off and the bear turns to the captain
>”Set in a course for home and take us away. I want to be sipping cocktails on my beach by sundown.” She orders
>”Of course Ms. Bearstein.” He replies, moving to one of the consoles
>She then turns to me, my blood running cold as her emotionless dark eyes run over my body
>She reaches down and tears the duct tape off my mouth
>”P-please! Don’t hurt me!” I plead. “I don’t know what you’re asking but my parents can pay! Please, just let me go and I won’t tell anyone what happened!”
>The bear pauses, a look of amusement appearing on her face
>”Money? I assure you, it isn’t money that I want. And even if I did, your parents couldn’t pay the kinds of sums that I deal in.”
>”Then why am I here? W-what do you want with me?”
>She leans down, a finger holding my chin up so I had no choice but to look at her
>”Do you know who I am?”
>I shake my head
>”No, I don’t.”
>She looks to the floor with a disappointed sigh, then walks to a small freezer on the bridge
>She rummages around, moving wine bottles and iced coffee out of the way until finally pulling a box out
>She moves in front of me and holds the box up to her face
>”Do you recognize me now?”
>I glance between her and the box
>On the box is a young smiling polar holding up a pawful of popsicles in a rainbow of colors
>Near the top of the box in bright pudgy font are the words ‘Bearstein’s Polar Princess Pops!’
>It gradually dawns on me that the young bear on the box is, in fact, the bear standing in front of me
>”You’re…the polar princess?”
>She puts a paw up to her mouth and chortles
>”Yes, about thirty years removed from the bear on the box, but I'm still the polar princess.” She sets the box down on a console. “My father, the founder of the Bearstein Ice Cream Company, put me on the box when he debuted what would become the most popular brand of frozen treats in the world. He raked in billions and left me as the heiress to the family fortune when he died. Since then I’ve been keeping things running, doing my part to keep the family name in good standing and the profits flowing in.”
>I shake my head in confusion
>”And what does this all have to do with me? Why am I here?”
>She leans against a console and crosses her arms
>”I suppose you wouldn’t know, we did try to keep things hush-hush so the media wouldn’t lose their minds, but I recently had a rather messy divorce from my ex-husband.”
>She brings her paw up and looks at it longingly, a small ring of matted fur where a wedding ring once graced her finger plainly visible
>”So? I didn’t have anything to do with it!”
>”It’s not about the divorce, it’s about what happened after. A week after signing the papers I found out that he hooked up with a cute little doe girl half his age, one that he’d been keeping around as ‘work friend’ when we were still together. Hell, maybe a third his age would be more accurate. You could practically still see the white spots on her back!”
>You begin to see where this is going
>”So you kidnapped me to…what? Make him feel jealous? Lady, I’m sure there are plenty of young, attractive guys willing to hook up with you out of their own volition. Lots of guys don’t mind dating, you know, older chicks. No offence.”
>She smiles politely
>”None taken. But can you imagine the media outrage if they found out I was running around robbing cradles? There would be so much gossip, and drama, and nasty rumors spreading like wildfire. I simply couldn’t take the risk. So, I had a few trusted associates acquire you for my own needs.”
>”Please, come on, you can’t do this! It’s illegal!”
>”Illegal?!” She blurts out with a laugh. “Baby, when you get to my level of income illegality is nothing more than a minor annoyance. Right now we’re headed to my own private island where even the omnifur herself couldn’t see what’s going on.”
>”But my family! They’ll know I'm missing! They’ll get the police involved!”
>She waves a paw dismissively
>”Oh don’t worry, I’ve already informed the police on what to do and bribed them to keep their mouths shut. They’ll launch a lengthy investigation, do their due diligence, then a couple weeks from now they’ll discover human remains in the stomach of a large alligator. The lab report will declare that the DNA matches yours, and you’ll go down as nothing more than the victim of yet another wild animal attack. Such a terrible way to go, torn to pieces by a stupid stinking lizard. An absolute tragedy.” She reveals, wiping a faux tear from her eye
>”This is insane. I’ll fight you! Find a way to break free! You can’t keep me as some kind of sex slave forever!”
>”Tut-tut-tut, sex slave is such a crude phrase. I prefer the term ‘plaything’. You’ll be my hot little stud on the island, a plaything of my own to match my ex-husband’s prancing slut. And there won’t be any breaking free for you, oh no. Everyone on this yacht works for me, everyone on my island works for me, and all outgoing and incoming communications are monitored. You know, just to make sure any company secrets aren’t accidentally leaked. Whether you like it or not, you’re mine.”
>”No…but…you can’t…” I trail off, desperate to find some kind of counter
>She turns to the captain
>”How much longer until our arrival?”
>”Six hours at current speed Ms. Bearstein.”
>”Good. I’ll be in my cabin if you need me.”
>She then bends over and cuts the ropes holding my hands and feet together with a mere flick of her curved claws
>”Stand up and follow me.” She orders, a paw held firmly on my shoulder
>Seeing no other option, I comply
>We make our way through the pristine halls of her yacht until coming up on a large oaken door decorated with an intricate carving of an arctic coast
>She turns its gilded doorknob and we step inside
>I'm immediately hit by a wave of cold air, still in nothing but my swimming trunks I can’t help but hold my arms together and shiver
>”Awww, poor baby.” She coos, rubbing my shoulder. “I have to keep it a little chilly in here, even though I get my fur cut every week I still need a place to cool down from time to time. And don’t worry, you’ll be warmed up soon enough.”
>As we move through her quarters the first word that comes to mind is ‘luxurious’, fine wood, white marble, gilded accents, the whole place must take up an entire deck of the yacht
>We make our way past her kitchen, living room, and library, until finally coming up on her bedroom
>She closes the door behind us and finally takes her paw off my shoulder
>Her opulent bed takes up most of the floorspace, the cottony blanket spread across it bearing the logo for the Bearstein Ice Cream Company
>”Take your bathing suit off. I want to sample you before we arrive at the island.” The bear orders
>”You don’t mean-“
>”Yes, I do mean.” She fires back. “We’re in the middle of the open ocean so don’t even think about getting snippy with me. Get naked boy, you don’t have anything I haven’t seen before.”
>My cheeks redden and a knot forms in my chest
>As much as I want to resist she seems to be the one holding all the cards right now
>So I slip my swimming trunks off and silently shiver as she undresses
>First she unbuttons her dress shirt revealing a lacy black bra holding up her sizable bust
>Then she slips off her skirt, her black panties now the only thing between me and a lifetime of unwanted memories
>With a wiggle in her hips she steps closer and waves a paw down her body
>”What do you think? It isn’t often young guys like you get to see the sensual body of a mature polar bear, much less one who’s net worth rivals small countries.”
>”You look beautiful.” I force out
>She puts a bashful paw to her chest
>”Aww, thank you. I’ve come a long way since I was a little cub posing for a stupid ice popsicle box. What’s the phrase? Aged like wine?”
>I quickly nod in agreement
>”Yes, you’ve aged like wine.”
>”Good. Now get over and pull my panties down for me.”
>”W-why?”
>”Sex is a mighty boring thing when only one party’s motivated to participate. Trust me, my ex was a limp fish in bed and there’s nothing worse than a selfish lover. So get over here and show me you’re at least the slightly bit motivated.”
>Resigned to my fate, I walk forward
>”Kneel.” She commands, and I get on my knees in front of her
>I put my hands up to her panties and-
>”No, with your teeth.” She says with a devious smile
>I groan internally and lean forward, biting down on her panties and lowering them down until they touched the floor
>As soon as I straighten my back I feel a paw grip the backside of my head and she shoves me into her crotch
>My face is covered in soft fur and slivers of warm flesh, a slightly musky scent invading my nostrils
>”Mmmmm…” She moans in delight. “Finally a new face to see between my legs. And even better, one that has no choice but to be there!”
>She then leans down and grabs me by the shoulders, easily tossing me onto the bed
>Before I have time to come to my senses she’s already on the bed towering over me, a foot on either side of my hips
>She puts a finger up to her chin
>”Ya know, there was one position my ex could never do, one he just didn’t have the flexibility for. But for a spring chicken like you…”
>She grabs my legs and pushes them up to my chest, leaning forward so her cunt was right above my…already erect cock
>Thanks teenage hormones
>She then eases down and engulfs my manhood behind a wall of white fur
>I try to steel my nerves and block out the pleasure from her folds gripping my cock but it’s useless
>My own body has betrayed me
>She begins a wild up and down and my cock can’t help but stay rock hard
>With my feet resting against her shoulders I stare at the ceiling, and try to simply pass the time
>What happened after is a blur
>After I came she wasn’t done, so we tried a few other positions
>Sometimes she’d take the lead
>And other times she’d force me to under threat of death
>I seem to recall being forced to lick her cunt while she poured wine over it at some point
>Or at least I think it was wine, the bitter taste of alcohol is still on my tongue as I wake up from a post coitus nap
>Orange light from a dying sun spills in through the cabin windows and as I lean up I see the naked form of Ms. Bearstein laying next to me, leaning up against the headboard
>The blanket is covered in a mixture of fluids, tissues, an empty wine bottle, and a couple popsicle wrappers
>Sitting next to her is a box of polar princess popsicles, that explains the wrappers
>Hearing me move she looks into the box
>”What’s your favorite flavor?” She asks, her voice oddly calm
>”Blueberry.” I shakily respond
>”That’s mine too.” She says with a gentle smile, rummaging around the box and handing me a popsicle
>I take it, but refrain from opening it
>I’m just not in the mood for sweetness
>”Was I your first? And I don’t mean your first polar bear.” She asks
>I stare into my lap in shame
>”Yes, Ms. Bearstein, you were my first.”
>”Thought so. And don’t call me Ms. Bearstein. My employees call me that, my family calls me that, my competition calls me that, you can call me…” She briefly looks to the ceiling in thought. “…you can call me the polar princess from now on. Got it?”
>”I understand, polar princess.”
>With a popsicle stick hanging out of her mouth she gets off the bed and walks to the cabin window, sighing in delight as she takes in the view
>”We’re here.” She states
>”Where?” I ask, mind still cloudy after waking up
>She pulls the bare popsicle stick out of her mouth
>”The island, my home. And now yours too.”

>I want to pin his limbs with a monstrous strength that surprises him. Maybe we're rough-housing. The mood is playful and flirtatious, but he's never been overpowered before; when his muscles strain against mine, when he fails to shove me off or break the hold my cudgel of a fist has on his forearm, he realizes for the first time what it feels like to be powerless in the grip of something that could really hurt him. My monstrous mouth is itself as much a tool as my hands. It can hang over him threateningly, sharp teeth gleaming wet when my lips curl back. He knows my animal mouth can damage him, but it can also be used so softly on his body.
>I don't mean to say that I want to rape someone. I want this hypothetical man to feel a thrill of fear, excitement, and uncertainty in my arms. (He's in over his head! He didn't realize I was so much stronger. What if he said no? Would I respect it? What if I'm rougher than he hoped?) I don't want him to be so terrified that he's repulsed by me, but I'd like to unbalance him. Make him feel small. I want to handle his body like its a toy – push him onto his back on the bed, pin his arm over his head, grasp a thigh and spread his legs for me. Not meanly, but with authority. Every action communicates my desire for him, and expects that he reciprocates that desire without asking. My judgment is enough for both of us.
>I want that blushing red penis to point stiffly up at me from between his thighs, bobbing while he squirms under the hands that pin him. I'm going to straddle him and sit right down on that. You can't imagine how good it feels to have that hard, warm flesh sliding in and filling you up. With each movement I can feel him rubbing my passage over every inch. When I squeeze down on the cock inside I can feel it even better; for that instant I tighten up, it feels so much bigger and so much harder. I'm wet, full, and it's bliss.

>"another"
>the smartly dressed wolf in a button-up and vest shoots you a concerned look from across the bar
>"alright skinny, but after this I'm cutting you off."
>you grumble and lay your stack of bills down on the counter
>more than enough to cover your tab, and a generous tip for the friendly bartender
>she places the glass she was wiping underneath the counter and begins mixing your sixth cocktail of the night
>you keep your gaze on the wooden finish of the bar to avoid the concerned stares other patrons shoot you
>you shouldn't be surprised, you can't imagine they get many humans here in 'The Wolf Den'
>especially not ones that only seem content destroying their liver at the bar
>but this was the closest watering hole to you and after tonight you needed a drink in a social setting
>the bartender slides your drink to you before taking your cash graciously
>you're pretty sloshed at this point when you hear her whistle to someone and then not so subtly gesture at you with her head
>you see a furred mass approaching you from the corner of your eye
>"How we doin' humie?" The newcomer greets you with a hand on your shoulder
>a muscular grey wolf in a tank top and jeans
>"ya know... Usually bucks like you are smart enough to not wander into a den of hunters~" she continues, sliding her hand down your back and tracing a finger towards the base of your spine
>"So wha'? Ya' wanna take me home and fuck me?" your slurred response comes as quickly as your soaked mind allows
>this catches the flirty wolf off guard, she withdraws her hand and shoots a questioning look at the bartender, who just shrugs in response
>"Uh... Wha-... Y-yes?" she stutters out, confused
>"Lets just go then... Lets just go..." You slur, putting your head in your hands, barely holding back a choked sob
>"I-I uh..." The grey wolf is at a loss for words, sounding much less confident
>she mouths a silent question to the barkeep, who responds by raising all five fingers
>the wolf at your back gives a low whistle of astonishment before patting you on the back and taking the bar stool beside you
>"So skinny... Why don't you tell me why you're really here?" She says, her playful flirting tone replaced with a much more serious one
>in your desperate drunken state you can't help but spill your guts to the concerned stranger
>"She dumped me... After 4 loving years she dumped me like a pile of garbage..."
>a look of realization dawns on the wolf's face and she takes a long inhale
>"Oh- you poor thing. H-hey, you wanna come hang with me and my friends? It'd be a lot better than drinking alone, we're fun gals!" She musters with the enthusiasm of a mother trying to console a crying child
>not too far off from how you actually felt right now
>"Whate- *hicup!* whatever..."
>"C'mon big guy, you look like you could use some friends right now" the wolf says as she drapes your arm over her neck
>you giggle drunkenly at the idea of being called 'big guy' by a wolf twice your size, you mood already swinging back to hazy mirth
>she seems to realize the size difference as well as she goes to stand and nearly lifts you out of your seat
>"Hmm" she hums to herself for a moment before putting you back down
>the grey wolf withdraws a few bills from her wallet and slides them across the bar
>she mouths a thanks to the bartender, who winks back at her in return
>then she takes your already forgotten drink and slams it
>you hardly notice in your slumped state, the previous drinks already catching up to you
>"alright, up you go" she says, and your suddenly flipped on your side as you're hoisted into a bridal carry
>suddenly you're moving through the bar, your destination unknown in your impared frame of mind
>you think you can hear a few more wolf-whistles from other patrons as you're carried through the bar
>you feel so secure in the grasp of this strange wolf
>"Y-your so *hic!* strong" you muse
>"careful dude, we might not make it back to the booth if you keep talkin' like that." She responds, you feel her flex a little at the remark. Her hard muscle straining under her soft coat of fur
>before you know it, you see yourself approaching a corner booth with six... Or maybe it's three? Wolves sitting at it
>a series of 'oohs' and 'ahhs' rise from the table as you both approach
>"awww! Cute!"
>"there was a human in here!?"
>"nice catch Deb! Where'd you find him?"
>"Girls, this is-- Uh..." The grey wolf, 'Deb' you're assuming, stops, realizing she never got your name
>"Anon" you mumble, already having closed your eyes and barely paying attention to the conversation
>"Anon" Deb continues "he got dumped, so he's gonna spend some time with us tonight, be nice."
>the trio pipes up again
>"Oh no!"
>"that's so sad!"
>"ooooh, single!" comes the last response, along with a new wandering furry hand creeping up your arm
>you feel it quickly swatted away by Deb's arm looped around your back
>"Hey! Easy! He's not feeling well right now." Deb growls, pausing for a moment to readjust you in her grip. "Besides, when he sobers up tomorrow. He's mine first"
>"wha- *hic* what was that?" You ask, no longer paying attention to the conversation
>"Nothing, dude. Why don't you get some shut-eye? We'll keep you safe while you sleep off your woes"
>a nap? That sounded nice...
>you feel yourself being flipped upright and slid into the booth next to the pack of wolves
>Deb slides in after you and soon your surround in a blanket of fur, pressing on you from both sides
>you feel a muscular arm snake around your back and pull you into Deb's side
>your head lands on a soft pillowy surface and you sink into it
>you're already starting to feel a little better as a chorus of muffled giggles and coos lull you to sleep

>You try to keep your composure

>”i said both eyes anon! How can i hypnotize you if you’re keeping one eye shut?”
>you can feel your eyes open unconsciously, as if your own body was in on putting you under her spell
>”thats a good boy. Now keep your eyes on the birdie”
>how could you not? With herself positioned over you, her soft feathery breasts swaying with each swing of that golden pendulum. How could you ever look away from the pretty bird?
>you couldn’t, you didn’t want to
>”thats it, just keep watching. It feels good to let go doesn’t it?” She leaned back, letting her crotch grind down onto your hips as you felt yourself stare and stare at her
>the prettiest bird with the softest feathers and the nicest golden gleaming eyes

>She sits in her chair like always after getting home and waits for you to stop what you're doing to take care of her
>You know your place, so she doesn't even have to say anything
>A few seconds later you're on your knees right in front of your anthro wife
>Like always, your pants and underwear are off, so she can see how your body reacts to the scent and sight of her feet
>First you gently grab her foot and start kissing the top of it for a few seconds until she raises it a bit
>It means you're allowed to taste her soles now
>Your lips press against her warm sole, giving it a nice long kiss while she slips the other heel off and pushes it into your hand
>Usually she wants you to focus on making out with her feet before the foot rub, but it seems like today was a bit tough for her
>You're a good husband, so you start gently rubbing her tired sole during the make-out session
>Your wife lets out a quiet moan and closes her eyes
>That's the moment you switch feet and let the other one feel your lips too

>Your anthro wife taught you well how important it is to not be selfish during those foot worship sessions over the years
>She can feel your desperation in your tongue and your fingers
>"Good boy, very good boy. Just focus on my toes for a bit longer, and I'll let you mate with my feet again"
>Jerking off while both of her feet are resting on your face feels amazing, but getting to fuck them?
>You instantly start sucking on her toes, one by one
>Every one of her toes stays in your mouth for half a minute, so your tongue can rub against it from every side
>Your erection starts twitching again as you think about fucking the feet that own you
>She's looking right at you, enjoying every second of her submissive husband worshiping the lower body part there is
>It must give her so much satisfaction to spend all day running after and catching those untrained human criminals, only to get home and enjoy the sight of her tamed husband licking the soles of her feet
>Now that both of her feet are nice and slippery, you can claim your reward
>She puts her soles together, so they're next to each other, creating a small gap between her soles
>You lay down on the floor and position yourself in a way where your cock is directly under her feet
>The first thrust is always the most intense one, especially after making out with her soles for so long
>It's hard to control yourself, but it feels so fucking good to slide your hard cock between those soft slippery soles
>You try your best to slow down a bit and make your reward last a bit longer
>It doesn't take you long to hit the edge
>You instantly freeze for a few seconds knowing your cock is so close to giving up
>Her soles are wrapped tightly around your cock, your wife could easily wiggle her toes or squeeze her feet a bit tighter to make you spill your seed
>You look at the anthro above you and see that smug grin on her muzzle
>Oh no
>"P-Please honey, just a little longer! Please!" You squeal as she reaches down for one of her worn heels
>"I beg you please, I need-" You can't even finish as she places her right heel over your face
>She doesn't want to be the one telling you to finish early
>She wants it to be your own choice
>For your addiction to her scent to take over
>Your nose ends up inside of her heel, right at the spot on the insole where her toes stay at for at least 8 hours a day, five days a week
>It's like something in your brain snaps, you can't even control your hips anymore
>You start fucking that footpussy again, but this time without slowing down or being careful at all
>You can't say no to that scent you love so much
>It feels so good to stop yourself
>You love her so much
>You love sliding your cock between her feet until they're both covered in your fat load
>and that's exactly what happens
>With the last thrust you empty your balls all over both of her feet
>You can still see her smiling at you, knowing it's always the same thing that gets you cumming early
>She gently squeezes your balls with her toes to make sure they're all nice and empty
>It's so hard to get up from the floor, but you know you need to clean them up
>Maybe next time you last a little bit longer

>"I was scared of Annie because she jumped at me!"
>Annie looks like she's going to pounce again
>but one of the disembodied paws holds her back
>the narrator chuckles

>Annie nods her head vigorously
>"And if you like him, you want him to be happy don't you?"
>Annie looks confused, scratching her chin with a claw
>then she smiles
>"Yes!"
>"Did Hugh look very happy when you pounced him?"
>Annie looks over at Hugh
>he's still frowning
>"No."
>Annie's ears droop dramatically and she whines
>"No. Humans are sensitive, Annie. Even if you like them very much you have to be careful, especially when he's not your husband."
>Annie pipes up
>"Yet!"
>the narrator chuckles again
>"Of course, he's not your husband yet. And until he is, you shouldn't be pouncing on him."
>Hugh breaks into a smug grin and sticks out his tongue at Annie
>"Now Hugh," the narrator chastises, "You know that Annie likes you very much."
>Hugh nods his head
>"But you did something wrong too. You fought back."
>Hugh gasps and furrows his brow
>the narrator continues
>"You know Annie is bigger and stronger than you. Anthros are bigger and stronger than humans."
>Annie flexes an arm
>"So when you're scared, or an anthro you don't know is touching you, fighting back may mean you get hurt even worse."
>Hugh looks over at Annie, terrified
>she blows kisses
>"Now, Annie is a good girl, but sometimes there are bad girls. When you think you're in trouble, don't fight. Flee. Find your mom, or an anthro you can trust like your local Safety Officer, so she can protect you."

>Hugh dashes to hide behind them
>Annie looks dismayed
>"Let's try that again. Annie, do you think you could show Hugh you like him without scaring him?"
>Annie scratches her chin again
>and then a light bulb lights up over her head with a 'ding!'
>she runs over to Hugh's side
>he flinches and hides behind the officer's legs again
>but Annie just offers her paw
>Hugh looks at it
>then steps out of hiding to hold it
>Annie smiles
>and then gives Hugh another lick across the face
>Hugh blushes
>the narrator gives another warm laugh
>"That's more like it. I'm glad you two could learn about boundaries. Tune in next week to learn about the different kinds of work in the State of Bismarck, and what every citizen does to keep the lights on, and food on your table!"

>"Easy now. There's lots of jobs that need doing. Depending on what you excel in, you could be...a farmer."
>Annie's plain clothes suddenly change to denim overalls and a flannel shirt, she holds a pitchfork and wears a straw hat
>a chicken struts by, and she goes to chase it
>"Or a soldier."
>Annie now wears a green uniform and a combat helmet
>she has a cork-gun in her paws
>the little cartoon wolf snaps a salute
>"Or a construction worker."
>her outfit changes again, a worker's jumpsuit under a safety vest
>her ears folded under a yellow hard-hat
>the jackhammer in her paws suddenly springs to life, and she bounces around erratically
>"Or even, a State Inspector."
>Annie pops back to her normal clothes with a gasp
>"An Inspector? Really?"
>the narrator responds
>"Only if you're diligent in your studies, respect your teachers, and work very, very hard. Inspectors are the eyes and ears of the Governing Council itself, and help keep all the parts of the State running smoothly."
>Annie looks starry eyed as the narrator continues
>"But remember, whatever you do, you must work your hardest to be the very best at it you can be. One day the state will rely on anthros like Annie to keep the lights on, food on our tables, and our borders safe."
>the screen turns over to Hugh, who looks equally excited
>"And what do I get to do, Inspector?"
>"You have a very special job as well. A job only humans can do."
>Hugh bounces in place excitedly
>"You get to be a husband."
>Hugh deflates, his excitement turning to a frown
>"A husband? Why does Annie get to do all the cool things?"
>the narrator tuts chidingly
>"Being a husband and father is a very special job, Hugh."
>"A husband's job is to marry an anthro, and help her make a big happy family."
>a pram stuffed full of cartoon wolf babies rolls up beside Hugh
>"And a father's job is to raise that family to make more hard working anthros, and diligent humans for the next generation. Hugh, when you're having dinner, who cooks for the whole family?"
>Hugh taps his finger for a moment
>"My dad!"
>"And when you do your homework, who's there to help you with the math questions?"
>a knowing smile cross Hugh's face
>"My dad is!"
>"And who teaches you right from wrong, watches over you, and reads you bed-time stories?"
>Hugh beams
>"My dad!"
>the inspector's voice is bright with praise
>"That's right! Being a husband and a father is a big responsibility, and just as important as being a soldier, or a farmer, or a construction worker."
>the camera pulls out to show Annie and Hugh on screen
>"So kids, what do you want to be when you grow up?"
>Annie throws up her paw
>"An inspector!"
>Hugh also raises his hand
>"A father!"
>the narrator chuckles warmly
>"Very good! Be sure to work your hardest, do your best, and you'll find the perfect job to serve the State. Tune in next time where we'll learn about the history of the State of Bismarck!"
>Annie and Hugh wave goodbye at the screen as 'THE END' shows up over their heads

>play as a female
>get to fight and kill and be killed like normal
>play as male
>not allowed to engage in pvp
>only allowed to play support
>instead of being killed you get "knocked out"
>bard class gets swapped for what's basically a battle stripper/cheerleader

>be a traveling merchant
>a horrible snowstorm hit you as you traveled across skyrim
>lost your horse and most of your product
>stumble to the nearest inn and burst through the door with a gasp
>"Come in traveler, take a seat by the--"
>you throw yourself in front of the firepit
>don't even bother with a seat
>just curl up and shiver
>damn this cold northern country
>you're suddenly poked with something blunt
>the hostess is jabbing you with the end of her broom
>"Hey you lout. You'd better by something or get out."
>you look up
"Have pity. All my coin is lost. Just a night by the fire, please."
>the hostess scowls
>"Does this look like a poorhouse? If you can't pay then get out."
>another voice interrupts
>"Khajiit will pay for the human."
>you sit up further to look across the common room
>in the back corner, two sets of glowing eyes stare back at you
>you can't make out more but you recognize the accents
>the hostess turns to the unseen khajiit
>"And who is he to you, cat? I told you not to make trouble."
>there's some snickering, and another voice responds
>if the first was warm, this one is cold
>sly and with a teasing lilt
>"This one makes no trouble. The human is merely khajiit's client."
>there's a hissing exchange from the shadows and the first voice continues
>"Yes. This one is a mercenary. She is hired to protect the nord and his money."
>the hostess glares
>then grunts and glances down to speak to you
>"Fine. But you're responsible if they steal anything."
>she marches off back to the bar
>you pull yourself off the floor and stagger over to the corner
>"The human is very cold, yes?"
>peer through the dark and see a khajiit seated at a table
>tawny-furred, with golden eyes
>she's clad in steel-plate armor
>"And he is alone, without money."
>her companion, grey-furred with ice-blue eyes purrs in her teasing inflection
>this one wears robes
>she snickers
>"Khajiit thinks this is not a smart way to travel."
>you hold up your hands
"I cannot pay you. My caravan is lost."
>both of them snicker
>they have another quick conversation in their strange tongue
>the grey one lashes her tail and leans back in her chair
>the orange one takes your wrist and pulls you down into the one empty stool at the table
>"Sit human. Khajiit has a proposition for him."
>you think you like the orange one better
>she's forceful yes, but her smile seems more genuine
>the grey one seems almost...
>hungry
>"This one knows he does have money. But in Skyrim, he has something of much value."
>the orange one gestures at you
>"He is human. He is allowed in places khajiit cannot go. Cities. Halls. Temples."
>the grey one leans forward and puts a paw over your hand
>her claws digging into the wood
>"Khajiit needs his handsome face."
>the orange one hisses
>and there's another short exchange you cannot understand
>the grey one rolls her icy eyes and releases your hand
>only for that paw to replaced by an orange one
>"So an exchange, yes? The human will go with khajiit, and will let khajiit in nice places. Big shops, new work, and nice fancy inns. Not like cold drafty hovel."
>she makes no attempt to lower her voice as she disparages the inn
>it is cold, despite the fire on the other side of the room
>"And khajiit will protect him. Take him place to place. Pay for his bed."
>sounds too good to be true
>they're probably sneak-thieves of some kind
>but you can't turn them down
"Fine. It's a deal."
>the orange khajiit smiles wide
>and grasps your hand tighter
>"Good! Oh, but there is one more thing khajiit asks."
>you suddenly feel arms snaking around your chest from behind
>a rumbling purr in your ear
>Shor's bones!
>you didn't even notice the grey one sneaking up on you
>the orange one goes on explaining as the grey one's paws explore your body
>rubbing your chest and drawing claws down to your belly
>"It is cold. Too cold for khajiit. Handsome human must share his warmth. And perhaps more..."

Wealthy executive anthro milfs eating sushi off of a smooth-shaved barely legal human teen

>All you knew is that they pay quite a lot of money for a single "session", you just have to shave all of your body hair below your nose and send them a few pictures
>They actually double the payment if it's your 18th birthday for some reason
>Another reason to give it a try..
>You do need some money, so why not give it a chance? What could go wrong?
>A few days later you find yourself all naked, lying on your stomach with some anthro lady putting some sushi on your back
>"Don't move until they're finished, do what they say, and don't speak unless spoken to"
>Before you can ask about anything else, the anthro exits the room, leaving you naked and covered in some expensive seafood
>A few minutes later, some three women enter the room and sit on the couch in front of you
>They keep talking about their businesses, but you can't really understand most of what they're saying
>It feels a bit weird how they don't pay any attention to you, it's like your whole existence is limited to being a big human plate for those wealthy anthro ladies
>At some point, one of the anthros accidentally drops a piece of seafood
>It lands right behind your armpit
>Oh no
>A pair of chopsticks fishes the sushi out but not without making you silently giggle, causing your body to twitch a few times
>They stop talking, but hopefully only for a few seconds, so maybe they haven't noticed
>Unlucky for you, every piece of food from that point gets dragged across your naked back before disappearing
>It's like they're doing that on purpose
>It's so hard not to laugh when they rub your sides with something cold or with a few pairs of chopsticks at the same time
>At some point you can't take it anymore and accidentally let out a quiet giggle
>They all stop talking at that moment
>"I don't know about you, but I'm still hungry. Let's get some more. Oh, and this time we should flip him over, this one sounds adorable~"

>instead of monster hunter it's monster baiter
>trained to withstand the mating sessions of ferocious horny she-beasts
>hired to distract or be "sacrificed" to the monsters when they start causing trouble because it's mating season and/or they're just horny
>the drugs and potions are still in, but are more geared towards stamina, elemental resistance, antidotes, and lots of water/general just fluid replenishment
>still wear armor that's themed off the monsters since it's visual flirting by saying you're dressed just like her
>instead of weapons they wield sextoys to hopefully satisfy the monsters before they decide to just turn the guys into sextoys

>you both make eye contact
>she smiles and says something in a new language you've never heard before
>she puts the shiny branch she was holding down, and pulls from her pocket a stick that points in all directions and urges you to take it
>as soon as you close in to do so you feel a cold clamp shut around your neck
>connected to it was a black vine that led to this new creature's hand
>she starts tugging for you to follow

>See a boar women walking down the street
>She's wearing a short coat with legs covered in fishnet stockings
>Her tusks are finely polished and lips are blood red, she's obviously an anthro whore
>Shout at her that she's a fat fucking sow who shouldn't come to this side of humie town
>She oinks back that stupid humies shouldn't threaten superior species
>Tell her to go back to whatever barn she crawled out of
>She tells me to run home to my furless skank of a mother
>I smash a beer bottle against a wall and point the sharp end towards her
>She pulls out a switchblade
>?????????????????
>Wake up in a dingy little apartment bedroom
>We're both naked and each of her teats is surrounded by my own dried saliva
>I slip my hand between her legs to feel a mixture of grool and cum
>Guess I'm mommy's little bacon boy now

>RadAway weakens your sperm cells a bit so it takes way more than just one breeding session to knock her up
>After your 5th orgasm you're shooting blanks so she lets you rest for the rest for the night
>Hugs you close and waraps one of her hand around you
>It's the first time you hear a deathclaw's heart beating right next to your ear
>Maybe your new life won't be so bad?

>Math is next period
>Where the hell did you put that textbook?
>Bell rings
>Fuck
>Still rummaging through the back of the locker
>That's when you hear them
>That obnoxious gaggle of girls
>You shudder
>Why'd they have to run out of space in the male locker rooms?
>Why'd your locker have to be in here
>You keep your head down
>You don't want to be teased again, you're not sure you can take it today
>"Hey nonny!"
>A padded palm smacks your up-facing butt
>They all start to snicker when you yelp and nearly collapse into your own locker
>"Oh gawd, Christie that was mean!"
>One of the girls whines through a giggle, she grabs your arm and helps you to your feet.
>"Tammy's in looooove" Christie taunts
>The two glare at eachother for a second while the rest of the volleyball team starts opening up their own lockers
>It's a menegerie of species, all slim, athletic, dripping with sweat, fur all styled up in wacky ways
>Some of them are panting in a way that just makes you blush
>You avert your eyes
"I... I just need a book is all. Then I'll be gone"
>You mumble but you're tugged on again
>Oh no it's Christie again
>That 6'5 cheetah girl smirks down at you, you can't help but feel like you're shrinking under her gaze
>"You don't have to leave so soon, 'non, It's not like you're super threatening or anything"
>You don't know how you feel about that.
>Another girl calls from your left but you can't see here behind your locker's door "Yeah it's nice havin' something to look at"
>There's a wave of snickers and giggles
>You're practically frozen, trapped in this room of half-naked hormonal furry bodies
>All pouring with pheromones
>"Hah, I think he's broken"
>Christie tugs you into a big sweaty hug
>You can feel your shirt staining
>A tongue smacks your forehead, then she pulls back
>The cheetah gives you a wink, and her canine friend Tammy shoots you an apologetic glance.
>You leave without finding the book
############
>3 Days Later
############
>"Hey Anon!"
>You'd recognize that voice anywhere.
"Oh, uh, hey Christie"
>Your gaze darts to her shoulders but you don't dare look in her eyes
>She smirks
>"You're always so tense, dude"
>"Anyway, you've got a free period today right? Why don't you come down and watch me and the gals demolish?"
>You accidentally look at her face
>A blush hits you like a truck, your lungs seize
"Ah... you mean like, watch your volleyball match?"
>She puts a paw on your shoulder, you notice how tight-fitting her uniform is
>The cheetah snickers "It's not like you're goin' to death row Anon"
"Sorry I'm just"
>"Distracted and nervous? As always?" Her grip releases. "c'mon, it'll be fun! Plus you can oggle us without feeling shy about it"
"Wha!?"
>You stiffened, your eyes were locked with hers now
>She was grinning from ear to ear
>Then she started laughing
>You wanted the ground to erupt beneath your feet right then and there
>"Calm down dude" she teased through a bout of snickering, gripping your arm when she saw you wobble on your feet.
>"I know it's gotta be a little weird for you, being assigned the girls' locker and all"
>"Honestly we don't mind the attention, well most of us. Don't look at Melinda, she'll rip your throat out"
>You gulp
>"Oh yeah! And Tammy said she wants to see you after school, but she's too shy to ask"
>/SHE'S TOO SHY?/
"Uhm... okay. I'll be there. F-for both"
>Christie beams
>"Awesome, seeya after the match then!"
>She's walking away when she swivels back and asks, "Oh and try to video some kick-ass volleys, yeah?"
>The bell rings
>English... And you've got a test.
>How are you gonna think straight now?

>Barge into the Ultra-Luxe
>Lay down an entire box of caps
"I'll book your wildest hooker for the night, please."
>Get escorted to a suite
>Waiting for you is a massive deathclaw
>She's laid back on the creaking bed with her legs spread and arms behind her head
>Each muscular thigh is thicker than your torso
>Her crotch is a deep, drooling slit in those armored scales
>"So, I get to have you all night, huh?"
>The lizard's scratchy growling voice shocks you to your bones
>The door slams and locks behind you
>"You paid for it!" squeaks a voice from the hallway
>Your paid-for comfort beckons you with a curling of her murderous talon
>"Don't keep me waiting, sugar. I'm ~starved~ for touch"
>You drop your clothes and head into battle

>God your tongue hurt.
>How long had you been at this?
>Her thighs were still clenched at your waist
>And the occasional grunt or squeeze of her tail around the back of your neck let you know you were doing something right.
>Still.
>This was more exhausting than you'd been expecting
>Your lips smooched the vixen's quivering pucker
>She'd started so tight when you began
>You could barely stick a finger in without her squirming
>But once you lubed her up with your tongue she loosened up pretty quickly
>After just a few minutes it was easy to dig that flexing muscle deep into her tailhole
>She seemed to like that, given the chitters and groans
>You let your hand focus on her womanhood
>A couple fingers slipped in deep while your thumb played with her clitoris
>That was like an hour ago now
>Her juices were dripping down your arm
>Your tongue desperately wanted to quit
>You curled your tongue and dug your fingers in against her walls
>Oh she was satisfied alright, it's just that she was a glutton for pleasure.
>Any time you tried to pull back she squeezed her legs or pushed her butt back into your face
>10 more minutes past, with your spit drooling down her backside
>Your tongue wriggling in and slurping out of that tight tunnel
>Your pruned fingers scraping every corner of her pink depths
>Then suddenly
>"Annh... Fuck... that feels so good..."
>This was it, you were free!
>But... then why was she..?
>The plump vixen pushed her paws against the bed
>She fell backwards, right on top of you
>Your eyes shut tight as your face was swallowed by her chubby bronze cheeks
"Mmph!"
>You tried to protest, but her pucker had clenched your tongue hard
>"Shhhh." She snapped
>"Tongue back in"
>You whimpered, but obeyed.
>"Thaaats a good boy..." her whisper made you feel all tingly
>Beyond the veil of her buttocks she pulled your legs out so you were laying flat beneath her
>Then she laid her paws on your crotch
>The paw pads gently ground against your boxer-bound manhood
>"You want a footjob?" she asked
"Mrmh! Mhm!"
>You gave her some excited tongue wriggles and a fierce rubbing of her clit to say 'yes'
>Your vixen mistress giggled
>"Another hour under me, then you can cum all over my toes"
>A mixed sense of despair and determination filled you
>Your face hurt
>Your tongue burned
>Your brain was doing the best it could with a vixen-musk adulterated air supply
>This was going to be a loooong hour.

>Her getting too drunk and getting more frisky in turn
>The party gets a bit out of hand
>She starts talking about how obedient and caring you are
>You've never seen Stella drink so much in such a good mood
>"Its MY fuuuucking pethusband and I'll do wahta I want with himmm! Comme heree"
>She starts making out with you in front of her guests
>You can feel yourself getting tipsy just from those messy kisses
>Hopefully the guests left right before she started riding your face
>You lick her to orgasm and help her get ready to bed afterwards
>Once in bed Stella says she needs you to cuddle with her until she falls asleep
>The last thing she says before blacking out is how happy she is you're still around

>"Anon, we know you were involved"
>"We found traces of coke in your hair when we were processing you"
>The bunny was smug
>She'd just spent two hours letting you spin up a story
>She asked you details
>Checked for clarifications
>Made small talk
>All to crash you down to this moment
>Your meager confidence faltered
>Blank expression breaking into a frown
>All of the sudden your mouth was dry
>"Now, we know there were more people involved. Clearly you're not smart enough to hatch a scheme like this"
>That smug little interrogator leaned over the desk
>She tapped her stupid carrot pen down on the plastic surface
>Then she leaned back in her chain.
>"All we're askin' for is a few names, maybe a location or two"
>"If you're cooperative you could see your sentence reduced or even dropped if it's found you were coerced."
>You gulp, but you can't lather up any saliva
"I... I want a lawyer"
>Your mumbling catches her in a snicker
>"Oh come now, Anon, don't be like that! We were just gettin' to know eachother!"
>She threw her feet up on the table
>Her boots thudded.
"I don't have to talk anymore"
>"Yeah, sure, you don't. But right now you've dug yourself into a pretty deep fuckin' hole."
>She kicked one of her shoes off
>"You're lookin' at up to 15 years here, maybe 6 with good behavior"
>The other shoe thudded off the table
>That smug little cunt rolled off her sweaty socks and, using her toes, tossed them towards you.
"Wh- What are you-"
>"Got a paw fetish, don't ya? We searched your phone. I know you find this distracting"
>You felt sick
>What else had she seen...
>"Calm your nerves, how about a trade? You get to lick my paws and in exchange, I get information"
"I'm not a rat"
>Your nervous voice chokes
>"Aww, poor humie"
>She wriggles her toes
>You tug forward but your hands are beneath the bolted-down chair
>"Don't you want a little... lick?"
>Her foot loomed in front of your exhausted, desperate eyes
>Your tongue wavered out from your parched lips.
>"Uh uh!" Her feet pulled back
>"Give me a name first"
>You gasped
>Your mouth opened again
>This time you spilled your guts.

>Be anon
>went out to the club on the weekend
>not your usual scene, but it might be fun
>tons of bodies bouncing, dancing, grinding
>humans and anthros alike partying
>it's overwhelming at first
>but then you get a couple drinks in you and start to bounce along to the music
>you're still hanging by the wall when you feel something tug your wrist
>it's an anthro
>a hyena woman
>dressed to party, crop-top and daisy-dukes with plenty of jewelry
>she's giggling
>"Hey! Come dance with us!"
>right behind her, leaning on her shoulder is another hyena, dressed similar
>the second is a bit shorter, though they're both way taller than you
>she cackles and leans forward
>"You're too cute to be dancing alone!"
>you try to pull back your hand
>she's strong
"I'm sorry, I have a girlfriend!"
>the hyenas look at each other and break into a shared cackle
>"Dude it's fine!"
>she tugs your wrist again
>and the other hyena comes around behind you to hold your shoulder
>"It's just a little dancing! Totally fine."
>you really don't think you have much of a choice
>and it's probably fine
>just a little dancing
>"Why don't I get us some more drinks and then we can have some fun!"
>the yeen at your back snickers and presses her snout against your ear so she doesn't have to shout over the music
>"I'm Kerry."
>she points across the dance floor
>"And that's my friend Cassy!"
>Cassy has returned with drinks in paw
>you're handed something bubbly and neon-blue
>"Cheers!"
>whatever she got you, it tastes like cotton candy
>you drink a healthy gulp
>then Kerry reaches around you to tip the glass up
>forcing you to drink more
>Cassy snorts and cackles
>"C'mon! No lightweights! We're partying!"
>you cough and splutter when the glass is pulled away empty
>you're slapped on the back and dragged toward the center of the dance floor as you try to regain your breath
>Cassy giggles and starts to bounce along to the beat in front of you
>you feel Kerry's hot breath on your neck
>"Now dance!"
>you bounce along to the music
>not exactly graceful, but you manage not to make a fool of yourself
>your new dance partners grin and dance along
>bouncing and swinging with the crowd
>but man
>that drink is starting to affect you
>whatever it was, it's strong
>you feel loose and free
>Cassy barks and whoops
>"Yeah! Go humie!"
>you try to do a move you saw on TV
>instead you trip on your own feet and almost fall over
>you're lifted immediately
>Cassy grabs your shoulders while Kerry lifts you from behind
>you're pressed back against the hyena's body
>holy shit those are her tits
>smushed against your back
>she shifts her body a bit and you find your body moving with her
>Cassy holds your shoulders and steps closer
>"Careful!"
>Kerry cackles
>"Looks like that drink was a little strong. Don't worry baby, we'll hold you up."
>you don't like that idea
>but they're already dancing again
>more like grinding against you
>the hyena in front with her hands on your shoulders and her hips bumping against yours in time to the beat
>behind you the other holds you up from under your arms
>her paws sliding over your chest and abdomen as forces you to sway with her body
>you a great deal drunker than you expected to be
>you so you just kind of bob your head along while Kerry and Cassy force your body to move
>"Now that's more like it!"
>Cassy grabs your head
>then your face is engulfed by her tits
>you're completely sandwiched between two strange anthros who go on bumping and grinding and cackling
"Mmph!"
>this is going too far
>it probably went to far five minutes ago
>you try to raise a protest but it's muffled under yeen tits
>you struggle against the hyena girls
>they just go on laughing and dancing
>like they don't even notice you putting up a fight
>until--
>"Oh shit!"
>Cassy grabs your shoulders and pulls back
>"Fuckin' finally!"
>Kerry leans her head over her shoulder
>"What? What is it?"
>Cassy grabs your crotch
>"Boner city baby!"
>oh fuck
>it's not your fault
>what are you supposed to do when you're smothered in yeen titties, with paws all over you, and a yeen grinding on your crotch?
>your face flushes
>Kerry gasps and bursts into fiendish giggly
>"Omygod that's so cute! Take it out!"
>Cassy starts undoing your belt
>you try to push her away
>but Kerry grabs your wrist and holds it back
>"Come on baby."
>Cassy gets her paw down your pants
>grabbing your shaft forcefully
"S-sorry but I got a human girlfriend!"
>that's only kind of true
>more like a human co-worker you're crushing on
>but maybe it will get them to back off
>Cassy flops your cock out of your boxers
>"Don't care. Show us the goods."
>it does not
>they break into harsh cackling
>Kerry's paw goes under your shirt
>pawing at your chest
>while Cassy starts stroking your cock
>her pawpads are warm, a little rough
>her grip is tight
>the hyena in front of you starts with herself
>her other paw going down her pants
>"Fuck, look at you squirming. Kerry, give him a pinch."
>Kerry response
>you feel the sharp pinch of her claws on your nipple
>you spasm and try to buck away from your captor
>she just giggles and twists her fingers to wring a groan from your lips
>"Aww precious. Give us another moan!"
>Kerry goes on tormenting you while Cassy keeps up the mutual masturbation
>her breath coming in shuddering huffs and uncontrolled cackles
>your cock twitches in her paw
>starting to leak pre-cum onto her fur
>you moan as Kerry's other paw leaves your wrist so she can tease both nipples together
>"Are you gonna cum? You gotta tell us when you're gonna cum okay cutie?"
>Kerry gasps
>"Ooh! Ooh! Cassy you should do that thing!"
>oh no
>what thing?
>Cassy nods furiously
>releasing your cock to frantically undo her own short-shorts and pull them down
>her panties are dragged down next, and she grabs your cock to force the tip into them
>they're already soaked
>"G-Gimme a paw, sis."
>Cassy starts pleasuring herself again
>one paw holding down her panties, the other rubbing her clit
>Kerry gives you a reach-around and starts jerking you off into Cassy's panties
>she's rough like Cassy was
>but even more enthusiastic
>her pawpads quickly getting slick with your pre as she strokes
>"C'mon baby, give us a big cummie."
>Kerry starts licking your neck and nibbling your ear
>her hot breath sending shivers down your spine
>Cassy snorts
>"Don't fuckin'--mmf--say it like that."
>she's leaking from her getting herself off
>warm fluids spattering your cock to act as lube for Kerry's strokes
>"Aww, but you want it don'tcha?"
>Cassy growls and rolls her eyes
>"Yeah. Just fuckin'--just make him cum already!"
>Kerry cackles and starts stroking you faster
>"C'mon baby, c'mon. Give Cassy a big fat load~"
>you squirm in her arms
>the other paw doing a good job of both holding you down and groping your relentlessly
>Cassy growls and huffs out shuddering breaths
>"C'mon just fuckin' nut already!"
>Kerry's trying
>milking you at a frenetic pace
>your cock twitches in her paws
>building to a climax
>Cassy too trembles, her arm shaking as she masturbates furiously
>her moans loud enough to be heard over the music now
>your own moans mingling with hers in the air
>and all the while you get closer and closer to climax, Kerry is cackling and giggling in your ear
>nibbling and licking you
>you thrust into her paw
>the beat pounds in your swimming head
>your body flush from the effort
>and finally you jerk forward
>Kerry holding you by the base to aim the first rope of cum right into Cassy's panties
>spattering the already-soaked material with your seed
>you grunt
>cock spasming in the air
>Cassy groans and huffs
>her tongue lolling out
>staring as you fill her panties with cum
>you don't even bother fighting back
>the last few spurts dribbling out of her underwear and down the inside of her thighs
>Cassy slides them up
>"Fuck yeah~"
>Kerry giggles
>"She liked that. Now it's my turn! I call dibs on--"
>a meaty hand lands on your shoulder
>all three of you look up to a muscular bull with a seriously pissed off expression
>his plain black T-shirt reads "SECURITY" in bold letters
>oh no
>"Alright freaks, take the humie show the fuck out of here."
>you stammer
>trying to explain it wasn't your idea
>but he just grabs the back of your shirt and lifts you off the floor
>the yeens yelp and scamper away as you're hauled across the dance floor
>they're waiting out front when you're tossed out on your ass
>Cassy's still squirming and huffing, the front of her shorts already stained
>but Kerry helps you up to your feet
>"Haha shit. That was pretty fuckin' crazy."
>you finally pull your pants up
>Kerry brushes you off
>"Sorry we got you kicked out babe."
>she suddenly smiles wide
>"Oh shit! I know this other place we can go!"
>you hold your hands out and try to back away
"I dunno about--"
>Kerry's already grabbed you
>she links your arm in hers and starts walking you along
>Cassy trotting to catch up
>the taller hyena managing a shuddering giggle
>"Don't worry about it humie. We'll buy you another drink. And dinner after."
>Cassy takes your other arm
>no escape now
>"Where were you thinking, Kerry?"
>Kerry giggles and flashes a big smile
>"That low-key joint down on fifth!"
>low-key sounds nice
>Cassy picks up the pace
>"That's perfect. We'll get away with a lot more there!"
>oh
>that does not sound low-key for you
>Kerry speeds up too
>you're practically dragged along
>too exhausted to put up more than token resistance
>not like you didn't have some fun
>maybe you can still dance some
>then Kerry speaks again
>"Haha yeah. I bet they'll let us fuck him right on the bar!"
>oh man
>gonna be a longer night than you planned

>Turns out when you feel pains similar to growing pains, it's your body not getting tall enough to fit the soul.
>Like outgrowing a set of clothes as you wear them.
>Have occasional aches all around the body- so when finally kicking the bucket you shoot up like a beanstalk from a fairy tale.
>After a life of good will and kindness you're about to ascend to a higher calling only wind up face-down into some red pavement because your parents decided to sell their first born to a hell demon in exchange for exceptional fertility and virility because they were impotent pieces of shit.
>They better be down there too, damn it.
>At least you're twelve feet tall now and can just punt people like footballs if they get too close, so that's a positive.
>The only negative is that you're the butler of some uppity bird lady with a superiority fetish.
>She treats the help like shit, and charlie-horses the back of your leg every time you get too close because being three feet shorter than a 'sinner' is apparently unacceptable for a bird witch.
>Doesn't help that she always has some sort of asinine task to accomplish.
>Just today she demanded that you bring tea and sandwiches to them and her hoity-toity friends, slapped the tray out of your hands, threw hot tea in your face, and groped your ass before kicking you to the ground.
>So, it looks like you were eternally subservient to a bitch with a princess complex.
>Yep, this is hell.
>The sound of a ringing bell awakes you at dawn.
>Even though the broom closet you sleep in has no windows, you know it's dawn because Lady Goetia likes to make your afterlife a living hell and wakes you up the moment light crests the forsaken horizon.
>You dust off one of your uniforms, change out of your jammies and depart.
>Just another day ruled over by the bird.
>Answer the door and escort possible mercenaries or assassins to her quarters in order to gain her audience.
>Prepare breakfast for Lady Goetia and their family.
>Have the breakfast you toiled over thrown in the garbage by your mistress.
>Stare pleadingly at her ex-husband for the sweet release of super-death.
>Have your pleading go unanswered.
>It was just another morning.
>-and it wasn't even eight yet.
>Your lady loved making you do ridiculous things throughout the day- most of which directly hindering your work.
>Did she demand that you dust the furniture? Well, now she wants you to learn how to juggle and ride the unicycle for her company.
>At the same time.
>Are you supposed to assist in the re-shingling of the roof with the imps? Too boring for the bird mistress. Now she has turned it into a suicidal free-for-all where it's either the imps or you.
>You're gonna miss Mookie, but the guy tried to slice your throat.
>What's worse is by the time you got off the roof covered in the viscera of your coworkers- you were getting shoved into a suitcase and relocating to her brother's house.
>You're fairly certain she just threw you on the roof of a carriage, but it's pretty hard to tell through THREE INCHES OF BALLISTIC NYLON.
>There's the sound of stirrups being whipped, and you're off.
>Fuckin' whee~
>You're not sure if her brother is a nut, or not.
>He acts like one, but the important word here is 'acts.'
>Might be smarter than he lets on, or dumber than you think.
>Also might want to doink his own sister.
>You know that you shouldn't be surprised because it's hell but c'mon, man.
>In the meantime, between the divorce and other things- Lady Goetia has been becoming. . . Frustrated.
>-and guess who has to deal with that?
>"Butler! BUTLER, WHERE ARE YOU!?!"
>You walk with purpose down one of the many corridors of the palace you've wandered many times before.
>Your posture was perfect, your focus ahead, and the large cloche-covered platter balanced on your right hand did not so much as jostle.
>You moved your feet fast, but with precision each time Lady Goetia called.
>"BUTLER! IF YOU ARE NOT HERE IN FIVE SECONDS I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND MOUNT YOU TO THE WALL!"
>You knew better than to doubt her sociopathic claims; a sentiment shared by your legs as they sped up just enough to still carry you with a sense of class.
>The moment you arrived at her chamber door however, you were met with the owner of this abode- Andrealphus.
>You were smarter than to stand taller than anyone in this place, soon crouching slightly in something of an awkward curtsy; closing your eyes as not to make contact.
>"Best to head inside. She's losing patience."
>The sound of a door opening hit your ears.
>"Your butler is here with what you've asked, dear sister."
>There was the sound of a closing door followed by steps on a cold floor, as you opened your eyes to see Andrealphus wandering off away from you; leaving you with an ominous doorway and a forced obligation to open it.
>The stench of sex hit you like a wall in a way that made you flinch.
>It may have not have been unpleasant, but you knew who it came from.
>You strolled in with the covered platter taking lead just in time for a vase to fly across the room and smash into the door.
"You. . . IDIOT."
>There was your mistress; sitting upright in a lavish bed far too large to be appropriate for her own size.
>"It was about time you got here!"
>To save face, you bowed.
"Apologies, I will improve in the future."
>The high canopy of the bed that once creating a regal curtain wall of luxurious linens was now in tatters as she stared daggers into you.
>You wasted no time, quickly moving around the bed and setting the domed platter on her bedside table before removing the cloche to reveal. . .
>Sexual paraphernalia.
>Indeed, the frustration that Lady Goetia had been dealing with was of the intimate variety- this escapade of a divorce apparently going on for so long that she has apparently suffered from it carnally somehow.
>How this came to be was anyone's guess.
>By how little she fucked Stolas, you'd think the bird was biologically asexual.
>None the less-
>This has led to moments in the day where your mistress has indulged in lustful decadence.
>Phallic toys, lubricants, sexual devices, lustful stimulants- the works.
>It was such a a spread that you had to advert your gaze just to save face.
>Now, however, came the worst part.
>After quietly dismissing yourself outside the room, you were to wait for your mistress to finish using them; the sounds of furious masterbation beginning the moment those doors were closed.
>'Why-' you ask? Because she couldn't be expected to clean them all, herself.
>You're pretty sure that your mistress didn't even know how to use a sponge; much less hold it.
>It was disgusting, really.
>Any normal person would probably be turned on by such a thing, but you felt nothing.
>She was a spoiled brat that grew up into a rotten woman, and there was no amount of pheromones or sexual thoughts that could get past everything she has made you do over the years.
>That being said, today's session certainly was going on for a while.
>Seconds turned to a minute, and then two, then three, then five, then ten, and finally twenty-seven.
>You had to check your pocket watch just to be certain the clock in the hall was accurate.
>All the while, the noises in the room behind you were becoming all the more furious before devolving into exhausted panting.
>"BUTLER, GET IN HERE NOW!"
>You sigh when finally being able to pick yourself off the door and step inside once more to-
>Damn it.
>The room was practically in shambles.
>Furniture was overturned, sheets were slashed- even some of the wallpapers seemed clawed into.
>This was going to be a pain to clean.
"Yes, Lady Goetia?"
>You shut the door behind you as you got a good look at the toys scattered around the bed and floor, stepping over a dildo just to reach the foot of the bed.
>It was there that you could see the bird woman lying in bed, furiously staring at you.
>Her red eyes tried to burn into you while her form below her neck stayed mostly shrouded by a comforter.
>"You wish to be free of your servitude to me, is that correct?"
>Was this a trick question?
>Even behind her heavy breathing you could feel the presence of arrogance, but bit your tongue.
"It has crossed my mind during my many tasks, yes."
>There was a pause.
>"Then I order you to disrobe."
>A frown graced your mistresses presence as you stood still as you watched Stella rise to her feet stop the mattress- making her way toward you.
>She stopped at the foot of the bed, staring down at you with annoyance at your lack of movement.
>"-and if I refu-"
>Before you even know what is happening, there is a talon gripping your throat that yanked you onto the bed and flat on your back.
>"YOU DO NOT REFUSE ME!"
>It was a verbal, visceral eruption that truly reminded you of the pecking order between the sinners and the higher class of hell.
>You were pinned by the throat against the bed, the woman's sheer grip strength already strangling the airflow to your lungs.
>All the while, your eyes couldn't help but wander when it came to the form that now knelt over yours.
>It was the first time seeing your mistress bare; her form no-longer covered by a blanket to let you see everything her dignity compelled her to cover.
>A small set of breasts, and a pair of shapely hips covered in a soft plumage of feathers were what you pulled your eyes away from just in time to see Stella stare down at you with entertained distain.
>She seemed to almost forget that you were suffocating.
>"You had best listen because I am only saying this once-" she threatened with a tightening of her grip.
>"I am going to lessen my grip, and give you an order."
>You began to flail your legs pointlessly under her as she pressed a sharpened digit onto your chest and slowly began to press onto you.
>"If any other words come out of your mouth other than 'of course, mistress' during your time in this room, then I will kill you a thousand times before you are given the opportunity to try again."
>Your mistress loosened her grip, and you gasped in a lung-full of air.
>"Now, disrobe."
>The bleeding fury behind her gaze caused you to relent, a hand clumsily unbuttoning your vest.
"O-of course. . . Mistress."
>"-and I'll handle the bottom-" she demanded fruitfully when using a digit to pop the button off of your pants crudely.
>"I normally wouldn't stoop to doing such a thing with a dirt-thing like you, but there is little else one can do when the only other options are faulty toys, and family."
>In only a matter of moments you feel her digging around in your pants, pulling out your shamefully half-mast member.
>She gripped it, but couldn't fit the fingers of her claw all the way around; giving it long, firm strokes when staring at you with narrowed eyes and a crude smile.
>"I'll give you a deal just like I gave those abominations you call 'parents'."
>You didn't know what to be staring at, the sight of your owner disrobing you of your trousers just to grind against your shaft better or the devious stare she gave you.
>"Please me, and you may consider your bindings to me loosened. Understood?"
"Of course, Mistress."
>She only seemed to be half listening when positioning herself over you; using a couple digits to spread a soft plush-looking labia over the head of your shaft.
>"Good, fail me and I'll have you gutted."
>In a swift movement she already dropped, not only surprising you but herself as her knees caught her halfway down your cock with a sharp gasp.
>"FUCK ME!"
>You weren't sure if this was a demand or a swear at the ceiling, but you thrusted upward in a way that caused your mistress to shudder; her knees buckling to let her fall the rest of the way as you felt your tip hit the end of the road before hilting your length.
>"Damn you, you bastard. . ."
>Lady Goetia hissed as she arched over you, sharp teeth clenching as her hips grinded into you.
>"Don't just lay there like my pathetic ex-husband! Keep. Fucking. MOVING."
>You weren't sure if it was your dick taking over your brain functions, or the talon being pressed against your throat but it wasn't long before you had Stella Goetia bouncing on your dick with every thrust of your hips.
>"Harder. HARDER. Oh, for the love of- just let me do it."
>A surge of pleasure shot through you as your mistress slammed herself onto you- letting you know absolutely certain that you were smashing against the back wall of her depths.
>"Well, this is a pleasant surprise-" she spoke through breathy huffs. "You're not as useless in bed as I expected. Perhaps I should make you my personal dildo?"
>You didn't wish to dignify that with a response, but luckily it seemed like you wouldn't have to as somehow your mistress got even more intense with her motions- wrapping her arms around you as if to pull you into her.
>You felt like you weren't going to last much longer, and she could feel you throbbing inside of her so in one last motion she slammed herself on top of you in a way that you almost heard your pelvis pop.
>Her body almost spasmed when reaching climax- instead choosing to latch onto you and grinding until she felt you paint her walls white.
>Even in the after-glow of post coitus, your mistresses body domineered your own as in your mental fuzz you did not take more of your lady taking something off of her bedside table and putting it in your mouth.
>"I am far from satisfied. Let us continue."
>This was going to be a long day.

>get abducted
>they run a series of tests on you
>forget to beam you back down to earth
>you're a sex pet for alien squirrels now

>"Thaaaats it, you fuckin' freak. Deep huff"
>Your eyes practically roll into the back of your head
>Was this even real? It couldn't be, it was too good to be true!
>The derisive snicker from the crowded room was loud in your ears
>Almost drowning out the thumping electronic party music
>This was equal parts a nightmare too, having your degeneracy exposed to everyone you knew
>Some party
>"Did I tell you to stop?"
>Stephanie's commanding tone launched your tongue back into action
>Your nose was buried in her sweat-damp armpit
>Nostrils burning with the skunk's natural scent. All those oils really leeched into sinuses.
>Everything was going to smell like her for days.
>Your tongue dug through that wiry nest of pit-fur.
>Stiff bristles to dig through and savor the wetness
>If you were feeling poetic you might think of it as the 'Rain of a goddess'
>Rather than what it was
>The rank, unwashed pit of a rowdy skunk bitch.
>The wall slammed into your spine
>You groaned
>Trapped in her underarm now
>"Jeez, I think I can feel his dick on my thigh"
>Steph's words excited the crowd of friends and enemies
>All united in observing your perverse torment
>You kept lapping, sucking, drinking that girl's sweat
>Part of you hoped this was all filthy wet dream
>The other part was glad to have finally been exposed
>"Alright that's enough."
>She pushed you in the chest. Hard.
>It hurt!
>Your tipsy self fell backwards and sprained your hand when you fell to the ground
>You seethe
"What was that for?"
>She didn't reply, just pulled her left foot from her heavy boot
>The socked toes flexed
>Dripped with sweat
>She stepped on your face
>"Huff it, perv."
>The hangover
>It was bad
>You awakened laying face first with your head crammed into the pillows of a couch
>It wasn't your couch
>Must've gotten too drunk to get home
>You clamber up
>Everything smelled weird
>You were drenched in sweat
>Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt.
>You needed water... but first you needed...
>Your slow stumbling turned into a mad dash towards the bathroom
>At least - you were pretty sure this was the bathroom.
>Thank fuck! It was!
>Hunching over a toilet you turned your stomach inside out
>Then you collapsed next to it
>The taste of vomit staining your tongue
>There were footsteps
>"You alright?"
>Stephanie's voice
>She was half naked too
>What was she doi- oh.. right, this was her home.
"Aghhh.."
>You groan
"I'm fine"
>A few memories of what happened last night tore through your brain
>Your face in her pits
>Sucking her toes
>Even letting her put a collar on you and parade you around the place
>A feeling of sickness rose in you
>As if the literal sickness from the booze wasn't enough
>"You were pretty wild last night" She teased.
>You wanted to die
"Ugh, why did I do that"
>She helped you to your feet
>"I 'unno, you were horny? I'm gonna take a shower. If you want another stab at my armpits, you can join me"
>She shrugged
>You wobbled on your feet a little
"I'll just get a glass of water first"
>The blast of cold water shocked you wide awake
"Why didn't you warn me!"
>"Only works if you don't see it coming"
>You shivered
>The cold shower poured down down both of you
"I notice it works for you"
>"Yeah but you're a noob"
>What the fuck was that even supposed to mean?
>Whatever
>You grabbed some soap
"So..."
>You hadn't talked much about last night beyond the awkward run in
>"Yeah there's probably loads of video"
>She cut to the chase
>"Honestly, nobody's gonna care, don't worry about it"
>"Coulda been waaay worse, you're lucky it was me bossin' you around"
>She laughed, then put a bottle of shampoo in your hand
>"Mind getting my tail?"
>You diligently helped shower the skunk
>Her fur was soft
>At some point she turned the cold to hot
>The warmth was incredibly cozy
>You wanted to cuddle her
"That mean all the insults and stuff were uh?"
>"100 percent real, you're a degenerate"
>You gulp
>She cackles
>"But that just means I can make you my pet, right? Like, I've had boyfriends. Boyfriends suck."
>Her hands rest on your shoulders
>You glance to each and then to her eyes
>"A pet sounds way better"
>She pushes you down
>This time you go with it, crouching into a kneel
>"Good puppy."
>You had told her you were okay with the pet-play kink
>So long as it didn't bleed into your real life
>That was 2 weeks ago
>Currently you were sitting in a lecture hall taking notes... with a collar around your neck.
>Steph had spent the whole morning bullying you into putting it on
>You wish you'd had the gumption to fight back just a little harder
>But the way she said "Bad puppy!" just twisted the blade in your heart
>You realized you'd been staring into space for the past 5 minutes
>Everyone was leaving
>Blinking a few times you settled back into reality
>Then you crammed all your crap back into your bag and slung it over your shoulder
>Your hand came to your throat, felt up the collar
>You tugged on it a little
>It was kinda tight
>"That's the point, dummy. So you remember it's there."
>You remembered that alright.
>Trying not to think about it, you left the campus to find something to eat
>You walked past an alleyway without looking
>Out from it emerged a shadow which bolted past you
>Swiftly, smoothly a furry black hand swiped past your face
>Felt a tug on your neck
>Your eyes darted around til they landed on that black and white landing strip of a tail
>Then followed the leather strap that was hooked into your collar
"What the f-"
>"Puppy! I knew I'd find you around here, you always come here"
>You glanced at Steph, then down at your own collar
>Then again you let your eyes follow the leash to her fist
"Oh... oh shit. Oh please, Steph, please not in public!"
>Your whines just made her giggle
>"Come off it, you look cute like this!"
>She tugged on the leash
>"Now heel, puppy! We're getting lunch!"
>This was the most humiliating experience of your life
>Sitting across from Steph, eating a muffin, drinking a mocha-latte ...
>With a leash between your neck and her palm.
>You chose not to make eye contact with anyone in the cafe
>"Y'know~"
>You just watched your own slip-ons shuffle beside Steph's boots as you left the cafe
>"A real pet wouldn't pay for his own meals, he'd beg for his owner for food and if he was a good boy, she'd feed him"
>God her whispering was insidious
"I am not giving you my bank account"
>She snickers and gives you a little smack on the shoulder
>"Daw you're no fun! At least entertain the idea."
>You shoot her a disapproving glare
>"Hmf"
>You sigh
>"Puppy is sleeping on the floor tonight."
>Your eyes swivel back to her
>Disbelief all over your dumb face
"What!?"
>"You heard me."
"Why? Because I won't give you all my money! That's absu-"
>"No, it's because you're raining on my parade here"
>"If you act like this is spoils the mood"
>You can't believe this
>This is nuts
"What does that eve-"
>"Just play along! You don't actually have to do it, just pretend!"
>Oh.
>You felt a little silly.
>You also felt quite angry. Why were girls so difficult?
>"Anyway. Orders stand. Puppy is on the floor tonight."
"Steph, c'mon!"
>"Nuh uh! And I want a paw massage."
>You sighed
>You strolled down the street with her, you almost forgot you were on a leash a few times.
>After a couple minutes of silence she went back into teasing
>This time you leaned into it
>Let her fantasies run wild, she'd certainly indulged in yours.
>You didn't want to be ungrateful
"Oh um, there's something I forgot back at campus? Can I go get it?"
>You tugged on the collar a few times
>"Oh! Forgetful little puppy aren'tcha? Sure, lets go back!"
>Oh no.
"I meant on m-"
>"Oh I know what you meant, but you've been a bad puppy today"
>"I'm not letting you leave my sight."
>You gulped
>Asking your professor if he'd seen a little red USB stick shouldn't have been so nerve wracking
>But doing it with a collar around your neck ...
>With your 'owner' standing behind you, giggling ...
>While she tugged on your leash a few times just to fuck with you ...
>You'd never been so red
>Or felt so cold
>She hadn't even seen the thumbdrive, so it was a waste of time.
>You later found it crammed in the bottom of your bag
>The entire humiliating ritual of being waltzed around campus on a leash was for nothing
>Well..
>Maybe not nothing per se
>Steph was pleased
>Really pleased!
>You sat with your back against the foot of her bed
>The skunk's toned thighs wrapped your head
>Her feet were on your manhood
>All you could do was groan
>"Sorry about making everything so public"
>Surprisingly there was a hint of guilt in her voice
>It was still mostly lust though
>"I know you said you weren't ready for that but... God, it was hot! Right?"
>Your cheeks were already burning up. They had been for hours.
>The day had been extremely uncomfortable
>In part thanks to the ceaseless bulge in your pants
>You give another groan
>"You're not a bad puppy, just a scared puppy."
>"Still sleeping on the floor tonight though, I haven't changed my mind"
>You whine
>Her toes curl around your shaft
>A toepad grinds your frenulum
>"That foot massage was good though! So um, I've never jerked anyone off with my feet before, am I doing a good job?"
>You nod as well as you can with her thighs gripping your skull
>She giggles
>You throb, and then you explode.
>Her giggle grows to a snicker. Steph's toes wriggle. Your spent seed stains into her black fur.
>"Look what a mess you made, naughty boy"
>-- Six Months Later --
>Maybe it was a bad idea
>But you decided to move in
>You and Steph talked about it a bunch
>It was a pretty big step for a few reasons
>First just financially
>Suddenly the two of you had more money spend by splitting the rent
>But kink wise
>Thing were kicked up to 11
>You woke up curled at the foot of Steph's bed.
>You were naked, Stephanie was nowhere to be found
>With a sigh you crawled out from under the covers
>The bed was still warm. Smelled like her too
>It was cozy
>You laid on the pillow for a moment, rubbing your eyes
>Then you reached to the bedside table for your collar
>It had become a routine
>Your palm fell flat on the wood surface
"Huh?"
>You looked to your hand
>There was no collar here
>Strange
>You suddenly felt even more naked than you already were
>With a hop you climbed out of bed and pulled on some clothes
>Sweat pants and a t-shirt
"Steph? You home?"
>A couple seconds later her voice calls back muffled through the walls
>"Mhm! Bathroom!"
>Oh, okay
>You waited in the living room / kitchen
>Might as well make some breakfast
>You popped bread in the toaster, when you turned around you noticed something
>A box was on the countertop
>The label made your throat dry
>A couple moments later you heard your owner/lover bounding down the hallway
>Her tail waved behind her like a great fluffy black and white kite
"Uhm, did you buy a shock collar?"
>Her smile quickly melted into a scary grin
"Uh oh"
>"Oh yes."
>You stuffed the toast in your mouth and chewed
>"You're gonna be a good puppy ... Or else"
>You swallowed
"G-gentle"

>You can only moan like a good boy and give her all of your seed

>as you stop laughing and blubbering to catch your breath, your eyes open and lock with hers, half closed from her grinning, fully reveling in your enjoyment
>"You're so cute when your squealing~"
>you barely manage to get out how overwhelming it all is
>"Aw, is it too much? Is me running my
paws all over you too much for you, big boy?"

>See huge rat-girl
>Give her the "fingerguns"
>Say, "Rat-a-tat-tat" as you "fire" off said "fingerguns"
How does she react?

I can see few scenarios playing out depending on which kind of a rat we are dealing with. Not huge rats necessarily
>Simple/Wild ratgirl: Quizzically inspects you. Thinks you are doing some sort of mating proposal and buries you underneath her body.
>Street rat: "Heh. That is quite funny. Want to see mine?" Follows this with pulling out her Tommy gun. She definitely belongs to a criminal syndicate.
>Officer Flint Scenario: "Aha aha. You got a licence to carry those "guns"? Yeah didn't think so. You are going to the station with me" Proceeds to handcuff you and interrogate you later.
>Mature rat matriarch: Doesn't really understand young peoples lingo and thinks you are stuttering. Still takes it as a compliment and hugs you tightly with your head trapped between her cleavage.

>First pegging session

>She notices and starts thrusting faster and deeper
>You try to say something but she shuts you up with a kiss
>Your head feels spinny, the tip of your cock rubs agaist her tummy fluff
>"If you cum right now I promise I'm gonna stop holding back during the next session"
>She's holding back right now?
>The toy keeps rubbing against that special spot back there
>"Come on, be a good boy and let it all out~ Do it for mommy"
>It's just too much for your poor prostate to handle
>You can feel it with your whole body
>Your load starts leaking out of your cock as she kisses you again
>The orgasm lasts twice as long as the normal one, your legs were actually shaking the whole time
>She just giggles and gives your balls a squeeze to get last drops of cum out of there

Anthros raid your village, burn it to the ground, taking all the men and goods. then they just expect the captured men to act like loving husbands from day 1, insanity.

What route do you take?
>Be a good sex slave/husband and live out your simple life to your assigned waifur?
>Begin gathering secretly with the other human males and begin plotting your strike in order to escape and form a rebellion?
>Begin psychologically manipulating your assigned waifur to make her start believing she should be the leader, and help her usurp the throne of her anthro clan with you at her side?

>suddenly my body shifts again
>she speaks in her language again, although I still can't understand a lick of it.
>In retrospect it was probably a warning
>because she zipped up her suit
>and forced me from a semi-fetal position to a full-on fetal position in her gut
>I guess acting as her personal heater is now my full-time job description..

>”Ah, anon! You’ve been in the system since just after the armistice.”
>”You’ll be assigned a wife from the second wave of candidates, you were eligible for the first wave but you know how soldiers are.”
>wat
>seeing my confusion she explains
>”First wave candidates were the soldiers involved in the fighting, while they could wait for the state to assign them a husband most just selected from prisoners of war directly.”
>she sighs
>”But it is their right by conquest, to the winner the spoils and all that.”
>”Your wife will be selected from veterans that were ineligible in the first wave due to injury and members of the citizen corps.”
>”Not that there’s anything wrong with that!”
>she adds hastily
>”Some people think it lacks the romance of a battlefield conquest but we’re all supposed to do our part right?”
>I stare blankly at this fluffy mountain of a woman
>what is this bitch talking about?
>if she notices my oblivious confused expression she doesn’t show it
>instead she passes me another form and points down the hallway
>”Your suitability meeting is down this way, interview room 3.”
>I’m a stunpilled stand-there maxer in my wtf arc
>The dog woman stands up, her full height towering over me
>she places her paw, big enough to cover both shoulders, on my back
>”Don’t be shy, go on now!” she says sweetly
>then gives me a gentle push that launches me across the room
>stumbling, I crash through a door
>marked interview room 3
>Inside is another one of these giant furry women
>correction: the last one was a giant, this one is at least twice her size
>another dog woman with muscular biceps and thighs that look like they could snap me in two
>wearing a pink sundress made from enough material to double as a two man tent
>hunched over, trying not to bump her head on a ceiling made for creatures a fraction of her height
>”Hello.”
>Her voice is deep but feminine and light
>cringing, I drag myself over to sit across from her at the table dwarfed by her very existence
>piercing blue eyes bore into me appraisingly
>the enormous predator leans in close, her long elegant nose twitching as she sniffs at me
>feel the hot puffs of her breath rush over my skin
>close my eyes, this is it right?
>imagine those enormous jaws sinking into my vulnerable flesh
>those massive arms holding me down
>her rock hard thighs closing around me….
>an agonising minute passes
>finally, feel her pull away and risk cracking open an eye
>she’s looking at me with a disappointed expression, her large bushy tail hanging limp by her side
>”Sorry. But I’m sure you’ll make some girl very happy.”
>She rejected me?
>unusual, but not unheard of the receptionist told me
>sometimes a human male would be judged unsuitable as a husband by a candidate
>she tried to tell me as kindly as possible but I got the message
>even in a world with state mandated wives I was still too beta to qualify
>I couldn’t help but laugh at the time
>the next few weeks were agony
>each week I had to show up to the bureau and go through the same humiliating ritual
>the receptionist would give me a friendly greeting and send me to the interview room
>candidates would meet me, inspect me, and reject me
>”Sorry, I’d be afraid of killing you by accident.”
>”I was hoping for someone taller.”
>”Smaller men are more my type.”
>It was reverse goldilocks, the three bears kept saying I wasn’t “Just right.”
>The whole situation was insane, these anthro women had a reputation of being irresistibly attracted to human men and hell bent on doing their duty to reproduce
>except with me
>the receptionist even took pity on me and started coaching me
>couldn’t help but start developing a crush on her
>”This next one is a cheetah, she’s perfect for you!”
>”She’s specifically asked for compliant humans, I’m sure you’re just her type?”
>The cheetah woman, sleek and cruel looking, didn’t spare a word on me
>stripped me the second I entered the room and inspected my body like a pedigree at a dog show
>squeezed my haunches, inspected my teeth, prodded my gut until I sucked it in
>”This one’s too pathetic, even for my tastes. Next!”
>ouch
>The receptionist tried to cheer me up after that
>desperate, I made a shot in the dark
>”Do you have a husband?” I asked
>the kind, sympathetic look she gave me then hurt more than being called pathetic
>she had been single up until two weeks ago, she was leaving for her honeymoon pretty soon
>said she really wanted to see me assigned before she left
>I barely heard a word she said and just nodded along, numb to the world

>Be Anon
>Sitting on the waiting room of a strange massage parlor
>You’ve been having a shit week at work
>You hurt your back lifting a heavy box
>Hopefully a massage will help ease your pain
>You found this place and found it to be pretty cheap than most other parlors
>”Anon? Cassandra’s ready for you.”
>You snap your head to the receptionist and make your way towards the stout otter, who hands you a key and points towards your room
>”Room 7. And by the way, Cassandra likes to take her time, hopefully that won’t be an issue!”
>You tell her you don’t mind and thank her
>You make your way towards the door and insert the key
>Turning it, you unlock the door and turn the handle
>It isn’t hard to find your masseuse
>A tall, overweight grizzly bear woman is setting up her oversized massage table for you
>God, you barely even reach her waist
>She looks at you and gives you a toothy grin
>”Well, hi there, sugar! You must be Anon, right?”
>The words are stuck in your throat
“I—uh, I’m—y-yeah! I’m A-Anon!”
>Your heart skips a couple beats
>Cassandra looks as soft as she is sweet
>”Perfect! Well, go ahead and take off your clothes and we’ll get started!”
>You take a moment to ogle at the motherly bear’s generous chest
>Her chubby belly
>Her wide hips
>You quickly shake those perverted thoughts out of your head and take off your clothes minus your underwear, last thing you need is a stiffy in front of this big bear woman
>You make your way to the oversized massage table, before looking up to Cassandra to ask her a question
“Uhhhh, isn’t this massage table too big for me?”
>Cassandra chuckles and waves a paw
>”Oh sweetie, trust me. You’ll need this.”
>You shrug and climb up onto the massage table, laying flat on it
>”Now, you said you hurt your back at work?”
“Ah, yeah. I must’ve pulled something while I was lifting a heavy box.”
>”Ahhh. Well, hopefully I can make that better, sugar. Let’s start with your shoulders, just lie down and relax.”
>Cassandra got to work by putting her big paws on your shoulders, and began massaging you
>Despite how large she is, she’s very gentle with her ministrations
>She hums as she works her paws downward, slowly going down your back
>”You doing okay, sugar?”
“Mhm.”
>You smile as you relax in her grip
>”Good. Just let me know if anything hurts.”
>Her paws continue massaging your back lower and lower, until they hit a certain spot, causing you to wince
>”Ohhhh, I can feel how sore it is down there. You still doing okay, Anon?”
“Y-Yeah, just–don’t go too hard, please.”
>Cassandra giggles and places her paw right on your sore spot
>”Don’t worry, sugar. I’ll go slow…”
>Cassandra gently soothes out your aching back, rubbing you in a circular motion
>You let out a pleasured groan as Cassandra rubbed your sore back
>Her soft pads slowly applied more and more pressure onto your back, soothing your aching muscles
>”That feel good, sugar?”
“Mmm, yes. Thank you.”
>”Good. Then you’re gonna love this.”
>Cassandra climbed onto the table behind you, resting her legs on either side of you
>Then, she slowly lowered herself on top of you, smothering the entire back of your body in her soft body
>You let out a happy groan as she just barely rests her weight on top of you
>You feel her soft breasts rest on the back of your head
>God, she feels like a giant waterbed
>”Let me know if I’m too heavy, alright?”
>You nod against her breasts as she starts grinding herself back and forth on top of you
>You let out happy sounds as her soft body caresses every inch of yours in her softness and heat
>It’s like a weighted massage blanket
>You feel your loins begin to stir, your dick growing hard
>Time loses meaning, and eventually she stops her full body massage on you to lift herself up slightly
>”Do me a favor and lay on your back for me, sugar?”
>You happily oblige, turning around to face her giant mammaries
>Cassandra lets out a happy hum as her chest falls down on top of your face, smothering you in darkness
>Her soft belly covers the entirety of your body, including your groin
>Her overflowing fat caresses every inch of your dick, drowning it in pleasure
>She giggled and resumed her grinding on your entire body
>”That’s it, sugar. Just relax and let me take care of all that stress on your body…”
>You’re in heaven, Cassandra’s soft body becomes your world
>Her soft boobs mash your face, and her big belly grinds on your dick
>You stifle a moan as her soft fat sends a wave of pleasure throughout your entire body
>She chuckles, and speeds up her grinding
>You try and tap her, but your arms are stuck to your sides, so you’re left helpless as she grinds more pleasure out of you
>Eventually it becomes too much, and you moan into her breasts as you climax
>Cassandra slows to a halt, and lifts herself up off of you
“O-Oh my God, C-Cassandra, I–I am so–”
>”No need to apologize, sweetie.”
>Cassandra gives you a warm smile and rubs your chest, looking at you with bedroom eyes
>She uses a pointed claw to touch your nipple, coaxing a moan out of you
>”Matter of fact, I think you’ve earned the premium package, free of charge. Follow me.”
>She makes her way to a room in the back as you get up off the massage table
>You follow her into a large doorway, watching her massive ass shake and wobble with each step
>It’s hard to ignore when your head is at the same height as her butt
>Once the two of you enter the room, you notice a large mattress embedded into the floor
>You look up at Cassandra, who gives you a comforting smile
>Then, she reaches for the hem of her pants and pulls them down in front of you, revealing her lower nude half to you
>Your face flashes beet red as you’re unsure of what reaction you should take
>But Cassandra still gives you that comforting smile as she does the same with her shirt, showing off her massive breasts and nipples
>”Go ahead and take off those boxers, sugar.”
“I—uh, I-“
>Cassandra chuckles and reaches for the hem of your boxers
“Oh, sweetie, don’t be ashamed.“
>She then pulls down your boxers and releases your erection from its fabric prison
>You look away, embarrassed to expose your most sensitive part of your body to her in its full form
>Instead, she simply hums and lays her paw on your shoulder
>”Go ahead and lay flat on your back, sweetie.”
>Slowly, you walk on the mattress floor and lay down in the middle
>Cassandra walks to your spot, standing on either side of you, and turns around, showing off her massive ass to you
>She looks down at you to make sure you’re there, and smiles
>”Take a deep breath, sugar.”
>Slowly, Cassandra lowers her butt down, it’s moving towards your face in slow motion
>Eventually, her fur grazes your face, then it’s her soft flesh and fat
>Once she’s low enough, her feet move underneath your head and push you further up, driving you deeper into her crack
>Then she fully lowers herself down, settling all her weight on top of your head
>She clenches her ass around your head a couple times to make sure you’re in place
>”Ah, nice and snug. Enjoying yourself down there?”
>You let out a happy groan as you wiggle your head deeper in between her cheeks
>”Hehe, I’ll take that as a yes.”
>She wiggles and grinds on top of you, forcing you deeper
>You turn your head to the right to give her cheek a kiss, before turning to the other side and doing the same
>Eventually, her fur starts getting thinner until it reaches a point where there’s nothing but rigid skin
>”Ooh, that’s the spot! Feel free to give it a kiss.”
>You quickly oblige, leaning in to give her pucker a quick kiss
>Cassandra slightly jumps, then slams back down, forcing your face against her asshole
>”Here, let me take care of you.”
>Cassandra wraps her paw around your pulsing rod with ease, covering the entire shaft and tip
>You moan and buck your hips into her paw, desperate for release
>”Don’t worry, sugar. Just relax and keep kissing.”
>You pucker your lips and kiss her asshole again, over and over until it’s covered in a thin layer of spit
>Cassandra responds by moving her paw up and down with a tight grip on your rod, coaxing pleasured moans out of you
>You respond by opening your mouth and licking her asshole, causing Cassandra to moan and wiggle her butt on top of you
>Eventually, you stick your tongue through her pucker and into her insides, lightly sucking her outer rim with your lips as you make out with her ass
>”Ooh, t-that’s the stuff! Keep going, sugar!”
>Cassandra huffs as she continues jerking you off in a faster speed
>You’re almost out of air, but you don’t care
>All that matters in the world is Cassandra’s ass
>You grope and squeeze her meaty cheeks as you start to grow lightheaded
>Unfortunately, Cassandra removes her paw from your dick and lifts herself up, leaving a thin saliva trail between her asshole and your mouth
>You hold onto her cheeks as she moves away from you, leaving you with a frown
>But as you sit up, you notice that she’s in front of you on all fours, looking back at you and spreading her ass apart, showing off her glistening asshole to you
>”You wanna finish, sugar?”
>You eagerly nod and make your way towards her butt
>You have to climb up on her big, fuzzy cheeks to line up your tip with her asshole
>Once you get set up, you thrust yourself forwards, and start pounding her ass
>The two of you moan together as her asshole consumes your dick up to the hilt
>”Oooh, that’s it sugar, keep going, I’m so close!”
>You feel your climax approaching fast, so you slow down your hips to pound her ass harder
>Her ribbed anal walls caress your entire shaft, sending waves of pleasure throughout your body
“Oh God, Cassandra, I’m—I’m…cumming!”
>”Oooh!”
>The two of you climax at the same time, your seed filling up Cassandra’s asshole, and her own spraying on the mattress below like a geyser
>Exhausted, you lay there with your dick still in her ass
“Oh my… Cassandra, that was… thank you.”
>Cassandra looks behind herself and winks at you
>”No problem, Anon.”
“I guess I should get going now. Can we do same time next week?”
>Cassandra gives you a grin
>”Actually, I was thinking we could do it at my house, how does that sound? That’s where most of my stuff is.”
>Your eyes grow wide
“R-Really? Sure!”
>Cassandra chuckles
>”Of course. Now, we should get ourselves dressed, we close in 10 minutes.”
>The two of you separate and gather your clothes, swiftly putting them on and making your way out the door
>Cassandra holds the door open for you, but not before leaning down and giving you a kiss on the cheek
>”See you next week, Anon! Here’s my address.”
>You take a paper note she’s holding out to you
“Y-Yeah, see you next week!”
>You reach for the cheek that she just kissed and rub it
>You wonder what equipment she’s talking about that she couldn’t bring to her job
