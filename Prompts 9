>basically like an in-heat male scent since human's mating season is year-round
>single human guys give off the scent strongest since it's just their scent
>even human guys with human GFs still give off the scent strongly since human women don't have strong scents that stick to the guy and don't rub against guys enough to even properly mark them

A fantasy of mine is to be the centerpiece of a high society anthro party.
The whole point of me being there is to be fawned over, adored, pet and played with.
An exotic thing that all the fancy and well-to-do animal women go crazy for.
Lost in a sea of huge, poofy dresses, claws and hooves running through my hair.
Eager old anthros leaving big, wet kiss marks on my face.
Getting pinned against a marble pillar by a huge, fat ass.
Scale and fur and feather passing me around like an expensive bottle of champagne.

>Suddenly, they pull away, and before you can gasp for breath...

>threatens to kegel you into red paste if you break her daughters heart
>sends you off without another word, and a pleasant toothy smile on her face

> Hound Goddess Luna Makes you her pet
> Be Anon, a curious and adventurous soul always seeking new thrills.
> One fateful day, you find yourself in a secluded forest, following a winding path that leads deeper into the woods.
> The air is thick with the scent of pine and earth, and the only sound is the rustling of leaves in the gentle breeze.
> As you continue on your journey, you come across a clearing bathed in golden sunlight.
> And there, standing before you, is a breathtaking sight: a tall anthro hound, her fur a mix of shades from deep ebony to rich mahogany.
> She stands at least a head taller than you, her powerful frame exuding an aura of dominance and raw sexuality.
> Her name is Luna, the Hound Goddess, and she looks down at you with eyes that seem to pierce your very soul.
> "Well, well, well," she purrs, her voice like velvet, "what do we have here? A little lost lamb wandering into my domain?"
> You can feel a shiver of anticipation run down your spine as you meet her gaze.
> "I-I...I was just exploring," you stammer, feeling suddenly small and vulnerable in her presence.
> Luna chuckles softly, a sound that sends a thrill of desire through you.
> "Exploring, hmm? Well, you've found something quite interesting indeed," she says, stepping closer until she's mere inches away from you.
> You can feel the heat radiating off her body, and the scent of her arousal fills the air, intoxicating you.
> "Tell me, little one," Luna continues, her voice low and husky, "have you ever been dominated by a Goddess before?"
> Your heart pounds in your chest as you shake your head, unable to tear your gaze away from her.
> "Well then," Luna smirks, her tail swishing behind her in anticipation, "it seems you're in for quite the experience."
> Without another word, Luna takes charge, pushing you down onto the soft mossy ground.
> You gasp in surprise and excitement as she straddles you, her powerful thighs pinning you down.
> "Mmm, such a delicious little plaything," Luna purrs, her claws grazing lightly over your skin.
> You whimper, feeling a mixture of fear and arousal coursing through your veins.
> Luna leans down, capturing your lips in a searing kiss, her tongue probing and exploring your mouth.
> You moan into the kiss, surrendering yourself completely to her.
> With expert hands, Luna begins to undress you, removing each article of clothing with tantalizing slowness.
> Your body is on fire, every touch sending shockwaves of pleasure through you.
> Luna takes her time, teasing and tormenting you until you're begging for more.
> "Please, Luna," you whimper, your voice filled with need.
> "Please what, my pet?" Luna smirks, her eyes glinting with mischief.
> "Please...please dominate me," you gasp, your body trembling with desire.
> Luna's grin widens, and she reaches for a length of rope that she had hidden nearby.
> "Oh, I intend to," she murmurs, her voice filled with promise.
> With skillful hands, Luna binds your wrists and ankles, securing you to the ground.
> You're completely at her mercy now, and the thought sends a surge of excitement through you.
> Luna stands over you, her powerful form silhouetted against the dappled sunlight.
> "Now, my little toy," she purrs, her voice a seductive whisper, "let's see how well you can please your Goddess."
> With that, Luna begins to explore your body, touching and teasing every inch of you.
> Her hands are everywhere, her touch both gentle and firm as she drives you to the brink of madness.
> You writhe and moan beneath her, unable to control the waves of pleasure crashing over you.
> "Yes, that's it," Luna growls, her voice filled with hunger, "give in to me completely."
> You cry out as she finally takes you, her body moving in perfect harmony with yours.
> The pleasure is overwhelming, blinding in its intensity as Luna claims you as her own.
> You lose yourself in the ecstasy of the moment, surrendering to Luna completely.
> And as you come undone in her arms, you realize that you've never felt more alive.
> Exhausted and spent, you collapse against Luna, your body trembling with aftershocks.
> She holds you close, her strong arms wrapped around you protectively.
> "Well done, my pet," Luna murmurs, her voice filled with pride.
> You smile weakly, feeling a sense of contentment wash over you.
> "Thank you, Goddess Luna," you whisper, your eyes closing as sleep claims you.
> And as you drift off into a blissful slumber, you know that you'll never forget this unforgettable encounter with the Tall Hound Goddess who dominated you completely.

I'm torn on collars

>lots of variation and accessorizing
>can be generic leather collar or highly personalized
but
>no easy access to neck for biting/licking/nibbling
>also means no bite marks/bruises/hickey on neck either

>They came for me on the beach
>I was laying on a towel, soaking up the rays while my parents were back at the resort devouring the breakfast buffet when I heard footsteps somewhere behind me
>I thought nothing of it, but then they stopped right next to me, I looked up, and the next thing I knew there was a rag covering my mouth
>There wasn’t much of a struggle, I blacked out nearly instantly, but the one glance I got at my kidnappers made me more confused than anything else
>They didn’t have bandannas over their faces like some sort of gang, they weren’t skeezy looking yeens hoping for a quick ransom, hell, they were dressed in cheap swimming trunks with noses caked in sunscreen just like every other unfurred tourist on the island
>Just two human men, middle aged and clean shaven
>They could have passed for a couple of schlubby dads enjoying time away from their nagging wives if it weren’t for their strangely cold eyes and blank faces
>Not that it mattered who I thought they were, I woke up in what I can only assume is some kind of ship’s storage room
>The steady hum of a distant engine reverberates around the hollow space and I think I can hear the faint calls of seagulls from somewhere above
>A cloth sack is wrapped tightly around my neck and my mouth is kept shut with duct tape
>With hands and feet bound with rope I’m utterly helpless, and the more I struggle the more it becomes apparent that I won’t be leaving this place of my own volition
>It isn’t long until I hear voices and footsteps from somewhere above, and I quickly still myself so they won’t know I’ve been struggling against my binds
>The voices become clearer, it’s two men, likely the same ones that kidnapped me
>”-don’t think I’d be happy with that.”
>”It’s for life though, and unlimited! A chance like this doesn’t come more than once in a lifetime you know.”
>”I’d still prefer the cash option. Shit, I don’t even like her brand that much. Penguin pops are so much bett-”
>”Shut up!” The voice angrily whispers. “Don’t let her hear you say that. I hear she’s touchy about that sort of stuff. Family legacy and all that.”
>”Whatever.” He flatly replies
>The voices quiet as they stop right in front of me
>Two arms reach down and wrap under my arm pits
>”Up ya go.” One grunts
>I'm carried through the unseen bowels of the ship by the two men
>It’s oddly quiet as we progress, no sounds other than our echoing footsteps and the hum of machinery
>Guess it must be lightly crewed
>Eventually I’m pushed down into a chair and the cloth bag over my head is ripped off
>My eyes burn at the sudden increase in light, so I squint and slowly take in my surroundings
>I’m on a ship, on the bridge to be exact
>It’s in the shape of a half circle, with windows letting in plenty of sunlight and consoles covered in electronic displays surrounding the rounded portion
>Standing off in the corner of the room is a graying German Shepard man in a captain’s uniform and standing directly in front of me is a large polar bear woman
>Unlike the dog she’s not wearing a uniform of any sort, instead dressed in a tight-fitting cream-colored dress shirt and skirt
>Her ears are pierced with large diamond earrings and a shiny golden necklace sits around her neck
>She stands tall, arms crossed in front of her chest as she looks down at me with a barely hidden sneer
>I get the feeling that she’s the cause of whatever situation I’ve found myself in
>The bear leans down sniffs around my face, I reflexively close my eyes and turn away, hoping that she doesn’t feel like taking a bite of my neck while she’s down here
>Thankfully, she leans back up and looks to one of the men standing behind me
>”He’s young.” She flatly states, voice tinged with disappointment
>”Just as you requested. One college age human male, unharmed, and with an average build.”
>She cocks her head with a frown
>”Last time I checked seventeen was a little young to be going to college.”
>”I swear he looked-“
>”Don’t worry Ma’am.” The other one says. “We can liquidate this one and get another. No extra charge.”
>Liquidate? I feel my blood pressure starting to rise
>The bear exhales and looks to the ground, eventually rolling her eyes and motioning to my bound body after a brief period of deliberation
>”No need. I’ll take him. Have you all decided on method of payment?”
>”Yes Ma’am. I’ll take the cash payout. And my partner will have the…”
>”Lifetime of free Bearstein’s ice cream please!”
>Her lips curl into a smug smile
>”Glad to see another happy customer. I’ll hook you up with the proper channels. No more than a gallon a day though, don’t try to take advantage of me. You…wouldn’t like that.”
>”Of course not ma’am! Thank you ma’am.”
>”I believe we’re done here then. Pleasure working with you. Now get the hell off my ship.”
>”Right away!”
>The men behind me scamper off and the bear turns to the captain
>”Set in a course for home and take us away. I want to be sipping cocktails on my beach by sundown.” She orders
>”Of course Ms. Bearstein.” He replies, moving to one of the consoles
>She then turns to me, my blood running cold as her emotionless dark eyes run over my body
>She reaches down and tears the duct tape off my mouth
>”P-please! Don’t hurt me!” I plead. “I don’t know what you’re asking but my parents can pay! Please, just let me go and I won’t tell anyone what happened!”
>The bear pauses, a look of amusement appearing on her face
>”Money? I assure you, it isn’t money that I want. And even if I did, your parents couldn’t pay the kinds of sums that I deal in.”
>”Then why am I here? W-what do you want with me?”
>She leans down, a finger holding my chin up so I had no choice but to look at her
>”Do you know who I am?”
>I shake my head
>”No, I don’t.”
>She looks to the floor with a disappointed sigh, then walks to a small freezer on the bridge
>She rummages around, moving wine bottles and iced coffee out of the way until finally pulling a box out
>She moves in front of me and holds the box up to her face
>”Do you recognize me now?”
>I glance between her and the box
>On the box is a young smiling polar holding up a pawful of popsicles in a rainbow of colors
>Near the top of the box in bright pudgy font are the words ‘Bearstein’s Polar Princess Pops!’
>It gradually dawns on me that the young bear on the box is, in fact, the bear standing in front of me
>”You’re…the polar princess?”
>She puts a paw up to her mouth and chortles
>”Yes, about thirty years removed from the bear on the box, but I'm still the polar princess.” She sets the box down on a console. “My father, the founder of the Bearstein Ice Cream Company, put me on the box when he debuted what would become the most popular brand of frozen treats in the world. He raked in billions and left me as the heiress to the family fortune when he died. Since then I’ve been keeping things running, doing my part to keep the family name in good standing and the profits flowing in.”
>I shake my head in confusion
>”And what does this all have to do with me? Why am I here?”
>She leans against a console and crosses her arms
>”I suppose you wouldn’t know, we did try to keep things hush-hush so the media wouldn’t lose their minds, but I recently had a rather messy divorce from my ex-husband.”
>She brings her paw up and looks at it longingly, a small ring of matted fur where a wedding ring once graced her finger plainly visible
>”So? I didn’t have anything to do with it!”
>”It’s not about the divorce, it’s about what happened after. A week after signing the papers I found out that he hooked up with a cute little doe girl half his age, one that he’d been keeping around as ‘work friend’ when we were still together. Hell, maybe a third his age would be more accurate. You could practically still see the white spots on her back!”
>You begin to see where this is going
>”So you kidnapped me to…what? Make him feel jealous? Lady, I’m sure there are plenty of young, attractive guys willing to hook up with you out of their own volition. Lots of guys don’t mind dating, you know, older chicks. No offence.”
>She smiles politely
>”None taken. But can you imagine the media outrage if they found out I was running around robbing cradles? There would be so much gossip, and drama, and nasty rumors spreading like wildfire. I simply couldn’t take the risk. So, I had a few trusted associates acquire you for my own needs.”
>”Please, come on, you can’t do this! It’s illegal!”
>”Illegal?!” She blurts out with a laugh. “Baby, when you get to my level of income illegality is nothing more than a minor annoyance. Right now we’re headed to my own private island where even the omnifur herself couldn’t see what’s going on.”
>”But my family! They’ll know I'm missing! They’ll get the police involved!”
>She waves a paw dismissively
>”Oh don’t worry, I’ve already informed the police on what to do and bribed them to keep their mouths shut. They’ll launch a lengthy investigation, do their due diligence, then a couple weeks from now they’ll discover human remains in the stomach of a large alligator. The lab report will declare that the DNA matches yours, and you’ll go down as nothing more than the victim of yet another wild animal attack. Such a terrible way to go, torn to pieces by a stupid stinking lizard. An absolute tragedy.” She reveals, wiping a faux tear from her eye
>”This is insane. I’ll fight you! Find a way to break free! You can’t keep me as some kind of sex slave forever!”
>”Tut-tut-tut, sex slave is such a crude phrase. I prefer the term ‘plaything’. You’ll be my hot little stud on the island, a plaything of my own to match my ex-husband’s prancing slut. And there won’t be any breaking free for you, oh no. Everyone on this yacht works for me, everyone on my island works for me, and all outgoing and incoming communications are monitored. You know, just to make sure any company secrets aren’t accidentally leaked. Whether you like it or not, you’re mine.”
>”No…but…you can’t…” I trail off, desperate to find some kind of counter
>She turns to the captain
>”How much longer until our arrival?”
>”Six hours at current speed Ms. Bearstein.”
>”Good. I’ll be in my cabin if you need me.”
>She then bends over and cuts the ropes holding my hands and feet together with a mere flick of her curved claws
>”Stand up and follow me.” She orders, a paw held firmly on my shoulder
>Seeing no other option, I comply
>We make our way through the pristine halls of her yacht until coming up on a large oaken door decorated with an intricate carving of an arctic coast
>She turns its gilded doorknob and we step inside
>I'm immediately hit by a wave of cold air, still in nothing but my swimming trunks I can’t help but hold my arms together and shiver
>”Awww, poor baby.” She coos, rubbing my shoulder. “I have to keep it a little chilly in here, even though I get my fur cut every week I still need a place to cool down from time to time. And don’t worry, you’ll be warmed up soon enough.”
>As we move through her quarters the first word that comes to mind is ‘luxurious’, fine wood, white marble, gilded accents, the whole place must take up an entire deck of the yacht
>We make our way past her kitchen, living room, and library, until finally coming up on her bedroom
>She closes the door behind us and finally takes her paw off my shoulder
>Her opulent bed takes up most of the floorspace, the cottony blanket spread across it bearing the logo for the Bearstein Ice Cream Company
>”Take your bathing suit off. I want to sample you before we arrive at the island.” The bear orders
>”You don’t mean-“
>”Yes, I do mean.” She fires back. “We’re in the middle of the open ocean so don’t even think about getting snippy with me. Get naked boy, you don’t have anything I haven’t seen before.”
>My cheeks redden and a knot forms in my chest
>As much as I want to resist she seems to be the one holding all the cards right now
>So I slip my swimming trunks off and silently shiver as she undresses
>First she unbuttons her dress shirt revealing a lacy black bra holding up her sizable bust
>Then she slips off her skirt, her black panties now the only thing between me and a lifetime of unwanted memories
>With a wiggle in her hips she steps closer and waves a paw down her body
>”What do you think? It isn’t often young guys like you get to see the sensual body of a mature polar bear, much less one who’s net worth rivals small countries.”
>”You look beautiful.” I force out
>She puts a bashful paw to her chest
>”Aww, thank you. I’ve come a long way since I was a little cub posing for a stupid ice popsicle box. What’s the phrase? Aged like wine?”
>I quickly nod in agreement
>”Yes, you’ve aged like wine.”
>”Good. Now get over and pull my panties down for me.”
>”W-why?”
>”Sex is a mighty boring thing when only one party’s motivated to participate. Trust me, my ex was a limp fish in bed and there’s nothing worse than a selfish lover. So get over here and show me you’re at least the slightly bit motivated.”
>Resigned to my fate, I walk forward
>”Kneel.” She commands, and I get on my knees in front of her
>I put my hands up to her panties and-
>”No, with your teeth.” She says with a devious smile
>I groan internally and lean forward, biting down on her panties and lowering them down until they touched the floor
>As soon as I straighten my back I feel a paw grip the backside of my head and she shoves me into her crotch
>My face is covered in soft fur and slivers of warm flesh, a slightly musky scent invading my nostrils
>”Mmmmm…” She moans in delight. “Finally a new face to see between my legs. And even better, one that has no choice but to be there!”
>She then leans down and grabs me by the shoulders, easily tossing me onto the bed
>Before I have time to come to my senses she’s already on the bed towering over me, a foot on either side of my hips
>She puts a finger up to her chin
>”Ya know, there was one position my ex could never do, one he just didn’t have the flexibility for. But for a spring chicken like you…”
>She grabs my legs and pushes them up to my chest, leaning forward so her cunt was right above my…already erect cock
>Thanks teenage hormones
>She then eases down and engulfs my manhood behind a wall of white fur
>I try to steel my nerves and block out the pleasure from her folds gripping my cock but it’s useless
>My own body has betrayed me
>She begins a wild up and down and my cock can’t help but stay rock hard
>With my feet resting against her shoulders I stare at the ceiling, and try to simply pass the time
>What happened after is a blur
>After I came she wasn’t done, so we tried a few other positions
>Sometimes she’d take the lead
>And other times she’d force me to under threat of death
>I seem to recall being forced to lick her cunt while she poured wine over it at some point
>Or at least I think it was wine, the bitter taste of alcohol is still on my tongue as I wake up from a post coitus nap
>Orange light from a dying sun spills in through the cabin windows and as I lean up I see the naked form of Ms. Bearstein laying next to me, leaning up against the headboard
>The blanket is covered in a mixture of fluids, tissues, an empty wine bottle, and a couple popsicle wrappers
>Sitting next to her is a box of polar princess popsicles, that explains the wrappers
>Hearing me move she looks into the box
>”What’s your favorite flavor?” She asks, her voice oddly calm
>”Blueberry.” I shakily respond
>”That’s mine too.” She says with a gentle smile, rummaging around the box and handing me a popsicle
>I take it, but refrain from opening it
>I’m just not in the mood for sweetness
>”Was I your first? And I don’t mean your first polar bear.” She asks
>I stare into my lap in shame
>”Yes, Ms. Bearstein, you were my first.”
>”Thought so. And don’t call me Ms. Bearstein. My employees call me that, my family calls me that, my competition calls me that, you can call me…” She briefly looks to the ceiling in thought. “…you can call me the polar princess from now on. Got it?”
>”I understand, polar princess.”
>With a popsicle stick hanging out of her mouth she gets off the bed and walks to the cabin window, sighing in delight as she takes in the view
>”We’re here.” She states
>”Where?” I ask, mind still cloudy after waking up
>She pulls the bare popsicle stick out of her mouth
>”The island, my home. And now yours too.”
