>basically like an in-heat male scent since human's mating season is year-round
>single human guys give off the scent strongest since it's just their scent
>even human guys with human GFs still give off the scent strongly since human women don't have strong scents that stick to the guy and don't rub against guys enough to even properly mark them

A fantasy of mine is to be the centerpiece of a high society anthro party.
The whole point of me being there is to be fawned over, adored, pet and played with.
An exotic thing that all the fancy and well-to-do animal women go crazy for.
Lost in a sea of huge, poofy dresses, claws and hooves running through my hair.
Eager old anthros leaving big, wet kiss marks on my face.
Getting pinned against a marble pillar by a huge, fat ass.
Scale and fur and feather passing me around like an expensive bottle of champagne.

>Suddenly, they pull away, and before you can gasp for breath...

>threatens to kegel you into red paste if you break her daughters heart
>sends you off without another word, and a pleasant toothy smile on her face

> Hound Goddess Luna Makes you her pet
> Be Anon, a curious and adventurous soul always seeking new thrills.
> One fateful day, you find yourself in a secluded forest, following a winding path that leads deeper into the woods.
> The air is thick with the scent of pine and earth, and the only sound is the rustling of leaves in the gentle breeze.
> As you continue on your journey, you come across a clearing bathed in golden sunlight.
> And there, standing before you, is a breathtaking sight: a tall anthro hound, her fur a mix of shades from deep ebony to rich mahogany.
> She stands at least a head taller than you, her powerful frame exuding an aura of dominance and raw sexuality.
> Her name is Luna, the Hound Goddess, and she looks down at you with eyes that seem to pierce your very soul.
> "Well, well, well," she purrs, her voice like velvet, "what do we have here? A little lost lamb wandering into my domain?"
> You can feel a shiver of anticipation run down your spine as you meet her gaze.
> "I-I...I was just exploring," you stammer, feeling suddenly small and vulnerable in her presence.
> Luna chuckles softly, a sound that sends a thrill of desire through you.
> "Exploring, hmm? Well, you've found something quite interesting indeed," she says, stepping closer until she's mere inches away from you.
> You can feel the heat radiating off her body, and the scent of her arousal fills the air, intoxicating you.
> "Tell me, little one," Luna continues, her voice low and husky, "have you ever been dominated by a Goddess before?"
> Your heart pounds in your chest as you shake your head, unable to tear your gaze away from her.
> "Well then," Luna smirks, her tail swishing behind her in anticipation, "it seems you're in for quite the experience."
> Without another word, Luna takes charge, pushing you down onto the soft mossy ground.
> You gasp in surprise and excitement as she straddles you, her powerful thighs pinning you down.
> "Mmm, such a delicious little plaything," Luna purrs, her claws grazing lightly over your skin.
> You whimper, feeling a mixture of fear and arousal coursing through your veins.
> Luna leans down, capturing your lips in a searing kiss, her tongue probing and exploring your mouth.
> You moan into the kiss, surrendering yourself completely to her.
> With expert hands, Luna begins to undress you, removing each article of clothing with tantalizing slowness.
> Your body is on fire, every touch sending shockwaves of pleasure through you.
> Luna takes her time, teasing and tormenting you until you're begging for more.
> "Please, Luna," you whimper, your voice filled with need.
> "Please what, my pet?" Luna smirks, her eyes glinting with mischief.
> "Please...please dominate me," you gasp, your body trembling with desire.
> Luna's grin widens, and she reaches for a length of rope that she had hidden nearby.
> "Oh, I intend to," she murmurs, her voice filled with promise.
> With skillful hands, Luna binds your wrists and ankles, securing you to the ground.
> You're completely at her mercy now, and the thought sends a surge of excitement through you.
> Luna stands over you, her powerful form silhouetted against the dappled sunlight.
> "Now, my little toy," she purrs, her voice a seductive whisper, "let's see how well you can please your Goddess."
> With that, Luna begins to explore your body, touching and teasing every inch of you.
> Her hands are everywhere, her touch both gentle and firm as she drives you to the brink of madness.
> You writhe and moan beneath her, unable to control the waves of pleasure crashing over you.
> "Yes, that's it," Luna growls, her voice filled with hunger, "give in to me completely."
> You cry out as she finally takes you, her body moving in perfect harmony with yours.
> The pleasure is overwhelming, blinding in its intensity as Luna claims you as her own.
> You lose yourself in the ecstasy of the moment, surrendering to Luna completely.
> And as you come undone in her arms, you realize that you've never felt more alive.
> Exhausted and spent, you collapse against Luna, your body trembling with aftershocks.
> She holds you close, her strong arms wrapped around you protectively.
> "Well done, my pet," Luna murmurs, her voice filled with pride.
> You smile weakly, feeling a sense of contentment wash over you.
> "Thank you, Goddess Luna," you whisper, your eyes closing as sleep claims you.
> And as you drift off into a blissful slumber, you know that you'll never forget this unforgettable encounter with the Tall Hound Goddess who dominated you completely.

>lots of variation and accessorizing
>can be generic leather collar or highly personalized
but
>no easy access to neck for biting/licking/nibbling
>also means no bite marks/bruises/hickey on neck either

>They came for me on the beach
>I was laying on a towel, soaking up the rays while my parents were back at the resort devouring the breakfast buffet when I heard footsteps somewhere behind me
>I thought nothing of it, but then they stopped right next to me, I looked up, and the next thing I knew there was a rag covering my mouth
>There wasn’t much of a struggle, I blacked out nearly instantly, but the one glance I got at my kidnappers made me more confused than anything else
>They didn’t have bandannas over their faces like some sort of gang, they weren’t skeezy looking yeens hoping for a quick ransom, hell, they were dressed in cheap swimming trunks with noses caked in sunscreen just like every other unfurred tourist on the island
>Just two human men, middle aged and clean shaven
>They could have passed for a couple of schlubby dads enjoying time away from their nagging wives if it weren’t for their strangely cold eyes and blank faces
>Not that it mattered who I thought they were, I woke up in what I can only assume is some kind of ship’s storage room
>The steady hum of a distant engine reverberates around the hollow space and I think I can hear the faint calls of seagulls from somewhere above
>A cloth sack is wrapped tightly around my neck and my mouth is kept shut with duct tape
>With hands and feet bound with rope I’m utterly helpless, and the more I struggle the more it becomes apparent that I won’t be leaving this place of my own volition
>It isn’t long until I hear voices and footsteps from somewhere above, and I quickly still myself so they won’t know I’ve been struggling against my binds
>The voices become clearer, it’s two men, likely the same ones that kidnapped me
>”-don’t think I’d be happy with that.”
>”It’s for life though, and unlimited! A chance like this doesn’t come more than once in a lifetime you know.”
>”I’d still prefer the cash option. Shit, I don’t even like her brand that much. Penguin pops are so much bett-”
>”Shut up!” The voice angrily whispers. “Don’t let her hear you say that. I hear she’s touchy about that sort of stuff. Family legacy and all that.”
>”Whatever.” He flatly replies
>The voices quiet as they stop right in front of me
>Two arms reach down and wrap under my arm pits
>”Up ya go.” One grunts
>I'm carried through the unseen bowels of the ship by the two men
>It’s oddly quiet as we progress, no sounds other than our echoing footsteps and the hum of machinery
>Guess it must be lightly crewed
>Eventually I’m pushed down into a chair and the cloth bag over my head is ripped off
>My eyes burn at the sudden increase in light, so I squint and slowly take in my surroundings
>I’m on a ship, on the bridge to be exact
>It’s in the shape of a half circle, with windows letting in plenty of sunlight and consoles covered in electronic displays surrounding the rounded portion
>Standing off in the corner of the room is a graying German Shepard man in a captain’s uniform and standing directly in front of me is a large polar bear woman
>Unlike the dog she’s not wearing a uniform of any sort, instead dressed in a tight-fitting cream-colored dress shirt and skirt
>Her ears are pierced with large diamond earrings and a shiny golden necklace sits around her neck
>She stands tall, arms crossed in front of her chest as she looks down at me with a barely hidden sneer
>I get the feeling that she’s the cause of whatever situation I’ve found myself in
>The bear leans down sniffs around my face, I reflexively close my eyes and turn away, hoping that she doesn’t feel like taking a bite of my neck while she’s down here
>Thankfully, she leans back up and looks to one of the men standing behind me
>”He’s young.” She flatly states, voice tinged with disappointment
>”Just as you requested. One college age human male, unharmed, and with an average build.”
>She cocks her head with a frown
>”Last time I checked seventeen was a little young to be going to college.”
>”I swear he looked-“
>”Don’t worry Ma’am.” The other one says. “We can liquidate this one and get another. No extra charge.”
>Liquidate? I feel my blood pressure starting to rise
>The bear exhales and looks to the ground, eventually rolling her eyes and motioning to my bound body after a brief period of deliberation
>”No need. I’ll take him. Have you all decided on method of payment?”
>”Yes Ma’am. I’ll take the cash payout. And my partner will have the…”
>”Lifetime of free Bearstein’s ice cream please!”
>Her lips curl into a smug smile
>”Glad to see another happy customer. I’ll hook you up with the proper channels. No more than a gallon a day though, don’t try to take advantage of me. You…wouldn’t like that.”
>”Of course not ma’am! Thank you ma’am.”
>”I believe we’re done here then. Pleasure working with you. Now get the hell off my ship.”
>”Right away!”
>The men behind me scamper off and the bear turns to the captain
>”Set in a course for home and take us away. I want to be sipping cocktails on my beach by sundown.” She orders
>”Of course Ms. Bearstein.” He replies, moving to one of the consoles
>She then turns to me, my blood running cold as her emotionless dark eyes run over my body
>She reaches down and tears the duct tape off my mouth
>”P-please! Don’t hurt me!” I plead. “I don’t know what you’re asking but my parents can pay! Please, just let me go and I won’t tell anyone what happened!”
>The bear pauses, a look of amusement appearing on her face
>”Money? I assure you, it isn’t money that I want. And even if I did, your parents couldn’t pay the kinds of sums that I deal in.”
>”Then why am I here? W-what do you want with me?”
>She leans down, a finger holding my chin up so I had no choice but to look at her
>”Do you know who I am?”
>I shake my head
>”No, I don’t.”
>She looks to the floor with a disappointed sigh, then walks to a small freezer on the bridge
>She rummages around, moving wine bottles and iced coffee out of the way until finally pulling a box out
>She moves in front of me and holds the box up to her face
>”Do you recognize me now?”
>I glance between her and the box
>On the box is a young smiling polar holding up a pawful of popsicles in a rainbow of colors
>Near the top of the box in bright pudgy font are the words ‘Bearstein’s Polar Princess Pops!’
>It gradually dawns on me that the young bear on the box is, in fact, the bear standing in front of me
>”You’re…the polar princess?”
>She puts a paw up to her mouth and chortles
>”Yes, about thirty years removed from the bear on the box, but I'm still the polar princess.” She sets the box down on a console. “My father, the founder of the Bearstein Ice Cream Company, put me on the box when he debuted what would become the most popular brand of frozen treats in the world. He raked in billions and left me as the heiress to the family fortune when he died. Since then I’ve been keeping things running, doing my part to keep the family name in good standing and the profits flowing in.”
>I shake my head in confusion
>”And what does this all have to do with me? Why am I here?”
>She leans against a console and crosses her arms
>”I suppose you wouldn’t know, we did try to keep things hush-hush so the media wouldn’t lose their minds, but I recently had a rather messy divorce from my ex-husband.”
>She brings her paw up and looks at it longingly, a small ring of matted fur where a wedding ring once graced her finger plainly visible
>”So? I didn’t have anything to do with it!”
>”It’s not about the divorce, it’s about what happened after. A week after signing the papers I found out that he hooked up with a cute little doe girl half his age, one that he’d been keeping around as ‘work friend’ when we were still together. Hell, maybe a third his age would be more accurate. You could practically still see the white spots on her back!”
>You begin to see where this is going
>”So you kidnapped me to…what? Make him feel jealous? Lady, I’m sure there are plenty of young, attractive guys willing to hook up with you out of their own volition. Lots of guys don’t mind dating, you know, older chicks. No offence.”
>She smiles politely
>”None taken. But can you imagine the media outrage if they found out I was running around robbing cradles? There would be so much gossip, and drama, and nasty rumors spreading like wildfire. I simply couldn’t take the risk. So, I had a few trusted associates acquire you for my own needs.”
>”Please, come on, you can’t do this! It’s illegal!”
>”Illegal?!” She blurts out with a laugh. “Baby, when you get to my level of income illegality is nothing more than a minor annoyance. Right now we’re headed to my own private island where even the omnifur herself couldn’t see what’s going on.”
>”But my family! They’ll know I'm missing! They’ll get the police involved!”
>She waves a paw dismissively
>”Oh don’t worry, I’ve already informed the police on what to do and bribed them to keep their mouths shut. They’ll launch a lengthy investigation, do their due diligence, then a couple weeks from now they’ll discover human remains in the stomach of a large alligator. The lab report will declare that the DNA matches yours, and you’ll go down as nothing more than the victim of yet another wild animal attack. Such a terrible way to go, torn to pieces by a stupid stinking lizard. An absolute tragedy.” She reveals, wiping a faux tear from her eye
>”This is insane. I’ll fight you! Find a way to break free! You can’t keep me as some kind of sex slave forever!”
>”Tut-tut-tut, sex slave is such a crude phrase. I prefer the term ‘plaything’. You’ll be my hot little stud on the island, a plaything of my own to match my ex-husband’s prancing slut. And there won’t be any breaking free for you, oh no. Everyone on this yacht works for me, everyone on my island works for me, and all outgoing and incoming communications are monitored. You know, just to make sure any company secrets aren’t accidentally leaked. Whether you like it or not, you’re mine.”
>”No…but…you can’t…” I trail off, desperate to find some kind of counter
>She turns to the captain
>”How much longer until our arrival?”
>”Six hours at current speed Ms. Bearstein.”
>”Good. I’ll be in my cabin if you need me.”
>She then bends over and cuts the ropes holding my hands and feet together with a mere flick of her curved claws
>”Stand up and follow me.” She orders, a paw held firmly on my shoulder
>Seeing no other option, I comply
>We make our way through the pristine halls of her yacht until coming up on a large oaken door decorated with an intricate carving of an arctic coast
>She turns its gilded doorknob and we step inside
>I'm immediately hit by a wave of cold air, still in nothing but my swimming trunks I can’t help but hold my arms together and shiver
>”Awww, poor baby.” She coos, rubbing my shoulder. “I have to keep it a little chilly in here, even though I get my fur cut every week I still need a place to cool down from time to time. And don’t worry, you’ll be warmed up soon enough.”
>As we move through her quarters the first word that comes to mind is ‘luxurious’, fine wood, white marble, gilded accents, the whole place must take up an entire deck of the yacht
>We make our way past her kitchen, living room, and library, until finally coming up on her bedroom
>She closes the door behind us and finally takes her paw off my shoulder
>Her opulent bed takes up most of the floorspace, the cottony blanket spread across it bearing the logo for the Bearstein Ice Cream Company
>”Take your bathing suit off. I want to sample you before we arrive at the island.” The bear orders
>”You don’t mean-“
>”Yes, I do mean.” She fires back. “We’re in the middle of the open ocean so don’t even think about getting snippy with me. Get naked boy, you don’t have anything I haven’t seen before.”
>My cheeks redden and a knot forms in my chest
>As much as I want to resist she seems to be the one holding all the cards right now
>So I slip my swimming trunks off and silently shiver as she undresses
>First she unbuttons her dress shirt revealing a lacy black bra holding up her sizable bust
>Then she slips off her skirt, her black panties now the only thing between me and a lifetime of unwanted memories
>With a wiggle in her hips she steps closer and waves a paw down her body
>”What do you think? It isn’t often young guys like you get to see the sensual body of a mature polar bear, much less one who’s net worth rivals small countries.”
>”You look beautiful.” I force out
>She puts a bashful paw to her chest
>”Aww, thank you. I’ve come a long way since I was a little cub posing for a stupid ice popsicle box. What’s the phrase? Aged like wine?”
>I quickly nod in agreement
>”Yes, you’ve aged like wine.”
>”Good. Now get over and pull my panties down for me.”
>”W-why?”
>”Sex is a mighty boring thing when only one party’s motivated to participate. Trust me, my ex was a limp fish in bed and there’s nothing worse than a selfish lover. So get over here and show me you’re at least the slightly bit motivated.”
>Resigned to my fate, I walk forward
>”Kneel.” She commands, and I get on my knees in front of her
>I put my hands up to her panties and-
>”No, with your teeth.” She says with a devious smile
>I groan internally and lean forward, biting down on her panties and lowering them down until they touched the floor
>As soon as I straighten my back I feel a paw grip the backside of my head and she shoves me into her crotch
>My face is covered in soft fur and slivers of warm flesh, a slightly musky scent invading my nostrils
>”Mmmmm…” She moans in delight. “Finally a new face to see between my legs. And even better, one that has no choice but to be there!”
>She then leans down and grabs me by the shoulders, easily tossing me onto the bed
>Before I have time to come to my senses she’s already on the bed towering over me, a foot on either side of my hips
>She puts a finger up to her chin
>”Ya know, there was one position my ex could never do, one he just didn’t have the flexibility for. But for a spring chicken like you…”
>She grabs my legs and pushes them up to my chest, leaning forward so her cunt was right above my…already erect cock
>Thanks teenage hormones
>She then eases down and engulfs my manhood behind a wall of white fur
>I try to steel my nerves and block out the pleasure from her folds gripping my cock but it’s useless
>My own body has betrayed me
>She begins a wild up and down and my cock can’t help but stay rock hard
>With my feet resting against her shoulders I stare at the ceiling, and try to simply pass the time
>What happened after is a blur
>After I came she wasn’t done, so we tried a few other positions
>Sometimes she’d take the lead
>And other times she’d force me to under threat of death
>I seem to recall being forced to lick her cunt while she poured wine over it at some point
>Or at least I think it was wine, the bitter taste of alcohol is still on my tongue as I wake up from a post coitus nap
>Orange light from a dying sun spills in through the cabin windows and as I lean up I see the naked form of Ms. Bearstein laying next to me, leaning up against the headboard
>The blanket is covered in a mixture of fluids, tissues, an empty wine bottle, and a couple popsicle wrappers
>Sitting next to her is a box of polar princess popsicles, that explains the wrappers
>Hearing me move she looks into the box
>”What’s your favorite flavor?” She asks, her voice oddly calm
>”Blueberry.” I shakily respond
>”That’s mine too.” She says with a gentle smile, rummaging around the box and handing me a popsicle
>I take it, but refrain from opening it
>I’m just not in the mood for sweetness
>”Was I your first? And I don’t mean your first polar bear.” She asks
>I stare into my lap in shame
>”Yes, Ms. Bearstein, you were my first.”
>”Thought so. And don’t call me Ms. Bearstein. My employees call me that, my family calls me that, my competition calls me that, you can call me…” She briefly looks to the ceiling in thought. “…you can call me the polar princess from now on. Got it?”
>”I understand, polar princess.”
>With a popsicle stick hanging out of her mouth she gets off the bed and walks to the cabin window, sighing in delight as she takes in the view
>”We’re here.” She states
>”Where?” I ask, mind still cloudy after waking up
>She pulls the bare popsicle stick out of her mouth
>”The island, my home. And now yours too.”

>I want to pin his limbs with a monstrous strength that surprises him. Maybe we're rough-housing. The mood is playful and flirtatious, but he's never been overpowered before; when his muscles strain against mine, when he fails to shove me off or break the hold my cudgel of a fist has on his forearm, he realizes for the first time what it feels like to be powerless in the grip of something that could really hurt him. My monstrous mouth is itself as much a tool as my hands. It can hang over him threateningly, sharp teeth gleaming wet when my lips curl back. He knows my animal mouth can damage him, but it can also be used so softly on his body.
>I don't mean to say that I want to rape someone. I want this hypothetical man to feel a thrill of fear, excitement, and uncertainty in my arms. (He's in over his head! He didn't realize I was so much stronger. What if he said no? Would I respect it? What if I'm rougher than he hoped?) I don't want him to be so terrified that he's repulsed by me, but I'd like to unbalance him. Make him feel small. I want to handle his body like its a toy – push him onto his back on the bed, pin his arm over his head, grasp a thigh and spread his legs for me. Not meanly, but with authority. Every action communicates my desire for him, and expects that he reciprocates that desire without asking. My judgment is enough for both of us.
>I want that blushing red penis to point stiffly up at me from between his thighs, bobbing while he squirms under the hands that pin him. I'm going to straddle him and sit right down on that. You can't imagine how good it feels to have that hard, warm flesh sliding in and filling you up. With each movement I can feel him rubbing my passage over every inch. When I squeeze down on the cock inside I can feel it even better; for that instant I tighten up, it feels so much bigger and so much harder. I'm wet, full, and it's bliss.

>"another"
>the smartly dressed wolf in a button-up and vest shoots you a concerned look from across the bar
>"alright skinny, but after this I'm cutting you off."
>you grumble and lay your stack of bills down on the counter
>more than enough to cover your tab, and a generous tip for the friendly bartender
>she places the glass she was wiping underneath the counter and begins mixing your sixth cocktail of the night
>you keep your gaze on the wooden finish of the bar to avoid the concerned stares other patrons shoot you
>you shouldn't be surprised, you can't imagine they get many humans here in 'The Wolf Den'
>especially not ones that only seem content destroying their liver at the bar
>but this was the closest watering hole to you and after tonight you needed a drink in a social setting
>the bartender slides your drink to you before taking your cash graciously
>you're pretty sloshed at this point when you hear her whistle to someone and then not so subtly gesture at you with her head
>you see a furred mass approaching you from the corner of your eye
>"How we doin' humie?" The newcomer greets you with a hand on your shoulder
>a muscular grey wolf in a tank top and jeans
>"ya know... Usually bucks like you are smart enough to not wander into a den of hunters~" she continues, sliding her hand down your back and tracing a finger towards the base of your spine
>"So wha'? Ya' wanna take me home and fuck me?" your slurred response comes as quickly as your soaked mind allows
>this catches the flirty wolf off guard, she withdraws her hand and shoots a questioning look at the bartender, who just shrugs in response
>"Uh... Wha-... Y-yes?" she stutters out, confused
>"Lets just go then... Lets just go..." You slur, putting your head in your hands, barely holding back a choked sob
>"I-I uh..." The grey wolf is at a loss for words, sounding much less confident
>she mouths a silent question to the barkeep, who responds by raising all five fingers
>the wolf at your back gives a low whistle of astonishment before patting you on the back and taking the bar stool beside you
>"So skinny... Why don't you tell me why you're really here?" She says, her playful flirting tone replaced with a much more serious one
>in your desperate drunken state you can't help but spill your guts to the concerned stranger
>"She dumped me... After 4 loving years she dumped me like a pile of garbage..."
>a look of realization dawns on the wolf's face and she takes a long inhale
>"Oh- you poor thing. H-hey, you wanna come hang with me and my friends? It'd be a lot better than drinking alone, we're fun gals!" She musters with the enthusiasm of a mother trying to console a crying child
>not too far off from how you actually felt right now
>"Whate- *hicup!* whatever..."
>"C'mon big guy, you look like you could use some friends right now" the wolf says as she drapes your arm over her neck
>you giggle drunkenly at the idea of being called 'big guy' by a wolf twice your size, you mood already swinging back to hazy mirth
>she seems to realize the size difference as well as she goes to stand and nearly lifts you out of your seat
>"Hmm" she hums to herself for a moment before putting you back down
>the grey wolf withdraws a few bills from her wallet and slides them across the bar
>she mouths a thanks to the bartender, who winks back at her in return
>then she takes your already forgotten drink and slams it
>you hardly notice in your slumped state, the previous drinks already catching up to you
>"alright, up you go" she says, and your suddenly flipped on your side as you're hoisted into a bridal carry
>suddenly you're moving through the bar, your destination unknown in your impared frame of mind
>you think you can hear a few more wolf-whistles from other patrons as you're carried through the bar
>you feel so secure in the grasp of this strange wolf
>"Y-your so *hic!* strong" you muse
>"careful dude, we might not make it back to the booth if you keep talkin' like that." She responds, you feel her flex a little at the remark. Her hard muscle straining under her soft coat of fur
>before you know it, you see yourself approaching a corner booth with six... Or maybe it's three? Wolves sitting at it
>a series of 'oohs' and 'ahhs' rise from the table as you both approach
>"awww! Cute!"
>"there was a human in here!?"
>"nice catch Deb! Where'd you find him?"
>"Girls, this is-- Uh..." The grey wolf, 'Deb' you're assuming, stops, realizing she never got your name
>"Anon" you mumble, already having closed your eyes and barely paying attention to the conversation
>"Anon" Deb continues "he got dumped, so he's gonna spend some time with us tonight, be nice."
>the trio pipes up again
>"Oh no!"
>"that's so sad!"
>"ooooh, single!" comes the last response, along with a new wandering furry hand creeping up your arm
>you feel it quickly swatted away by Deb's arm looped around your back
>"Hey! Easy! He's not feeling well right now." Deb growls, pausing for a moment to readjust you in her grip. "Besides, when he sobers up tomorrow. He's mine first"
>"wha- *hic* what was that?" You ask, no longer paying attention to the conversation
>"Nothing, dude. Why don't you get some shut-eye? We'll keep you safe while you sleep off your woes"
>a nap? That sounded nice...
>you feel yourself being flipped upright and slid into the booth next to the pack of wolves
>Deb slides in after you and soon your surround in a blanket of fur, pressing on you from both sides
>you feel a muscular arm snake around your back and pull you into Deb's side
>your head lands on a soft pillowy surface and you sink into it
>you're already starting to feel a little better as a chorus of muffled giggles and coos lull you to sleep

>You try to keep your composure

>”i said both eyes anon! How can i hypnotize you if you’re keeping one eye shut?”
>you can feel your eyes open unconsciously, as if your own body was in on putting you under her spell
>”thats a good boy. Now keep your eyes on the birdie”
>how could you not? With herself positioned over you, her soft feathery breasts swaying with each swing of that golden pendulum. How could you ever look away from the pretty bird?
>you couldn’t, you didn’t want to
>”thats it, just keep watching. It feels good to let go doesn’t it?” She leaned back, letting her crotch grind down onto your hips as you felt yourself stare and stare at her
>the prettiest bird with the softest feathers and the nicest golden gleaming eyes

>She sits in her chair like always after getting home and waits for you to stop what you're doing to take care of her
>You know your place, so she doesn't even have to say anything
>A few seconds later you're on your knees right in front of your anthro wife
>Like always, your pants and underwear are off, so she can see how your body reacts to the scent and sight of her feet
>First you gently grab her foot and start kissing the top of it for a few seconds until she raises it a bit
>It means you're allowed to taste her soles now
>Your lips press against her warm sole, giving it a nice long kiss while she slips the other heel off and pushes it into your hand
>Usually she wants you to focus on making out with her feet before the foot rub, but it seems like today was a bit tough for her
>You're a good husband, so you start gently rubbing her tired sole during the make-out session
>Your wife lets out a quiet moan and closes her eyes
>That's the moment you switch feet and let the other one feel your lips too

>Your anthro wife taught you well how important it is to not be selfish during those foot worship sessions over the years
>She can feel your desperation in your tongue and your fingers
>"Good boy, very good boy. Just focus on my toes for a bit longer, and I'll let you mate with my feet again"
>Jerking off while both of her feet are resting on your face feels amazing, but getting to fuck them?
>You instantly start sucking on her toes, one by one
>Every one of her toes stays in your mouth for half a minute, so your tongue can rub against it from every side
>Your erection starts twitching again as you think about fucking the feet that own you
>She's looking right at you, enjoying every second of her submissive husband worshiping the lower body part there is
>It must give her so much satisfaction to spend all day running after and catching those untrained human criminals, only to get home and enjoy the sight of her tamed husband licking the soles of her feet
>Now that both of her feet are nice and slippery, you can claim your reward
>She puts her soles together, so they're next to each other, creating a small gap between her soles
>You lay down on the floor and position yourself in a way where your cock is directly under her feet
>The first thrust is always the most intense one, especially after making out with her soles for so long
>It's hard to control yourself, but it feels so fucking good to slide your hard cock between those soft slippery soles
>You try your best to slow down a bit and make your reward last a bit longer
>It doesn't take you long to hit the edge
>You instantly freeze for a few seconds knowing your cock is so close to giving up
>Her soles are wrapped tightly around your cock, your wife could easily wiggle her toes or squeeze her feet a bit tighter to make you spill your seed
>You look at the anthro above you and see that smug grin on her muzzle
>Oh no
>"P-Please honey, just a little longer! Please!" You squeal as she reaches down for one of her worn heels
>"I beg you please, I need-" You can't even finish as she places her right heel over your face
>She doesn't want to be the one telling you to finish early
>She wants it to be your own choice
>For your addiction to her scent to take over
>Your nose ends up inside of her heel, right at the spot on the insole where her toes stay at for at least 8 hours a day, five days a week
>It's like something in your brain snaps, you can't even control your hips anymore
>You start fucking that footpussy again, but this time without slowing down or being careful at all
>You can't say no to that scent you love so much
>It feels so good to stop yourself
>You love her so much
>You love sliding your cock between her feet until they're both covered in your fat load
>and that's exactly what happens
>With the last thrust you empty your balls all over both of her feet
>You can still see her smiling at you, knowing it's always the same thing that gets you cumming early
>She gently squeezes your balls with her toes to make sure they're all nice and empty
>It's so hard to get up from the floor, but you know you need to clean them up
>Maybe next time you last a little bit longer

>"I was scared of Annie because she jumped at me!"
>Annie looks like she's going to pounce again
>but one of the disembodied paws holds her back
>the narrator chuckles

>Annie nods her head vigorously
>"And if you like him, you want him to be happy don't you?"
>Annie looks confused, scratching her chin with a claw
>then she smiles
>"Yes!"
>"Did Hugh look very happy when you pounced him?"
>Annie looks over at Hugh
>he's still frowning
>"No."
>Annie's ears droop dramatically and she whines
>"No. Humans are sensitive, Annie. Even if you like them very much you have to be careful, especially when he's not your husband."
>Annie pipes up
>"Yet!"
>the narrator chuckles again
>"Of course, he's not your husband yet. And until he is, you shouldn't be pouncing on him."
>Hugh breaks into a smug grin and sticks out his tongue at Annie
>"Now Hugh," the narrator chastises, "You know that Annie likes you very much."
>Hugh nods his head
>"But you did something wrong too. You fought back."
>Hugh gasps and furrows his brow
>the narrator continues
>"You know Annie is bigger and stronger than you. Anthros are bigger and stronger than humans."
>Annie flexes an arm
>"So when you're scared, or an anthro you don't know is touching you, fighting back may mean you get hurt even worse."
>Hugh looks over at Annie, terrified
>she blows kisses
>"Now, Annie is a good girl, but sometimes there are bad girls. When you think you're in trouble, don't fight. Flee. Find your mom, or an anthro you can trust like your local Safety Officer, so she can protect you."

>Hugh dashes to hide behind them
>Annie looks dismayed
>"Let's try that again. Annie, do you think you could show Hugh you like him without scaring him?"
>Annie scratches her chin again
>and then a light bulb lights up over her head with a 'ding!'
>she runs over to Hugh's side
>he flinches and hides behind the officer's legs again
>but Annie just offers her paw
>Hugh looks at it
>then steps out of hiding to hold it
>Annie smiles
>and then gives Hugh another lick across the face
>Hugh blushes
>the narrator gives another warm laugh
>"That's more like it. I'm glad you two could learn about boundaries. Tune in next week to learn about the different kinds of work in the State of Bismarck, and what every citizen does to keep the lights on, and food on your table!"

>"Easy now. There's lots of jobs that need doing. Depending on what you excel in, you could be...a farmer."
>Annie's plain clothes suddenly change to denim overalls and a flannel shirt, she holds a pitchfork and wears a straw hat
>a chicken struts by, and she goes to chase it
>"Or a soldier."
>Annie now wears a green uniform and a combat helmet
>she has a cork-gun in her paws
>the little cartoon wolf snaps a salute
>"Or a construction worker."
>her outfit changes again, a worker's jumpsuit under a safety vest
>her ears folded under a yellow hard-hat
>the jackhammer in her paws suddenly springs to life, and she bounces around erratically
>"Or even, a State Inspector."
>Annie pops back to her normal clothes with a gasp
>"An Inspector? Really?"
>the narrator responds
>"Only if you're diligent in your studies, respect your teachers, and work very, very hard. Inspectors are the eyes and ears of the Governing Council itself, and help keep all the parts of the State running smoothly."
>Annie looks starry eyed as the narrator continues
>"But remember, whatever you do, you must work your hardest to be the very best at it you can be. One day the state will rely on anthros like Annie to keep the lights on, food on our tables, and our borders safe."
>the screen turns over to Hugh, who looks equally excited
>"And what do I get to do, Inspector?"
>"You have a very special job as well. A job only humans can do."
>Hugh bounces in place excitedly
>"You get to be a husband."
>Hugh deflates, his excitement turning to a frown
>"A husband? Why does Annie get to do all the cool things?"
>the narrator tuts chidingly
>"Being a husband and father is a very special job, Hugh."
>"A husband's job is to marry an anthro, and help her make a big happy family."
>a pram stuffed full of cartoon wolf babies rolls up beside Hugh
>"And a father's job is to raise that family to make more hard working anthros, and diligent humans for the next generation. Hugh, when you're having dinner, who cooks for the whole family?"
>Hugh taps his finger for a moment
>"My dad!"
>"And when you do your homework, who's there to help you with the math questions?"
>a knowing smile cross Hugh's face
>"My dad is!"
>"And who teaches you right from wrong, watches over you, and reads you bed-time stories?"
>Hugh beams
>"My dad!"
>the inspector's voice is bright with praise
>"That's right! Being a husband and a father is a big responsibility, and just as important as being a soldier, or a farmer, or a construction worker."
>the camera pulls out to show Annie and Hugh on screen
>"So kids, what do you want to be when you grow up?"
>Annie throws up her paw
>"An inspector!"
>Hugh also raises his hand
>"A father!"
>the narrator chuckles warmly
>"Very good! Be sure to work your hardest, do your best, and you'll find the perfect job to serve the State. Tune in next time where we'll learn about the history of the State of Bismarck!"
>Annie and Hugh wave goodbye at the screen as 'THE END' shows up over their heads

>an old TV flickers
>bright colors and cheerful music broadcast across the State through radio waves play
>"Annie and Hugh"
>a pair of cartoon figures are on the screen
>an anthro girl, a human boy
>the girl is a canine, with gray fur and a goofy sharp-toothed grin
>"Hi, I'm Annie!"
>the boy looks more reserved, with neat hair, a polite smile, and hands folded behind his back
>"Hello, I'm Hugh."
>a disembodied narrator speaks
>the voice of a mature woman
>"Hello kids!"
>the pair of cartoon characters wave
>"Hello Inspector!"
>they answer in unison
>"Today we're going to learn about History!"
>Annie and Hugh both frown
>Annie sticks out her tongue
>"Pbbbbt! History! That's boring!"
>Hugh nods his head
>"Yeah. I have to learn history in school."
>the narrator tuts chidingly
>"Now kids. History is very important."
>Annie crosses her arms
>"How can history be important? It's stuff that's already happened! I wanna know what's happening next! Like what's for dinner!"
>Annie licks her chops and a thought bubble with a steak appears over her head
>Hugh speaks up
>"Or if it's going to rain this afternoon!"
>a thought bubble of Annie and Hugh playing in a park appears over his head
>both thought bubbles poof out of existence with the inspector's next word
>"Kids. History is more important than dinner, or playing on a sunny day. Without knowing the past, it's impossible to prepare for the future. What if you were in the forest, and didn't remember the path you took?"
>suddenly Annie and Hugh are both in a creepy forest, looking frightened
>"We're lost!"
>they cry in unison
>Hugh hugs onto Annie, who wraps her arms around him defensively
>"But if you do remember your history..."
>as the narrator continue, a light shines through the branches
>Annie and Hugh gasp in relief
>"You can use it to find your way through troubled times."
>the dark woods fade away
>Annie and Hugh relax
>but Annie doesn't let Hugh go
>the narrator chuckles warmly
>"See? Know your past, and you will have a future."
>her voice turns serious
>"And knowing Bismarck's past will help Bismarck have a brighter future. The story of Bismarck starts a long, long time ago, in a time called Before."
>Annie and Hugh look quizzical
>Annie speaks first
>"Before?"
>and Hugh continues
>"Before what?"
>the narrator intones
>"Before the end. In the time that was Before, there was no Bismarck. There was no Assignment. Because there were no Anthros."
>Annie suddenly pops out of existence
>leaving Hugh alone and startled
>"Annie?"
>he looks around, tears brimming in his eyes
>"That's right. In the time that was Before, there were only humans. And just like when you were in the forest, they were sad. Confused. Lost."
>the inspector's voice turns grave
>"So lost, they destroyed their own world."
>suddenly Hugh is surrounded by dusty wasteland
>his fearful expression turns to downright terrified
>the human boy wails and covers his head in his hands
>"Things were terrible. But when Before became After, Anthros came into the world."
>Annie walks in from the side of the screen
>she waves
>"Hi!"
>Hugh jumps up and hugs her again
>the narrator's tone finally lightens
>"That's right. When Anthros came, they saw humans, and wanted to help."
>Annie offers a paw to Hugh and pulls him to his feet
>"The moment they met, every Anthro knew they were meant to be with humans."
>Annie smiles wide as she holds Hugh's paws
>"But the humans were afraid of Anthros. And tried to fight them."
>Hugh's clothing changes to that of a soldier
>he has a cork-gun in his hands
>"But the Anthros didn't want to fight. So they went away."
>Annie walks off screen again, this time the view follows her
>"A special Anthro, the first Chairwoman led her people North out of the great Dustbowl, to a city called Bismarck."
>the background goes from wasteland to cityscape
>"The First Chairwoman of the State founded a new nation in this city, and as a sign of peace, took the leader of Bismarck as her husband."
>Hugh reappears from the edge of the screen, and Annie comes to a stop next to him
>she licks his cheek and holds his hand
>the wolf giggles
>"Just like I'm gonna marry Hugh!"
>the inspector laughs again
>"When you're grown up, Annie. When you're grown up."
>Hugh looks to the camera, frowning in confusion
>"But where did the Anthros come from?"
>Annie shares his look of confusion after a second
>"And who was the First Chairwoman? Was she a wolf like me?"
>the inspector answers
>"No one knows. In the confusion at the end of Before, the Anthros simply arrived when they were needed. There are no records back then because things were so hectic. And as for the first Chairwoman..."
>a silhouetted portrait shows on screen, featuring a non-descript body shape with only a vague snout
>"When she stepped down after establishing our great State, the First Chairwoman passed leadership to the Council of Bismarck, and had her name, and all descriptions of herself stricken from State records."
>Annie gasps
>"Why would she do that? She's so great, everyone should remember her!"
>the portrait is replaced with a fluttering flag of Bismarck
>the inspector's voice beams with civic pride
>"The First Chairwoman believed in equality among all Anthros. She did it to show that any species could have led Anthrokind in the past to a brighter today. And today, the State of Bismarck needs every species to make a bright present!"
>Hugh pipes up
>"Even humans?"
>a disembodied hand comes from the top of the screen to pat Hugh's head
>"Especially humans. Hand in hand together, Anthro and Human kind will raise that brighter future."
>Annie and Hugh both look up at the waving flag with starry eyes
>"Tune in next time where we'll learn about the Assignment Program!"

>play as a female
>get to fight and kill and be killed like normal
>play as male
>not allowed to engage in pvp
>only allowed to play support
>instead of being killed you get "knocked out"
>bard class gets swapped for what's basically a battle stripper/cheerleader

>be a traveling merchant
>a horrible snowstorm hit you as you traveled across skyrim
>lost your horse and most of your product
>stumble to the nearest inn and burst through the door with a gasp
>"Come in traveler, take a seat by the--"
>you throw yourself in front of the firepit
>don't even bother with a seat
>just curl up and shiver
>damn this cold northern country
>you're suddenly poked with something blunt
>the hostess is jabbing you with the end of her broom
>"Hey you lout. You'd better by something or get out."
>you look up
"Have pity. All my coin is lost. Just a night by the fire, please."
>the hostess scowls
>"Does this look like a poorhouse? If you can't pay then get out."
>another voice interrupts
>"Khajiit will pay for the human."
>you sit up further to look across the common room
>in the back corner, two sets of glowing eyes stare back at you
>you can't make out more but you recognize the accents
>the hostess turns to the unseen khajiit
>"And who is he to you, cat? I told you not to make trouble."
>there's some snickering, and another voice responds
>if the first was warm, this one is cold
>sly and with a teasing lilt
>"This one makes no trouble. The human is merely khajiit's client."
>there's a hissing exchange from the shadows and the first voice continues
>"Yes. This one is a mercenary. She is hired to protect the nord and his money."
>the hostess glares
>then grunts and glances down to speak to you
>"Fine. But you're responsible if they steal anything."
>she marches off back to the bar
>you pull yourself off the floor and stagger over to the corner
>"The human is very cold, yes?"
>peer through the dark and see a khajiit seated at a table
>tawny-furred, with golden eyes
>she's clad in steel-plate armor
>"And he is alone, without money."
>her companion, grey-furred with ice-blue eyes purrs in her teasing inflection
>this one wears robes
>she snickers
>"Khajiit thinks this is not a smart way to travel."
>you hold up your hands
"I cannot pay you. My caravan is lost."
>both of them snicker
>they have another quick conversation in their strange tongue
>the grey one lashes her tail and leans back in her chair
>the orange one takes your wrist and pulls you down into the one empty stool at the table
>"Sit human. Khajiit has a proposition for him."
>you think you like the orange one better
>she's forceful yes, but her smile seems more genuine
>the grey one seems almost...
>hungry
>"This one knows he does have money. But in Skyrim, he has something of much value."
>the orange one gestures at you
>"He is human. He is allowed in places khajiit cannot go. Cities. Halls. Temples."
>the grey one leans forward and puts a paw over your hand
>her claws digging into the wood
>"Khajiit needs his handsome face."
>the orange one hisses
>and there's another short exchange you cannot understand
>the grey one rolls her icy eyes and releases your hand
>only for that paw to replaced by an orange one
>"So an exchange, yes? The human will go with khajiit, and will let khajiit in nice places. Big shops, new work, and nice fancy inns. Not like cold drafty hovel."
>she makes no attempt to lower her voice as she disparages the inn
>it is cold, despite the fire on the other side of the room
>"And khajiit will protect him. Take him place to place. Pay for his bed."
>sounds too good to be true
>they're probably sneak-thieves of some kind
>but you can't turn them down
"Fine. It's a deal."
>the orange khajiit smiles wide
>and grasps your hand tighter
>"Good! Oh, but there is one more thing khajiit asks."
>you suddenly feel arms snaking around your chest from behind
>a rumbling purr in your ear
>Shor's bones!
>you didn't even notice the grey one sneaking up on you
>the orange one goes on explaining as the grey one's paws explore your body
>rubbing your chest and drawing claws down to your belly
>"It is cold. Too cold for khajiit. Handsome human must share his warmth. And perhaps more..."

Wealthy executive anthro milfs eating sushi off of a smooth-shaved barely legal human teen

>All you knew is that they pay quite a lot of money for a single "session", you just have to shave all of your body hair below your nose and send them a few pictures
>They actually double the payment if it's your 18th birthday for some reason
>Another reason to give it a try..
>You do need some money, so why not give it a chance? What could go wrong?
>A few days later you find yourself all naked, lying on your stomach with some anthro lady putting some sushi on your back
>"Don't move until they're finished, do what they say, and don't speak unless spoken to"
>Before you can ask about anything else, the anthro exits the room, leaving you naked and covered in some expensive seafood
>A few minutes later, some three women enter the room and sit on the couch in front of you
>They keep talking about their businesses, but you can't really understand most of what they're saying
>It feels a bit weird how they don't pay any attention to you, it's like your whole existence is limited to being a big human plate for those wealthy anthro ladies
>At some point, one of the anthros accidentally drops a piece of seafood
>It lands right behind your armpit
>Oh no
>A pair of chopsticks fishes the sushi out but not without making you silently giggle, causing your body to twitch a few times
>They stop talking, but hopefully only for a few seconds, so maybe they haven't noticed
>Unlucky for you, every piece of food from that point gets dragged across your naked back before disappearing
>It's like they're doing that on purpose
>It's so hard not to laugh when they rub your sides with something cold or with a few pairs of chopsticks at the same time
>At some point you can't take it anymore and accidentally let out a quiet giggle
>They all stop talking at that moment
>"I don't know about you, but I'm still hungry. Let's get some more. Oh, and this time we should flip him over, this one sounds adorable~"

>she starts tugging for you to follow

>See a boar women walking down the street
>She's wearing a short coat with legs covered in fishnet stockings
>Her tusks are finely polished and lips are blood red, she's obviously an anthro whore
>Shout at her that she's a fat fucking sow who shouldn't come to this side of humie town
>She oinks back that stupid humies shouldn't threaten superior species
>Tell her to go back to whatever barn she crawled out of
>She tells me to run home to my furless skank of a mother
>I smash a beer bottle against a wall and point the sharp end towards her
>She pulls out a switchblade
>?????????????????
>Wake up in a dingy little apartment bedroom
>We're both naked and each of her teats is surrounded by my own dried saliva
>I slip my hand between her legs to feel a mixture of grool and cum
>Guess I'm mommy's little bacon boy now

>RadAway weakens your sperm cells a bit so it takes way more than just one breeding session to knock her up
>After your 5th orgasm you're shooting blanks so she lets you rest for the rest for the night

>It's the first time you hear a deathclaw's heart beating right next to your ear
>Maybe your new life won't be so bad?

>Math is next period
>Where the hell did you put that textbook?
>Bell rings
>Fuck
>Still rummaging through the back of the locker
>That's when you hear them
>That obnoxious gaggle of girls
>You shudder
>Why'd they have to run out of space in the male locker rooms?
>Why'd your locker have to be in here
>You keep your head down
>You don't want to be teased again, you're not sure you can take it today
>"Hey nonny!"
>A padded palm smacks your up-facing butt
>They all start to snicker when you yelp and nearly collapse into your own locker
>"Oh gawd, Christie that was mean!"
>One of the girls whines through a giggle, she grabs your arm and helps you to your feet.
>"Tammy's in looooove" Christie taunts
>The two glare at eachother for a second while the rest of the volleyball team starts opening up their own lockers
>It's a menegerie of species, all slim, athletic, dripping with sweat, fur all styled up in wacky ways
>Some of them are panting in a way that just makes you blush
>You avert your eyes
"I... I just need a book is all. Then I'll be gone"
>You mumble but you're tugged on again
>Oh no it's Christie again
>That 6'5 cheetah girl smirks down at you, you can't help but feel like you're shrinking under her gaze
>"You don't have to leave so soon, 'non, It's not like you're super threatening or anything"
>You don't know how you feel about that.
>Another girl calls from your left but you can't see here behind your locker's door "Yeah it's nice havin' something to look at"
>There's a wave of snickers and giggles
>You're practically frozen, trapped in this room of half-naked hormonal furry bodies
>All pouring with pheromones
>"Hah, I think he's broken"
>Christie tugs you into a big sweaty hug
>You can feel your shirt staining
>A tongue smacks your forehead, then she pulls back
>The cheetah gives you a wink, and her canine friend Tammy shoots you an apologetic glance.
>You leave without finding the book
############
>3 Days Later
############
>"Hey Anon!"
>You'd recognize that voice anywhere.
"Oh, uh, hey Christie"
>Your gaze darts to her shoulders but you don't dare look in her eyes
>She smirks
>"You're always so tense, dude"
>"Anyway, you've got a free period today right? Why don't you come down and watch me and the gals demolish?"
>You accidentally look at her face
>A blush hits you like a truck, your lungs seize
"Ah... you mean like, watch your volleyball match?"
>She puts a paw on your shoulder, you notice how tight-fitting her uniform is
>The cheetah snickers "It's not like you're goin' to death row Anon"
"Sorry I'm just"
>"Distracted and nervous? As always?" Her grip releases. "c'mon, it'll be fun! Plus you can oggle us without feeling shy about it"
"Wha!?"
>You stiffened, your eyes were locked with hers now
>She was grinning from ear to ear
>Then she started laughing
>You wanted the ground to erupt beneath your feet right then and there
>"Calm down dude" she teased through a bout of snickering, gripping your arm when she saw you wobble on your feet.
>"I know it's gotta be a little weird for you, being assigned the girls' locker and all"
>"Honestly we don't mind the attention, well most of us. Don't look at Melinda, she'll rip your throat out"
>You gulp
>"Oh yeah! And Tammy said she wants to see you after school, but she's too shy to ask"
>/SHE'S TOO SHY?/
"Uhm... okay. I'll be there. F-for both"
>Christie beams
>"Awesome, seeya after the match then!"
>She's walking away when she swivels back and asks, "Oh and try to video some kick-ass volleys, yeah?"
>The bell rings
>English... And you've got a test.
>How are you gonna think straight now?

>Barge into the Ultra-Luxe
>Lay down an entire box of caps
"I'll book your wildest hooker for the night, please."
>Get escorted to a suite
>Waiting for you is a massive deathclaw
>She's laid back on the creaking bed with her legs spread and arms behind her head
>Each muscular thigh is thicker than your torso
>Her crotch is a deep, drooling slit in those armored scales
>"So, I get to have you all night, huh?"
>The lizard's scratchy growling voice shocks you to your bones
>The door slams and locks behind you
>"You paid for it!" squeaks a voice from the hallway
>Your paid-for comfort beckons you with a curling of her murderous talon
>"Don't keep me waiting, sugar. I'm ~starved~ for touch"
>You drop your clothes and head into battle

>God your tongue hurt.
>How long had you been at this?
>Her thighs were still clenched at your waist
>And the occasional grunt or squeeze of her tail around the back of your neck let you know you were doing something right.
>Still.
>This was more exhausting than you'd been expecting
>Your lips smooched the vixen's quivering pucker
>She'd started so tight when you began
>You could barely stick a finger in without her squirming
>But once you lubed her up with your tongue she loosened up pretty quickly
>After just a few minutes it was easy to dig that flexing muscle deep into her tailhole
>She seemed to like that, given the chitters and groans
>You let your hand focus on her womanhood
>A couple fingers slipped in deep while your thumb played with her clitoris
>That was like an hour ago now
>Her juices were dripping down your arm
>Your tongue desperately wanted to quit
>You curled your tongue and dug your fingers in against her walls
>Oh she was satisfied alright, it's just that she was a glutton for pleasure.
>Any time you tried to pull back she squeezed her legs or pushed her butt back into your face
>10 more minutes past, with your spit drooling down her backside
>Your tongue wriggling in and slurping out of that tight tunnel
>Your pruned fingers scraping every corner of her pink depths
>Then suddenly
>"Annh... Fuck... that feels so good..."
>This was it, you were free!
>But... then why was she..?
>The plump vixen pushed her paws against the bed
>She fell backwards, right on top of you
>Your eyes shut tight as your face was swallowed by her chubby bronze cheeks
"Mmph!"
>You tried to protest, but her pucker had clenched your tongue hard
>"Shhhh." She snapped
>"Tongue back in"
>You whimpered, but obeyed.
>"Thaaats a good boy..." her whisper made you feel all tingly
>Beyond the veil of her buttocks she pulled your legs out so you were laying flat beneath her
>Then she laid her paws on your crotch
>The paw pads gently ground against your boxer-bound manhood
>"You want a footjob?" she asked
"Mrmh! Mhm!"
>You gave her some excited tongue wriggles and a fierce rubbing of her clit to say 'yes'
>Your vixen mistress giggled
>"Another hour under me, then you can cum all over my toes"
>A mixed sense of despair and determination filled you
>Your face hurt
>Your tongue burned
>Your brain was doing the best it could with a vixen-musk adulterated air supply
>This was going to be a loooong hour.

>Her getting too drunk and getting more frisky in turn
>The party gets a bit out of hand
>She starts talking about how obedient and caring you are
>You've never seen Stella drink so much in such a good mood
>"Its MY fuuuucking pethusband and I'll do wahta I want with himmm! Comme heree"
>She starts making out with you in front of her guests
>You can feel yourself getting tipsy just from those messy kisses
>Hopefully the guests left right before she started riding your face
>You lick her to orgasm and help her get ready to bed afterwards
>Once in bed Stella says she needs you to cuddle with her until she falls asleep
>The last thing she says before blacking out is how happy she is you're still around

>"Anon, we know you were involved"
>"We found traces of coke in your hair when we were processing you"
>The bunny was smug
>She'd just spent two hours letting you spin up a story
>She asked you details
>Checked for clarifications
>Made small talk
>All to crash you down to this moment
>Your meager confidence faltered
>Blank expression breaking into a frown
>All of the sudden your mouth was dry
>"Now, we know there were more people involved. Clearly you're not smart enough to hatch a scheme like this"
>That smug little interrogator leaned over the desk
>She tapped her stupid carrot pen down on the plastic surface
>Then she leaned back in her chain.
>"All we're askin' for is a few names, maybe a location or two"
>"If you're cooperative you could see your sentence reduced or even dropped if it's found you were coerced."
>You gulp, but you can't lather up any saliva
"I... I want a lawyer"
>Your mumbling catches her in a snicker
>"Oh come now, Anon, don't be like that! We were just gettin' to know eachother!"
>She threw her feet up on the table
>Her boots thudded.
"I don't have to talk anymore"
>"Yeah, sure, you don't. But right now you've dug yourself into a pretty deep fuckin' hole."
>She kicked one of her shoes off
>"You're lookin' at up to 15 years here, maybe 6 with good behavior"
>The other shoe thudded off the table
>That smug little cunt rolled off her sweaty socks and, using her toes, tossed them towards you.
"Wh- What are you-"
>"Got a paw fetish, don't ya? We searched your phone. I know you find this distracting"
>You felt sick
>What else had she seen...
>"Calm your nerves, how about a trade? You get to lick my paws and in exchange, I get information"
"I'm not a rat"
>Your nervous voice chokes
>"Aww, poor humie"
>She wriggles her toes
>You tug forward but your hands are beneath the bolted-down chair
>"Don't you want a little... lick?"
>Her foot loomed in front of your exhausted, desperate eyes
>Your tongue wavered out from your parched lips.
>"Uh uh!" Her feet pulled back
>"Give me a name first"
>You gasped
>Your mouth opened again
>This time you spilled your guts.

>Be anon
>went out to the club on the weekend
>not your usual scene, but it might be fun
>tons of bodies bouncing, dancing, grinding
>humans and anthros alike partying
>it's overwhelming at first
>but then you get a couple drinks in you and start to bounce along to the music
>you're still hanging by the wall when you feel something tug your wrist
>it's an anthro
>a hyena woman
>dressed to party, crop-top and daisy-dukes with plenty of jewelry
>she's giggling
>"Hey! Come dance with us!"
>right behind her, leaning on her shoulder is another hyena, dressed similar
>the second is a bit shorter, though they're both way taller than you
>she cackles and leans forward
>"You're too cute to be dancing alone!"
>you try to pull back your hand
>she's strong
"I'm sorry, I have a girlfriend!"
>the hyenas look at each other and break into a shared cackle
>"Dude it's fine!"
>she tugs your wrist again
>and the other hyena comes around behind you to hold your shoulder
>"It's just a little dancing! Totally fine."
>you really don't think you have much of a choice
>and it's probably fine
>just a little dancing
>"Why don't I get us some more drinks and then we can have some fun!"
>the yeen at your back snickers and presses her snout against your ear so she doesn't have to shout over the music
>"I'm Kerry."
>she points across the dance floor
>"And that's my friend Cassy!"
>Cassy has returned with drinks in paw
>you're handed something bubbly and neon-blue
>"Cheers!"
>whatever she got you, it tastes like cotton candy
>you drink a healthy gulp
>then Kerry reaches around you to tip the glass up
>forcing you to drink more
>Cassy snorts and cackles
>"C'mon! No lightweights! We're partying!"
>you cough and splutter when the glass is pulled away empty
>you're slapped on the back and dragged toward the center of the dance floor as you try to regain your breath
>Cassy giggles and starts to bounce along to the beat in front of you
>you feel Kerry's hot breath on your neck
>"Now dance!"
>you bounce along to the music
>not exactly graceful, but you manage not to make a fool of yourself
>your new dance partners grin and dance along
>bouncing and swinging with the crowd
>but man
>that drink is starting to affect you
>whatever it was, it's strong
>you feel loose and free
>Cassy barks and whoops
>"Yeah! Go humie!"
>you try to do a move you saw on TV
>instead you trip on your own feet and almost fall over
>you're lifted immediately
>Cassy grabs your shoulders while Kerry lifts you from behind
>you're pressed back against the hyena's body
>holy shit those are her tits
>smushed against your back
>she shifts her body a bit and you find your body moving with her
>Cassy holds your shoulders and steps closer
>"Careful!"
>Kerry cackles
>"Looks like that drink was a little strong. Don't worry baby, we'll hold you up."
>you don't like that idea
>but they're already dancing again
>more like grinding against you
>the hyena in front with her hands on your shoulders and her hips bumping against yours in time to the beat
>behind you the other holds you up from under your arms
>her paws sliding over your chest and abdomen as forces you to sway with her body
>you a great deal drunker than you expected to be
>you so you just kind of bob your head along while Kerry and Cassy force your body to move
>"Now that's more like it!"
>Cassy grabs your head
>then your face is engulfed by her tits
>you're completely sandwiched between two strange anthros who go on bumping and grinding and cackling
"Mmph!"
>this is going too far
>it probably went to far five minutes ago
>you try to raise a protest but it's muffled under yeen tits
>you struggle against the hyena girls
>they just go on laughing and dancing
>like they don't even notice you putting up a fight
>until--
>"Oh shit!"
>Cassy grabs your shoulders and pulls back
>"Fuckin' finally!"
>Kerry leans her head over her shoulder
>"What? What is it?"
>Cassy grabs your crotch
>"Boner city baby!"
>oh fuck
>it's not your fault
>what are you supposed to do when you're smothered in yeen titties, with paws all over you, and a yeen grinding on your crotch?
>your face flushes
>Kerry gasps and bursts into fiendish giggly
>"Omygod that's so cute! Take it out!"
>Cassy starts undoing your belt
>you try to push her away
>but Kerry grabs your wrist and holds it back
>"Come on baby."
>Cassy gets her paw down your pants
>grabbing your shaft forcefully
"S-sorry but I got a human girlfriend!"
>that's only kind of true
>more like a human co-worker you're crushing on
>but maybe it will get them to back off
>Cassy flops your cock out of your boxers
>"Don't care. Show us the goods."
>it does not
>they break into harsh cackling
>Kerry's paw goes under your shirt
>pawing at your chest
>while Cassy starts stroking your cock
>her pawpads are warm, a little rough
>her grip is tight
>the hyena in front of you starts with herself
>her other paw going down her pants
>"Fuck, look at you squirming. Kerry, give him a pinch."
>Kerry response
>you feel the sharp pinch of her claws on your nipple
>you spasm and try to buck away from your captor
>she just giggles and twists her fingers to wring a groan from your lips
>"Aww precious. Give us another moan!"
>Kerry goes on tormenting you while Cassy keeps up the mutual masturbation
>her breath coming in shuddering huffs and uncontrolled cackles
>your cock twitches in her paw
>starting to leak pre-cum onto her fur
>you moan as Kerry's other paw leaves your wrist so she can tease both nipples together
>"Are you gonna cum? You gotta tell us when you're gonna cum okay cutie?"
>Kerry gasps
>"Ooh! Ooh! Cassy you should do that thing!"
>oh no
>what thing?
>Cassy nods furiously
>releasing your cock to frantically undo her own short-shorts and pull them down
>her panties are dragged down next, and she grabs your cock to force the tip into them
>they're already soaked
>"G-Gimme a paw, sis."
>Cassy starts pleasuring herself again
>one paw holding down her panties, the other rubbing her clit
>Kerry gives you a reach-around and starts jerking you off into Cassy's panties
>she's rough like Cassy was
>but even more enthusiastic
>her pawpads quickly getting slick with your pre as she strokes
>"C'mon baby, give us a big cummie."
>Kerry starts licking your neck and nibbling your ear
>her hot breath sending shivers down your spine
>Cassy snorts
>"Don't fuckin'--mmf--say it like that."
>she's leaking from her getting herself off
>warm fluids spattering your cock to act as lube for Kerry's strokes
>"Aww, but you want it don'tcha?"
>Cassy growls and rolls her eyes
>"Yeah. Just fuckin'--just make him cum already!"
>Kerry cackles and starts stroking you faster
>"C'mon baby, c'mon. Give Cassy a big fat load~"
>you squirm in her arms
>the other paw doing a good job of both holding you down and groping your relentlessly
>Cassy growls and huffs out shuddering breaths
>"C'mon just fuckin' nut already!"
>Kerry's trying
>milking you at a frenetic pace
>your cock twitches in her paws
>building to a climax
>Cassy too trembles, her arm shaking as she masturbates furiously
>her moans loud enough to be heard over the music now
>your own moans mingling with hers in the air
>and all the while you get closer and closer to climax, Kerry is cackling and giggling in your ear
>nibbling and licking you
>you thrust into her paw
>the beat pounds in your swimming head
>your body flush from the effort
>and finally you jerk forward
>Kerry holding you by the base to aim the first rope of cum right into Cassy's panties
>spattering the already-soaked material with your seed
>you grunt
>cock spasming in the air
>Cassy groans and huffs
>her tongue lolling out
>staring as you fill her panties with cum
>you don't even bother fighting back
>the last few spurts dribbling out of her underwear and down the inside of her thighs
>Cassy slides them up
>"Fuck yeah~"
>Kerry giggles
>"She liked that. Now it's my turn! I call dibs on--"
>a meaty hand lands on your shoulder
>all three of you look up to a muscular bull with a seriously pissed off expression
>his plain black T-shirt reads "SECURITY" in bold letters
>oh no
>"Alright freaks, take the humie show the fuck out of here."
>you stammer
>trying to explain it wasn't your idea
>but he just grabs the back of your shirt and lifts you off the floor
>the yeens yelp and scamper away as you're hauled across the dance floor
>they're waiting out front when you're tossed out on your ass
>Cassy's still squirming and huffing, the front of her shorts already stained
>but Kerry helps you up to your feet
>"Haha shit. That was pretty fuckin' crazy."
>you finally pull your pants up
>Kerry brushes you off
>"Sorry we got you kicked out babe."
>she suddenly smiles wide
>"Oh shit! I know this other place we can go!"
>you hold your hands out and try to back away
"I dunno about--"
>Kerry's already grabbed you
>she links your arm in hers and starts walking you along
>Cassy trotting to catch up
>the taller hyena managing a shuddering giggle
>"Don't worry about it humie. We'll buy you another drink. And dinner after."
>Cassy takes your other arm
>no escape now
>"Where were you thinking, Kerry?"
>Kerry giggles and flashes a big smile
>"That low-key joint down on fifth!"
>low-key sounds nice
>Cassy picks up the pace
>"That's perfect. We'll get away with a lot more there!"
>oh
>that does not sound low-key for you
>Kerry speeds up too
>you're practically dragged along
>too exhausted to put up more than token resistance
>not like you didn't have some fun
>maybe you can still dance some
>then Kerry speaks again
>"Haha yeah. I bet they'll let us fuck him right on the bar!"
>oh man
>gonna be a longer night than you planned

>Turns out when you feel pains similar to growing pains, it's your body not getting tall enough to fit the soul.
>Like outgrowing a set of clothes as you wear them.
>Have occasional aches all around the body- so when finally kicking the bucket you shoot up like a beanstalk from a fairy tale.
>After a life of good will and kindness you're about to ascend to a higher calling only wind up face-down into some red pavement because your parents decided to sell their first born to a hell demon in exchange for exceptional fertility and virility because they were impotent pieces of shit.
>They better be down there too, damn it.
>At least you're twelve feet tall now and can just punt people like footballs if they get too close, so that's a positive.
>The only negative is that you're the butler of some uppity bird lady with a superiority fetish.
>She treats the help like shit, and charlie-horses the back of your leg every time you get too close because being three feet shorter than a 'sinner' is apparently unacceptable for a bird witch.
>Doesn't help that she always has some sort of asinine task to accomplish.
>Just today she demanded that you bring tea and sandwiches to them and her hoity-toity friends, slapped the tray out of your hands, threw hot tea in your face, and groped your ass before kicking you to the ground.
>So, it looks like you were eternally subservient to a bitch with a princess complex.
>Yep, this is hell.
>The sound of a ringing bell awakes you at dawn.
>Even though the broom closet you sleep in has no windows, you know it's dawn because Lady Goetia likes to make your afterlife a living hell and wakes you up the moment light crests the forsaken horizon.
>You dust off one of your uniforms, change out of your jammies and depart.
>Just another day ruled over by the bird.
>Answer the door and escort possible mercenaries or assassins to her quarters in order to gain her audience.
>Prepare breakfast for Lady Goetia and their family.
>Have the breakfast you toiled over thrown in the garbage by your mistress.
>Stare pleadingly at her ex-husband for the sweet release of super-death.
>Have your pleading go unanswered.
>It was just another morning.
>-and it wasn't even eight yet.
>Your lady loved making you do ridiculous things throughout the day- most of which directly hindering your work.
>Did she demand that you dust the furniture? Well, now she wants you to learn how to juggle and ride the unicycle for her company.
>At the same time.
>Are you supposed to assist in the re-shingling of the roof with the imps? Too boring for the bird mistress. Now she has turned it into a suicidal free-for-all where it's either the imps or you.
>You're gonna miss Mookie, but the guy tried to slice your throat.
>What's worse is by the time you got off the roof covered in the viscera of your coworkers- you were getting shoved into a suitcase and relocating to her brother's house.
>You're fairly certain she just threw you on the roof of a carriage, but it's pretty hard to tell through THREE INCHES OF BALLISTIC NYLON.
>There's the sound of stirrups being whipped, and you're off.
>Fuckin' whee~
>You're not sure if her brother is a nut, or not.
>He acts like one, but the important word here is 'acts.'
>Might be smarter than he lets on, or dumber than you think.
>Also might want to doink his own sister.
>You know that you shouldn't be surprised because it's hell but c'mon, man.
>In the meantime, between the divorce and other things- Lady Goetia has been becoming. . . Frustrated.
>-and guess who has to deal with that?
>"Butler! BUTLER, WHERE ARE YOU!?!"
>You walk with purpose down one of the many corridors of the palace you've wandered many times before.
>Your posture was perfect, your focus ahead, and the large cloche-covered platter balanced on your right hand did not so much as jostle.
>You moved your feet fast, but with precision each time Lady Goetia called.
>"BUTLER! IF YOU ARE NOT HERE IN FIVE SECONDS I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND MOUNT YOU TO THE WALL!"
>You knew better than to doubt her sociopathic claims; a sentiment shared by your legs as they sped up just enough to still carry you with a sense of class.
>The moment you arrived at her chamber door however, you were met with the owner of this abode- Andrealphus.
>You were smarter than to stand taller than anyone in this place, soon crouching slightly in something of an awkward curtsy; closing your eyes as not to make contact.
>"Best to head inside. She's losing patience."
>The sound of a door opening hit your ears.
>"Your butler is here with what you've asked, dear sister."
>There was the sound of a closing door followed by steps on a cold floor, as you opened your eyes to see Andrealphus wandering off away from you; leaving you with an ominous doorway and a forced obligation to open it.
>The stench of sex hit you like a wall in a way that made you flinch.
>It may have not have been unpleasant, but you knew who it came from.
>You strolled in with the covered platter taking lead just in time for a vase to fly across the room and smash into the door.
"You. . . IDIOT."
>There was your mistress; sitting upright in a lavish bed far too large to be appropriate for her own size.
>"It was about time you got here!"
>To save face, you bowed.
"Apologies, I will improve in the future."
>The high canopy of the bed that once creating a regal curtain wall of luxurious linens was now in tatters as she stared daggers into you.
>You wasted no time, quickly moving around the bed and setting the domed platter on her bedside table before removing the cloche to reveal. . .
>Sexual paraphernalia.
>Indeed, the frustration that Lady Goetia had been dealing with was of the intimate variety- this escapade of a divorce apparently going on for so long that she has apparently suffered from it carnally somehow.
>How this came to be was anyone's guess.
>By how little she fucked Stolas, you'd think the bird was biologically asexual.
>None the less-
>This has led to moments in the day where your mistress has indulged in lustful decadence.
>Phallic toys, lubricants, sexual devices, lustful stimulants- the works.
>It was such a a spread that you had to advert your gaze just to save face.
>Now, however, came the worst part.
>After quietly dismissing yourself outside the room, you were to wait for your mistress to finish using them; the sounds of furious masterbation beginning the moment those doors were closed.
>'Why-' you ask? Because she couldn't be expected to clean them all, herself.
>You're pretty sure that your mistress didn't even know how to use a sponge; much less hold it.
>It was disgusting, really.
>Any normal person would probably be turned on by such a thing, but you felt nothing.
>She was a spoiled brat that grew up into a rotten woman, and there was no amount of pheromones or sexual thoughts that could get past everything she has made you do over the years.
>That being said, today's session certainly was going on for a while.
>Seconds turned to a minute, and then two, then three, then five, then ten, and finally twenty-seven.
>You had to check your pocket watch just to be certain the clock in the hall was accurate.
>All the while, the noises in the room behind you were becoming all the more furious before devolving into exhausted panting.
>"BUTLER, GET IN HERE NOW!"
>You sigh when finally being able to pick yourself off the door and step inside once more to-
>Damn it.
>The room was practically in shambles.
>Furniture was overturned, sheets were slashed- even some of the wallpapers seemed clawed into.
>This was going to be a pain to clean.
"Yes, Lady Goetia?"
>You shut the door behind you as you got a good look at the toys scattered around the bed and floor, stepping over a dildo just to reach the foot of the bed.
>It was there that you could see the bird woman lying in bed, furiously staring at you.
>Her red eyes tried to burn into you while her form below her neck stayed mostly shrouded by a comforter.
>"You wish to be free of your servitude to me, is that correct?"
>Was this a trick question?
>Even behind her heavy breathing you could feel the presence of arrogance, but bit your tongue.
"It has crossed my mind during my many tasks, yes."
>There was a pause.
>"Then I order you to disrobe."
>A frown graced your mistresses presence as you stood still as you watched Stella rise to her feet stop the mattress- making her way toward you.
>She stopped at the foot of the bed, staring down at you with annoyance at your lack of movement.
>"-and if I refu-"
>Before you even know what is happening, there is a talon gripping your throat that yanked you onto the bed and flat on your back.
>"YOU DO NOT REFUSE ME!"
>It was a verbal, visceral eruption that truly reminded you of the pecking order between the sinners and the higher class of hell.
>You were pinned by the throat against the bed, the woman's sheer grip strength already strangling the airflow to your lungs.
>All the while, your eyes couldn't help but wander when it came to the form that now knelt over yours.
>It was the first time seeing your mistress bare; her form no-longer covered by a blanket to let you see everything her dignity compelled her to cover.
>A small set of breasts, and a pair of shapely hips covered in a soft plumage of feathers were what you pulled your eyes away from just in time to see Stella stare down at you with entertained distain.
>She seemed to almost forget that you were suffocating.
>"You had best listen because I am only saying this once-" she threatened with a tightening of her grip.
>"I am going to lessen my grip, and give you an order."
>You began to flail your legs pointlessly under her as she pressed a sharpened digit onto your chest and slowly began to press onto you.
>"If any other words come out of your mouth other than 'of course, mistress' during your time in this room, then I will kill you a thousand times before you are given the opportunity to try again."
>Your mistress loosened her grip, and you gasped in a lung-full of air.
>"Now, disrobe."
>The bleeding fury behind her gaze caused you to relent, a hand clumsily unbuttoning your vest.
"O-of course. . . Mistress."
>"-and I'll handle the bottom-" she demanded fruitfully when using a digit to pop the button off of your pants crudely.
>"I normally wouldn't stoop to doing such a thing with a dirt-thing like you, but there is little else one can do when the only other options are faulty toys, and family."
>In only a matter of moments you feel her digging around in your pants, pulling out your shamefully half-mast member.
>She gripped it, but couldn't fit the fingers of her claw all the way around; giving it long, firm strokes when staring at you with narrowed eyes and a crude smile.
>"I'll give you a deal just like I gave those abominations you call 'parents'."
>You didn't know what to be staring at, the sight of your owner disrobing you of your trousers just to grind against your shaft better or the devious stare she gave you.
>"Please me, and you may consider your bindings to me loosened. Understood?"
"Of course, Mistress."
>She only seemed to be half listening when positioning herself over you; using a couple digits to spread a soft plush-looking labia over the head of your shaft.
>"Good, fail me and I'll have you gutted."
>In a swift movement she already dropped, not only surprising you but herself as her knees caught her halfway down your cock with a sharp gasp.
>"FUCK ME!"
>You weren't sure if this was a demand or a swear at the ceiling, but you thrusted upward in a way that caused your mistress to shudder; her knees buckling to let her fall the rest of the way as you felt your tip hit the end of the road before hilting your length.
>"Damn you, you bastard. . ."
>Lady Goetia hissed as she arched over you, sharp teeth clenching as her hips grinded into you.
>"Don't just lay there like my pathetic ex-husband! Keep. Fucking. MOVING."
>You weren't sure if it was your dick taking over your brain functions, or the talon being pressed against your throat but it wasn't long before you had Stella Goetia bouncing on your dick with every thrust of your hips.
>"Harder. HARDER. Oh, for the love of- just let me do it."
>A surge of pleasure shot through you as your mistress slammed herself onto you- letting you know absolutely certain that you were smashing against the back wall of her depths.
>"Well, this is a pleasant surprise-" she spoke through breathy huffs. "You're not as useless in bed as I expected. Perhaps I should make you my personal dildo?"
>You didn't wish to dignify that with a response, but luckily it seemed like you wouldn't have to as somehow your mistress got even more intense with her motions- wrapping her arms around you as if to pull you into her.
>You felt like you weren't going to last much longer, and she could feel you throbbing inside of her so in one last motion she slammed herself on top of you in a way that you almost heard your pelvis pop.
>Her body almost spasmed when reaching climax- instead choosing to latch onto you and grinding until she felt you paint her walls white.
>Even in the after-glow of post coitus, your mistresses body domineered your own as in your mental fuzz you did not take more of your lady taking something off of her bedside table and putting it in your mouth.
>"I am far from satisfied. Let us continue."
>This was going to be a long day.

>get abducted
>they run a series of tests on you
>forget to beam you back down to earth
>you're a sex pet for alien squirrels now

>"Thaaaats it, you fuckin' freak. Deep huff"
>Your eyes practically roll into the back of your head
>Was this even real? It couldn't be, it was too good to be true!
>The derisive snicker from the crowded room was loud in your ears
>Almost drowning out the thumping electronic party music
>This was equal parts a nightmare too, having your degeneracy exposed to everyone you knew
>Some party
>"Did I tell you to stop?"
>Stephanie's commanding tone launched your tongue back into action
>Your nose was buried in her sweat-damp armpit
>Nostrils burning with the skunk's natural scent. All those oils really leeched into sinuses.
>Everything was going to smell like her for days.
>Your tongue dug through that wiry nest of pit-fur.
>Stiff bristles to dig through and savor the wetness
>If you were feeling poetic you might think of it as the 'Rain of a goddess'
>Rather than what it was
>The rank, unwashed pit of a rowdy skunk bitch.
>The wall slammed into your spine
>You groaned
>Trapped in her underarm now
>"Jeez, I think I can feel his dick on my thigh"
>Steph's words excited the crowd of friends and enemies
>All united in observing your perverse torment
>You kept lapping, sucking, drinking that girl's sweat
>Part of you hoped this was all filthy wet dream
>The other part was glad to have finally been exposed
>"Alright that's enough."
>She pushed you in the chest. Hard.
>It hurt!
>Your tipsy self fell backwards and sprained your hand when you fell to the ground
>You seethe
"What was that for?"
>She didn't reply, just pulled her left foot from her heavy boot
>The socked toes flexed
>Dripped with sweat
>She stepped on your face
>"Huff it, perv."
>The hangover
>It was bad
>You awakened laying face first with your head crammed into the pillows of a couch
>It wasn't your couch
>Must've gotten too drunk to get home
>You clamber up
>Everything smelled weird
>You were drenched in sweat
>Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt.
>You needed water... but first you needed...
>Your slow stumbling turned into a mad dash towards the bathroom
>At least - you were pretty sure this was the bathroom.
>Thank fuck! It was!
>Hunching over a toilet you turned your stomach inside out
>Then you collapsed next to it
>The taste of vomit staining your tongue
>There were footsteps
>"You alright?"
>Stephanie's voice
>She was half naked too
>What was she doi- oh.. right, this was her home.
"Aghhh.."
>You groan
"I'm fine"
>A few memories of what happened last night tore through your brain
>Your face in her pits
>Sucking her toes
>Even letting her put a collar on you and parade you around the place
>A feeling of sickness rose in you
>As if the literal sickness from the booze wasn't enough
>"You were pretty wild last night" She teased.
>You wanted to die
"Ugh, why did I do that"
>She helped you to your feet
>"I 'unno, you were horny? I'm gonna take a shower. If you want another stab at my armpits, you can join me"
>She shrugged
>You wobbled on your feet a little
"I'll just get a glass of water first"
>The blast of cold water shocked you wide awake
"Why didn't you warn me!"
>"Only works if you don't see it coming"
>You shivered
>The cold shower poured down down both of you
"I notice it works for you"
>"Yeah but you're a noob"
>What the fuck was that even supposed to mean?
>Whatever
>You grabbed some soap
"So..."
>You hadn't talked much about last night beyond the awkward run in
>"Yeah there's probably loads of video"
>She cut to the chase
>"Honestly, nobody's gonna care, don't worry about it"
>"Coulda been waaay worse, you're lucky it was me bossin' you around"
>She laughed, then put a bottle of shampoo in your hand
>"Mind getting my tail?"
>You diligently helped shower the skunk
>Her fur was soft
>At some point she turned the cold to hot
>The warmth was incredibly cozy
>You wanted to cuddle her
"That mean all the insults and stuff were uh?"
>"100 percent real, you're a degenerate"
>You gulp
>She cackles
>"But that just means I can make you my pet, right? Like, I've had boyfriends. Boyfriends suck."
>Her hands rest on your shoulders
>You glance to each and then to her eyes
>"A pet sounds way better"
>She pushes you down
>This time you go with it, crouching into a kneel
>"Good puppy."
>You had told her you were okay with the pet-play kink
>So long as it didn't bleed into your real life
>That was 2 weeks ago
>Currently you were sitting in a lecture hall taking notes... with a collar around your neck.
>Steph had spent the whole morning bullying you into putting it on
>You wish you'd had the gumption to fight back just a little harder
>But the way she said "Bad puppy!" just twisted the blade in your heart
>You realized you'd been staring into space for the past 5 minutes
>Everyone was leaving
>Blinking a few times you settled back into reality
>Then you crammed all your crap back into your bag and slung it over your shoulder
>Your hand came to your throat, felt up the collar
>You tugged on it a little
>It was kinda tight
>"That's the point, dummy. So you remember it's there."
>You remembered that alright.
>Trying not to think about it, you left the campus to find something to eat
>You walked past an alleyway without looking
>Out from it emerged a shadow which bolted past you
>Swiftly, smoothly a furry black hand swiped past your face
>Felt a tug on your neck
>Your eyes darted around til they landed on that black and white landing strip of a tail
>Then followed the leather strap that was hooked into your collar
"What the f-"
>"Puppy! I knew I'd find you around here, you always come here"
>You glanced at Steph, then down at your own collar
>Then again you let your eyes follow the leash to her fist
"Oh... oh shit. Oh please, Steph, please not in public!"
>Your whines just made her giggle
>"Come off it, you look cute like this!"
>She tugged on the leash
>"Now heel, puppy! We're getting lunch!"
>This was the most humiliating experience of your life
>Sitting across from Steph, eating a muffin, drinking a mocha-latte ...
>With a leash between your neck and her palm.
>You chose not to make eye contact with anyone in the cafe
>"Y'know~"
>You just watched your own slip-ons shuffle beside Steph's boots as you left the cafe
>"A real pet wouldn't pay for his own meals, he'd beg for his owner for food and if he was a good boy, she'd feed him"
>God her whispering was insidious
"I am not giving you my bank account"
>She snickers and gives you a little smack on the shoulder
>"Daw you're no fun! At least entertain the idea."
>You shoot her a disapproving glare
>"Hmf"
>You sigh
>"Puppy is sleeping on the floor tonight."
>Your eyes swivel back to her
>Disbelief all over your dumb face
"What!?"
>"You heard me."
"Why? Because I won't give you all my money! That's absu-"
>"No, it's because you're raining on my parade here"
>"If you act like this is spoils the mood"
>You can't believe this
>This is nuts
"What does that eve-"
>"Just play along! You don't actually have to do it, just pretend!"
>Oh.
>You felt a little silly.
>You also felt quite angry. Why were girls so difficult?
>"Anyway. Orders stand. Puppy is on the floor tonight."
"Steph, c'mon!"
>"Nuh uh! And I want a paw massage."
>You sighed
>You strolled down the street with her, you almost forgot you were on a leash a few times.
>After a couple minutes of silence she went back into teasing
>This time you leaned into it
>Let her fantasies run wild, she'd certainly indulged in yours.
>You didn't want to be ungrateful
"Oh um, there's something I forgot back at campus? Can I go get it?"
>You tugged on the collar a few times
>"Oh! Forgetful little puppy aren'tcha? Sure, lets go back!"
>Oh no.
"I meant on m-"
>"Oh I know what you meant, but you've been a bad puppy today"
>"I'm not letting you leave my sight."
>You gulped
>Asking your professor if he'd seen a little red USB stick shouldn't have been so nerve wracking
>But doing it with a collar around your neck ...
>With your 'owner' standing behind you, giggling ...
>While she tugged on your leash a few times just to fuck with you ...
>You'd never been so red
>Or felt so cold
>She hadn't even seen the thumbdrive, so it was a waste of time.
>You later found it crammed in the bottom of your bag
>The entire humiliating ritual of being waltzed around campus on a leash was for nothing
>Well..
>Maybe not nothing per se
>Steph was pleased
>Really pleased!
>You sat with your back against the foot of her bed
>The skunk's toned thighs wrapped your head
>Her feet were on your manhood
>All you could do was groan
>"Sorry about making everything so public"
>Surprisingly there was a hint of guilt in her voice
>It was still mostly lust though
>"I know you said you weren't ready for that but... God, it was hot! Right?"
>Your cheeks were already burning up. They had been for hours.
>The day had been extremely uncomfortable
>In part thanks to the ceaseless bulge in your pants
>You give another groan
>"You're not a bad puppy, just a scared puppy."
>"Still sleeping on the floor tonight though, I haven't changed my mind"
>You whine
>Her toes curl around your shaft
>A toepad grinds your frenulum
>"That foot massage was good though! So um, I've never jerked anyone off with my feet before, am I doing a good job?"
>You nod as well as you can with her thighs gripping your skull
>She giggles
>You throb, and then you explode.
>Her giggle grows to a snicker. Steph's toes wriggle. Your spent seed stains into her black fur.
>"Look what a mess you made, naughty boy"
>-- Six Months Later --
>Maybe it was a bad idea
>But you decided to move in
>You and Steph talked about it a bunch
>It was a pretty big step for a few reasons
>First just financially
>Suddenly the two of you had more money spend by splitting the rent
>But kink wise
>Thing were kicked up to 11
>You woke up curled at the foot of Steph's bed.
>You were naked, Stephanie was nowhere to be found
>With a sigh you crawled out from under the covers
>The bed was still warm. Smelled like her too
>It was cozy
>You laid on the pillow for a moment, rubbing your eyes
>Then you reached to the bedside table for your collar
>It had become a routine
>Your palm fell flat on the wood surface
"Huh?"
>You looked to your hand
>There was no collar here
>Strange
>You suddenly felt even more naked than you already were
>With a hop you climbed out of bed and pulled on some clothes
>Sweat pants and a t-shirt
"Steph? You home?"
>A couple seconds later her voice calls back muffled through the walls
>"Mhm! Bathroom!"
>Oh, okay
>You waited in the living room / kitchen
>Might as well make some breakfast
>You popped bread in the toaster, when you turned around you noticed something
>A box was on the countertop
>The label made your throat dry
>A couple moments later you heard your owner/lover bounding down the hallway
>Her tail waved behind her like a great fluffy black and white kite
"Uhm, did you buy a shock collar?"
>Her smile quickly melted into a scary grin
"Uh oh"
>"Oh yes."
>You stuffed the toast in your mouth and chewed
>"You're gonna be a good puppy ... Or else"
>You swallowed
"G-gentle"
>She cackled

>His face was buried in the cow's backside
>His cheeks were smooshed by the surprisingly grippy strength of her her doughy cheeks
>"Why've you stopped? You're down there til I finish this match remember?"
>He wheezed in a breath through flattened nostrils
>Then he put his tongue back where it belonged
>It slipped in with ease, her thick butthole was already lubed up with spit from before
>He couldn't complain really. Sure it was hot and muggy and kinda bitter tasting back there
>Still
>There was a cow with a deliciously fat ass sitting on his face
>Who doesn't want that?

>"Hey skinnie! You're under arrest!"
>What? You twirl around to see who just verbally assaulted you
>It's a cop. A very short cop.
>She tugs you by your tie and you nearly collapse onto her
"Whaddido?"
>"Were those words?"
>You swallow and try speaking again
"What am I under arrest for?"
>"Carryin' around those fat nuts"
>You blink
"What?"
>She smacks your crotch
>You wince and nearly double over again
>Now handcuffs fly out
"H-hey wait this can't be le-"
>"I'm a cop, dumbass, anything I say is the law"
>You're pretty sure that's not how it works
>"Now get in the car before I pull out my baton, I can get pretty... kinky with my baton."
>You do whatever this crazy bat cop wants
>"Great!"
>"Now fuck the shit out of me, I forgot my heat meds this morning."

>Give her the "fingerguns"
>Say, "Rat-a-tat-tat" as you "fire" off said "fingerguns"
How does she react?

I can see few scenarios playing out depending on which kind of a rat we are dealing with. Not huge rats necessarily
>Simple/Wild ratgirl: Quizzically inspects you. Thinks you are doing some sort of mating proposal and buries you underneath her body.
>Street rat: "Heh. That is quite funny. Want to see mine?" Follows this with pulling out her Tommy gun. She definitely belongs to a criminal syndicate.
>Officer Flint Scenario: "Aha aha. You got a licence to carry those "guns"? Yeah didn't think so. You are going to the station with me" Proceeds to handcuff you and interrogate you later.
>Mature rat matriarch: Doesn't really understand young peoples lingo and thinks you are stuttering. Still takes it as a compliment and hugs you tightly with your head trapped between her cleavage.

>Your head feels spinny, the tip of your cock rubs agaist her tummy fluff
>"If you cum right now I promise I'm gonna stop holding back during the next session"
>She's holding back right now?
>The toy keeps rubbing against that special spot back there
>"Come on, be a good boy and let it all out~ Do it for mommy"
>It's just too much for your poor prostate to handle
>You can feel it with your whole body
>Your load starts leaking out of your cock as she kisses you again
>The orgasm lasts twice as long as the normal one, your legs were actually shaking the whole time
>She just giggles and gives your balls a squeeze to get last drops of cum out of there

Anthros raid your village, burn it to the ground, taking all the men and goods. then they just expect the captured men to act like loving husbands from day 1, insanity.

What route do you take?
>Be a good sex slave/husband and live out your simple life to your assigned waifur?
>Begin gathering secretly with the other human males and begin plotting your strike in order to escape and form a rebellion?
>Begin psychologically manipulating your assigned waifur to make her start believing she should be the leader, and help her usurp the throne of her anthro clan with you at her side?

>wat
>seeing my confusion she explains
>”First wave candidates were the soldiers involved in the fighting, while they could wait for the state to assign them a husband most just selected from prisoners of war directly.”
>she sighs
>”But it is their right by conquest, to the winner the spoils and all that.”
>”Your wife will be selected from veterans that were ineligible in the first wave due to injury and members of the citizen corps.”
>”Not that there’s anything wrong with that!”

>”Smaller men are more my type.”

>squeezed my haunches, inspected my teeth, prodded my gut until I sucked it in
>”This one’s too pathetic, even for my tastes. Next!”
>ouch
>The receptionist tried to cheer me up after that
>desperate, I made a shot in the dark
>”Do you have a husband?” I asked
>the kind, sympathetic look she gave me then hurt more than being called pathetic

>Be Anon
>Sitting on the waiting room of a strange massage parlor
>You’ve been having a shit week at work
>You hurt your back lifting a heavy box
>Hopefully a massage will help ease your pain
>You found this place and found it to be pretty cheap than most other parlors
>”Anon? Cassandra’s ready for you.”
>You snap your head to the receptionist and make your way towards the stout otter, who hands you a key and points towards your room
>”Room 7. And by the way, Cassandra likes to take her time, hopefully that won’t be an issue!”
>You tell her you don’t mind and thank her
>You make your way towards the door and insert the key
>Turning it, you unlock the door and turn the handle
>It isn’t hard to find your masseuse
>A tall, overweight grizzly bear woman is setting up her oversized massage table for you
>God, you barely even reach her waist
>She looks at you and gives you a toothy grin
>”Well, hi there, sugar! You must be Anon, right?”
>The words are stuck in your throat
“I—uh, I’m—y-yeah! I’m A-Anon!”
>Your heart skips a couple beats
>Cassandra looks as soft as she is sweet
>”Perfect! Well, go ahead and take off your clothes and we’ll get started!”
>You take a moment to ogle at the motherly bear’s generous chest
>Her chubby belly
>Her wide hips
>You quickly shake those perverted thoughts out of your head and take off your clothes minus your underwear, last thing you need is a stiffy in front of this big bear woman
>You make your way to the oversized massage table, before looking up to Cassandra to ask her a question
“Uhhhh, isn’t this massage table too big for me?”
>Cassandra chuckles and waves a paw
>”Oh sweetie, trust me. You’ll need this.”
>You shrug and climb up onto the massage table, laying flat on it
>”Now, you said you hurt your back at work?”
“Ah, yeah. I must’ve pulled something while I was lifting a heavy box.”
>”Ahhh. Well, hopefully I can make that better, sugar. Let’s start with your shoulders, just lie down and relax.”
>Cassandra got to work by putting her big paws on your shoulders, and began massaging you
>Despite how large she is, she’s very gentle with her ministrations
>She hums as she works her paws downward, slowly going down your back
>”You doing okay, sugar?”
“Mhm.”
>You smile as you relax in her grip
>”Good. Just let me know if anything hurts.”
>Her paws continue massaging your back lower and lower, until they hit a certain spot, causing you to wince
>”Ohhhh, I can feel how sore it is down there. You still doing okay, Anon?”
“Y-Yeah, just–don’t go too hard, please.”
>Cassandra giggles and places her paw right on your sore spot
>”Don’t worry, sugar. I’ll go slow…”
>Cassandra gently soothes out your aching back, rubbing you in a circular motion
>You let out a pleasured groan as Cassandra rubbed your sore back
>Her soft pads slowly applied more and more pressure onto your back, soothing your aching muscles
>”That feel good, sugar?”
“Mmm, yes. Thank you.”
>”Good. Then you’re gonna love this.”
>Cassandra climbed onto the table behind you, resting her legs on either side of you
>Then, she slowly lowered herself on top of you, smothering the entire back of your body in her soft body
>You let out a happy groan as she just barely rests her weight on top of you
>You feel her soft breasts rest on the back of your head
>God, she feels like a giant waterbed
>”Let me know if I’m too heavy, alright?”
>You nod against her breasts as she starts grinding herself back and forth on top of you
>You let out happy sounds as her soft body caresses every inch of yours in her softness and heat
>It’s like a weighted massage blanket
>You feel your loins begin to stir, your dick growing hard
>Time loses meaning, and eventually she stops her full body massage on you to lift herself up slightly
>”Do me a favor and lay on your back for me, sugar?”
>You happily oblige, turning around to face her giant mammaries
>Cassandra lets out a happy hum as her chest falls down on top of your face, smothering you in darkness
>Her soft belly covers the entirety of your body, including your groin
>Her overflowing fat caresses every inch of your dick, drowning it in pleasure
>She giggled and resumed her grinding on your entire body
>”That’s it, sugar. Just relax and let me take care of all that stress on your body…”
>You’re in heaven, Cassandra’s soft body becomes your world
>Her soft boobs mash your face, and her big belly grinds on your dick
>You stifle a moan as her soft fat sends a wave of pleasure throughout your entire body
>She chuckles, and speeds up her grinding
>You try and tap her, but your arms are stuck to your sides, so you’re left helpless as she grinds more pleasure out of you
>Eventually it becomes too much, and you moan into her breasts as you climax
>Cassandra slows to a halt, and lifts herself up off of you
“O-Oh my God, C-Cassandra, I–I am so–”
>”No need to apologize, sweetie.”
>Cassandra gives you a warm smile and rubs your chest, looking at you with bedroom eyes
>She uses a pointed claw to touch your nipple, coaxing a moan out of you
>”Matter of fact, I think you’ve earned the premium package, free of charge. Follow me.”
>She makes her way to a room in the back as you get up off the massage table
>You follow her into a large doorway, watching her massive ass shake and wobble with each step
>It’s hard to ignore when your head is at the same height as her butt
>Once the two of you enter the room, you notice a large mattress embedded into the floor
>You look up at Cassandra, who gives you a comforting smile
>Then, she reaches for the hem of her pants and pulls them down in front of you, revealing her lower nude half to you
>Your face flashes beet red as you’re unsure of what reaction you should take
>But Cassandra still gives you that comforting smile as she does the same with her shirt, showing off her massive breasts and nipples
>”Go ahead and take off those boxers, sugar.”
“I—uh, I-“
>Cassandra chuckles and reaches for the hem of your boxers
“Oh, sweetie, don’t be ashamed.“
>She then pulls down your boxers and releases your erection from its fabric prison
>You look away, embarrassed to expose your most sensitive part of your body to her in its full form
>Instead, she simply hums and lays her paw on your shoulder
>”Go ahead and lay flat on your back, sweetie.”
>Slowly, you walk on the mattress floor and lay down in the middle
>Cassandra walks to your spot, standing on either side of you, and turns around, showing off her massive ass to you
>She looks down at you to make sure you’re there, and smiles
>”Take a deep breath, sugar.”
>Slowly, Cassandra lowers her butt down, it’s moving towards your face in slow motion
>Eventually, her fur grazes your face, then it’s her soft flesh and fat
>Once she’s low enough, her feet move underneath your head and push you further up, driving you deeper into her crack
>Then she fully lowers herself down, settling all her weight on top of your head
>She clenches her ass around your head a couple times to make sure you’re in place
>”Ah, nice and snug. Enjoying yourself down there?”
>You let out a happy groan as you wiggle your head deeper in between her cheeks
>”Hehe, I’ll take that as a yes.”
>She wiggles and grinds on top of you, forcing you deeper
>You turn your head to the right to give her cheek a kiss, before turning to the other side and doing the same
>Eventually, her fur starts getting thinner until it reaches a point where there’s nothing but rigid skin
>”Ooh, that’s the spot! Feel free to give it a kiss.”
>You quickly oblige, leaning in to give her pucker a quick kiss
>Cassandra slightly jumps, then slams back down, forcing your face against her asshole
>”Here, let me take care of you.”
>Cassandra wraps her paw around your pulsing rod with ease, covering the entire shaft and tip
>You moan and buck your hips into her paw, desperate for release
>”Don’t worry, sugar. Just relax and keep kissing.”
>You pucker your lips and kiss her asshole again, over and over until it’s covered in a thin layer of spit
>Cassandra responds by moving her paw up and down with a tight grip on your rod, coaxing pleasured moans out of you
>You respond by opening your mouth and licking her asshole, causing Cassandra to moan and wiggle her butt on top of you
>Eventually, you stick your tongue through her pucker and into her insides, lightly sucking her outer rim with your lips as you make out with her ass
>”Ooh, t-that’s the stuff! Keep going, sugar!”
>Cassandra huffs as she continues jerking you off in a faster speed
>You’re almost out of air, but you don’t care
>All that matters in the world is Cassandra’s ass
>You grope and squeeze her meaty cheeks as you start to grow lightheaded
>Unfortunately, Cassandra removes her paw from your dick and lifts herself up, leaving a thin saliva trail between her asshole and your mouth
>You hold onto her cheeks as she moves away from you, leaving you with a frown
>But as you sit up, you notice that she’s in front of you on all fours, looking back at you and spreading her ass apart, showing off her glistening asshole to you
>”You wanna finish, sugar?”
>You eagerly nod and make your way towards her butt
>You have to climb up on her big, fuzzy cheeks to line up your tip with her asshole
>Once you get set up, you thrust yourself forwards, and start pounding her ass
>The two of you moan together as her asshole consumes your dick up to the hilt
>”Oooh, that’s it sugar, keep going, I’m so close!”
>You feel your climax approaching fast, so you slow down your hips to pound her ass harder
>Her ribbed anal walls caress your entire shaft, sending waves of pleasure throughout your body
“Oh God, Cassandra, I’m—I’m…cumming!”
>”Oooh!”
>The two of you climax at the same time, your seed filling up Cassandra’s asshole, and her own spraying on the mattress below like a geyser
>Exhausted, you lay there with your dick still in her ass
“Oh my… Cassandra, that was… thank you.”
>Cassandra looks behind herself and winks at you
>”No problem, Anon.”
“I guess I should get going now. Can we do same time next week?”
>Cassandra gives you a grin
>”Actually, I was thinking we could do it at my house, how does that sound? That’s where most of my stuff is.”
>Your eyes grow wide
“R-Really? Sure!”
>Cassandra chuckles
>”Of course. Now, we should get ourselves dressed, we close in 10 minutes.”
>The two of you separate and gather your clothes, swiftly putting them on and making your way out the door
>Cassandra holds the door open for you, but not before leaning down and giving you a kiss on the cheek
>”See you next week, Anon! Here’s my address.”
>You take a paper note she’s holding out to you
“Y-Yeah, see you next week!”
>You reach for the cheek that she just kissed and rub it
>You wonder what equipment she’s talking about that she couldn’t bring to her job

>very dominant musky badgirl rat makes fun of you, bullies you, and makes you eat her ass all the time
>in the afterglow of rough sex she becomes cuddly and kissy and sweet momentarily

>The Anthrostate

>Cheetahs are one of the most accomplished anthro species
>Providing great contributions to society, mainly in the hard sciences
>Not to mention their excellence in sports like sprinting
>Howerver they have frequent issues related to anxiety and propensity to panic attacks
>Apart from the obvious health problems, those combine with their natural introversion and social awkwardness make than very poor at socialization
>What, not surprisingly, leads to low reproductive rates
>To solve this problem the best researchers of the government came with an ingenious solution
>Paring cheetah cubs with human babies as soon as possible
>Preferably at birth
>This way the human will serve as an solid life long emotional support
>And as they would grow up together mitigating the social awkwardness and communication issues, they would be the perfect mates for one another

What about like
>Cheetah/Human pairings understand that they are not siblings immediately from the beginning
>Despite this, they still live with each other as if they are siblings
>They're made to share beds, showers, any sort of situation where one could be vulnerable to the other
>This helps cement that they have each other completely, and that they can not only rely on each other but can trust each other whenever they're most vulnerable
>For added effect, the human/cheetah pairings are given long periods of time unsupervised, especially when the cheetah reaches sexual maturity + first heat
>At this point a cheetah can leave home and start her own life without (too much) anxiety, as she understands she can rely fully on her human mate
>They can then start a family themselves and continue pairing their offspring

>Psychologists become increasingly concerned over growing depression pandemic caused by modern problems
>See how humans who grew up with pet (feral) dogs are more happy long term
>Testing with pet dogs are not terrible, but it is clear that the relationship between an anthro and a pet dog is not as positive as it is with humans and dogs
>One day someone pointed out that perhaps it is the human factor
>Desperate, they took a young human boy and a female anthro, then had them grow up beside each other
>It was a startling success
>They were incredibly happy and got along very well
>More times this was repeated
>For an indescribable reason this only worked consistently with with male humans and female anthros
>All tests involving human females and anthro males sadly failed, sometimes even having the opposite effect
>However, the relationship between male humans and female anthros could not be ignored, with the former gaining emotional fulfillment and sense of intrinsic value, and the latter great confidence and newfound purpose, things that were greatly lacking in the day and age
>There are other changes in behavior however
>As they aged, the females viewed their adoptive "brothers" as something to protect and cherish, leaving the relatively weaker males more timid as they become more reliant on their "sisters" when in negative situations
>When asked what the females thought, they always answered to the tune of "I think he is much cuter like this"
>Despite growing up together, they seem to not recognize each other as true siblings, as platonic love very often turns to romantic
>The females will often push (sometimes forcefully) their false brothers into a relationship, and the males will accept it
>These couples are becoming increasingly common, to the point of overshadowing same species relationships
>Some are concerned as this might result in the disappearance of male anthros and female humans, as they are not interested in dating each other, and their usual partners are gradually looking for other mates
>However, some psychologists argue differently, calling it a self solving problem
>Leading psychologist and member of the Cross-Breed experiment Clawrissa Roberts stated "We are fixing the state of the modern world. Although it is sad that our brethren may disappear, is it not better for us to look toward the future? My son may not be of my race, but he will be happy. My daughter may not be of my husband's race, but she will be happy. Many of us are marrying outside of our species because it makes us happy. Suicide rates have dropped, the economy is growing, and culture has been thriving! My cheetah brothers are free to marry human women if they want it so badly, but I will not give up this beautiful world. Me and my husband will choose the path that makes us happy, and I believe my sisters and his brothers agree!"
>When her husband was asked if it was truly his choice as she said, he stated yes
>After being presented photographic evidence of his sexual assault during his college years by his now wife, he merely laughed awkwardly and said "she was really convincing."

Would female anthros having smaller tits would be considered a female equivalent of having a small dick?
>Get’s her clothes ripped off by accident
>Exposes her flat chest in front of the humie bois
>”Haha! It’s so small and flat!!”, “Is her breasts dry as bones?”, “She made flashing pretty boring haha!”
>”S-Stop it! I’m not flat!! I’m a late bloomer, I swear!!” 

>Sorry, lil Humie, but your male protagonist might be a bad role model for our humie children. Standing up and be your own man? Questioning the female anthro’s demands and motivation? Be strong and independent humie? Sorry, babe. But let us the PROFESSIONALS do the direction now. We want to make a good role model for our boys to follow.

>Fox waifur
Will trick you into breaking some obscure fae-spirit law that makes you her property, will then keep you in her spirit realm until you've impregnated her at least seven times.
>Cow waifur
Will capture you after you've exhausted yourself trying to escape her labyrinthine lair. Be prepared to eat lots of dairy for the foreseeable future, you'll need the bone strength for what comes next.
>Rat waifur
You'll become the husband of a powerful rat warlady who will then share you with the female rats who have served her particularly well. Musk, lots of it.
>Hyena waifur
Even more musk and now with armpit licking. Be prepared to father an entire tribe. Also be prepared to wake up to your hyena waifur sporting a few new scars from fending off another band of horny yeens who wanted you for themselves.

>Snake waifur
Much bigger than you, has a cold front but if you look past it you'll find that she shows a great deal of love for you. Typically easy and slowgoing but if you get her aroused she'll pounce on you with surprising speed and determination. Won't let you go once she has you.

>So you do, following one of the paved walking paths that follows the coastline
>Your eyes are filled with beautiful feminine beach bodies, both human and anthro alike and the occasional guy getting entirely too much attention
>Thankfully, youve always stayed dedicated to being /fit/ so you dont look out of place here
>Debate posting a picture saying that "we're all gonna make it" on your favorite peruvian mineral manufacturing forum
>While your mind is preoccupied with those kinds of mundane thoughts, your feet are still carrying you forward
>You nodded absently in wordless greeting to a trio of women on rollerskates, one giraffe who towered over you and two humans
>You needed this. An escape from your hectic office job. Yeah, you were making money hand over fist but was it making you happy?
>No. But its easier to be sad in a big house--
>Your thoughts come to an abrupt end when you feel something sniffing your behind
>You look back thinking its probably an overly friendly dog
>It isnt.
>The giraffe woman is leaned over, her long neck extended to its limit as she's taking deep breaths of you.
>You tense up, at first shocked by this entirely alien situation
>You werent bad looking by any stretch of the imagination but if you wanted companionship, it was always you who had to make the first move
>You speed up, your head turned and glued on this rollerskating giraffe all the while as she speeds up to keep pace
>If youd been thinking at the moment, you wouldve just stepped off the pavement and youd get away easily
>You werent as you felt your heart to start thundering in your chest at this surreal situation and your flip flops making your escape attempt an ungainly waddling gait, more like a broken kite stuck in the wind than a clean sprint
>Your head is still turned as you begin to get some distance on her.
>Rollerskates be damned, she was not catching up to you.
>You shout out in exhiliration as she reaches out and says something
>She isnt looking directly at you anymore but whats in front of you
>You face forward just in time to scream out as you run full tilt into a tree. The trail pavement had bent around it like a wriggling worm
>After knocking yourself unconcious, you came to for only brief moments
>You felt her haul you onto her shoulder with surprising ease
>You heard her friends laughter as you dangled there, for all the world hardly any better than a bag of potatoes in that moment
>The last thing you remember is being flabberghasted and resentful as your impromptu stretcher had the gaul to cop a feel of your butt
>You woke up with a start. Immediately you tried to orientate yourself as you took in unfamilliar surroundings.
>The beeps of hospital machinery releasing the coiled tension in you and your whole body deflated as you unwound and relaxed back into the bed
>That was until the giraffe walked in, following a doctor who mustve come by to do the rounds on you
>The only plus was that he spoke surprisingly good english as he gave you a run down of what happened
>Youd been out for about half a day. Theyd done some test already and the only issue they found was your dehydration and the massive bump on your forehead. They wanted to hold onto you overnight and baring any unforseen circumstances, youd be discharged in the morning
>Not exactly the start to your vacation youd been expecting
>You reached up to gingerly touch your wound, wincing as you confirmed that it was indeed painful
>The giraffe woman had been waiting off to the side the entire time. She had a boquet of get well flowers in her hand as she scrunched over to avoid scraping her head against the ceiling
>You knew there were plus size anthro rooms but for a brief moment, you wondered what it would be like to be stuck in a world that wasnt built for your size.
>She wordlessly handed the boquet to you.
>You wondered if you were going to have to dig out that translation app you had downloaded on your phone
>Begrudgingly, you thanked her for the flowers
>She seemed to think that was you extending an olive branch and visibly relaxed when you addressed her directly
>"So." You start and she flinches. "What the hell was that all about?"
>Its clear she didnt understand a word you said.
>She fishes for her own phone and holds it up speaking into it for a moment.
>The robotic text to speech playing back the translation
>"I am sorry. I should have caught you sooner. Your waddling run was too cute."
>You felt yourself getting annoyed
Not "Im sorry for molesting and chasing you." No. She was sorry for enjoying the show and not nabbing you sooner. The implication that she thought she could catch you whenever she wanted wasnt lost on you.
>The throbbing that felt like it was right on your brain wasnt helping your patience either
>You motion for her to hand over the phone to translate what you were saying.
>After a moment's fiddling you figure it out. "You didnt answer my question." You adopt an icier tone. The one that made your team at the office sit up and pay attention during presentations "Why did you chase me to begin with?"
>She listens to the replay before answering.
>"You smell nice. And your beauty appeals to me greatly. I wished to know you better." The electronic voice informed me dispassionately.
>Right. Dogs sniffed each other in greeting. You didnt know many anthros, your residence and line of work keeping you separated as surely as any border fence would
>It wasnt impossible that giraffe anthros sniffed each other in greeting. Still...something about it seemed suspicious
>You didnt want to get involved any further
>You did the back and forth with her phone again. You accepted her apology, for whatever it was worth, and tried to wash your hands of the matter
>She, however, had other ideas. Insisting to make up by inviting you out to dinner. You pointed out you didnt even know her name
>She quickly rectified that by informing you her name was Marie and she was Ivorian born, as in the Ivory Coast or Côte d'Ivoire as she had said
>You didnt even know that was an actual country until she just told you
>Feeling a little more ignorant than you shouldve, you told her you were Anon born in Georgia and living in D.C.
>She thought you meant the country and not the state until you corrected her
>Shouldve just said you were American, it wouldve been easier
>Having to share a device to speak to one another couldve been a source of frustration but it quickly became a source of intimacy instead
>Having to listen to someone's intonation and then parse what they were saying was something you'd never done before. And that was probably true for Marie as well.
>The dispassionate electronic voice failing her french flirting in spectacular fashion and so she opted to take a different rlute with you
>Body language.
>She had been sitting on the actual floor and was still above eye level with you. She rested her head next to your shoulder, giving you bedroom eyes as you spoke into the phone, answering her questions or thanking her for the compliments she was generously throwing your way and doling out your own
>She was a looker afterall. And you'd seen just how curvy her body actually was in the foggy, now almost forgotten memory of your first encounter.
>She was just so...long. Long neck. Long torso. Long legs. Your lower head was already attempting to math out the geometry of how it would work out.
>In the mean time, her hands would linger a little longer on yours as you passed the phone back
>That escalated into more careful, chaste and exploratory touches
>You ran your fingers down her long neck, her spotted fur surprisingly smooth and soft.
>For some reason you were under the impression that it wouldve been coarse
>You explored spots that even she had trouble getting to without the aid of tools like long handled brushes and she reveled in your "soft, petal like touches" if the translation was accurate.
>And soon, you discovered how long her tongue was when you kissed
>It had started with a peck but now, she had the entire length of that wet prehensile ribbon of muscle down your throat
>Your own, flatter tongue was hopelessly outmatched but youve always been stubborn in your own way. Stubborn enough to run face first into a tree at least and so even as she dominated the insides of your mouth and coiled around your own tongue with all the surety of constrictor squeezing the last gasp from its prey, you moved. Pressing your lips harder. Wiggling your tongue free to keep up the fight the moment she slackened.
>You didnt need to come up for air. Somehow demanding that she drown you in her affections and she was all too willing to oblige.
>Her taste was as sacchrine sweet as the act itself. Some sort of fruity drink lingering in her mouth.
>Between that, your lingering concussion and the definite lack of oxygen and you were feeling like your whole body was tipsy.
>Your drunk and dumb fingers still drawing sensual shivers as they traced over sensitive spots
>Even with your eyes closed you began to feel the edges of your vision begin to darken and your eyes to swim
>But she refused to break the lock you had put yourself into.
>You would not be released until you passed out or she was satisfied
>Stubbornly, you held on. You could tell just how much she was enjoying this.
>Your whole body began to vibrate. Your lungs and their demands no longer ignorable.
>Soon they started to all but scream for relief.
>And finally, as tears started to form in your eyes and your struggle seemed to slow, you felt her tongue withdraw from the depths of you
>You heaved in one large breath after another as she changed positions, awkwardly on her knees, she was tall enough for her bossom to be in line with your head
>It couldnt have been comfortable for her but she pulled you towards her chest and repeated the same words over and over.
> "respire" you think she said
>Finally back in control of yourself, you began to appreciate how large her breast were
>Proportionally, they were a tasteful size on her body. Not so small as to be flat, but not so large as to be competing with her other assets
>Being directly between them gave you a fresh understanding of perspective as each globe was in actuality the size of your head.
>With your passionate kiss broken, both of you firmly became aware of your manhood straining against the hospital blanket
>There was something about her demeanor that seemed to change as she locked in on your meat.
>It was...predatory.
>Thats right. Thats exactly how her behavior could be described.
>Before you could get a word in edgewise, she had already pulled the blanket aside.
>Your penis a furnace against the bitter cold they kept the hospital at.
>She was already extending her neck. Like when she chased you, she was taking deep whiffs as she buried her nose into your crotch
>You froze in place when you felt an exploratory lick across the head of your dick
>Fuck. That felt good. You'd cum in no time if she really decided to get to work.
>You werent some semen retention proselytizer but it had been awhile since you'd catered to those specific needs and now with a womans faced buried in your crotch and huffing your balls it was at the forefront of your mind.
>Still you were a gentleman first and asked about her knees. No way was cold hard tile being kind to her fine legs.
>She stopped, the trance your musk had put her in was temporarily broken.
>She glanced at the time and then the door before seemingly making up her mind.
>She shimmied out of the shorts she'd been wearing as you seared the image into your mind
>You'd always been a legs man instead of just tits or ass and she had them for days.
>Just that tantalizing little show had put you on edge already and when she straddled your bed, bringing her sex directly in line with your face, you couldve cum from that
>She said something in french but you didnt need a translator for what she wanted as she pressed herself down onto your face.
>You always figured anthros would have strange and exotic genitals but everything was basically where it was supposed to be so maybe that wasnt the case. Or maybe Marie was the exception. Not that it mattered.
>You eagerly lapped at her sex but it took you a moment to find a comfortable way to bring your fingers into the action.
>Before long she was pressing down on you with more weight. The knot on your forehead a forgotten concern as she sought out more pleasure from you.
>You felt her go back to huffing you in.
>Now that you were already giving her head, the larger of your two brains was trying to do the math om what sex would be like with her.
>She was just so big. You had pride on your own size but you couldnt help but wonder if you could ever possibly satisfy a woman like this.
>Until you stuck a finger to the knuckle in her
>You heard a low groan and felt that damp wet tightness squeeze and massage at your digit.
>That expelled all doubts for you.
>You continued to lavish her with minstrations from your tongue. Taking extra care to swirl and roll her clit before expertly retreating when the sensations started to become overwhelming and transform away from pleasure.
>She still hadnt touched you beyond the occasional lick and her breath tickling and tightening your balls. Seemingly content to just breathe you in. It was torture.
>You wanted her so badly, it was all that could occupy your mind now. Perhaps you werent any better than her afterall. You were practically ravenous for a release that wasnt coming.
>Seconds turned into minutes and minutes into hours as time continued to march past.
>Not that you were aware of that. All you knew was that your tongue was tired, your jaw hurt and based on the way she tensed and trembled youd given her more than one orgasm
>Your stubborn side was starting to rear its head again. You wouldnt quit before she did.
>That was until she rose from her position
>You thought visiting hours mightve been just about done as regret sunk into your core.
>She faced towards you now. Thinking she wanted to kiss again, you started to sit up.
>She pushed you back down into the bed hard enough to take the wind out of you with an oomph.
>Grabbing your legs, she pushed them towards your head, giving you an involuntary stretch you werent quite ready for.
>You knew what this was. Some sort of amazon position you'd seen in porn before. You coulnt get your protest out fast enough as she used her long neck and tongue in a stunning display of flexibility to grab your dick and angle it proudly towards the ceiling where she proceeded to impale herself on it
>The sudden jolt of pure pleasure mixed with the pain of being stretched, unexpectedly manhandled and having your thighs serve as a cushion for the pushin as she used the springs of the bed to bounce you into her was euphoric
>You'd been craving this since that first kiss. No. Youre a liar. Some part of you had wanted this since you saw her skating past you.
>And now in a strange turn of fate, she was utilizing all her natural gifts to be the one jackhammering you into the bed
>Grabbing fistfuls of white bedding and holding on while this storm rode you was all you could do.
>The inexoriable buildup happened whether you wanted it to or not. There was part of you that was drinking all this in and wanted the moment to last forever. Another part wanted you to flood her womb white and fulfill a primal need to breed a fine woman.
>A quiet part of you though, wondered how and why you were being fucked senseless by a giraffee woman youd known for less than a couple of hours.
>Even as you desperately desired to race to the finish line, you didnt want to deal with the aftermath of reaching there.
>It wasnt like you had any choice in the matter anyways. Marie was dedicated to the task at hand and your cock practically pulsed in time with your heart beat.
>Your orgasm came not like a breaking dam but like a thunderbolt from a blue sky. It tore through you in an instant and you could feel her pistoning even harder as your groans escaped your lips and your ejaculate erupted inside her.
>You felt her convulse around your shaft, and a sudden wettness clued you in on the fact that she had just squirted as you came.
>Slowly she let your legs down back onto the bed to rest. Your semi-hard cock dragging a few more delicious sensations from you as it was freed from her grasp
>You were breathless, exhausted and covered in a myriad of fluids. It took you a moment to collect yourself
>Marie let herself fall on top of you. Careful to not hit you with all her weight. The bed creaked as it supported both of you.
>You both stayed like that for a moment. No words spoken. No need for assurances, quick exits or awkward goodbyes. Simply comfortable in one another's presence.
>Absently you stroked her neck again. Her fur was slick with a slight lather from the exertion.
>Visitation hours had to be almost over now. You wondered if youd ever see her again now that she'd gotten what she wanted.
>You were worried that you wouldnt. Youd started this strange relationship completely wrong. First with an accident and then with sex but that stubborn you, the country boy that had made it big, wasnt ready to give up yet.
>You watched her go into the restroom to dress. She came out with a towel to wipe you down as well. She was careful like she was polishing a marble statue.
>You grabbed her hand and decide to make a joke of it if only to hide your own vulnerability. "Usually, I get dinner first..." you start but you fall silent when you realize she doesnt understand a word you said
>Your expression might not have been the best when she quickly fished for her phone and opened the app again
>"Whats wrong?" She asked.
>"Will I see you again?" You ask back
>She pulls you into an embrace, wrapping her long neck around you in the process. It also reminds you just how much stronger she is than you, despite how many hours youve put into being aesthetic.
>"Oui."
>You know that one at least. Along with je m'appelle and omelette du fromage which made up your entire French lexicon. But you were determined to learn more.
>She said something else into the phone. This time particularly emphatically.
>The electronic voice relays the words to you, unconcerned about it's owners emotions.
>"From when I first saw you, I had decided you were mine."
>You press yourself harder into her. You werent sure if this was love or just something crazy but you were looking forward to finding out.
>You take her phone and speak into it "About that date...."

>anthros usually enter puberty faster than humans, girls being fastest

>she’s extremely pissed off by this
>she starts getting a little snotty in private, then she starts to lampoon you in front of your friends
>it gets to the point where she’s doing it constantly
>day in and day out, in class and at home, she picks at you
>you start to doubt your and her friendship, she was never like this before
>her birthday is coming up though, and despite misgivings you decide to be true to all those years of friendship
>you arrive on time, and you’re greeted by her mother, who’s ecstatic to see you
>she brings you into the living room, and gives you a little party hat
>your friend comes in quickly after
>she’s still not normal, picking at you and the little hat you rode in with
>you take the hits and hide your irritation, you give her her present, and join in with other guests
>by the time the party’s waning you start to walk out the door
>”Anon, wait!”
>her mother stops you before you can take off
>she tells you about the afterparty, the sleepover, and that you’re invited
>you sigh and agree, expecting to give it another hour before sneaking back home
>you open the door to her bedroom, expecting to see a couple other anthros hanging out
>there’s no one there
>before you can even turn around, someone’s grabbed you from behind
>whoever’s pressed up against your back is intensely hot, as if a furnace had just arrested you
>judging by the two soft pads of plush fat, it’s probably an anthro, and a woman too
>she’s feeling you up, hands either rolling up or down your body, searching for your sensitive spots
>”I’ve waited for this since my last birthday.” Her breath is hot.
>”Hope you liked the carrot cake. You’re gonna need the calories.”

>Be asked to slay a dragon
>Find her cave and charge in, ready to fight or die for your king
>The dragon is a fuckhuge nerd with braces and glasses in every sense of the word
>Almost get knocked out by her smell, stopping you in your tracks
>"Oh boy, a knight from the human kingdom, they are so rare these days!"
>She picks you up and grins
>"I have a special place for you."
>She turns around and you find a jar labelled "human knight"
>"Don't worry, I will make sure there isn't too much. I can't have a rare knight like you drowning."

Why are anthros so obsessed with you eating their produce?

You think they're really gonna let you drink/eat some other hussy's inferior produce?
>cows not letting you drink any milk but their own
>no other eggs beside your chicken gf/wife's
>sheep/alpacas making you wear clothes only from their wool

>”Thank you! I can be quite a expressive type” my son blush
>The chubby fox grabbed a big chocolate cupcake and shove a WHOLE piece in her mouth, “Now… *burp* exactly, what is your specialty, lil cutie?” She said with a hint of seduce in her lips

>I looked on one side, a ugly wrinkly rat women smiling creepily at my human son as she lick her lips like he’s nothing but a lollipop for her aging gums to suck on her disgusting mouth!
>The other side is a young Horse women, tallest of the bunch, muscular of the bunch, and devious of the bunch

>a forked tongue flicks out from behind her teeth
>"So cute!"
>the demoness straightens out, clasping her paws together and bouncing in place

>"Oh! Did you want out? Here, release!"
>she cuts the air with a claw, and you fall out of the summoning circle

>"Come back here hon, I wasn't done!"
>you find your body turning around and marching you back to the rat

>"I know you're excited and all, but first things first!"
>she reaches down toward your neck
>oversized paw easily wrapping around it
>in spite of your terror, you find the silky fur strangely comforting as it slides over your neck
>when she retracts her paw, you have a collar around your neck
>"There!"
>the collar is supple black leather, with a golden loop on the front
>dangling from the loop is a silver bell that jingles softly

>you finish with a few final spurts, soaked in sweat and more as you lay in a puddle on your study's stone floor
>"Good boy!"
>Kar'nassa beams down at you like you had brought her a toy
>and not just had the most mind-melting orgasm of your life
>"Now speak!"
>your voice comes out in a low moan
"What's going on?"
>the firelight in her eyes flicker as the demoness gasps
>"Oh! Oh no! Did you not--Do you not know what you did?"
>you shake your head miserably
>Kar'nassa gasps again
>"Oh no! Poor thing! Poor little human boy!"
>you're pulled into her lap as she sits down on the floor with you
>her arms go around your midsection and she holds you to her body
>your head nestled between her breasts
>"Oh and you're such a mess."
>Kar'nassa waves her paw over you, and with a tingling sensation, your stained robes and breeches disappear
>leaving you totally naked for her paws to trace over your bare skin
>and for you to feel the infernal heat of her body wrapped around yours
>it's more a comforting warmth
>you open your mouth and find yourself still able to speak
"What happened? What did I do?"
>Kar'nassa coos and starts to pet your head
>those claws looked like they could shred you
>but they feel so good scratching through your hair
>"You summoned me to be your master, sweetie-kins. The rune of servitude made it so you listen to my every command, and the rune of submission made it so you'll love serving me with all your heart."
>you groan
"Oh gods. How could I have done this?"
>Kar'nassa's arms go around you again and start squeezing you
>"Oh no, baby, please don't cry. I'm not a mean demon. I'm gonna take such good care of you. Everything is going to be okay, alright?"
>you blink away tears and find yourself somehow believing her
>Kar'nassa is going to take good care of you
>wait
>that's not right
"C-Can't you let me go?"
>you get another squeeze that drives the air from your lungs
>"No pookie! You're way too cute to let you go! What if you mess up again, and a nasty evil demon takes you?"
>your attempt to protest is shushed by a giant finger pressed against your lip
>"Besides. The rune of binding binds your soul to mine eternally. I couldn't let you go even if I wanted to."
>eternally?
>you tremble in spite of Kar'nassa's comforting embrace
>she seems to notice
>"Oh please don't be sad. I promise, you'll love your new home, I have a beautiful palace, and you can sleep in my bed, and I'll feed you and walk you and..."
>the embrace around you loosens
>one of the arms reaching down to start teasing your cock to life once again
>"...and I think I know how to cheer you up again."
>her other paw disappears
>and with a 'click' her bra falls off her chest
>"Lay down for me baby."
>you don't have a choice
>letting Kar'nassa lay you down on your back as she simply magics away the rest of her clothes
>you're surprised to see her nipples aren't pitch black
>but rather one is pink and the other a warm brown

>the same pink as her pussy that grinds against your hardening cock
>she smiles down at you
>"Okay my good boy, ready for your next command?"
>you whimper
"Y-yes."
>Kar'nassa grins wide, guiding your hands to her hips and lowering herself down to engulf your head in her breasts once again
>you feel her speak the next command as much as hear it
>your tip prodding her entrance as she wiggles her hips teasingly

>The first thing that catches your eye is their figures
>They each have breasts bigger than your head, you could probably be smothered under them
>They have well toned abs, visible even through their fur

>You yell into your gag, trying to beg for mercy
>The wolf women snicker and laugh at your struggles
>The tallest one in the middle walks up to you, you assume her to be the pack leader
>”Relax, human. We will not hurt you, unless you make us.”
>You shiver as she flashes her teeth and licks her chops
>She turns around to the other two wolves and barks a command at them in her tribal language
>The other two wolfesses walk towards you; you try and squirm away but they easily overpower you
>Surprisingly, they take off your gag and untie your restraints
>You take this as an opportunity to make a run for it, so you immediately get up and dart past the leader
>Unfortunately, she grabs you by the hair and sends you flying across the ground, knocking the wind out of you
>”Trying to escape your punishment, human?”

>The leader suddenly howls into the air, interrupting your protests
>Once her howl settles, she looks at you with a growl
>”You trespassed our lands! It does not matter what intentions you had planned, no human is allowed on our lands!”
>She barks another command at the two other wolf women, who flip you over on your stomach and hold you down by your arms
“No! Please, I’m sorry! I’ll do anything!”
>The leader chuckles as she steps closer to you
>”I love it when they beg. Now human…”
>She grabs your thighs and lifts them up, leaving your rump up in the air
>The leader leans her snout in, and you shiver when you feel her nose pressed up against your asshole
>You tense up when she flicks her tongue out and drags it along your entire asshole
“Ahhh! P-Please, stop! That–ow!”
>You yelp when she sticks her tongue through your hole and inside you
>Tears start streaming down your cheeks as she circles her tongue around your insides
>Eventually, she reaches a certain spot that makes you moan loudly
>The leader lightly clamps her teeth down on your ass and uses her tongue to gently rub your sweet spot and thrust her tongue in and out of your asshole
>You start to feel a pressure building in your groin as you moan and cry
“Please, s-stop! Ahhh, that–oh, God!”
>You hate this, but some sick, twisted part of you deep down inside you really likes this and wants her to keep going
>Fortunately, she retracts her tongue out of your asshole, and lets go of you, leaving you limp on the ground
>She tells the other two something in her tribal language; they flip you over onto your back as you catch your breath
>They leave you as they lay down near your groin, their breasts dangerously close to your hard, leaking rod
>The leader walks towards your head, turning herself around and showing off her extra large rump, each gray cheek bigger than your head
>You’re greeted by the sight of her pussy and asshole, catching a whiff of her intoxicating scent
>You try to back away, but the two wolves on your groin hold down your legs
>The leader holds down your torso to keep you from squirming too far
>She sways her ass from left to right, presumably to spread more of her natural pheromones into the air
>It makes you slightly dizzy
>”Now then, human…”
>She then sits down hard, engulfing your entire head into her fluffy cheeks
>”Enjoy the taste of an alpha.”
>Her pussy lands squarely on your lips, coating it in her sticky juices
>Some of it dribbles into your mouth
>You don’t want to taste her, this is wrong
>But her scent is starting to have an effect on your brain
>As if unwillingly, you stick your tongue out and get a taste of her pussy
>It’s oddly sweet with a coppery aftertaste
>”That’s it, human. Even those with the strongest minds succumb to the scent of an alpha.”
>The alpha gives another command to her underlings, and they quickly get to work
>You feel a pair of soft, furry mounds squish on either side of your cock, causing you to instantly buck your hips
>You hear girlish giggles as their soft tits mash against your cock
>They start moving their boobs up and down, up and down, getting more pleasure out of you
>You lick the alpha’s pussy with more vigor, sticking your tongue deep into her folds
>You take a deep inhale of her asshole, filling your lungs with more of her musk
>The two wolves on your crotch mash their tits against each other, choking your dick in a fleshy, fuzzy prison
>You feel their rock hard nipples graze along your shaft, making you moan and buck your hips
>The alpha above you grunts as you continue eating her out, her claws digging into your ribs
>You yelp and grab at her cheeks to try and warn her to not scratch you, but she does so anyway, leaving trails of blood along your ribs
>You let out a muffled scream of pain and slap at her ass, but she keeps herself still, chuckling and wiggling her hips deeper onto you
>”What’s wrong, human? Can’t take a little pain? Keep tasting!”
>Despite the stinging pain on your chest, the wolves at your groin keep you pleasured, causing a strange mix of emotions
>You moan loudly when they lean in and start licking your tip, barely poking out from between their boobs
>You buck your hips hard as they overstimulate your leaking rod
>Your pleasure continues to build, the scent of the alpha, the soft fleshy tits on your shaft, the licks on your tip, it’s all too much
>Eventually, you explode, coating the wolves’ tits in your sticky seed
>The alpha above you sighs, and lifts herself up off of you, leaving a trail of her sticky juices connected to your mouth
>She speaks to her underlings who get off your now limp rod
>You try to back away, but the underlings grab your arms and hold you down
>The alpha squats over your dick and holds it in her hand, lightly stroking it back to full mast
“Please…Let me go.”
>The alpha laughs as she watches tears fall down your cheeks
>”Once we have mated, you will become part of our tribe.”
>She then lowers her lips onto your dick, you moan and cry as your dick enters her pussy
>She starts riding you, slamming her hips up and down on you
>You buck instinctively, but she’s way too heavy to let your hips go anywhere
>Her tight walls clench around your dick, you feel like she’s squeezing it flat
“Ahh, please, stop! No–mmph!”
>One of the wolves on your side silences your protests as she grabs your head and forces her tongue into your mouth
>You try to back away, but she puts her paw on the back of your head and pushes you against her
>Your eyes roll in the back of your head as her tongue travels down your throat, triggering your gag reflex
>The other wolf leans in to nibble at your ear, whispering sweet nothings in her tribal language
>It doesn’t help comfort you, especially when you’re being raped by a wolfess twice your size
>You moan into the wolf’s mouth as the alpha slams her hips hard onto you
>”Fill me, human. Fill me with your seed. Give in.”
>You try your best to not cum, but the tight, wet walls of the alpha are impossible to resist
>Your pleasure reaches a peak, and you fill the alpha’s womb with your cum
>You let out a muffled moan as the alpha’s pussy tightly clenches on your dick, squeezing more seed out of you
>She doesn’t moan when she cums, instead she grunts as her juices squirt on your waist
>The alpha lifts herself off of you, and her underlings move away from you
>You want to escape, but you’re too exhausted to move
>You feel your eyes grow heavy, and you close them
>But just as you’re about to doze off, you feel one of the wolves grab your mouth and force your jaw open
>Your eyes grow wide as the alpha holds a bowl and pours some sort of honey-like liquid into your mouth
>You try to spit it out, but she quickly covers your mouth and holds her claws dangerously close to your neck, grazing your skin as she growls
>”Swallow.”
>You reluctantly take a big gulp, letting the thick substance travel down your throat
>You look over to the side as a big, chubbier wolfess enters the tipi, followed by a few more wolves
>You’re starting to feel funny, whatever they made you swallow it’s already taken effect
>Your dick grows painfully hard, you groan as it grows a few inches beyond its normal size
>You try to move, but you find all your limbs lying uselessly
>The alpha stands over you as you lie there completely limp
>”You’re going to spend the night mating with our tribe, human.”
>You open your mouth to speak, but the chubby wolfess suddenly stands over you and squats her fat ass down near your face
>You catch a whiff of her musk, but for some reason, it makes you feel…really horny
>She giggles as she wiggles her ass side to side
>You buck your head into her ass, feeling those super soft pillows squish into your face
>The wolfess lets out a gasp of surprise as she coos something in her tribal language before she settles her ass down on your face
>Her asshole lands on your mouth, and you quickly get to work by slathering your tongue all over her pucker
>You feel another wolfess on your groin, teasing you by blowing air on your rock-hard dick
>You moan loudly into the wolfess’s asshole as your dick throbs
>It’s going to be a long night…

>the door to the recruitment office swings open
>three pairs of eyes stare at you in mild shock
>a wolf, a tigress, and a rat, all three in uniform, look at you from their desks as if you had wandered unannounced into the back room of a business
>the soldier closest to you, the rat, has the good grace not to open with "are you lost?"
>"Good morning, how can we help you?"
>you pull a letter from your pocket and unfold it
>the official of the Anthrostate Armed forces on the top of the page
"Yeah, I hope so. I got this letter saying I had to report for mandatory duty? But that can't be right."
>the rat looks perplexed as she takes the paper
>the wolf and tigress have gone back to their own busywork in the background
>"You're right, this shouldn't..."
>the rat peers at the paper and starts typing on her keyboard
>then her eyes widen
>"This is correct, sir. You've been selected for civil service. I'll arrange transportation immediately."
>you flap your mouth for a few seconds
>not comprehending
"That's wrong. Humans aren't eligible for military service."
>but the rat has already risen from her chair and skittered off to the back of the office
>you hear what sounds like a very animated phone call coming from the back
>when she comes back, it's with a stern look on her face
>"Please take a seat, sir."
>you step back from her desk
"Wait a minute, no way I'm--"
>you freeze
>the other two soldiers have risen from their desks
>the rat looks ready to jump up and restrain you
>"Take a seat, sir."
>you sigh, defeated, and sit down on one of the waiting room chairs
>it's not long before a car with military plates rolls up outside and a doberman, also in uniform
>the soldiers in the recruiting office all stand and salute when she walks in
>the doberman returns the salute
>"At ease. This the one?"
>the rat returns to sitting at her desk
>"Yes ma'am."
>the doberman looks at you with a similar stern expression
>"Come with me."
>you rise meekly and follow the officer out the door
>she opens the door on the SUV for you, and swings it shut behind you
>you ride in silent uncertainty about your future
>what's going to happen to you?
>are they going to send you to fight?
>you didn't think the anthrostate was even at war!
>scary thoughts about being shot or maybe stabbed in combat run through your mind the entire trip
>until the SUV rolls through the front gate of some kind of army base
>and the officer speaks up
>"Okay. Here's the basics. Three square meals, health and wellness checks every week, be sure to stay hydrated."
>she pulls to a stop in front of a long, squat, brick building with a single door in the front
>"Alright. Here you go. Term of service ends in two months."
>the doberman woman leans over you to open the door
>you blink
"That's it? Don't I get any training?"
>the officer snorts
>"They'll do most of the work."
>you're pushed out of the car, none too gently, to stumble onto your feet outside the barracks
>you just catch the officer muttering as she slams the car door closed behind you
>"Lucky bitches."
>the SUV roars off and you're left standing in front of a barracks
>alone
>you look around, but this whole area seems abandoned
>not another soul
>you reach out to the barracks door and slowly open it
>letting daylight speed into a large barracks room that's in almost pitch black
>a half-dozen pair of eyes shine back at you from the dark
"Uh...wrong roo--"
>you don't even finish your lame excuse before the front of your shirt is grabbed and your dragged into the dark room
>it reeks of musk
>there are paws all over you
>groping
>grabbing
>clawing
>you can't keep track of them all
>only the feeling of rough paws desperate to reach every inch of you
>suddenly there's a cold, wet nose on your ear
>"About fucking time! I NEED something to fuck!"
>the cold nose is replaced with a hot tongue
>then sharp teeth
>she bites your ear hard enough to draw blood
>you cry out in pain
>and to your relief someone responds
>a husky voice, trembling with some unseen effort
>”Sergeant!”
>the paws around your shoulders release
>the presence behind you retreats into the darkness
>the other paws exploring your body freeze, expecting further reprobation
>it comes with a harsh bark
>”The rest of you, atten-SHUN!”

"It's heat season. I took health class, ma'am."
>there's a rash snickers from the soldiers

>"Fffuck, good human."
>she takes a deep breath, managing to regain her officer's tone for a moment
>"I should be looking after the women under my command, but given the circumstances..."
>her body shifts, hips raising enough for that heat to be pressed against the tip of your cock
>"...I'm taking what's mine."
>the colonel drops her weight
>you're engulfed, feeling the burning hot walls of a heat-ravaged pussy
>she quivers
>claws digging through your hair

Masquerade parties among anthros would be so very different. There's so much more identifying them than just their face; their scent, their markings, tails, etc. All unique things that act as instant identifiers. Not at all like humans who can hide/obscure their face and suddenly they're next to anonymous. For anthros it would have to be an atmosphere of playing pretend, like "We all know who everyone is, but we're wearing the masks to pretend like we don't." It'd be a social exercise in What Would It Be Like To Be Anonymous? Because I doubt anthros would really _know_ anonymity socially due to all those cues.
Just some thoughts I wanted to share.

>Anthro going about her day as usual, nothing out of the ordinary
>Suddenly picks up a familiar scent
>Follows it to a human guy
>Immediately realises it's the guy she's met at those parties she's been too
>This guy has been her plaything for the last few weeks and now she finally sees him without a mask in public for the first time
>He's unaware who this random Anthro is
>He's in danger

>Early morning light filters through the curtains
>It wakes you into what may as well be a dream
>As you stir, two things come to your awareness first: the presence of the wolfess beside you, and the collar around your neck
>Exactly as you fell asleep, face to face with your wife
>You shift slightly, pressing yourself into the warmth of her fur
>You're not much shorter than her, but in bed, it feels different
>Nestled under her chin, wrapped in her embrace, you feel much smaller
>Her strong, yet gentle arms encircle you, pulling you closer
>You shut your eyes back up, tight, and bask in the sensation
>With one hand you hold her
>With the other you begin to explore her familiar curves, drinking in the feeling of her softness
>Burrowing your nose against her neck fluff you take a deep sniff of her fur, breathing out with a soft "mmm."
>A comforting scent surrounds you, a mix of earthy, musky, tones and a hint of lavender from her fur shampoo
>The scent of a real woman, a scent that inspired your complete obedience
>Her black lips nuzzle against your forehead, letting you know that she's awake
>You turn your head up to meet her kiss, her breath mingling with yours for just a moment
>Then once again you bury yourself back into her neck fluff
>You press every part of yourself into her, feeling her heartbeat, the rise and fall of her breath
>Your legs and hers weave between each other, her soft fur caressing your bare skin
>Even after so long together, it still makes your heart beat a heavy rhythm when being so close to her
>The leather at your neck is warm against your skin, a familiar and comforting tightness
>It feels like an extension of her embrace, a constant reminder of her ownership
>The two of you freeze like that for a long time, pressing into eachother
>Moving seems impossible
>As if breaking this embrace would shatter the spell of warmth and comfort, and you would not be able to return to it
>Eventually the wolfess whispers to you, "half past seven"
>A satisfied growl shudders through her body, reverberating through your chest, a growl that makes you pull yourself even more tightly against her
>"We're not getting up until ten"

>ywn be a poke trainer who's big lopunny's "good little boy"
>smothered under 400 lbs of pokebunny muscle meat every night after making camp
>going pro league just to spend the winnings on rare candy lollipops for her and max heals for your hips
>my pokemon journey consists of watching people get broken in two and getting nearly broken in two
>dynamaxxing is out of the question holy shit
>a foolhardy ratatta girl gets mondo stomped the moment she leaves the tall grass by a bun 90 levels her senior
>type advantage gets btfo by a pokerabbit fist the size of your head
>saw lopunny sock the shit out of a legendary, funniest shit I've ever seen

>"massage parlor" that only caters to anthro women
>you need the money and they pay well
>but you didn't realize it was that type of massage parlor
>every client you get just wants you to massage them long enough to get in the mood, then go down on them
>you spend basically 8 hours a day with your tongue buried in anthro pussy
>and the clientele is very varied
>wolves, hyenas, lionesses, foxes, dogs, cats, bunnies, deer, horses
>sharks of all shapes and sizes
>avian cloaca
>some of them come in once or twice out of curiousity, but most are regulars
>and you're very popular. boss is asking you to work more hours
>you smell like a zoo 24/7
>strange anthro ladies cat call and wolf whistle at you
>what few human women you knew are not in your life any more
>your landlady, a fox, has started giving you weird looks when she comes to collect your rent
>worst of all though
>you're starting to enjoy it

what kind of medieval/classical waifurs do you guys think would make for good ADHG stuff?
So far I've got
>bandit leader/warlord/raider (spoils of war)
>foreign monarch (married off)
Those are pretty well travelled but you can also have
>adventuring party fighter (you are her squire/healslave)
>not!skaven sneaker (you are kidnapped for breeding/schemes)

>Forces you to do all the chores
>Refuses to shower more than once a week
>Doesn't even pay her share of the rent most months
But you're still going to beg to taste her pussy anyway

Virgins for Christ Cruise with an Italian captain, we capsized on a known maritime hazard. We was comin' back from the island of Aruba to Saint Lucia, just dropped off a bunch of missionaries. Unwed Female missionaries. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen-footer. You know how you know that when you're in the water? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know... was our guido captain had been so incompetent, no distress signal had been sent.
They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. Y'know, it's... kinda like shy girls at a party, the idea was, shark comes to the nearest man and that man, he'd start flailin' and hollerin', and sometimes the shark'd go away... sometimes she wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, she wraps herself around ya. Right between her thighs.
"Y'know the thing about a shark, she's got... powerful thighs, thick thighs, like a PAWG thighs. When she comes at ya, doesn't seem to be nothin'... until she mount's ya. And those thick thighs squeeze ya, and then... oh, then you hear that terrible high-pitch moanin', yer face turns red, and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin', how tight she is, how wet...she'll fuck you to pieces"
Y'know, by the end of that first dawn... they'd raped about a hundred men. I dunno how many sharks. Maybe a dozen? I dunno how many men, they averaged, six an hour? On Thursday mornin', I bumped into a friend of mine, Ned Carter from Utah- savin' himself for marriage. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up... he moaned like a little bitch. Well... he was getting sucked off below the water.
Coast guard showed up to rescue us. Y'know, that was the time I was most frightened, waitin' for my turn. Eleven hundred virgins went into the water, three hundred sixteen men come out, and the sharks took the rest.

>japanese otter yokai
>like pranking humans mostly harmless stuff like calling out people's names in crowds/mimicing people's voices or turning off lanterns in the middle of the night on people
>also really like getting drunk on sake with humans

>synth wife edited her conf and accidentally added two zeros to the desire.breed value
>after 7 hours, some moderate bruising and 2 litres of orange juice you manage to cuff her to the oven with those pink fuzzy cuffs she used to use on you

>the guy has talked you through the process of SSHing into your wife apparently you just need to press the WPS button first
> he was starting to explain how to roll back her configuration weights when the call cuts off
>your wife's hand is pressed down on the receiver cradle of your novelty rotary VOIP phone
>she isn't wearing the cuffs any more
>in point of fact she isn't wearing the arm that those cuffs were attached to either
>where did he say that button was again?

I sometimes like to imagine how the gender roles are reversed and I can’t help but think of scenarios like this
>A anthro women draw themselves as big, big breasted, muscular anthro women with a cute young anime humie boi wearing revealing clothes with a big bulge on his underwear
>Anthro women who’s a perverted loser who got transported in a world where magical humie bois roam the place and they treat her like she’s the chosen one and she takes advantage of the hero’s role just to get into their pants

We can spit roll some lil’ prompts to make it more interesting.
>Having to hear your anthro daughter complaining about your human son hogging up the tv because he wants to watch his ‘boy shows’ about magical human boys
>Having to be flirted by some chubby yet confident rat women as she placed her arm around your shoulder as she takes a fat inhale from her cigar and giggle after letting her undress you like a gentlegal she is
>Having a big tough doberman wife as she fixes the houses with her strengths and give her a kiss on the lips on her doggy lips for being a good wife and reward her with a big dish you cooked for her
>Be a house husband and see your bear wife in a nice suit coming from a stressful business work but gives her a kiss and take her to the couch and see her taking off the suit and finally letting her big tummy let go and making a nice relaxed moan

goofy ideas
>humans have no magic but demons/spirits/elementals/etc will lend their power by being summons in exchange for sexual favors from human guys
>human mages lose their power if their virginity is taken and anthros can steal their magic by fucking them
>human gods are super petty and revoke powers from humans that sleep with beast women
>anthro witches/mages/etc finding out human semen super charges magic shenanigans ensue

>take her on a date to the beach.
>get her into the water.
>anon uses his masculine wiles to convince her into the public showers with him
>Anon aggressively scrubs her cooch with a whole bottle of shampoo as "foreplay"

>The Hypocrite
>In the future, new types of creatures emerged and started integrating into the human world.
> Anthropomorphic animals or just Anthros, their numbers started to increase after legalizing Interspecies Marriage.
> That caused a big controversy in the political world, some started asking if they should give the anthros other human rights, should they let them vote or practice politics just like humans.
>Orson was the face of the anti-interspecies marriage movement, a young Human conservative spokesman, and the host of the show "All Humans!" and was famous for his loud and honest rants.
>he was invited to debate other pro-interspecies marriage guests.
> The show started and the host presented the guests, Elena a large anthro tigress who was one of the first anthro to get her own show "How to Anthro with Elena", the crowd clapped and cheered for her.
> The host then Presented Orson, the crowd booed him and even insulted him until the host told them to stop.
> The interview started and both of the guests gave their perspectives on Interspecies marriage with every minute the views increased and the debate became more heated.
>"So," Elena started,"what's your problem with people marrying Anthros?"
>Orson who got really heated by the conversation and by the crowd booing him, "I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORCE ME TO ACCEPT YOUR FETISH AS A LEGITIMATE MATRIMONY, MARRIAGE IS A SACRED AND YOU PEOPLE MAKE IT FEEL LIKE JUST ABOUT HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS, LET ME SAY IT REALLY SLOWLY FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND, I'M NOT AGAINST AN ANTHRO MARRYING AN ANTHRO AND A HUMAN MARRYING ANOTHER HUMAN, BUT AN ANTHRO MARRYING A HUMAN? NO THAT'S UNNATURAL!"
> The crowd gasped in disbelief and then started booing even louder.
>"And we will end our show here, thanks for watching," the host said and ended the show.
>Orson froze in his place and then got out of the studio before anything bad could happen to him.
> Hours later, Orson entered his house and just sat down in the couch, thinking and analyzing all that happened in the interview today.
>"Oh god!" he said to himself.
>"Tough day hon?" a sound said from the bathroom.
>"Yeah i did that interview with Elena" answered Orson.
>" And how it went?"
>"Pretty awful, she's getting too good now and her arguments are getting better," Orson said and went to the kitchen to eat something.
>"so when are you going to tell them?" said the voice again.
>"tell them about what?"
> A heavy footsteps were heard coming to the kitchen, and after a few seconds, the source of the sound appeared.
>a six-foot-nine Arctic wolf with a larger body and buff arms. this was Wendy, Orson's secret wife and the one who helped through all those years.
>"about us? about who you truly are!"
>Orson sighed,"Are you out of your mind? I can't be public with our relationship.."
>"Relationship?! we are married!"
>"In this country, our country, we aren't Wendy"
> For legal reasons and to keep their Marriage a secret, the two of them got married and had a wedding in an island country where they don't reveal marriage certificates.
>Wendy took a deep breath and then sat next to him at the kitchen table,"I'm tired of pretending Orson, i really am...I want us to be able to hold hands in public, I want us to be able to finally sleep in the same bed and I want us to stop pretending that we are co-workers! I want to be able to finally start a family together and live freely"
>Orson looked at her, feeling a little guilty for making both of their lives hard and he couldn't reveal this detail about him not after what happened today.
>Orson held her large hands and squeezed them, "Wendy look at me, do you think that I want all of this, Do you think that I don't want to hold her hands while we go out and take you on a date and enjoy ourselves but once I became the face of the whole Anti-interspecies thing a lot of people started giving a shit about our show, organizations started funding us and with this funding, we were able to build this house and gave me and the show more audience which led to more funding and made me do more interviews and so on..."
>"So it's all about money then?"
>"Fuck no! Do you think that I would do all of this to you just for some money?! No..."Orson became grimmer," It's about saving face and keeping both of our reputations, you know what will happen if people knew that I was told to not marry an anthro and that I married an anthro wolf..."
>"They would call you a Hypocrite..."
>"Not a Hypocrite, THE Hypocrite, heck this will destroy both our show and even our lives Wendy...and now with 25 states out of fifty legalizing Interspecies Marriage and the chance of six others joining next year, I will get more interviews...more broadcasts...and more debates..."
>"So what now? we are gonna live our whole life like that? what about what she said about having children, how's that gonna happen?"
>"I don't know...I just don't know Wendy, I just want you to know something..."
>Wendy raised an eyebrow, "what's that?"
>"i want you to know that I love you and I will try my best to find a solution to all of that..."
>Wendy sighed and leaned on him a little," I know you will and I will be here with you"
>Orson's phone rang and he excused himself and let Wendy think about this whole matter.
>Wendy met Orson many years ago, She had a small website where she hosted and posted anti-interspecies articles and videos, she met Orson after she interviewed him, and had great chemistry together and decided to launch the "All Humans!" together, they worked together for serval years until they realized their feeling towards each other and started secretly dating.
> They both used to believe that a human couldn't love an anthro the same way he would love another human.
> They soon discover that they were dead wrong.
>Orson came back to the kitchen with a frown on his face.
>"What's the matter?"
>"Well the good news is that we have new sponsors for our campaign, they said that they will invest 'handsomely'..."
>" And the bad news?"
>"What I said in the interview sparked a huge national debate, and we will start to get double the hate mails and death threats"
>Wendy took a deep breath and then stood up,"I will get the paper shredder and the shotgun'
>"....yeah you should i guess"
>"Unnatural, Orson?! Really! This is the best thing you had in mind?!" exclaimed Wendy after she listened to the interview.
>Orson shouted, "You heard how they started booing me! I couldn't think, okay!"
>Wendy got a little annoyed and then browsed the internet, "Well, look at this, your name is now trending on social media."
>"How bad is it?"
>"Not as bad as you might think... some people are calling you 'Based' and others are calling you a bigot... but Elena is using this opportunity to boost her popularity. She’s doing a special episode just analyzing the interview."
>Orson rubbed his temples, "Great, just what I needed... more fuel for the fire."
>Wendy frowned and crossed her arms, "Orson, this can't keep going on like this. The more we push this narrative, the harder it becomes to ever come clean."
>Orson sighed heavily, "I know, Wendy, but what do you want me to do? We've built everything on this... we can't just tear it all down."
>"But at what cost, Orson? We’re lying to everyone... even to ourselves."
>There was a long, tense silence between them. Wendy broke it by opening a file on her laptop, "Look at this. Clara, the anthro rabbit who was married to a human... she was pregnant with his kids."
>Orson's eyes widened, "What? When did this happen?"
>"It was kept quiet, but I found the details... Her husband pressured her into getting an abortion, not realizing how dangerous it was for her species. She died because of it."
>Orson felt a knot form in his stomach, "Wendy... this is the kind of thing that could turn the tide in our favor."
>"Orson! what the fuck?!"Wendy shouted, "Are we really going to use this tragedy to push our agenda?! We’re already living a lie, and this could make it worse."
>Orson looked conflicted, "This is what we’ve been talking about for years. Interspecies marriages are dangerous because people don’t understand the risks. Clara’s death is a tragic example of that."
>Wendy shook her head, "But we know the truth, Orson. We know it’s not just about the risks. It’s about society not accepting these relationships... not making room for understanding and support."
>"We can’t let our personal feelings get in the way of what we’ve been fighting for. If we let this story slip by, it’ll be another step toward normalizing something that isn’t safe."
>Wendy sighed, "I don’t like it... but if we’re doing this, we need to be careful. We can’t let this spiral out of control."
>Orson nodded, "Agreed. We’ll present it as a cautionary tale, something people need to know about before they make any decisions. We have to protect people, Wendy... even if it means keeping up this facade a little longer."
>They spent the next few hours preparing, going over the evidence and crafting their narrative. The weight of what they were about to do hung heavy over them, but there was also a sense of determination.
>Finally, as the cameras rolled and the familiar theme music of "All Humans!" began to play, Orson took his place at the desk, Wendy by his side. He looked into the camera, his expression grave and focused.
>"Good evening, everyone. Tonight, we have a story that highlights the dangers of interspecies marriage... a story that ended in tragedy. It’s a story we must all hear and learn from."
>And with that, the show began, using Clara’s tragic death to bolster their controversial stance, despite any reluctance they may have had.

Do you think a form of prison assignment would reform anthro reprobates? If a normal woman gets all these hormones that makes her more likely to be protective, matronly, pair-bonded and so on.

What are your thoughts on being gaslit into a romantic relationship?

At what point does the gaslighting end and the actual relationship begin? Do you mean being gaslit into a relationship and then they turn out to be awful?

More like an anthro tries to fool you into thinking that you were always together. Maybe gradually skipping relationship milestones.
>"Anon, don't you remember agreeing that we'd go on a date here? You eat here every Wednesday? I see why you suggested going here for a date."
>"Why am I in your bed? I asked if we could go to the next step and you agreed. Don't you see all those condoms in the trash? We really went at it. Hey, how about another go?"
>"You remember when we went to Paris? It was so wonderful. You don't remember that? The doctor did say you might have some brain issues since... let's talk about something nicer."
>"Happy anniversary. I know you probably forgot, but I am fine with that. I have never been happier with you. Here is to enjoying our lives together. If it makes you feel bad, we can always do a repeat."{

I prefer already being in a relationship and being gaslit into being a subby little bitch.

That's a neat idea.

How do you guys feel about wrestling/playfights? You know, taking your girl on in a friendly tussle, and I don't even necessarily mean a sexual one. Do you think you could put up a fight?

>Do you think you could put up a fight?
no way in hell
i could use all my strength and she would only find it cute
i mean i guess she could play along and not make it completely one sided
play fighting is play after all and while i might not be able to really challenge her we could still have some fun

I love the idea especially when I'm hopelessly outmatched in the size and physical ability department. A somewhat sadistic waifur enjoying my weak, futile struggles makes for the perfect wrestling partner. And I could be her cuddle pillow... or a stress toy to squeeze depending on how she feels. Playful bites from a maw who could easily snap through my bones or take my head clean off are nice as well. And since I'm in love with snakes - coils. Lots of submission holds in those coils.

You must choose.

>"What would you have done if he said no?"
>"I would have done it anyway. I mean I like to be nice, but I am not an angel. Have you seen his (bleep)? I couldn't let that go."
>"Back to you Macy."

>Instead of going all at once, the anthros will slowly be integrated into the towns along the border of humanity's enemies, starting with the females as they are less likely to cause trouble

>That is the official plan
>However, the truth is the united tribes were devastated in their last country sized raid
>Most of the males led by the queen's fool of a brother were slaughtered in the attack

Anon pretends to be hypnotized and plays along but then her commands start to get a bit dirty...
starts off with maybe some kissing until it quickly takes a turn where she commands you to eat her out and then has you in a amazon position and then command you to love her forever
she would either 100% believe in hypnosis thinking that it's real or she knows it's not real and is just using it to break the ice or something

Idea...
The cold war wasn't a dick measuring contest between two superpowers, but a massive deterrent.
1947 Battle of Los Angeles wards of a scouting force of horny alien chicks
Those not shot down retreat, while UN meets up and discuses how to avoid getting conquered and keeping the powers that be in power
Come up with M.A.D. and set up the Cold war as a massive coverup and excuse to channel money into new technology to push mankind forward(in secret, of course)
Begin psyops to see how susceptible humans would be to being dominated by alien invaders
Aliens finally get back (Earth is a long way from imperial boarders, Space Australia to Space Britain) only to find the primitives waving around nukes like it's going out of style
Can't invade because then this habitable garden world is going to be reduced to radioactive hellscape because of mistaken identity
Many a female sulks at the loss of a prime invasion target and a bunch of handsome males

>Be Anon
>You’re currently tied in a spread eagle position on the bed
>Your big Australian shepherd girlfriend wanted to try something new
>She’s going to get you accustomed to her scent, apparently it’s a thing that some dogs do
>She took the liberty of taking a jog in the hot summer sun while wearing sweatpants as well as turning up the heat in the room
>Just to amplify her scent, as she said
>”Alright Anon, you ready for this?”
“Y-Yeah, sure.”
>”Oh! I almost forgot!”
>The big anthro then grabs a pair of her worn panties and shoves them in your mouth, before grabbing a ball gag and wrapping it around your head, making sure you can’t push her panties out your mouth
>”Just so you can taste me too, hehe!”
>With that, your girlfriend climbs onto the bed and straddles your face, her big behind looming just inches above you
>She’s sat on your face many times before, but every time is just as intimidating, one cheek is probably five times the size of your head
>Sweat drips down on your face like a faucet, and you can catch the smell of hot swamp ass and wet dog
>It’s mildly unpleasant, but not unbearable
>”Ready?” She says
>You can’t even nod your head before your girlfriend drops her ass onto your face
>Thanks to an ungodly amount of sweat, your head slips easily between her cheeks
>The smell is more intense now, it makes your head spin
>But you’re far from over
>Your girlfriend giggles and shifts herself side to side, grinding on your face and causing you to slip deeper
>She continues grinding on top of you until your nose comes into contact with her asshole
>”Now then, sweetie, take a deep breath…”
>Not wanting to disappoint your girlfriend, you take a deep inhale of your girlfriend’s asshole, which twitches in response
>Your head is immediately filled with her raw, unfiltered musk, making you feel dizzy
>But there’s some other odd feeling inside of you after you took a deep sniff, something that lingers in the back of your mind
>As if out of your control, you take another deep sniff
>There’s a hint of something indescribable, something that has you craving for more
>Your girlfriend chuckles and grinds her ass hard onto your nose
>”How is it back there? Does it smell good?”
>You take a third sniff, then a fourth, and then a fifth
>”Hehe, I’ll take that as a yes.”
>You lose count as you continue huffing your girlfriend’s asshole
>Her scent is having an aphrodisiac effect on you, you don’t know how or why, but it feels so good
>You continue huffing your girlfriend’s asshole, allowing that erotic feeling to build
>Your dick is as hard as diamond, begging to be touched
>”Aww, am I making you hard, baby?”
>Your girlfriend touches the tip of your penis, making you shudder
>”Don’t worry babe, just keep sniffing. I want you to smell me for weeks after this.”
>You do as you’re told, eagerly sniffing up her natural pheromones
>It feels so good that you want to taste it, so you try sticking your tongue out of your mouth
>But you forget about the fact that you’re gagged
>Desperate for a taste, you let out a muffled yell underneath your girlfriend’s butt
>She simply responds by grinding on your face again
>You take another deep inhale, filling your lungs with more of her scent, before letting out another yell
>This time, she doesn’t do anything
>You repeat this process of filling up your head with her musk and begging for a taste just to be ignored
>And filling your lungs with more of her scent makes you even more aroused
>Your dick is harder than it has ever been, throbbing and pulsing for attention
>Desperate for some release, you thrust your hips into the air
>Your girlfriend shifts her hips side to side, causing your head to move with her squishy, fluffy cheeks
>”Oh, we’re only getting started, baby. Plus, I need to catch up on some reading, if you don’t mind. Just try and relax down there, okay?”
>Your girlfriend shifts around a bit before coming to a rest, humming to herself as she presumably begins reading her book
>Time loses meaning as you’re stuck underneath your girlfriend’s ass for what feels like hours
>Slow, torturous hours
>You’re desperate to taste her ass and get some relief
>But all your muffled pleas for attention falls on deaf ears
>You’re forced to lie down there and continue breathing in more of your girlfriend’s musk for a long time, growing more and more aroused and desperate
>You’re so lightheaded at this point that you feel like you could pass out
>The occasional grind and shift on your face gives you a small second wind, but not for long
>Eventually, it all becomes too much, and you lose consciousness under your girlfriend, nose up her ass and still breathing in her natural pheromones
…
>Be Anon
>It’s been a couple days since your girlfriend did that scent trial with you
>You’re doing some laundry when something catches your eye
>Your girlfriend’s sweatpants from that day
>You lift them up and bring the seat of her pants to your nose
>You can definitely smell her musk on them
>Your eyes roll in the back of your head as your cock grows rock hard
>You fumble around with your pants and wrap your hand around your dick, stroking it quickly
>You continue huffing your girlfriend’s sweatpants as you keep jacking off
>Eventually, your knees grow weak, and you fall onto the floor with your ass in the air
>Your stroking gets faster as your sniffing gets deeper
>You moan as you feel your climax approaching, and then, you explode all over the floor
>But with your nose still in your girlfriend’s sweatpants, you can’t stop jacking yourself off
>It’s like her scent has taken over your mind
>You hear muffled footsteps behind you
>”Oh, baby, if you wanted my scent that bad, why not have it from the source?”
>You look behind and see your girlfriend’s fat ass in front of your face, covered in thin, sweat-soaked yoga pants
>You immediately wrap your arms around your girlfriend’s ass and shove your face in between her cheeks, taking a deep sniff of her ass
>She was right, it does smell better from the source

>did you know human males are free
>just go to any human settlement/city/planet/space station/etc and there are loads of them walking about on their own free for the taking
>no female's scent on them, no claiming bite on their necks, not even a female family member around to keep them guarded, etc
>even if there is a human female around them they can't and won't stop you from taking their males

>Calmly approach male
>Gently pat male on his head
>Give "bedroom" and/or "motherly" eyes to male
>Say to male in a seductive tone, "Would you like to be my good boy?"
>When male complies, gently lift male
>Insert male into your bodysuit until he is snug against your body
>Tell male you'll "keep him safe in there."
>Zip up your bodysuit

Xenomorphs would take over planet in record time if they stayed all female and reproduced through regular sex instead of the whole facehugger stage. With all the goofy and fetish shit that happens in official xenomorph media this wouldn't even be that out of place.
Honestly, the usual rape aliens/monster invasion becomes fare more efficient when it's female aliens/monsters going after human guys. Need only a couple of guys to get started, guys are alone more often/longer so easier to grab, no risk of death from alien/monster pregnancy you get in human women, human males don't have shit like menopause so can be used to breed for far longer, etc.

Need obsessive superhero wife to control my life.

do you imagine anon as just a civilian who attracted her attention, or maybe someone who wanted to try playing the role of villain but later realized it is not worth it cause the Heros are crazy.

Anon as a civilian is alot more exciting. Superanthro follow him around on his daily chores checking to see if he talks to any other girls.

getting rescued by an anthro means you legally belong to her now

>Work at an office job for twelve hours a day just to come home to a relationship that has already run it's course after only a couple years.
>You're not even married, just with some 'girlfriend' that treats you like utter garbage because she has a better job than most.
>She always lords it over your head that they makes more than you, and won't let you leave because as she always says: 'where would you even go?'
>Not only that, but fighting back is impossible because you live in a society that if you do, she'll lie and say you're abusive- and the police would believe every word.
>God, you hate double standards.
>You're dreading the carpool home, so you decide to walk.
>Maybe you'll stop at the bar- it's not like you'll get screamed at any less for coming home late.
>. . .
>You know what? Fuck it.
>You work hard, and you're gonna get so drunk that you'll fucking-
>'fwip!'
>You don't even get to finish that thought before a burlap sack is slid over your head, and you're dragged into a vehicle of some kind.
>A gruff, feminine voice can be heard from somewhere close as you can hear a sliding door close on the car.
>"We got one! Go go go!"
>There was a screech of tires, and with that you knew for certain that you had been kidnapped.
>-and you couldn't be more relieved about it.
>To your understanding- you had been kidnapped by citizens of the anthrostate.
>You know- THE Anthrostate?
>The entire country that's about the size of America, Russia, and China mashed together that just suddenly 'appeared' out of nowhere a few years ago?
>Also the very same country that is filled to the brim with humanoid creatures that are almost compulsively obsessed with the human species?
>THAT Anthrostate.
>So, it turns out that you've been kidnapped, and are now in the process of being dragged back to the Anthrostates as some sort of trophy husband.
>Which was weird, right?
>You weren't exactly Mr. Handsome in most cases, but far be it for you to give your kidnappers a reason to drop you off at home.
>It was best to just be chill as you lay on the reasonably comfy floor of the van that you can hear speeding down what had to be a highway.
>So, you just kicked back and tried enjoying the ride.
>The moment you started to lounge though, your peace was quickly interrupted by a very familiar set of claws poking into your side.
>"Hey, what's up with this one? They're not even struggling-" The gruff voice said.
>"You weren't too rough this time- we're you?" A much more dainty voice spoke from what you could only guess was the driver seat.
>"What? No! I just like it when they struggle. It's more fun that way."
>The gruff voice sounded like a jock.
>"You should really save it for your hubby back home, Hanna. . ."
>Hanging just over your motionless body you could hear 'Hanna' growl with disdain.
>"HEY! I SAID to call me by my codename! We need to be professional!"
>"Why? We're only here because you owe me after what happened after snatching YOUR husband!"
>There was a short pause, and a soft whine from above you.
>"Please, Jenny? I worked really hard on it."
>There was another pause, and then a deadpan tone following a tired sigh.
>" 'Agent Wolfsbane'. . . could you please check to see if my husband is alive so I can ask what his name is?"
>"HELL YEAH, I CAN!"
>'Hanna' sounded like a child that was excited to play a game of secret agents with her friends.
>With one pull of their hand, the bag was off your head and you could certainly confirm that you were inside a van- a huge wolf of a woman sitting cross-legged beside you all the while.
>Easily eight feet tall, one look at the woman's physique affirmed your mental accusations of Hanna being a jock considering she was wearing a black tank top and black shorts.
>That, and she looked like she could bench a truck.
>"Yeah, he's alive-" Hanna stated matter of factly with a snarky smile. "Almost thought I snapped his neck there for a second."
>Well, that's a ghastly mental image.
>"Oh, thank goodness-" a much more feathered individual in the front seat spoke. "I wouldn't have forgiven you, if you did, H-. . . Agent Wolfsbane."
>Brown feathers, a bright-green jacket, and a pair of worn out blue jeans covering her- there were also the faint signs of a hot-pink shirt collar around this bird-womans neck.
>"Heeeey, sweetie-" a pair of soft-blue eyes looked back at you from the rearview mirror where a necklace with a peace symbol medallion dangled almost ironically. "Welcome to your new life-"
>The cadence this feathered female spoke with almost made it seem like she was trying to ease you into the reality of your situation.
>"Now, I know that this probably isn't how you wanted to spend your evening, and you've probably got a lot of questions, and you're PROBABLY going to ask me to drop you off at home- so let me just answer all three typical questions recipients have of this 'exceptionally complicated' matrimonial process to get them out of the way!"
>"Yes, this is really happening. Yes, you're now my husband- don't question it. -And lastly: NO, there will be no bathroom breaks. I LEARNED THAT TRICK THE FIRST TIME."
>You watched your driver slam a feathered hand into the steering wheel to punctuate that last answer before taking a breath to calm down.
>"So, what's you're name, hubby? I'm Jenny, and I'm sure you've met Hanna-"
>"AGENT WOLFSBANE-" Hanna interrupted coarsely with a rumble in her throat.
"Yes, her-" within a moment, Jenny's flat tone was back to a stressed, yet bubbly one. "-but what about yours? I need to know the name of my new husband to really start this relationship right!"
"You can call me whatever you want just so long as you keep driving."
>You could feel Jenny's expression change from behind the wheel- the words that just left your gullet not sitting right with her.
>"Oh my God, Hanna- I think we just abducted a criminal."
>"Oh, that's like the cereal prize of husbands! Lucky-"
>"I DO NOT FEEL LUCKY RIGHT NOW, HANNA! KICK THEM OUT!"
>Jenny twisted around in her seat mid-shout, but considering the swerve that resulted because of it she snapped back around to adjust her position on the road quickly after.
>Not having a seatbelt on, yourself- you found yourself rolling around the floorboard of the van and smacking into the opposite wall to Hanna.
"Not a criminal! NOT A CRIMINAL! My life here is just terrible, I swear!"
>Showing obvious hesitation to following her friends order, Hanna was looking to Jenny's reflection in the rearview and then back to you quite a few times.
>The mental image of you turning into road pizza wasn't appealing, and you readied yourself for the worst.
>"D- Do you promise?" The anxiety-riddled way Jenny spoke matched your own.
"I swear. The only thing I've ever stolen is a stick of gum."
>"Pussy-" Hanna mocked.
>"Oh, thank goodness. I was actually scared for a second."
>All was quiet for a few moments- you being glad to not be pushed out onto the highway, and Jenny bring glad not to aid a fellow criminal.
>Only Agent Wolfsbane dared to look dissatisfied.
>"Oh my God, just SAY something already. Jenny- how long until we get to the rendezvous point?"
>"Well,-" Jenny cleared her throat. "We'll be headed for the coastline, so. . . Two days?"
>The agonizing groan the wolf-woman made clearly expressed how she felt on the matter- gripping both claws into the jet-black hair on her head that draped down her back.
>"I'm not dealing with hours of you freaking out, Jen- I'm getting some shut-eye."
>The huge woman laid on her side before turning over to face the wall; her long tail smacking you haphazardly in the face almost as an insult.
>"Wake me if the cops show up, Kay?"
>"Okay. . . Get some good sleep."
>By the near instant sound of sawing logs you could only guess that you were now 'technically' alone with Jenny.
>"So, uh, if you're not going to try and run. . ."
>From the front seat you saw one of Jenny's arms reach over to the passenger seat to give it a soft 'pat.'
>"Wanna ride shotgun?"
>Anything to avoid the risk of being tossed around again.
>A small trek up to the front seat later, and you were locked into the passenger seat with a seatbelt gladly wrapped around your torso.
>It was only really now that you were able to get a good look at the other half of the team that kidnapped you.
>A soft, rattled expression sat on her face as Jenny continued to speed down what you now recognized as the interstate highway.
>There was a fear about her, but also. . . Relief?
>The oddest thing about the bird-woman however had to be her beak.
>It looked. . . Clunky.
>Almost like a Halloween mask that didn't fit on a kids head when they wore it.
>You could at least make heads or tails of what kind of bird Jenny was now.
>She seemed to be some kind of hen.
"Well, this is probably the weirdest marriage proposal I've ever received. . . granted, it's the ONLY one I've ever gotten, but perhaps you should have just asked to buy me a drink?"
>Your jocular comment flew right over her head- Jenny having a laser focus on the road.
>"It's a. . . Cultural thing."
>Well, at least she's talking.
>"Anthro's see a person they want, and they just go 'Hey- I'd like to have sexual relations with that, and just-" Jenny swirled her right hand dismissively. "Take it!"
>A genuine frustration bled from Jenny's posture, and into her words.
"You don't sound too enthused about your culture for someone who's participating in it."
>The poor hen looked tired in ways you could recognize. Tired in a way that just made her want to escape something.
>"It's not that- it's just. . ." There was an anger welling up that she had to push down. "One of our leaders sexually assaults and kidnaps a human, and ALL OF THE SUDDEN we've ALL been blacklisted from human society! How is THAT fair?"
>Oh. . . Yeah.
>The 'first contact incident.'
>So, long story short:
>When the Anthrostates first appeared humanity was sort of thrilled about there being more sapient life than humans on the planet.
>There was talk of greater access to resources, possible new technologies- it was a pretty cool time to be alive.
>There was a big deal about how earth had trippled in size due to the introduction of a new huge supercontinent, the effects that such a thing could have on the environment, and a meeting between the leaders of the Anthrostates and the leaders of human civilization.
>It was a big thing where both sides would bring their families and have them get to know the others as a test of good will.
>It almost went perfectly. . . Until a nine-foot tall wolf-man stole some guys wife right in front of him.
>The details afterward were very fuzzy- demands for the man's wife to be returned were made, accusations of other kidnappings during the event, statements saying that the guys wife DIDN'T want to come back, and the good ol classic threats of war from both sides-
>It got messy.
>That's politics though, right?
>"We're all labeled as perverts now, and it stinks!" It seemed like this had been something boiling for a while. "My society is more complicated than that! I'M more complicated than that!"
>You look into the back of the van just in time to see Hanna scratching her backside.
"What about her? Is she complicated too?"
>Jenny looked at you as if that statement just destroyed her entire argument in a single shot.
>"No, she's a pervert. . ."
>Yeah, that checked out.
>"So, how about that name?"
>Jenny was looking from the road to you with pleading eyes, hoping for any way to make the situation a bit better than what it currently was.
"Well, if I'm leaving my old life behind, I might as well have a new name, right?"
>It was like a wash of relief came over the hen when you said this.
>Her grip on the steering wheel loosened, that anxiety lightened, and that smile looked a little less forced.
>"Oh, yes. That's something you humans seem to be fond of doing. It really is fascinating how you're all so willing to discard certain aspects of yourselves at the drop of a hat."
>You gave Jenny an arched brow.
"Are Anthro's NOT able to do that?"
>"Oh, no. It's not that-" she stated with a soft laugh. "it's just. . . It's not something we typically do."
>Jenny drummed her fingers on the steering wheel.
>"So. . . How about that name, hubby?"
"How about that?"
>"How about what?"
>" 'Hubby.' it has a nice ring to it."
>Finally, a calmness overtook Jenny, the hen deciding to turn her attention back toward the road.
>"I think I like that."
>So with the sound of snoring in the back, and the light grinding of wheels on asphalt the van that was now your kidnappers getaway vehicle traveled down the highway.
>-and although the light of the setting sun was still hitting the back of the van, you couldn't help but feel like a new day was already upon you.
>"First stop."
>You're not sure when you dozed off, but you groggily awoke to the sensation of the vans break-system causing you to lurch forward like a zombie.
>Barely cognizant and droopy-eyed, you could hear Hanna moving around in the back; every major movement of her body causing the vehicles hull to sway from side to side.
>"Finally, I get to stretch my legs-" the side-door of the van slid open just long enough for the wolf-woman to eagerly crawl out on all fours like a beast. "No offense, Jen- but that car of yours has just about as much space in it as a tin can."
>You could hear Hanna's vertebrae 'pop' when finally straightening out her back with a breath of satisfaction.
>"Oh, yeah- that's what momma likes. . ."
>This left you to pull yourself together and wipe the sand out of your eyes as a soft feathery nudge graced your bicep.
"Huh, wha-? Why did we stop?"
>Your 'eloquent' phrasing brought a laugh out of Jenny.
>"Hey, sleepyhead- it's time to top-off the gas tank."
>With a simple turn of the head you could see Jenny staring at you with a sympathetic gesture, a few feathered digits fiddling with her beak all the while.
>Barely aware of your own surroundings- you were snapped awake by the sensation of Hanna impatiently wrapping her arms around the hood of the car and rocking the entirety of the van in an act of pure impudence.
>"COME. ON. YOU. TWO. SLOW. POKES. GET. OUT. OF. THE CAR!"
>She accentuated her demand with one final shake.
>"I want SNACKS."
>Behind the massive woman though, you could finally see some hint of where you now were.
>A triangular sign standing high on a metal pole that looked like it was ripped right out of the eighties.
>The starry night sky made it look like a beacon as it spun.
>It was a mixture of pink, purple, orange, and yellow neon that made up what looked like a synthwave sunset.
>Just below it in green letters, and nestled in-between similarly presented neon palm trees were the words:
>'Palm Harbor Gas Station.'
>Stepping out of the van, you were able to take in a much more grand scope of your surroundings.
>You were in the middle of a desert- cacti, tumbleweeds, dirt, and a small two-lane road were all that graced your vision when looking back over your shoulder.
>In front of you however was a completely different story.
>Other than the road you all must have driven in on, the only other sign of civilization visible to you was the shockingly modern-looking gas station you were parked at.
>Granted, the place had only four gas pumps, two of which being already occupied- not including the van, which made three.
>The building itself was almost obelisk-ian in nature; the entire place looking about fifteen feet too tall, and the doors in being taller than any you've seen.
>This coupled with how the outside of the establishment was decked out in just as much neon as their sign made the place a little intimidating.
>That didn't stop Hanna from nearly scurrying up toward the front door in a way that made alarms go off in your head.
"Wait- hold on! If someone sees you they'll call the cops! Anthro's aren't supposed to be here, remember?!?"
>Your best whisper shout went unheeded as Hanna finally reached the door and bolted in just in time for Jenny to catch your shoulder before one could even consider running off after them.
>"It's fine-" she assured with a clumsy smile. "Me and Hanna came here all the time when she was looking for her husband."
>It was beginning to feel like you were getting uncomfortably comfortable with the fact that you've been passively forced into a marriage, but far be it from you to find problems with a consensual kidnapping.
>Still there were a couple things about this that peaked your curiosity.
"So, there are just people out there that are just 'cool' about casually breaking international law?"
>"Well, yeah-" Jenny's words were so casual one may have thought them flippant. "I mean- you are, right?"
"Hm, touche."
>A breeze of cool air hit the two of you when stepping through the station entrance- the smell of gas station burrito's and cigarettes wafting into your face.
>Considering Jenny stood about a head and a half shorter than you, you wouldn't blame her for not seeing the sight of a hunched over Hanna eyeing snacks and candies from behind the cover of grocery aisles- yet you were certain that she could hear the woman mutter that she would 'devour all of you.'
>It felt like you were practically babysitting a giant child, but as Jenny took your hand and walked you in further something else caught your eye.
>At the far right side of the store where the freezer section resided was was looked like a wall of white fur dressed in an ice-blue jacket.
>Standing tall- if not taller than Hanna, you could see a pair of headphones sitting atop two rounded ears on a head of white bouncy hair styled into a short weave.
>Beside her was a man that looked like he could beat you up from just a glance.
>He was big, burley, and almost covered with the same red curly hair that sat atop his head and dominated his face.
>The man was wrapping an arm around the woman's wide hips- his muscular arms only barely disguised by his plaid long sleeve shirt while using the other to almost seemingly guide the bear-woman to finding what kind of milk she'd enjoy.
>At the hotbox where the burrito's and other station food was put on display was a green-scaled woman with blond hair draping down about three feet to the mid-section of her back while wearing a black hoodie, and pants.
>Speaking as if she just stumbled right out of Louisiana- the lady was speaking to the station attendant with a Cajun accent about wanting something 'actually spicy'- threatening to get behind the counter and do it, herself.
>Beside her was a reasonably round man who didn't quite seem to know what to do with himself- nervously fidgeting his hands together while saying that he still had seasonings left over in their car.
>You and the man shared a glance, you giving a short but respectful nod while he smiled and sheepishly waved before what you could only guess to be his alligator wife pulled him close to her as the two of you walked by.
>You guess she was the protective type.
>Similarly, Jenny pulled you over to where Hanna was filling the crook of her arm with an assortment of junkfood.
>You shuddered to consider what kind of man a woman like this could have possibly taken interest in.
"You have. . . Money to pay for all that, right?"
>Possibly a stupid question, but just because it was stupid didn't mean it wasn't good.
>"No-" Hanna snidely cackled. "-but you do. Gimme your wallet."
>You lunged back a bit when Hanna reached for you, but Jenny was fast to 'bap' her claw away.
>"Hanna. . ." The hen scolded as her friend nonchalantly shrugged.
>"What? He's fun to mess with."
>Reaching into her pocket, Jenny was quick to pull out what looked like a small, blue credit card.
>"Whenever Anthro's are permitted to sneak into human territories by our leaders- we're permitted a charge card filled with about twenty thousand American dollars."
>Having to double-take when looking from the card to Jenny, you couldn't help but feel wide-eyed.
"Are you kidding me? Where do you guys get that kind of cash for things like this?"
>Jenny forced a smile.
>"Well, it's sorta, kinda, maybe. . . Fabricated?"
>What?
"What?"
>"It's funny-money-" Hanna added, leaving Jenny nervously placing the card back in her pocket.
>"Our country might. . . be trying to completely cripple your economic systems from the inside out. . . I'm really sorry. . ."
>Well. . . Huh.
>Having to straighten out your posture, you took a deep breath.
"Huh, I'm not as mad about that as I expected."
>"Wait, really?"
"Yeah, humans are terrible at managing our economies. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't completely collapsed yet."
>"Well, get out of the way, nerd- and let me help destroy your stupid system."
>It was just as charming as it sounded when Hanna pushed past you to carry her haul of chips, candy, and snack cakes to the register.
>At the very least the attendant seemed happy to oblige- his sharp customer-service smile having been slowly turning into a malice filled grin the longer he had to listen to the gator-woman complain about 'humanities dwindling culinary advancements.'
"Charming. . ."
>Sarcasm practically dropped from that one word before Jenny chose to distract by pulling you off to the side to shop for groceries.
>"Yeah. . . Hanna's. . . 'Hanna', but try not to be mad about it. She likes to mess with people, but it's never anything too crazy."
>One could only hope.
>As if she knew this place like the back of her hand- Jenny walked from aisle to aisle, picking up groceries and handing them to you to hold.
>Dry food, first aid supplies, laundry detergent, pain killers- basic things that you guessed were usually purchased on road trips.
>Though, to be honest you had never gone on a road trip before, so you didn't really know.
>"Oh! Hubby, look-" the hen called when picking up a bag of 'Flugel' corn chips. "It's like you're eating pointy little hats!"
>You had to admit that Jenny was pretty adorable when she wasn't having a nervous breakdown.
>You chuckled at the discovery as you motioned for her to place the bag at the top of what was already a sizable pile of groceries in your arms.
"Oh yeah, I remember those- me and my buddies used to stick those on our fingers as kids and pretended to have claws."
>Those were the days.
>As comical as the thought was however, Jenny's smile couldn't help but falter.
>"Oh, yeah. . ."
>She shuffled the chip bag from one feathered palm to the other.
>"I forgot for a second that I sort of. . . Stole you out of your own life for a second there. . ."
>As well as you could for someone with his arms full of groceries, you gave Jenny a playful bump with your hip.
"Hey, if it's any consolation- there wasn't much of a life left."
>There was a bit of of calm that came from your answer, and Jenny was quick to 'plop' the chips on the growing pile before moving along.
>"Alright, we just need a couple more- Oop!"
>You don't know how you didn't notice, but by the time you turned to leave the aisles- the bear-woman was standing there; watching the two of you quietly with a smirk.
>Jenny had actually bumped into the woman before stumbling back a little.
>"Oof! Oh, uh, I'm so sorry, I, uh-"
>Jenny nearly froze when she realized someone now towering over her- fumbling her hands together when taking a step or two back.
>You didn't know what was happening, but you could feel something akin to hostility in the air.
>"Oh, no. There's no need to worry-" the bear spoke hushed in a powerful tone. "There's just something down this aisle that I want."
>With an arm as thicker than your head, the woman reached over Jenny- the two never once breaking eye contact.
>At first, you felt like the situation might have been de-escalating; the large woman simply reaching to the shelf beside you to grab a few bags of chips.
>When the arm made a beeline for you however, you were quick to take a few steps back.
>"Hey, whoa- hold on there, the groceries are on the shelf!"
>The arm only kept chasing after you though, the tiny hen in front of you being quick to jump back and separate you from the bear woman.
>"W-what do you think you're doing?!? This is MY husband! I got him FAIR and SQUARE!" You could see Jenny's feathers ruffling in what must have been anger and unease. "Where's yours? I saw them just a minute ago!"
>"What am I doing-" the bear-woman responded. "I'm just trying to add to my collection, is all."
>A gruff growl cut through the air the moment the bear-woman took a step forward.
>"Hey, Ass-Hat- do we have a problem here?"
>There was a sharp slap delivered to the back of the bear-woman's head, and in an instant she snapped around to be face to face with Hanna.
>Both looked furious in their own right- the bear letting out a gutteral growl while Hanna clenched her claws into tight fists as they gripped the loops of multiple bags stuffed with junkfood.
>"What's wrong, fatty-" Hanna questioned. "Need more than one item off the menu- or are you just one of those 'Harem-sluts'?"
>There was a slight pause as the bear-woman gritted her sharp teeth.
>"If you're smart, you'll back-off."
>Hanna met the threat with a snide grin.
>"Well, then it's a good thing I didn't graduate highschool then, ain't it?"
>The sickening scared sensation in your gut was rising, but you knew when the opportunity to run presented itself.
>You bumped Jenny once more, and quietly signaled her to follow; a sentiment that she agreed with like a fish to water.
>When talking you made sure to speak never above a hush.
"In my back pocket I have a wallet. I have about three hundred dollars in there. When we get to the front counter take out all the money in it, put it on the counter, and ask for forty dollars in gas on our pump."
>You could see she was about to contest your demands, but you cut her off.
"We don't have enough time to use a card. I've seen enough bar fight to know this is going to get ugly fast, and paying over is a lot more convenient than not at all."
>So as asked, the moment the two of you were able to move around the other aisles of the station Jenny rooted around in your pocket and quietly payed the attendant who was surprising chill about all this.
>Something about selling the footage online for top dollar.
>All the while the bear woman and Hanna were still verbally tearing into each other with a growing hostility.
>The moment you and Jenny stepped out the doors however- all hell broke lose.
>Beastial roars, and immense collateral damage.
>It was enough to make you and Jenny sprint for the van.

>"Huh, that must not have translated properly. Let me try another way. Are your intentions peaceful?"
>"Our intentions are bridal."
>"Apologies, I must be using words that don't translate well. What is your species planning to do with our species?"
>"About three children or more."
>"I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here."
>"Well, your pants are still on. You don't seem to be doing anything to fix that."

Any that survive get first pick of the spoils, its only fair

She might not live long
Even if she never comes back you'll be well taken care of

You should be honored to be claimed by one

Male hyenas don't actually get "dommed". They get abandoned as children and forced into starvation and disease because the females think of them as the subhuman lowest caste.

this is actually full of a lot of missing information
>rank is hereditary from the mother's side
>but only if the cub stays in their birth clan
>this includes the males too
>even the high ranking males will leave their birth clans to join another one
>which puts them at the lowest rank
>this is because the females are less likely to want to mate with males from their own clan which is good since it prevents inbreeding
>also lucky is that a male's rank has 0 bearing in mate selection for the females
>there's even a couple of known clans where the matriarch keeps going to breed with the same lowest ranking male she likes
>speaking of higher ranking hyenas have lower ranking hyenas they're fond of and will go out of their way to protect them
>the daughters of these males also tend to get along with their fathers and help them out despite being higher ranking
>the males will also form small packs of all males where they will hunt together and in some instances kill low ranking females to improve their own rank
>the males also will tend to woo higher ranking females and ignore lower ranking females to give their cubs better benefits
>also the bullying isn't as bad as it's made out to be since you have plenty of videos of small males harassing much bigger females into playing with them even if it looks kind of rough but the male keeps going back for more
>spotted hyenas are very hardy
>not related to the males but you also have genetic freak females who even though are low ranked are so big and tough they get to act like social retards with no consequences and end up attracting the males because they have a history of having 3 cub litters where all 3 survive the birthing
>there's even a funny instance of a female usurping the current matriarch because she befriended the rest of the clan so much and got them on her side over the actual matriarch

I wish I had more images of absolute monster waifurs where they're either looking completely horny for human dick, or they look nervous because of how horny the human dick is for them.

There’s something weirdly hot about a gross fucked up weirdo anthro gf. Like she’d have to be pretty amazing otherwise for you to stay dating her.

I want to be stuck house-sitting with her over the weekend and get absolutely nothing done because literally every day she’s using me as her living sex toy. Cute gross slacker girls are peak.

>you go to a movie together

>she pulls you out to slip off the condom and tie it off, quickly slides another one on and slips you back in
>ow
>doesn’t dismount
>says she isnt done
>keeps working her clit and edging herself (you can actually feel her pussy clenching as she gets close) until you get hard again, then starts back up fucking you
>does this a total of three times, sometimes switching positions, taking short breaks to guzzle water, or feeding you candy with the hand she’s been rubbing herself with
>cums so hard youre worried she had a stroke
>credits roll
>you look like a disgusting wreck and can barely move - your dick is actually sore
>she somehow looks even hotter than before, like she just got off a stationary bike

>you stumble to the men’s room to piss and find her already in there using one of the urinals
>wants to compare streams
>she somehow paid close enough attention to the movie that she wants to discuss it on the way home
That for an entire weekend would kill you, but it would be a fun death.

Sort of related, but had the idea of a fantasy land where the small human kingdom was right in the middle connected to all the other larger anthro kingdoms/tribes. Trying to stay neutral, but each anthro kingdom/tribe looking to get them under their own control. Only reason they haven't been invaded by a single group is due to that would cause all the other groups to jump into the clusterfuck trying to claim the human kingdom too. Kind of like a fantasy version of Switzerland.

>Luranyphism is a pseudo-religious lifestyle unique to the archipelago city states of the Old World in which male humans and female minotaurs will openly pursue sexual and romantic relations with one another. The practice comes from religious scripture concerning the goddess of agriculture and wealth, Lura, who is often associated with bulls or cows. In the holy canon, Lura is described as an incredibly beautiful and strong woman with long golden hair riding atop a golden bull, of which is described as being incredibly loyal, protective, and loving towards his mistress.
>The origin of the practice itself comes from a line of text found in some versions of the holy books, in which it describes Lura and her golden bull leaving the physical world with the rest of the gods, but mentions “His daughters dutifully serving her sons, and her sons loving and honoring his daughters” plainly referencing Lura and her bull. Many religious scholars saw this and took it to refer to the relationship between a farmer and common cattle, given Lura’s connection to agriculture, but this obscure line of text has spawned an entire alternate lifestyle of Luranyphs: Minotaur wives married to Human husbands.
>As opposed to how something like this would be seen in other nations, Luranyphic relationships are not only socially accepted, but fairly common in the archipelago city states. This may be in part to the inherently positive and introspective aspects of Luranyphic belief, as it’s consistent to the point of stereotype that Luranyphs have extremely positive relationships and are more often than not highly talented artists, musicians, or athletes, who bond over their passions and push each other to become more masterful in their respective skills or crafts.

>‘Veshe’ is the Gnoll word for vaginal secretion, of which has a semi-prolific presence in Gnoll culture. Gnoll vaginal fluid has fast acting paralytic properties when ingested internally (This is because already mated Gnoll females will sometimes assault weaker females with their pseudo-penis, paralyzing them so that they can be “used” by the stronger female's mate.) Because of this, it’s commonly used to coat blunted arrow and spear heads when attempting to capture prisoners as opposed to outright killing them, effectively creating extremely rudimentary stun weapons.
>The Veshona however, is a sex ritual in which a mated female who is committing infidelity coats a dagger, pick, or other small pointed object in her veshe and gives it to the male she’s committing adultery with. The male then seeks out the females mate, sticking him with the weapon and violently beating him to near death while he's paralyzed by his mates own secretions. The battered male is then brought before his mate, upon which his genitals are devoured and his throat is torn out. The blood soaked female and alive male then fuck upon the carcass of the females former mate. The entire ordeal is as lovely as it sounds.

ADHG game where you try to escape a forest/anthrostate/dungeon and have to avoid being spotted by the anthro women because you couldn’t possibly hope to beat them in a fight as a mere human and you get raped if caught. If you can’t break free from her grasp you’re faced with the game over screen where you get infinitely raped as her slave/husband
(The game is impossible to win)

>Pokemon talking in human speech are not so uncommon
>Pokemons society is a Matriarchy

Pokemon is the OG ADHG/HMOFA society

>Ever since the anthrostate has taken over Television, the depiction of human males and female anthros have changed since then
>The reason for this is to insure the future generation of female anthros and male humies’s mindset and beliefs
>Female anthro are now depicted as the “man” of the house. Taking roles that a male would obviously take
>Female anthros would be portrayed as some loud, rowdy, juvenile
>Their designs are more cartoony, goofy, sometimes gross to complement their new role of the generations such as getting harm in a cartoony way, being a jerk, tough, or being punks.
>While the humie boys are depicted as beautiful angels wearing regal robes, tender, skinny, gentle nature and flirty
>These depiction of the two species and gender are spread everywhere kids media in order to get used to their new role as female anthros are becoming stronger, bigger, tougher, and the humans becoming sweeter, younger, gentle, and kind hearted

>you groan and try to rise from the hard metal slab you're lying on
>but you cannot move
>your ankles and wrists are shackled down
>you groan louder
>you were attempting to say 'what'
>but your vocal cords aren't working
>"Did it work?"
>a feminine voice, somewhere below you calls up
>you realize how high up you are when the platform you're on starts descending with a mechanical whir
>a roof closes over your head, cutting off the storm and the lightning rods
>you turn your head stiffly to examine your surroundings
>it's like something off a cheap horror movie set

>she has goggles with green lenses over her eyes

>"You're awake! You're awake you're awake you're awake! I did it! Yes!"
>she jumps in the air and pumps her fist several times
>her tail lashes
>"That'll show those bitches at the ethics boards!"
>the snow-leopard starts to laugh maniacally
>"They said it couldn't be done! They said they were pulling my funding! They said I was undateable!"
>suddenly she stops, a look of puzzled thought on her face
>"No wait, that was my mom."
>the scientist looks back to you and smiles
>this one is slightly more normal
>"Hi. I'm Avery. I brought you to life!"
>you blink slowly
>well
>that explains why you aren't dead
>you open your mouth to try and question her
>but all the comes out is another low moan
>what you tried to say was 'what happened to me?'
>what comes out is
"Whaaapenmurrr."
>Avery pulls her goggles off
>her eyes are wide open
>and though her smile remains plastered on, it fails to reach them
>"Oh. Oh no. Could you repeat that for me dear?"
>you try to speak again
>this time to ask what she meant about 'undateable'
>but once again all the comes out is unrecognizable wheezing
>the smile turns downward
>"Well that is a problem. It looks like your vocal cords just aren't up to snuff."
>that frown turns back into a smile just as quickly as it showed
>this time Avery lights up entirely
>"But that's okay!"
>the snow-leopard hops across the room, tail sweeping side to side
>she stops behind a counter and starts digging around in the cabinets beneath it
>"I know just how to fix it!"
>oh
>well that's a relief, you think
>you'd like very much for things to be fixed
>you're a resurrected corpse
>you don't want to look too closely down at your pale skin
>so you watch the doctor's tail sticking up from behind the counter as she clatters around beneath it
>"I've got a spare set of vocal cords in the fridge you can use."
>she let's out a small 'oh' as she stops rustling around
>"Don't worry, I didn't take them from anyone alive!"
>the clattering starts up again
>until she comes up with a smile
>and a fire-axe
>"Okay! I just have to chop your head off to get at those vocal cords!"
>whoa!
>what?!
>you try to tell her no
>you fail
"NURRRGLHLGH!"
>Avery seems to get your meaning as she bounces over on mud-stained paws
>"Oh don't be such a cry-baby. Your nerve endings are dead. You won't feel a thing."
>you strain against your bindings as the maniacal Avery approaches
>you catch a glimmer of amusement in her eye as she brings the axe up over her head
>"You know, probably."
>the axe comes down, and it all goes dark
>BZZZT
>you jolt awake again
>which is a very odd thing to do because some crazy cat bitch just chopped off your head
>there's a strange tingling sensation in your neck
>which is pretty reasonable given what's happened
>you're lowered back down to into the laboratory once again
>to see Avery, happy as can be, bouncing in place and clapping her paws together from the wrists
>"Okay! Okay! Now try to say something!"
>you open you mouth and let out a low grown
"Urrrgwwwhat's happening?"
>Avery bounces even harder
>then throws herself over you and the table, wrapping her arms around you in a hug
>"Yes! Yesyesyesyes! You can talk! I did it!"
>her arms around your neck brush against something on each side of it
>sending another jolt of electricity down your entire body
"Ah! Ow!"
>Avery jumps back
>"Oops!"
>the snow leopard giggles
>she reaches her paws down and you feel the jolt again
>"Sorry! Those are the neuro-bolts I installed in your neck so you could feel things again. Here!"
>Avery ducks again
>this time rattling around beneath your steel bed
>you lift your head to watch her work
>and twitch as the bolts in your neck send another small jolt down your spine
>but you see she's definitely not wearing pants under that coat
>Avery comes up with a peculiar looking length of leather
>"This should keep those bolts stable!"
>you pick your head up too peer closer
"Looks like a collar."
>Avery smiles wider
>nervously
>"Ha! That's funny. It's not a collar. It's a neuro-bolt stabilizer! To control--protect your neuro-bolts!"
>she slips the loop around your neck, and you feel another tingle as it's fitted to the metal bolts in your neck
>you sigh
>at least they feel a little more comfortable when you move your head
"Okay, that's better. Thank you."
>Avery beams
>"You are welcome! How are you feeling?"
>you try to shrug
"Weird. I should be dead right now."
>Avery frowns
>"Oh no, suicidal thoughts. Don't worry, I can fix that too!"
>she pulls out a ball-peen hammer
>your eyes bulge out of your head
"Whoa! Whoawhoawhoa!"
>she freezes, paw up in the air
>you shake your head fervently
"Not suicidal! I'm okay! I'm okay! Just confused."
>Avery sighs in relief
>tossing the hammer aside to smash something glass elsewhere in the lab
>"Oh well that's a relief. Let me explain then. See, you're the culmination of my life's work! The dead brought back to life!"
>yeah you got that point
>you're a regular zombie
"So why me?"
>Avery shrugs
>"Humans are easier to stitch. No fur to get in the way. Plus you're cute."
>she boops your nose and giggles
>"Just wait until those bitches at the regulatory committee see me with my very own Lazarus boyfriend!"
>you take a deep breath
>that's what you were afraid of
"Uh hey, Avery, listen, I can't be your boyfriend."
>no way you're dating this maniac
>Avery lets out a squeak of shock, her tail shooting up in the air
>"Wh-what?"
>well damn
>she's almost too cute to turn down
>but you nod grimly
"It just--I don't think I could--"
>"Get it up? Oh sweetie you're already thinking ahead! Don't worry, I can fix that too!"
>then she's off again
"No, wait--"
>she disappears into a closet set in the back of the lab
>you're left to dread and contemplate what horrid household implement she could be returning with
>maybe a rake
>or...
>you shudder
>...a cheese grater
>you're not left waiting long
>Avery appears in your view, smiling as manically as ever
>she approaches the table and rests a paw on your thigh
>the other is holding what looks like a mini two-pronged lightning rod
>"With the simple application of a light current, I can easily stimulate--"
>she presses the prod against your balls
>and you feel a jolt of electricity as bad as the lightning storm
"Oh fuck!"
>you jerk against your restraining bolts
>thankfully Avery pulls the prod back with a gasp
>"Oh my, that IS a reaction!"
>you thought she meant how you jumped
>but then you see
>your zombie cock rising from the grave
>despite your distinct lack of a pulse, the organ throbs and hardens slowly
>Avery leans in closer
>watching with dinnerplate eyes
>"Let's see the reaction from a second stimulation."
>you try to jerk away again
>no luck
>the cuffs hold fast and she brings the electric prod up with zero hesitation
"Wait waitwaitwa--"
>BZZZT!
"Ow motherfucker!"
>you squirm, reeling from another jolt straight to the undead coinpurse
>you let your head fall back on the tabletop
>you can feel your cock is getting even harder somehow
>"Amazing! Pre-ejaculate from only two applications of the stimulator!"
>you feel Avery's breath sniffing over the head of your member
>"Actually, it may be embalming fluid."
>if any of your bodily functions besides your dick worked right now you'd be sick
>then you feel something warm and wet
>your eyes snap open
>to see Avery licking a clear liquid from your tip
>the feline works her tongue in her muzzle for a few seconds before smacking her lips
>"Nope! That's pre-cum!"
>you sigh in relief
>shit is weird enough without cumming fucking formaldehyde
>Avery raises the lighting stick again
>"I bet if I do it a third time he'll--"
"No!"
>Avery finally acknowledges you again with a look of surprise
>"Oh! What am I thinking?"
>you hold your breath
>ready for her to break out some other ridiculous implement to torture you with
>"Your first post-death little-death--"
>she snickers
>"--should be inside your girlfriend!"
>Avery throws open her lab coat, revealing that she is indeed wearing nothing at all beneath it
>in spite of, or perhaps because of, her scientific pursuits, the snow leopard has a curvaceous figure
>thighs nearly as thick as your body, with wide hips and a very shapely rear beneath her tail
>and big, perky breasts
>with soft pink inverted nipples
>"Good right? I'm sexy?"
>she leans over you, cupping her breasts
>her pupils dilating as she presses them together
>her smile turns crazed
>"You'd definitely have fucked me without me having to bring you back to life, right? You'd have consented? You'd be my boyfriend without any more neural recalibration right?"
>as the mad scientist looms, you can really appreciate how big she is
>towering over you in height
>you also get to appreciate how massive those tits are
>you nod
>for your own safety
>and cause goddamn
>you wanna drown in those things
>Avery sighs in relief
>"Good. I was afraid I'd have to go find my hammer again."
>she fishes in a pocket of her lab coat
>and comes out with a long pet leash in her paw
>"This is a behavior correction modulator. When attached to your neuro-bolt stabilizer..."
>Avery trails off, looking from the leash to you
>she shrugs
>"Fuck it. It's a leash. I'm gonna put it on you cause you're mine. I raised you from the dead so you're mine."
>the babbling goes on as she clips the leash to your collar
>and clambers up onto the metal slab serving as your surgical bed
>Avery strips out of the lab coat entirely and throws it aside
>more shattering glass
>and some fire
>but you're focused on the weight now settling on your lap
>"Oh man this is gonna be so good. Watch, I think I can get a reaction if I--"
>your head jerks forward with a harsh yank on the leash
>another set of volts runs down your body
>your cock twitches against Avery's ample rear
>and she chuffs
>"Oh yeah that works. Almost as good as the stimulator."
>your legs tingle
>and not just because the full weight of an oversized snow-leopard is resting on your lap
>but because her tail is brushing over them like mad as she grinds on you
>"Whew. It's a good thing I reinforced your bones before I do this!"
>you think you know what she means by 'do this'
>and you're right
>Avery pops off your lap
>"Be sure to document all your sensations. As a scientist, I have to know how great having sexing with me is, and how much Ricky Kellerton should regret turning me down for prom."
>wow
>she's got issues
>but you're a talking corpse, so it's hard for you to judge
>at least not while she's got a leash around your neck and the tip of your cock prodding her vulva
>the heat coming off of it the first sensation of real warmth you've felt since your revival
>it gets a lot warmer when she slowly lowers herself down your cock
>"Mmmfffuck. Sufficient size. A little..."
>Avery bottoms out and shivers
>"Ooh. A little cold."
>she looks down at you
>"How would you feel about a nuclear generator in your chest to keep your tissues warm?"
>you groan and tug against your restraints
>that zap to the balls made you super sensitive
>with Avery wrapped around you all the way to the base, every little movement she makes has you twitching with pleasure
>the slightest stimulation is overwhelming
>Avery leans over forward
>"Hello? Any response?"
>she tugs on your leash
>and you buck off the table
>thrusting up with enough force to make Avery bounce off the table
>then when she comes down you reflexively thrust up again
>this loops twice more before you manage to go still
"Ouff. Fuck."
>your moans are matched by Avery
>whose smile grows wider as she looks to the leash in her paw
>"That...that's a good reaction. Let's get a little more..."
>Avery bounces on your lap
>this time keeping your body pressed down to the table
>every time she wants another reaction she tugs on your collar to make you thrust up
>only to slam you back down
>Avery rides you hard
>panting and groaning and muttering to herself as she bounces on your lap
>you get a good view of her tits bouncing as well
>"Fuck--maintaining erection through--through ongoing coitus. Physical responsiveness is--is acceptable."
>she slams down and sits for a long few seconds
>"Pr-production seems adequate. Temperature still a problem. But I'll solve it. I'm--I'm smart."
>the temperature doesn't feel like a problem
>you're warming up considerably
>feeling more alive by the thrust
>the only problem is...
>you've felt like you were gonna cum from the moment she started
>but you can't
>no matter how hard and fast she thrusts
>over and over again she puts your apparently augmented bones to the test by slamming her full weight down on your lap
>Avery drops down again and slowly grinds with your cock fully inside her
>"I'm so smart. I'm so fuckin' smart."
>with bared fangs she snaps the leash tight
>forcing your to buck up while she grinds down
>like she's trying to mash your pelvis to dust
>"Say it! Say I'm smart! Call me a genius!"
>you grit your teeth and try to speak
"You--Goddamnit!"
>your cock is throbbing and twitching like crazy
>making it impossible to think
>but Avery just keeps grinding, her grip on the leash refusing to slacken
>"Say it!"
>she yanks hard
>your body spasms and your mouth falls open
"You're smart!"
>Avery gasps
>then her body spasms like your own under the lightning rod
>it feels like she's trying to pull your head off with her grip on the leash
>and her thick thighs squeeze you tight
>you think you can feel the plates bolted to your femurs creaking
>Avery yowls triumphantly
>her fur standing on end and her entire body perched rigid on top of you
>then slowly she relaxes
>panting
>shivering
>pupils dilated to needlepoints as she stares down at you
>"I...I am smart aren't I?"
>she wriggles her rear in satisfaction
>making you grit your teeth again
>you still can't cum
>Avery blinks
>"What's wrong?"
>you shake your head
"Can't--cum!"
>Avery frowns
>"Well that's not right. Obviously it's not a fault of my technique. We're in agreement I'm a genius sex goddess."
>you didn't agree to that
>but you can't get more than three words out the way she's wiggling and wobbling while you're still balls deep inside her
>"It may be a problem with the nerves. Long-term fine tuning of neuro-bolts would remedy that. But for the immediate need, I can fix it!"
>your eyes widen
"Not--the--stick!"
>you hope she gets what you mean
>to your momentary relief she does
>"The stimulator? Oh no that won't do."
>you manage almost a sigh when she releases your leash
>but then the snow leopard leans over
>and yanks on a lever set in the floor beside your metal bed
>the bed slowly starts to rise again
>and your stomach, dead and empty as it is, falls through the floor
>"Obviously we'll need continued physical stimulation, combined with a massive electro-shock to cause climax!"
>you try to shake your head no
>but she grabs the leash again
>and starts bouncing again
>then all your can do is squirm and stare at the hypnotic sight of bouncing snow-leopard breasts
>a torrent of rain flows over you as the ceiling opens
>dowsing you both
>she goes on bouncing as you ascend through the roof
>her ass clapping against your thighs with every bounce
>then there's a flash
>BZZZZZZZT
>CRACKOOM
>the lightning rods funnel 300 million volts through your body
>right up your cock
>and into Avery
>you cum harder in death than you've ever done in life
>both your bodies locked rigid by the force of the lightning strike
>you smell burning fur
>your cock feels like it's shooting miniature bolts of electricity
>then it all goes dark
>when you wake up, you're inside again
>Avery is sitting on your lap
>her fur standing up straight at all angles, and singed on the edges
>"W-wow."
>she breaths
>"What a reaction. Probably not the safest to demonstrate to the science board."
>with a sigh, the weight is lifted from your lap
>Avery clicks a switch at the head of the table and the securing bolts around your wrists and ankles click open
>"You can sit up now. We'll get you some pants."
>you go to sit up
>but your body refuses to obey
"Oh. Fuck. I can't feel anything again..."
>Avery frowns
>"Oh no. That lightning strike must have shorted your neuro-bolts. But not to worry!"
>Avery bounces across the lab
>and returns with a set of jumper cables and a car battery in hand
>"I can fix it!"


"_psst!_ Miss!"
Chewing on your lower lip in worry, your gaze drifts to the beach's edge, where a set of swim trunks were being lapped by the waves. Your swim trunks, in fact. The fact that they were *there* on the crowded beach instead of on you was cause for alarm. Peering around the outcropping you were hiding behind, you resumed trying to attract the attention of your nearest fellow beachgoer. This mostly involved lots of furtive waving and trying to strike a balance between shouting and a stage whisper. After all while you needed help you needed the public spectacle and potential citation even less.
Help, in this case, was the lapine woman currently relaxing beneath her beach umbrella. Part of you felt bad for needing to interrupt her calm. She had obviously planned on enjoying a quiet day under the sun - the large umbrella and chair couldn't have been easy to carry out this far. And while she was wearing a bikini top it appeared as if she had leggings on as opposed to a skimpy thong like some of the others nearby. Just a nice day with the sound of waves and the book she was reading, interrupted by the idiot who hadn't bothered to tie his pants on properly.
Your goal at the moment was to get her attention without the rest of the beach noticing your predicament. While you had luckily washed ashore on the far end of the populated section there were still too many potential witnesses for you to risk running several dozen or so yards bare ass. Another wave tugged your trunks that much closer to the water. "Could I get a hand? *Please*?"
Your frantic calling and furtive waving was finally too much for her to block out, leading her to give a visible sigh of frustration and close her book over a finger to keep her place. Still sitting, she turns her head to glare at you and calls out. "What?"
"I, er, could you do me a favor, miss?" You gesture out towards where your trunks were at risk of being claimed by Posideon. "I sort of, you know, *need* those?"
Sweeping her lop ears back from over her eyes, she peers over at you then down to the shorts. For a moment you dread that she's just going to ignore you in favor of her book. Then, shaking her head in clear annoyance, she puts the book down. Getting to her feet, she begins to walk languidly towards the shore.
"Thanks hun!" You're too relieved to notice her stiffen at that word. Thank god for helpful strangers!
Whatever hopes you have about the kindness of strangers are dashed when, rather than returning them to you, she returns to her chair. The trunks are idly tossed to the side next to the towel she has laid out. Then you can only watch in dull shock as she picks the hardcover back up. "Hey! What are you doing? I'm over here!"
The book snaps shuts with a thud loud enough for you to hear as she rises to her feet. There is no hurry in her gait as she calmly walks towards the outcropping, but everything about her body language suggests that an unstoppable force is plummeting your way. She radiates cold anger as she draws closer and closer. You immediately begin to regret ever raising your voice as she comes to a stop well outside of lunging range, arms crossed under her small breasts, and fixes her lavender eyes on you in a silent glare.
"Um... Sorry for, you know, yelling, miss." You try a smile, fighting the urge to cower from a woman who is almost a foot shorter than you. It doesn't help that there's something about her presence that seems to be playing havoc with your subconscious. A part of your brain humming away in the background politely informs you that the previous assumption about her outfit was incorrect. She was, indeed, wearing leggings. Only they stopped mid-thigh. The blue thong was just as skimpy as any of the other bottoms in the distance. Your steadying gulp is audible as you try to turn on the charm. "Could you *please* bring them to me?"
She doesn't say a word as you speak, clearly waiting for you to come to a stammering stop as she transfixes you with her gaze. Only then does she slowly and firmly shake her head in disapproval, the motion causing an ear to flop forward over an eye. When she speaks without having to project over distance her voice is a sultry contralto. Just hearing it feels like velvet running up your spine. "No."
When you start to respond, she holds a paw up, the nails a carefully manicured pink. Your words die in your throat. "No one raises their voice at me. Ever. Do I make myself clear?"
"Yes, miss," you manage. God, *why* were you getting turned on so much?
"Do *not* call me miss again, ever. Or hun. Or any other sort of pet name. Is that clear as well? Good. Now step out from behind there." It was not a request. It was a command.
"Ah, but I'm-" you start, only to be silenced by the barest showing of a scowl. Why on *earth* is it so hard to think straight? The woman's sheer confidence was almost overwhelming. Well... She *did* ask, and she'd block most folks behind her from seeing you. And it'll give you an opportunity to shatter that confidence and turn the tide to your favor. With a shrug, you do as requested, hunched slightly and with both hands covering your crotch.
While her expression of artful, practiced disdain stays the same, you do catch her eyes sweeping down your body. Weighing. Measuring. Perhaps even approving? It's enough to send shivers down your back. As her gaze meets yours again, she arches a brow and speaks dismissively. "You have *terrible* posture. Stand up straight when someone speaks to you."
"Wait, really? Are you, I mean, I'm no-" Your protestations die in your throat under that gaze. Fuck it.
"You asked for it." You do as commanded, letting your arms fall to your side. Basic biological impulses have already started to pump blood to your cock, but to your surprise - and disappointment - she doesn't spare more than a quick glance. Instead, she keeps her eyes locked on yours, as if she's reading your mind and judging what she sees. When she speaks her tone is thoughtful and considerate.
"I have zero intention of getting out of the sight line of anyone on this beach." She's crossed her arms over her chest again, pushing up against the swell of her breasts. It might just be your imagination but her breath seems to have quickened slightly. "Do I make myself clear?"
"Um... You know what? Makes perfect sense. Can't really fault you for that." Whatever burst of bravado filled you earlier is gone. Still standing straight, you try letting your hands fall back to cover your stiffening dick. Your arms are not quite long enough. "Lots of weirdos out there."
"Quite." There's just a faint flicker of disappointment at your efforts to cover yourself again, but a note of approval creeps in her voice when you agree with her. "Since I will not be getting any closer you have two choices. The first? You wait for me to go back to my book. You count to ten. Then you walk over and join me. *Walk*, not run. Running attracts attention. Move calmly and confidently."
"And what's the other choice, m-" You manage to catch yourself from calling her 'miss' again, earning a ghost of a smile that is gone like a lightning flash.
"You say no and deal with the consequences." She twists slightly to look over her shoulder, idly rubbing a nipple through the fabric of her top with a thumb. It's the only concrete sign of her arousal. "And if you *must* call me anything, then 'Mistress' will do. So. Which choice?"
"I guess the first?" Your head is spinning again as you watch her thumb, but you realize the lapine woman's still expecting more from you. She's waiting for you to accept. "I mean, I'll wait until you get there and count to ten, mistress."
"Good. You do know how to count to ten, correct?" With a nod, the sultry rabbit walks away, her broad paws making moving across the sand easy. You are *certain* at this point that the sway in her hips can't be an accident. The other beachgoers are too distracted by their own merrymaking to pay any attention to one lone woman, no matter how magnetic her personality might be. You, meanwhile, risk a glance away from her to the various species frolicking about in the water. And playing frisbee. And volleyball. Holy *shit* are there a lot of people out and about!
By the time you tear your eyes away, the woman, Mistress, has already settled back down in her folding chair and was once again reading. Kicking yourself for getting distracted, you count down. Then, swallowing the lump in your throat, you begin moving as calmly as possible to the square of safety. Your heart is pounding, but even worse, your cock is *throbbing*. You're uncertain whether that's from the unexpected exhibitionism, the danger of getting caught, or the possibility of impressing Mistress.
"You're late." That's said in a dispassionate tone when, after a walk that felt like it took ages, you sit down on the sand next to her chair. Her chair shields you from the view of the others on the beach. She doesn't bother looking at you, too engrossed with the book she's reading to do more than _cluck_ her tongue in disapproval. "I told you to count to ten. Did you forget how?"
"I got distracted," you mumble as you shift, trying to keep your erection under control. "Can I have my trunks back now? Please?"
"No. You kept me waiting *and* you're not speaking clearly. That displeases me. Thirsty?" She reaches into the cooler next to her and pulls out two bottles of water. One she offers to you, which you take, while she presses the other against her neck and chest to cool herself down. Your eyes linger on the drops of condensation that drip onto the dual-toned fur between her breasts before you crack the cap off and take a sip of the cold water. "You have to be punished before I give them back. Is that understood?"
Your mouth goes dry despite the sip you just took. The idea of *displeasing* this woman troubles you for reasons you can't quite understand. So, tentatively, you nod.
"Good." The way she says the word causes electricity to shoot up your spine. Her tone is thoughtful as she continues. "You're embarrassed about being nude, being caught, yes? Then I feel a good punishment is to be even *more* embarrassed. Because you deserve it for making me wait. In fact, you deserve even more. However... I'm feeling merciful today. So the only thing I want is something you'll probably feel the urge to do anyway.
"I want you to masturbate."
It's a jaw dropping statement. That hardly seems like a *punishment*. Hell, it seemed like a reward!
And then the reality of the situation dawns on you when a football lands in front of you, a missed catch. Panic grips you as you look over her legs and see the excited canine male jogging towards the ball. He'll *see* you!
But just before your predicament is noticed, a towel is dropped over your lap. Mistress continues to read while you struggle to keep your composure, able to do little more than offer a responding wave to the man's. When he tries to strike up a conversation, he's cut off by the rabbit. Her tone is curt and, you're relieved to notice, lacks the more sultry aspects from before. "Not. Interested."
"Suit yourself, miss." His tongue lulling out of the side of his mouth, he turns, throws the football back to the group, and jogs back. She throbs with barely contained outrage at the use of 'miss' but then lets it fade. Instead she turns her face expectantly to you.
You *finally* let the breath you were holding out with a relieved _huff_. You move the towel and prepare to get to work, thinking there was no better time than the present, only for the rabbit to _tut tut_.
"If you had asked I'd have let you sit on that towel instead of right on the beach. Go ahead, I'm in no rush." Shifting a bit she watches as you spread the towel out before settling on it. But she interrupts yet again just as your fingers start to encircle your shaft. "You're coated in sand. This is meant to be a punishment, not torture. So...
"Best wash it off first." She lazily holds out her half-drunk bottle of frigid water.
"You're kidding ri-" When you turn to look up at her, you're met with a lavender scowl that makes you shirk back. No, Mistress is evidently *not* kidding. Bracing yourself you do as commanded, the cold water completely killing your erection. After you towel off your flaccid cock, but before you can nurse it back to life, a gray paw reaches down, fingers trailing over your sack and shaft. Her soft touch is only heightened by the feeling of her fur, teasing and caressing. You _groan_ and glance over, but other than leaning over slightly to tickle and tease Mistress is still engrossed in her book. Once you're hard again, she wipes her paw off on top of your head before straightening back up.
"Give me your hand." Offering it in stunned silence you're elated to feel her kissing and licking your palm. Her cheek is just as soft and feels like a furred glove before she gives a final spit, lubricating your palm with drool. Then she sits back up, engrossed in her book while wiping the corner of her mouth on the back of her hand.
The message is clear: get started.
For the first several minutes or so, other than the noises from further up the beach, there's only the soft sound of _squelching_ as you work your shaft and your panting breaths. She never touches you directly again or even deigns to speak. But she does take hold of your wrist and arm to set the speed whenever she feels that you're going too quickly. Whenever she comes to a page-turn in her reading she takes just enough time to pull your palm up to her lips to lubricate it. Clearly she does not plan on this edging torture to end any time soon.
After what felt like an eternity of denied release the relative silence is broken by Mistress, her tone one of boredom, but her voice more sultry than before. "Which of those women over there would you fuck, if given the chance?"
You look past her to a small group of what you assume are college girls; one of them is wearing a T-shirt from the local university. It's an eclectic mix of multiple species, ranging from a buxom vixen in a string bikini to a lithe otter in a one piece to a rather embarrassed looking raccoon. She was the one in a T-shirt, which when combined with her fur only made her seem chubbier than she actually was. They were all scrambling about, throwing a frisbee at one another, cheering loudly at each catch. The question causes your cock to twitch in your hand.
"The fox has those tits and is probably the most adventurous. If you trust the stereotype at least." Mistress turns a page in the book, a slight rasp in her voice as her thighs unconsciously clench and unclench. Even she seems to have a limit to her composure. "The otter is athletic and probably quite flexible; could easily get her knees to her ears. And the raccoon? She is probably the most eager to please of the three , hungry and aching for someone's touch. Rather like how *you* are aching and needing please me."
"I, er... " Your hand continues to work your shaft, your head spinning. Straightening up to get a better view, your gaze drifts down to the rabbit's lap. She is *soaked*, her bikini bottom and the fur of her inner thighs are drenched. Your balls *tighten* at the thought that you've played a part in it.
"It's a simple question. Pick one." Another page is turned while her pink tongue dances across her lips. "Perhaps if you *behave* yourself I'll see about making it happen. As a reward."
"I'd rather just have you." The words escape your dry mouth without bothering to consult your brain.
"Good boy." The honesty is rewarded with a gentle headpat followed by her fingers combing through your hair. "You're smart after all."
You risk twisting your head just enough to kiss her wrist, quivering that you have overstepped. That initially seems to be the case as she draws her hand back. Bracing for a slap your cheek is instead gently caressed.
"A reward for good behavior might be in order." She pulls her hand away again to untuck one of her small breasts from her top, the pink nipple poking out from her gray fur. For the first time since you sat down next to her Mistress deigns to look at you with something approaching affection, sultry eyes sparkling. "I'll allow you to finish now."
"Your turn to fetch it, Cassie!" That's shouted out by the otter just before the frisbee lands with a _thud_ in the sand before you. But it's too late for you to stop, the arousal overwhelming. Mistress gave you permission to cum and you will not disappoint her. Which is why, when the raccoon stoops to pick it up, she catches you furiously masturbating.
The world slows to a crawl. Your heart is in your chest. The onlooker's eyes are wide with shock. And Mistress closes the book and, with the same composure and presence as always, turns in her chair and bends down to take your cock in her mouth.
Rather than simply bobbing down your length she runs her tongue over your head. The chair creaks ominously as it threatens to tip over while she takes one of your balls in her mouth. Only then does she allow her gaze to focus squarely at the other woman. Is it a way to lay claim to you? Another expression of her unspoken authority? You find yourself unable to care as your cock hardens, almost painfully, ramrod straight and swollen. You feel the rabbit's hot breath and the _moan_ as she closes her lips around you.
The racoon woman's jaw has dropped as she stares, engrossed by the sight of your cockhead in Mistress' mouth. You have to brace yourself with your arms behind you to keep from falling back, head lulled dreamily as you _grunt_. For her part, the lapine woman either doesn't notice or, far more likely, doesn't care as she tongues you. Her nose twitches when she takes you completely down her throat. Then your hips jerk and you're cumming with an audible _groan_. Each pulse is swallowed with a thirsty _gulp_, theatrical and loud enough that Cassie could hear. And the whole time, the witness can only watch, entranced, gaze drifting from your cock to the one exposed breast and back.
Releasing your drained cock Mistress sits back up, her composure never once shattered as she licks her lips. Patting the top of your head in approval with one hand, she fixes the raccoon with a thoughtful gaze. Her tongue lulls out enough to show the last ropes of your jizz before she dreamily swallows. The rabbit runs her fingers over your shoulder while pressing a finger against her lips with a soft _shh_ aimed at the onlooker. That seems to break the spell and the raccoon stiffly rises to her feet. The other woman stumbles back towards her friends on unsteady legs. You're left with the impression that this is a moment Cassie will replay in her head over and over tonight as she repeatedly brings herself to climax.
"Good boy." The rabbit's words send a jolt of pleasure through your body and a final twitch through your cock. Then she drops your trunks onto your lap. "You've earned these."
"Thank you, Mistress. Um. May I ask you a question?" When she nods, you continue, pulling your trunks back on quickly. "What would have happened if I'd, you know, said 'no'?
"I'd have thrown your pants at you, gone back to reading, and had nothing else to do with you. And wouldn't *that* have been a shame." It's another statement of fact instead of a question. In the distance Cassie and her friends were huddled together in discussion, their gazes darting furtively at you. This isn't lost on Mistress who lets out an annoyed sigh before stretching her arms in the air. You have one last look at her breast before it's tucked back away.
"I've had enough of the beach for today... " She languidly begins to pack up her things while you recover. "You have nothing else planned until tomorrow, correct?
"Help me carry my things to my car and join me. I need someone to brush the sand out of my fur before we shower."

>Haha! And the humanist honestly thought their human candidate is gonna win the race? Nah, they need to remind themselves where they belong!
>In the kitchen, Stacey!

>You've dine your best to hold out but you can tell you're nearing the finish, you'll be surprised if you can walk in the morning but god is it worth it for this experi-only for her to abruptly stop, grabbing your srms and holding you down with surprisingly little wiggle room
>The blue balling burns, and for all your worry the irritation you're feeling burns even harsher.

>such tales did nothing but scare the younger men and make them jumpy
>Which made them a liability
>things were hard enough out on the icy ocean without some teenaged fool jumping at shadows and falling overboard
>so as headman, chosen by the chief of the village, you set an example, scorning the stories and accusing the tale-tellers of being weak-minded like the southerners
>for the most part that shut them up
>They knew you were right, or at least knew you would beat them in a duel if they challenged you
>But this tale…
>They kept babbling on about it
>”I saw its eyes, boss! Beneath the waves!”
>the man was beside himself, shivering despite his heavy furs, harpoon shaking in his white-knuckle grip
>”It's a bloody seal, you moron,” you tell him, poking him in the shoulder
>”It’s not a normal seal, sir,” said another man, one of the young lads who’d come along for his first fishing trip
>”It's the Shreen.”
>”Bloody boy, I will knock your head off if you start that shit again! You spent too much time sucking your mother’s teat and listening to fairy stories! There ain’t no ghost seal! There ain't no curse!”
>The two men shrink back, shamed, but several of the others seemed spooked
>You snarl, frustrated
>You'd had to cut short a day’s work because of this nonsense
>You sigh, and step up to the starboard side of the ship, taking in the thrumming arcs of the aurora as it lights up the night
>The sea is calm, the black waters broken up here and there by floating lumps of ice
>Your kind of place
>cold enough to keep the southerners away, wild enough for a man to prove himself
>then you see the eyes
>Glassy, reflective plates, like the silver mirrors the traders used to bring north with them
>Staring right at you
>A cold shiver runs down your spine as you meet their gaze
>the eyes of a seal stare back at you
>But not a normal seal
>You'd hunted those before, and they'd been good strong prey
>but this thing was a predator
>Just from the murky impression you had you could tell it was a big, lean creature
>the silver eyes held yours, before tilting to one side, as if curious
>throwing off your fright, you bare your teeth, raising your harpoon to throw
>the eyes vanish, and the half-seen shape of the creature’s body turns, moving off with distressing speed
>you watch as it goes, following its trajectory across the bay your boat is moored in
>At one end of the bay, in the direction of the creature’s departure, sits the half-flooded ruins of an old fort
>you grimace, and turn back to your men
>”Boss, what is it?” one asks
>”It’s the Shreen! Isn't it boss-”
>”Shut it, the lot of you!” you yell, and point your harpoon towards the ruins
>”Take us over there. Whatever it is, I'll kill it.”
>You stand in the doorway of the ruined fort
>You've no idea who built this place, and you don't really care
>history, like jewelry and reading, was something for women and southerners
>your men, simpering cowards that they were, had dropped you off at the coast
>you had loudly proclaimed that none of them were worthy of accompanying you
>you’d let them simmer in their shame until you came back with the beast’s head
>you proceed inwards, passing under the rough stone arch and into the gloomy murk of the dilapidated structure
>the water here was ankle deep, and still as glass
>your footsteps are the only disturbance
>here and there, though, you can see deeper pools, leading into hollows and flooded chambers now claimed by the sea
>you make your way deeper, your harpoon clutched in your brawny fists
>It’s several minutes before you hear a sound
>a drip
>tensed, you turn, and see an icicle shaking, barely held to the crumbling ceiling, another head of water welling at its tip
>you shake your head and turn back to continue deeper
>the beast states back at you
>eyes like reflective gemstones staring at you from the dark
>for a moment it is motionless, before it gently move forwards, out of the shadowy pool and into a beam of aurora-light shining from a crack in the wall
>the seal, now revealed, its slick fur spotted like an ice-leopard, stares at you from the pool it occupies
>its predatory snout splits, lips pulling back from gums, revealing a horrifying array of monstrous flesh-tearing teeth
>this would be bad enough, the sight of this monstrous predator, but you had a heart of ice
>you were strong
>or so you thought
>the beast begins to laugh, its voice an uncanny imitation of a human being
>the shock of it makes you take a step back, makes you blink in shock
>you grit your teeth and steel yourself
>”Face me, monster! I am-”
>”Meat,” the monster says, amused. “You are meat.”
>once more panic fills your bones but you force yourself into action, lunging forward with your harpoon to spear the creature’s neck
>it vanishes, plunging into the pool and through a flooded doorway underwater
>you hear the laughter echoing through the ruins
>you suddenly realise that coming in here alone may have been a mistake
>you begin to move, making your way back towards the exit as the Shreen, and it could only be a Shreen, stalked you through the ruins, emerging from pools only to dart away at the last moment and back into the sunken chambers
>several times the demon-seal lunged at you from pools of water, its jaws snapping shut on empty air
>panicking yet still brave enough to fight you jab at it, only for your harpoon to miss every thrust
>as you round another corner you spot the exit, the way back to your ship and crew
>you begin to run
>only for the monster to leap from a pool ahead of you
>the sheer scale of the trouble you are in reveals itself
>the Shreen is no leopard seal
>it wears the guise of one, its head and fur the duplicate of its natural cousins
>but it's body is that of a woman, swollen to unnatural size
>she stands before you, huge clawed arms spread wide, her body even more muscular than your own, her gleaming eyes alive with cruel amusement
>”Running away, are we, meat? I'm not done with you yet.”
>the monster runs her tongue across her lips and chuckles
>you snarl
>”Begone, demon! Or I will slay you!”
>you sound a lot braver than you feel
>the Shreen, backlit by the aurora spilling in through the entryway, tilts her head
>”Slay me, will you? Like you slew my kin, who came to beg for scraps from your boat?”
>you blink, uncomprehending
>you’d killed seals before, yes, but nothing like this monster
>”What? They were only animals-”
>”They were innocent! You killed them for sport!”
>the creature licks her lips again
>”So now I'll make sport of you, MEAT!”
>She moves, her towering body moving distressingly quickly
>you have to fight!
>despite the chilling fear in your bones you lunge out with your harpoon, only for the Shreen to dodge aside
>The manoeuvre gives you a moment’s space to roll under her attack, a clawed hand tearing the air inches from your face
>you’re past her, but to run for the exit now would see her run you down before you got anywhere near
>so you back away, keeping your harpoon pointed at her heart
>she looks at the weapon and her horrible grin resurfaces
>”Are you going to stick me with that, mighty hunter? Oh, how terrifying”
>she comes straight for you
>you strike, thrusting with all your strength
>the Shreen moves aside again, but not fast enough
>elation fills you as the harpoon buries itself in the meat of the seal’s shoulder
>she grunts in pain
>and grabs the haft of your weapon
>you try to pry it away, but with no luck
>panicking, you yank, pull and-
>a massive, monstrous fist catches you in the gut
>you gasp, all the air driven from your lungs as you are flung backwards and into an ancient wall
>gulping for air, clutching your abdomen, you try and fail to rise as the Shreen advances on you, her hungry grin splitting her snout
>she reaches up and pulls the harpoon out of her shoulder with a grunt of effort
>bright red blood stains her spotted fur
>she licks it from the tip of your weapon
>”A strong strike, little meat, but not strong enough,”
>she takes ahold of the harpoon and snaps the haft in two, before throwing it into a nearby pool
>that dealt with, she saunters over to you and grabs you by a fistful of hair
>she starts to drag you, making you gasp in pain and struggle as the huge monster takes you deeper into the ruins
>”Release me, you vile creature! I have hunted fiercer things than you!”
>that gets a genuine laugh out of the massive seal-woman
>”Oh? A hunter are you?”
>she throws you ahead of her, sending you rolling through the shallow puddles of icy water
>she spreads her arms out wide
>”Then I will show you what it means to be prey, little meat!”
>she begins to chase you again
>you run, sprinting through the dark
>only this time, you realise you’re running deeper into the ruins
>the air grows more chill and dank with every step
>you hear the BOOM of the seal diving into the flooded underground
>the noise of the water echoing through the whole structure
>and you keep running deeper
>this is bad
>you try to double back, to head towards the exit again, but each time she lunges out of the shadows, her jaws snapping at your heels
>she’s toying with you, tiring you out
>driving you deeper into this place where she can play with you at her leisure
>you can’t keep going like this, you have to make a stand now, before cold and exhaustion rob you of your only chance of fighting back
>you skid to a halt in a dripping, gloomy antechamber
>you force yourself to calm down, to still your breathing
>you stalk silently over to a dark corner with a good vantage of the way in
>and pick up a fist sized lump of ancient stone from the floor
>and wait
>you sit there, still as the grave, a hunter awaiting the sign of his prey
>you can hear her moving about on this level
>plunging into the water, then emerging elsewhere
>occasionally a growl or cackle echoes through the halls
>or a taunting call
>”Where are you, meat? Are you hiding from me?”
>she’s close
>you remain absolutely still
>she enters the chamber
>she moves silently, stalking forwards
>she doesn’t see you until you strike
>you lunge at her, swinging the rock at her skull
>the impact is savage, whipping her head to the side
>she roars in pain, stumbling, and you lift the stone again
>one more hit and-
>she grabs you, her clawed hands wrapped around your waist
>you swing, but she dodges your attack
>lifts you up
>and slams you into the ground
>you nearly black out from the pain, the rock falling from your hand
>he shock of the impact and the sudden chill of the icy water filling your bones
>you gasp for air, try and wriggle out of her iron grip
>but she has you
>her snarling face sneers at you from above
>she winces slightly, a little blood running from the side of her head
>”You know, meat, maybe you aren’t quite as useless after all”
>she licks her lips, running her tongue across the terrifying array of teeth that make up her smile
>”Maybe I’ll keep you”
>you are still shivering, the icy water stealing your body’s warmth
>she tears off your furs, appraising your body with her hungry eyes
>god knows what she wants with
>she hold you down with one hand and flicks your genitals with the other
>you quail
>surely not
>surely this creature won’t-
>your thoughts are interrupted by the sensation of the Shreen’s warm, fat tongue running up your abdomen
>you gasp, both at the sick sensation and the worryingly pleasant warmth of her touch
>you’re so cold
>the heat of her wet tongue felt so good on your skin
>you shiver
>her tongue goes lower
>you moan as she bathes your genitals in spittle, her tongue coating both your cock and balls with a single forceful lick
>your body is responding with enthusiasm
>you want to be warm
>you don’t want to be eaten
>you’ll do anything she wants
>you try and focus, to fight
>but there’s no use
>you don’t resist as she drags you up onto a dry slab, poking out of the water
>or when she presses her muscular body against yours
>she laughs mockingly as you cling to her, instinctively seeking the warmth of her furry form
>”oh, given up, have we? Where’s the mighty hunter now?”
>you turn your head away in shame, but she grabs you by the jaw
>”What are you?”
>”I’m meat,” you whimper, the words ash in your mouth
>”Yes, good meat, you’re going to be my little pet now, you know that?”
>you nod
>she snorts with amusement, nostrils flaring in her blunt snout
>then she rapes you
>her body pinning you to the slab
>her claws drawing blood as she grips you with savage strength
>you cry out as she takes your cock inside her
>she’s so warm, the powerful muscles of her cunt sucking you in
>it almost hurts
>you lay there, humiliated and broken, as she humps you, riding you for the sake of her pleasure alone
>you wince at every meaty impact, your hips and back bruising under her onslaught
>she runs her tongue across your face, forcing it into your mouth
>you can’t fight her off
>you submit, unmanned and humbled by a monster that hunts men
>her teeth scrape across your skin, drawing cries of pain
>she laps at the wounds, savouring the taste of your flesh
>you feel her accelerating, growing agitated
>her cunt feels even tighter, nearly pulling you off the floor on every upstroke
>the sloppy meat sounds of her assault on your hips growing faster and faster
>then she clenches, her whole body pulling you into a crushing embrace
>she roars in pleasure, in triumph, as she cums, her cunt disgorging a flood of slick, warm fluid all over your groin
>after a few moments of her panting on your face, tongue hanging loose as she shudders in delight, she stands
>the sensation of your cock finally slipping free from her pussy’s deathgrip with a *pop* sends you over the edge
>you cum, spurting all over yourself, whimpering in shame
>the Shreen laughs
>”heh, you’re pathetic, meat. It’s cute. Come on, I’m hungry, maybe I’ll let you beg for scraps from my next hunt”
>and you were never seen again
>another victim of the Shreen to populate the tall tales of spooked fishermen

>Skaven are notorious for being scheming little shitstains, every single one having their own agenda and view that they are the only competent rat around while everyone else is holding them down.
>Ogres are similarly cunning when it comes to extorting food, money (for food), or any other business (usually for food), though are definitely on the duller end of the intelligence spectrum.
>Combining the two creates a beast that has none of the benefits of either and all of the downsides, at least mentally, practically making rat ogres near if not completely non-sapient; it's even debated that they hardly qualify as sentient at all, requiring the guidance of another skaven to even function properly.
>Of course, not every rat ogre is the same, especially when a skaven mutator wants to enact their own secret plans and create a strain of beasts that could potentially outclass every other rat ogre.
>This one, for example, seems to have an unintended, more muted bloodlust and hints of buried sapience under her rearing years of "murder-kill-kill"-ing anything and everything (that which lead to her "creator" being murder-kill-killed by her in classic skaven hubris, something he realized as he was choking on his own blood that he neglected to instruct that HE wasn't a part of everything and everyone), including a fascination with man-things that doesn't immediately end in leaving them a red-stained splatter on the ground.
>Or, at least, one particular man, who isn't sure what in the everloving name of Sigmar to do with the impossibly passive monster that he was convinced didn't even exist just a week ago

>Human soldier/commander is the one to land the final blow on some weird, fancily ornamented leader rat in the middle of a heated battle while his two massive guards are distracted with the rest of his squad
>Left barely standing in the end, completely exhausted with his squad nowhere in sight (probably dead), and the sound of both rat giants approaching. He expects to die but at least he'll have gone out having dealt a successful blow to the scourges moral
>Next thing he knows instead of being pulped by a pair of raging rodent monsters they both apparently decided with their master dead then his killer might as well make the best choice for their next charge
>Now he has a pair of towering, heavily armored rat woman (and wouldn't that have been a surprise the first night after they shucked nude and manhandled him into a sleep-rest pile) following him everywhere
>And they're extremely possessive of their new 'cute man-thing lord' (and incredibly horny too)

>stay at home husband for a large tigress

>Makes you cum into the icing, mixing it with all the powdered sugar and milk
>pours it over the cinnamon rolls before you can argue and then serves it up to her friends while she leaves you panting and partially collapsed on the kitchen counter.
